	  A new 9/11 sculpture made from steel from the World Trade Center was unveiled at the Ground Zero Museum Workshop in Chelsea on Thursday, Sept. 7, 2017.       Photo Credit: Getty Images / Drew Angerer     "
73,A new sculpture made from the wreckage of the Twin Towers was unveiled at the Ground Zero Museum Workshop in Chelsea Thursday afternoon.
74,"Created by New York City-based artist Marie-Hélène, the artwork, titled ""Metamorphosis,"" incorporates original steel and window glass from the World Trade Center, and features hydrographic transfer of image – a technique that allows the artist to apply a printed design to a three-dimensional object."
75,Museum curator Gary Marlon Suson said 33 percent of the proceeds from the unveiling event will be donated to the FDNY Widows and Children’s Fund. Suson served as the Uniformed Firefighters Association’s official photographer at Ground Zero for seven months after the 9/11 terror attacks.
76,"“It’s surprising to realize that it has been 16 years since the 9/11 catastrophe. And more and more people I meet forget what really happened surrounding America’s worst terrorist attack in U.S. history,” said Suson, who is also an honorary FDNY battalion chief. “As challenging as it is to keep the museum’s doors open, it’s minuscule compared to the challenges faced by the victims’ families on a daily basis. My goal is to keep the memory alive through images and artwork so that our world doesn’t forget.”"
77,"The unveiling also featured the debut of a companion documentary about the making of the sculpture, called “Remembrance.” The film was directed by Nicolas Lopez and produced by Annie Flocco, both award-winning filmmakers."
78,"The artwork’s unveiling also fell on the 12th anniversary of the museum’s opening on Sept. 7, 2005. The museum specifically highlights Ground Zero’s “recovery period,” helping visitors to understand what it was like for firefighters and rescue workers who were on the front lines through the use of images, artifacts and more."
79,The Ground Zero Museum Workshop will also be donating 33 percent of its ticket sales to the to the FDNY Widows and Children’s Fund on Sept. 11. The price of entry is $25 and it includes an interactive tour of the museum.

118,Two subway stations in Astoria reopened Friday following eight months of aesthetic renovations under the MTA’s controversial Enhanced Station Initiative.
119,"The rehabilitation efforts at the 30th Avenue and 36th Avenue stations, which are both above ground and serve the N and W lines, included improvements to entrances, mezzanines, platforms, as well as structural repairs, according to the MTA."
120,"Improved signage on both ground and platform levels, refurbished staircases, glass service gates, LED lighting and wood-paneled benches were added to each station, as well as wire mesh platform windscreens."
121,advertisement
122,"The ground level of the 36th Avenue station also boasts several floor-to-ceiling laminated glass artworks by Maureen McQuillan, known as “Crystal Blue Persuasion.” Artist Stephen Westfall was commissioned to create the laminated glass artworks, known as “Perasma I and II; Dappleganger,” at the 30th Avenue station."
123,"Astoria resident Rocelli DeGuzman, 49, was taking photos of the 36th Avenue station shortly after 11:30 a.m., about a half-hour after it had opened to commuters."
124,"“It’s amazing; totally different from how it was,” DeGuzman said. “This is one nice upgrade.”"
125,"The improvements are similar to work that was completed at the Bay Ridge Avenue and 53rd Street stations in Brooklyn, which were the first to reopen after Enhanced Station Initiative redesigns."
126,"Noticeably absent from the renovations, however, are elevators – a sticking point with commuters and disabilities advocates since the stations are not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act."
127,"“I like the design. I wish they had an elevator for handicapped people,” Andrew Soulios, 32, said while standing on a renovated 30th Avenue platform. “They did this big renovation but no elevator for disabled people. I’m happy otherwise.”"
128,"Max Lam, who lives a few blocks away from the 30th Avenue station, said he’s disappointed that it wasn’t made accessible."

130,"“One thing I do understand is that these stations haven’t been touched for a 100 years. I’m appreciative that the MTA is focusing on the Astoria line,” he said. “But I hope that in the future that they do create a project to make these stations more accessible.”"
131,"The NYCT Subway Twitter account responded to similar complaints on the social media platform, promising that expanding accessibility is “an integral part” of the MTA’s plan to improve subway stations. The agency is working to make 50 subway stations ADA compliant within five years."
132,Some commuters also grumbled over the lack of service improvements in the project.
133,"“The transit quality needs to improve. This is really lovely but what matters more to us is to get to wherever they need to get to,” said East Harlem resident Laura High, 30, who has a weekly appointment near the 36th Avenue station."
134,"Adam Andrianopoulos, also of East Harlem and traveling with High, said now that the stations have been improved structurally, it’s time for the MTA to focus on service."
135,"“They need to upgrade the signal system all through New York,” he added."
136,"Despite concerns over service, both welcomed the aesthetic and structural improvements. The glass barriers running along the length of the station, with wire mesh replacing it on the edges, was a favorite of High’s."

141,Time needed to vet sex assault allegation against Supreme Court nominee.
142,"
	  Judge Brett Kavanaugh appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing.       Photo Credit: Getty Images / Mark Wilson     "
143,Confirming a Supreme Court nominee is an intensely political process. That’s certainly been the case with Brett Kavanaugh.
144,But the emergence of a woman willing to testify about her allegations of sexual misconduct against Kavanaugh when both were teens is a cry to put politics aside. California college professor Christine Blasey Ford deserves to be heard. So does Kavanaugh.
145,"The Senate Judiciary Committee made the correct decision to hold a hearing Monday for both Ford and Kavanaugh to testify in public and under oath; vetting Ford via private phone calls, committee chairman Chuck Grassley’s preference, was never going to be sufficient. And if senators genuinely want the truth, as they claim, they should let outside counsel ask the questions. Political grandstanding to score points in front of TV cameras would only be a distraction."
146,"The extra time also should be used to let the FBI thoroughly vet Ford’s claim. There are gaps and inconsistencies in her accounts. Agents should seek whatever details are available — corroborating evidence, contemporaneous or witness accounts — to try to stop this from devolving into a he-said, she-said battle. We wish Ford’s allegations could have been handled in a more timely fashion, but the most disturbing part of this is the allegations themselves. They can’t be dismissed by saying that sensibilities were different in the 1980s, or that Kavanaugh was only 17 at the time."
147,"And if more time is needed for investigation, the committee should take it. There’s no need to rush. It doesn’t matter whether Kavanaugh is seated when the court’s term begins Oct. 1, or a little later. The court has dealt with having eight justices before — very recently. Republicans certainly weren’t worried about that when they let Merrick Garland’s nomination languish for more than 10 months until Barack Obama was out of office and President Donald Trump nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the late Antonin Scalia’s seat. It’s hypocritical to talk about delays now."
148,The standard for Kavanaugh is not whether this is a prosecutable case. The test is one of character and credibility. He cannot be voted out of office in two years if found lacking. This is a lifetime appointment. His tenure will have huge impacts on our lives. Getting it right at the start is essential. His credibility during confirmation hearings already has been questioned on matters such as his involvement in the Bush administration’s legal justifications for torture and how much he knew about a computer hack of records belonging to Senate Judiciary Democrats.
149,"Kavanaugh, stunningly, now finds himself being vetted by the American people in the era of #MeToo. There can be no repeat of the debacle with Anita Hill, another professor who came forward in 1991 with allegations of past sexual harassment by then-nominee Clarence Thomas only to be attacked and treated with disrespect by some Judiciary Committee members."
150,"Ford and Kavanaugh will be heard. Basic fairness demands they be treated with respect and that the facts be uncovered. Only then can the Senate, and the American people, decide whether Brett Kavanaugh is worthy of a seat on the Supreme Court."

	  The Row hotel in midtown is one of an increasing number of hotels that broadcast music to passersby and pedestrians by via what appear to be speakers embedded into the undersides of  their structural awnings.       Photo Credit: Sheila Anne Feeney     "
155,Businesses have now declared open season on your ears -- even though the practice of pumping music and advertising into public airspace is apparently illegal.
156,"At least three renovated midtown hotels -- The Row, The Novotel and the Midtown North Hampton Inn -- sport new speaker-laced awnings bleeding music into the street below, and an increasing number of stores and bars in midtown sport external speakers to blare music and acoustic attention grabbers into the ears of passersby."
157,"Externally mounted flat screens adorn the edifices of theaters, sometimes with audio of performance outtakes or advertising. And in a growing trend, halal stands, sweet shops and souvenir outlets broadcast hip hop, rock and pop from boom boxes and externally mounted speakers."
158,"While no data exists yet on the commercial creep, ""we should jump in now and identify it,"" said environmental psychologist and CUNY professor emerita Arline Bronzaft. ""If tourism has increased -- and apparently it has -- and merchants believe music attracts tourists to their shops, we should be alerted that the music will increase and make our streets even louder,"" said Bronzaft."
159,"NYC Gifts owner Waleed Khan said he began broadcasting 92.3 NOW from speakers outside the store selling souvenirs late last year, after construction started nearby. His intention, he said, was to attract customers and pull people in from the east side of the street."
160,"Pop music announces that ""we're inviting and friendly,"" Khan said. ""People don't always speak English, but people all over the world understand music,"" and no one has ever complained, he said."
161,"The Novotel declined to comment on its public broadcasts, which an employee said was an Internet radio station. The Midtown North Hampton Inn and The Row did not respond to requests for comment lodged via corporate email."
162,"But a spokesman for the City's Department of Environmental Protection, which is in charge of enforcing the city's noise code, said that ""businesses may not broadcast music and/or promotional and commercial audio content, at any time, for advertising purposes."""
163,"New Yorkers kvetch plenty about clamor and commotion. 311 registered 6,694 complaints in 2013 from ""noise from a store or business,"" although it's unclear what percent of those complaints involved noise leaking out of a restaurant, nightclub or bar versus those that are deliberately broadcast from a business. Another 15,434 ""noise from street or sidewalk"" complaints were received last year, although the majority of those are thought to be associated with construction."
164,"The department issued 124 ""notice of violations"" for sound reproduction devices for sound or advertising purposes in 2013."
165,"While the decibel levels of the latest audio assault may not be high enough to trigger hearing loss, the stress of unwanted audio stimulation still takes a toll on the human body, most markedly in the form of diminished cardiovascular health, said Bronzaft."
166,"Adapting to unwanted sound ""is always an added stress,"" and this ""added intrusion makes the streets a little less comfortable,"" said Bronzaft, who would like to see more vigorous enforcement."
167,"Residents complain periodically to Community Board 4 about hotel noise and especially about ""Times Scare,"" the haunted house with ghoulish touts outside who are often armed with microphones, said Robert J. Benfatto Jr., district manager for Community Board 4. The Community Board asks the offending businesses to remedy the problem. ""It quiets down for a while; then it starts up again,"" he said."
168,"While the commercial appropriation of the air occurs in other U.S. cities, it is most pervasive in noisy NYC, said Eric Spangenberg, a marketing professor and dean of Washington State University's College of Business."
169,"The practice ""turns the entire city into an outdoor mall,"" said Spangenberg, who has studied the influence of music in retail environments. The creep of commerce into outdoor air often is associated with tourism, noted Spangenberg: People on vacation are more inclined to welcoming distractions than residents who are repeatedly subjected to sounds they don't select."
170,"Businesses do it to ""compete for people's senses and an emotional connection: They're creating a 360-degree experience that they hope people will encode,"" and associate with the brand, Spangenberg explained."
171,"Yet, ""I haven't seen any kind of research to show that this works,"" to lure customers or pump up profits, Spangenberg added. ""It's become a 'me too!' kind of deal and it's assaultive,"" he said. ""They're also driving certain customers away,"" and there are ""serious social implications,"" to businesses feeling entitled to claim the attention of pedestrians in an already demanding environment, he said."
172,"An informal poll of passersby found that various tourists described the music as ""fun"" or ""a good thing,"" whereas residents were less enthusiastic."
173,"Resident Kasey Callender, 33, noted she could hear the music broadcast by The Row Hotel ""over my headphones,"" which she found ""obnoxious."""
174,"Callender is a contract manager for a sound company, and wants it clear that ""I adore music!"" But ""you shouldn't have to sell that hard,"" to people who haven't chosen to listen to it, she said."

327,"Chef, schmef. Who understands steak better than the butcher?

To kick off the grilling season, we enlisted Lou Kreitzman, owner of the 21-year-old Prime Time Butcher on Long Island and third-generation scion of a meat-wholesaling family. Not only has Kreitzman been selling meat his whole adult life, he's been explaining to his customers how to cook it. We spent an afternoon with Kreitzman at his Great Neck home and took notes while he grilled five steaks and shared expert advice.

His tips:
Steak prep: Let the steaks come to room temperature before grilling -- which will take from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on thickness. For the home griller, 1 inch is the maximum thickness Kreitzman recommends.
Heat: Kreitzman preheats the grill for at least 15 minutes on high. Once the steaks go on the grill, he turns it down to medium. ""Unless the steaks are very thin -- like skirt steaks -- it's best to grill with the top down,"" he said.
Leave the steaks alone: Once you put them on the grill, don't move them around. ""When they're ready to be flipped, they will release from the grill."" Another indication the steaks are ready to flip: ""Moisture will begin to bead up on the exposed side.""
Doneness: After you flip a steak, the second side will need about half the time the first side needed. ""The best way to tell if a steak is done,"" Kreitzman said, ""is to use an instant-read thermometer."" An internal temperature of 120 to 125 degrees is rare, 125 to 130 is medium-rare, 140 is medium, 150 is medium-well, 160 is well. Steaks should always rest 5 to 10 minutes after cooking, during which time the temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees.
Marinade: It's not that Kreitzman doesn't like marinade. ""It's just that I really like the taste of meat,"" he said. Thick, flavorful, pricey cuts, such as porterhouse or rib eye he grills with no seasoning, but he's not averse to ""infusing"" other steaks with some extra-virgin olive oil and herbs. At the store, he sells hanger steaks in a marinade based on his own barbecue sauce.
Cleaning the grill: ""When you're done for the day,"" he said, ""cover the grate with heavy-duty foil, turn the heat to high. The grill will start to smoke, but in about 10 minutes, depending on how dirty your grill is, the smoke will clear. Open the grill and all the gunk will be reduced to ash.""

His favorite summer steaks:"
328,"Kreitzman explained that ""London broil"" is not a cut of steak. It refers to any large, boneless cut that you slice (always across the grain) to serve. Most markets' London broils are from the top round, a singularly tough and bland cut of meat. Kreitzman is a big fan of the flat-iron steak, cut from the chuck (shoulder), which has a great flavor and texture."
329,"The famous steakhouse steak is made up of two distinct cuts separated by a t-shaped bone: The larger cut, flavorful but somewhat fibrous, is variously referred to as strip steak, New York strip, Kansas City steak, club steak, shell steak, top loin steak. The smaller cut is the filet, incomparably tender but lacking in flavor. T-bone steaks (which, on the steer, are just adjacent to the porterhouses) have a smaller filet. ""If you're willing to spend the money to buy a good prime steak, you can't do better than a porterhouse,"" Kreitzman said. "
330,"This thin, fibrous steak has a strong beefy flavor that can stand up to marinades. At Prime Time Butcher, Kreitzman sells them marinated in his own barbecue sauce. (He also likes this Asian marinade: Combine 1 cup hoisin sauce, ¼ cup prepared barbecue sauce, 1 tablespoon minced garlic and 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger.) Skirt steaks are so thin, they are easy to overcook. Cook them with the grill cover open, and don't let them rest long before eating."
331,"The rib eye is simply a standing rib roast that's been cut into steaks. Kreitzman prefers bone-in to boneless rib eyes. ""The bone adds flavor and makes the steak cook more evenly,"" he said. ""And, best of all, it's great to gnaw on."" Rib eyes have ""sweet, rich-tasting"" meat and ""even a choice steak will have good flavor."" If you want an impressive steak and don't have access to prime, go for the rib eye."
332,"Until recently, the hanger steak had few fans in this country. (The Japanese and French knew better.) ""My father could never sell them,"" Kreitzman recalled. ""He'd bring them home for us -- that's how they got the nickname 'butcher's tenderloin.' "" The hanger is just as beefy and sweet as the skirt steak but is a little more tender. For our barbecue, Kreitzman grilled a hanger steak that had been treated to a few hours in a mixture of extra-virgin olive oil and fresh herbs. If you like your steak well done, the hanger steak will retain a lot of its appeal."

480,Two food writers are giving the adage “a woman’s place is in the kitchen” a feminist twist.
481,"Co-authored by Life & Thyme's Stef Ferrari and Deepi Ahluwalia, “A Woman's Place: The Inventors, Rumrunners, Lawbreakers, Scientists, and Single Moms Who Changed the World with Food,"" out March 5, is an anthology on female culinary innovations, with profiles of women from various backgrounds and time periods."
482,"amNewYork spoke to Ferrari, who lives in Cobble Hill, about six whose stories connect to NYC."
483,"Pauline Morton Sabin (1887-1955), socialite involved in repealing Prohibition"
484,"“I think there’s this notion that, across the board, all women supported and advocated for Prohibition. But Pauline’s story is fascinating because she saw it as ineffective and ultimately argued that it caused greater problems by creating opportunities and motivation for criminal behavior. Pauline rallied more than a million women who shared that belief and worked toward Prohibition reform.”"
485,"Esther Eng (1914-1970), film director and restaurateur"
486,"“She was a daughter of Chinese immigrants in San Francisco. She took up filmmaking and moved to New York and recognized that a lot of the Chinese actors that she had been working with were struggling financially. She opened a restaurant almost as a platform to give them a place to work and hone their English, so that when they went to acting gigs they could communicate better. She wound up opening several restaurants in New York. Esther lived openly as a lesbian as well. She faced quite a lot of adversity in her day, and her legacy is one of inclusivity, empathy and, of course, food!”"

She showed people the scope of Southern cuisine beyond the stereotypical ‘soul food' — though you could hardly imagine saying her food was without soul! She was far ahead of her time in demonstrating that restaurant meals could focus on fresh and seasonal cooking. Her work helped make Café Nicholson legendary. It was a hangout for Tennessee Williams, Capote, Brando, Garbo, Dietrich — you name it. They all came for her food.”"
491,"Judith Jones (1924-2017), Alfred A. Knopf editor who oversaw cookbooks by the likes of Julia Child and Edna Lewis"
492,"“She was such a visionary when it came to identifying these powerful voices in food. She was such a champion, and as an editor, she helped find, support and propel these women to the culinary world’s stage. It’s because of Judith that we have some of the most important cookbooks of our time — not to mention a window into other worlds and cultures through their cuisine.”"
493,"Dorothy Cann Hamilton (1949-2016), founder of the International Culinary Center"
494,"“Dorothy was a woman who knew the one thing all great entrepreneurs must know: how to identify and fill a need. After she traveled to France, she recognized that American culinary schools couldn’t hold a candle to what she’d seen abroad. Because of her decision to come back and launch the French Culinary Institute in NYC (now the International Culinary Center), we have some of our most famous chefs — including New York icons like Christina Tosi and Bobby Flay.”"
495,"Ruth Reichl, 71, James Beard Award-winning food writer and NYC native"
496,"“Ruth showed up at a time when food books and magazines were almost exclusively about recipes. She showed the humanity behind food, and really helped create modern food journalism, by demonstrating through her work at Gourmet as well as her time at The New York Times, that there were real stories and lessons to be learned about people and culture from the food world.”"

540,"On a recent Friday morning, Seth Haberman pedaled from his Upper West Side home to Greenpoint to take advantage of New York’s best unkept secret in noshing."
541,"Outside of Acme Smoked Fish on Gem Street, he was arranging his $200 haul on his bike for the ride back to Manhattan: a pound and a half of sable, two pounds of David Burke pastrami smoked salmon, two pounds of lemon pepper smoked salmon, half a pound of Nova, a pound of hot smoked salmon, four pounds of cold smoked and hot smoked tuna, and two tubs of whitefish salad."
542,He wasn’t alone.
543,"“It’s like the answer to the question ‘What do hipsters, Hasidim and Koreans have in common?’ Fish Friday,” says Haberman, 58, before taking off toward the Williamsburg Bridge with his bags balanced on the back of his bike. "
544, A Friday tradition
545,"Fish Friday became a tradition in the early 1980s at the fourth-generation family-run fish factory, located on Gem Street near Meserole Avenue since 1954. "
546,"People would come in to the wholesale operation “at every hour of the night and day and ask to buy a whitefish,” according to Richard Schiff, vice president of Northeast sales for Acme. "
547,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
548,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
549,"“Workers would tell them, ‘Come back on Friday,’ and it became a thing where every Friday, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., we would offer herring, whitefish or sable,” Schiff says. “We now have seven to 12 people working behind the counter all day on Friday and a line out the door and down the street to get a taste of what Acme has to offer.”"
550,"In addition to the staples like cold smoked salmon, gravlax, sable, pastrami smoked salmon, kippered salmon, whitefish and packaged varieties of smoked fish, there are also Fish Friday specials which vary from week to week. "
551,"Customers come to the cash-only market for these offerings, as well as the substantial savings off the retail price of smoked fish."
552,"A man who gave his name only as Moishe has been coming to Fish Friday every week for 25 years from his home in Brighton Beach. He was snacking on smoked salmon trimmings ($4 a pound), which will become a salmon salad when he gets home, as he was placing his order."
553,"Lori Oppenheimer and her husband Peter, come from Great Neck, Long Island, for Fish Friday three or four times a year."
554,"“It’s a wonderful experience if you don’t mind the fish smell,” Lori says with a smile. “We came here for the selection of various kinds of smoked salmon and the taste experience. Whatever you buy you can ask for a taste.” "
555,The Oppenheimers come prepared. 
556,"“I have my list, and we change it from time to time,” Lori says. “Gravlax, Scottish salmon, today we got the sweet and spicy. We load up. Different kinds of packaged smoked fish for the coming weeks, the fresh smoked salmon that they slice. We get the salads, salmon salad, whitefish salad, today he wanted the herring salad.’”"
557,They left with two big plastic bags in hand. 
558, Changing with the times 
559,"Of course, Acme’s operation goes beyond its wholesale outlet. The 60,000-foot factory, along with other Acme plants in North Carolina and Florida, process an astronomical 11 million pounds of smoked fish a year, available at supermarkets across the country."
560,"It’s a long way from when the company was first founded in 1906 by Harry Brownstein, who worked as a “jobber,” delivering smoked fish purchased from local smokehouses by horse-drawn wagon to local appetizing shops."
561,"Despite being more than 100 years old, Acme keeps developing unique flavors, in addition to its traditional smoked fish, like its BBQ smoked salmon and maple hot smoked salmon (both of which this year won SOFI awards, for “specialty outstanding food innovation,” from the Specialty Food Association)."
562,"“Acme has grown with the tastes of the country and the tastes of the world by adding flavors to traditional smoked salmon that are sometimes unexpected, sometimes unique, sometimes chef-driven,” Schiff says. "
563,"No matter the flavor, it all starts with the whole fish. Inside the factory, workers wearing hair and beard nets, gloves, high rubber boots and white coats take giant, 30-pound Norwegian salmon and prepare them to be turned into kippered salmon. With surgical precision, they filet, debone and cut it up before it is smoked."
564,"The company makes lox (salt-cured salmon that isn’t smoked), but it accounts for “less than 1 percent of the 11 million pounds a year we produce,” Schiff says. "
565,"Smoked salmon, whether it comes from Norway, Scotland, Chile or Canada, is made by mildly curing salmon for a week, then cold smoking for around 18 hours before it’s sliced."
566,"The demand is greater than ever, Schiff says. "
567,"“We’re expanding into new markets in the country — exploding with growth,” he says. “Smoked salmon on a bagel is still up there with pizza as the best food in the world. And it’s so quintessentially New York.” "
568,Specials for the High Holidays
569,"For the upcoming Jewish High Holidays, people will queue up an hour before the 8 a.m. opening of the factory store. Specials for the holy days will include several experimental tastes cooked up by Fish Friday maven Gary Brownstein, a production manager who is in charge of the slicing department."
570,"For Sept. 7, before the start of Rosh Hashanah, Brownstein’s special will be a “Summer Harvest Poke,” which includes smoked salmon, New Jersey corn, tomatoes, avocados and mangoes ($22/pound). "
571,"Then on Sept. 14, a few days before the start of Yom Kippur, his special will be a Thai chili cold smoked salmon and a Thai chili hot smoked salmon ($22/pound)."

597,"Instead, homemade fettuccine pasta is tossed into a butter and cheese sauce and then twirled to order just before serving. More reminiscent of a certain elbow pasta dish with elastic strings of cheese in each bite, it's no wonder the recipe has been popularized with the American palate. "
598,"To add some glitz to the cheesy dish, Alfredo 100 serves a table's guest of honor, perhaps the prettiest person in the party, with a golden fork and spoon, inspired by gifts to Di Lelio by 1920s Hollywood stars Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. "

670,Think of it as a “healthy” Chipotle for Venezuelan arepas.
671,"A new fast-casual eatery offering customers the option of customizing their own stuffed corn cakes will open in midtown Manhattan this September. Areppas will “us[e] first rate ingredients and modernized preparation techniques to ensure that the cuisine is as nutritious as it is sumptuous,” according to a news release."
672,"Executive chef Gabiela Machado — a native Venezuelan who made a name for herself in Miami — is using all-organic ingredients and baking her pre-cooked white cornmeal patties in a convection oven, rather than frying them on a grill, general manager Ivo Diaz told amNewYork."
673,"Preparing the traditional Venezuelan breakfast, lunch and snack food that way makes them fluffier and less oily, said Diaz, a restaurant industry veteran who ran his own arepa restaurant for a few years in Queens."
674,"“Usually when you cook an arepa, you make it on the grill,” Diaz said. “When you do it in the oven, it’s like a piece of bread — it kind of inflates a little bit...The first time I used [the oven], it made magic.”"
675,"Areppas will serve the 4.5-inch-across corn discs in three colorful flavors in addition to the original white, or “blanca”: a blended beet-flavored “roja”; a carrot juice-infused yellow or “sol”; and a “verde,” flavored with cliantro, parsley and lime zest."
676,"Customers will have the option of either ordering one of six signature dishes with geographical names — the Morningside, for example, is a roja arepa sliced and stuffed like a hamburger bun with egg, ham, and Guyanese cheese; the Brooklyn is a verde arepa stuffed with avocado, radish and jalapeño — or customizing their own, Diaz explained. Signature dishes range in price from $7.75 to $8.75. An arepa of one’s choice, $5.25 and up, will come with any kind of protein from beef short ribs to chicken salad; toppings like avocado, ham and black beans; cheeses such as buffalo mozzarella or Mexican cotija; and one of three sauces."
677,"Sides ($5 to $7) will include carrot slaw, sweet plantains and tequeños, decidedly unhealthy Venezuelan cheese sticks. For dessert, there will be cheesecake; marquesa de chocolate, a cold Venezuelan chocolate cake; and coquito, a coconut eggnog-type beverage. And to drink, expect agua frescas ($4.50) in flavors like watermelon mint and apricot thyme."

682,"”We’re trying to improve something in our country, we’re trying to help out,” said Diaz, who was born in Venezuela and still has extended family in Maracaibo."
683,"And yes, Areppas is intentionally spelled with two ps, he confirmed: “For American people, it’s easier to pronounce arepas with two p’s. We did a little bit of research on that, so that mistake was done on purpose.”"

Taiyaki translates to “fried fish,” and the fish-shaped cakes — typically filled with red bean paste or custard — have long been popular in Japan, though are ripe for the Instagram age."
693,"At Taiyaki NYC, you can pick one of the shop’s creations or make your own taiyaki. Choose an ice cream (including vanilla, chocolate, black sesame and the on-trend matcha), filling (custard or red bean), drizzle (chocolate, caramel, condensed milk or strawberry) and two toppings, such as mini M&Ms, mocha or — for the most photogenic option — a wafer."
694,"You can opt for your ice cream in a cup, but, then, why are you even going?"
695,"Taiyaki start at $7; 119 Baxter St., taiyakinyc.com."

704,Stirring batter is replacing swiping right for one Los Angeles woman.
705,"Audrey Shulman began blogging about her quest to meet men in via Cakebarring™ (yes, that's trademarked now)-- sitting in bars with homemade cake and passing out slices to eligible, worthy-looking guys -- in 2013."
706,"Since, she met a boyfriend who loves cake and has turned her recipes and dating stories into a book, ""Sitting in Bars with Cake: Lessons and Recipes from One Year of Trying to Bake My Way to a Boyfriend."""
707,We asked Shulman a few questions about her sweet and unique dating strategies.
708, 
709,Can you have your cake and a boyfriend too?  
710,"Absolutely! I found a boyfriend who loves cake, and doesn't seem to mind when friends come to town and we take cake to a bar."
711,Have your friends copied your method of meeting people through cake?
712,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
713,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
714,"I had some girlfriends try to meet guys by taking cupcakes to a bar, but they kind of struck out. It turned out cupcakes were too easily transportable; the guys just said thank you after picking them up and walked away. I can't explain it, but there's something about cutting a piece of cake for a guy that makes him stick around -- it's almost as if there's an implied conversation that should happen afterwards since you've just made an effort to give him something."
715, 
716,Do you think men can woo women with baked goods? 
717,"I had some guy friends try to meet girls by taking pie to a bar, but the girls were suspicious, especially when it was framed as, ""Would you like to eat this pie with us?"" not just, ""Would you like some pie?"" Unfortunately, I don't think the strategy works so well the other way around."
718, 
719,Does baking to attract the opposite sex feel outdated or anti-feminist to you?
720,"I can see how people think baking to attract the opposite sex feels outdated or anti-feminist, but for me, this was my way of being proactive about dating. I didn't want to wait around for the right guy to read my online dating profile. This was how my friends and I could explore new bars in Los Angeles-- really, new parts of the city-- and go up to guys we were interested in talking to."
721, 
722,Do you think this would work in NYC? People are skeptical of free food…
723,"I think this could totally work in New York, especially if you have some nice friends with you to imply you're not a psycho. (And especially if you don't cut into the cake before going to the bar, which was often my strategy to make the cake look more like casual leftovers.)"
724, 
725,Do certain types of cake attract certain types of people?
726,"Cake is this weird, universal magnet, regardless of what kind it is. Chocolate is always a winner, but I met guys who were into eating sweet potato cake, Greek yogurt cake, and definitely cakes I made with alcohol in them. Maybe craft beer cake would attract foodie hipsters, but I think people generally are just excited by something with frosting."
727, 
728,What made you want to put your recipes and dating stories in a book?  
729,"After chronicling all these adventures on a blog, the book was a way for me to get into more detailed portraits of the guys I met and invent new recipes. (The book contains 35 original recipes, all of them metaphors for the guys profiled-- the Sticky Maple Kiss Cake for The Guy Who Made Contact With My Mouth, the Seedy Cherry Cocktail Cake for The Guy Who Directed Adult Films, and so on.) I'd like to think this is the kind of book you'd buy for your best friend, whether she's single or not-- hopefully she'd laugh reading the stories, and make a cake either way."

739,Annika Schimmer knows firsthand how hard the holidays can be for people with restrictive diets.
740,"The Long Island City health coach and dance instructor has an autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis) and for over three years has eliminated a laundry list of foods from her diet to live symptom-free (including grains, gluten, legumes, dairy, nightshades and refined sugar)."
741,"In her new cookbook, “Enjoy!: Healthy Festive Meals for You and Your Loved Ones” ($29.95 at enjoycookbook.com), she shares more than 50 recipes plus tips for getting through special events without feeling deprived."
742,"“I love the holidays, and I’m a real foodie in general,” says Schimmer, 34, who graduated last year from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition, an online nutrition school based in New York. “It was really important always for me to recreate dishes that I love because I just didn’t want to give up delicious foods even though I had food restrictions.”"
743,"Schimmer knew there were others like herself who might seek out grain- and gluten-free bread or biscuits, dairy-free soups or paleo desserts. When working on the cookbook, she had in mind people who also have an autoimmune disease and follow the autoimmune protocol, or AIP. That naturally means a lot of recipes that are gluten-, dairy-, soy, egg- and nut-free, covering a swath of common food intolerances and allergies."
744,"“I meet a lot of people with food restrictions — I naturally attract them,” she says with a laugh. “I want to show them that there’s so much more out there, and you really don’t have to suffer and feel deprived.”"
745,"Day-to-day, a restrictive diet can be easy to follow. But the holidays pose challenges. Schimmer finds that people either stick to their diets and are “miserable watching everybody else eat your favorite childhood foods and meanwhile you have to nibble on a carrot,” or cave and eat it anyway “and have to suffer the consequences.”"
746,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
747,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
748,"For those who are new to a restrictive diet, Schimmer recommends advance planning. That might mean calling ahead of a friend’s potluck to see what kinds of mains and sides will be served to see what you can eat, and bringing a dish you can eat as well based on the menu “so at least you know you have something to eat.” If it’s unclear what will be served, “my best tip is to eat before you go,” she says. “The worst thing you can do is go somewhere and be hungry and then there’s only celery and carrots for you. That’s happened to me many times.” Of course, you can also host your own party so you’re in complete control of the menu, she adds."
749,"Even those who don’t have a restrictive diet due to an intolerance or illness might find use out of “Enjoy!,” Schimmer says."
750,"“It’s kind of a time where people tend to overeat and gain weight, not feel good, feel bloated,” she says. “And it really doesn’t have to be like that.”"
751,"One of Schimmer’s most popular recipes is for gingerbread squares. “When I bring it to a party, it’s the first dish to always go,” she says. Schimmer ran a version of the recipe on her blog, 50 Shades of Avocado, and includes an updated version that substitutes eggs in her cookbook."
752,1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
753,"2. Combine the liquid ingredients (coconut milk, banana, coconut oil, honey, eggs and vanilla) in a blender and mix until smooth."
754,3. In a separate medium size bowl combine all the remaining dry ingredients using a whisk.
755,4. Add the flour/spice mix into the liquid mix and blend until you have a smooth batter.
756,5. Pour into a small square cake or brownie pan and bake for 30 minutes in the middle of the oven.

767,"When Avocaderia co-founder Alessandro Biggi, 30, went on “Shark Tank” to pitch an investment in his all-avocado café, he had no reservations about using his Italian accent to charm the judges. "
768,"“My accent, I can’t remove it, so why not play with it? I might as well use it as a way to make myself more likable to the “sharks,” said the Tuscany-native, who secured $400,000 in exchange for a 20 percent share of his 10-month-old business on the Feb. 11 episode of the ABC reality TV show. "
769,"Avocaderia, which sells avocado-based toasts, smoothies, salads and guacamole out of a millennial-friendly stall at the Industry City food hall in Sunset Park, had already been poised for expansion. With money from what Biggi told the “Shark Tank” panel was a six-figure cookbook deal with Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, the former business consultant and his two partners are opening a second location in the Terminal Warehouse in Chelsea this April or May."
770,"But the team isn’t planning on ending their avocado domination there, pitchman Biggi explained. They aim to launch 20 locations in New York City and then branch out into Los Angeles, San Diego, Miami and Texas. Biggi, Alberto Gramigni and Francesco Brachetti also expect their fledgling company to do a whopping $4.3 million in business next year, said Biggi, who presented the “sharks” with tastes of Avocaderia’s best-sellers, like its Mediterranean avocado toast with olive tapenade, cherry and sun-dried tomatoes, feta and an Egyptian pistachio and spice blend."
771,"(Of his initial discovery of the wonders of avocado mash on bread, Biggi said, kissing his fingers, “Man, it was delizioso!”)"
772,"The investors snapped all the eats — and Biggi’s accent — right up, with QVC queen Lori Greiner especially enamored but ultimately backing out of an investment because she’s “not a huge avocado fan.” "
773,"Ultimately, it was real estate titan Barbara Corcoran and businessman Mark Cuban who decided to take a bite out of Biggi’s “ripe” proposal, each pitching in $200,000 for 10 percent. "
774,"Corcoran was certainly a target going onto the show, Biggi tells us, “because . . . real estate is so important in the restaurant business and especially here in New York, it’s so hard to find good real estate.”"
775,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
776,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
777,"And Cuban, he adds, “is a target for everybody, because . . . he’s a self-made entrepreneur and billionaire now. That’s definitely someone you want on your team.”"
778,What clinched the deal?
779,"In addition to his company’s eye-catching branding, Biggi credits the win to honesty. During his upbeat, energetic presentation, the entrepreneur admitted that one of the reasons he fell hard for the easily prepared avocado is that he’s “not the best chef out there, although I should be, because I’m Italian.”"
780,"“I think (the judges) also shared the vision that it’s a big opportunity in terms of spreading this culture about eating better and at the same time enjoying what you’re eating,” continues Biggi, who maintains that the avocado craze driving consumption up for the past decade isn’t going anywhere."
781,"“What’s we’re seeing right now is what we like to call a movement,” Biggi says. “We’ve been pioneering this movement. That’s why there are other avocado restaurants and bars opening around the world” — including a new competitor on the Lower East Side, Avocado Appetit — “which I think is amazing.” (Asked about Avocaderia’s Manhattan neighbor, the alligator pear evangelist says competition is normal, and his company, which he says made $75,000 last month and has been profitable since its second month, will continue to focus on keeping its food quality standards high.) "
782,"Avocaderia plans to use its new infusion of green to lock down a third location and build out its staff, Biggi says."
783,"Personally, he hasn’t yet tired of the fatty, green fruit: “I’m not able to eat more than one or two a day, because I think it’s part of a balanced diet, but for lunch, it’s basically every day.” "

791,"That includes the Greenwich Village restaurant’s most recent addition: an avocado baked egg. The dish is included on the all-day breakfast items, alongside smoothies and organic scrambled eggs."
792,"“We wanted more creative breakfast options,” said Jordan Feldman, who founded the restaurant with fellow native New Yorker Sam Eckstein. “A lot of places rely on oatmeal, toast, pancakes, waffles — that’s a lot of grains and sugar. We have scrambled eggs on the menu but we wanted something more interesting.”"
793,"The avocado baked egg, developed by chef Andrew Novak, features a soft-boiled egg baked in an avocado mash, topped with chopped tomatoes, seaweed flakes and za’atar and all served in an avocado peel."
794,"“The avocado has healthy fat, and the egg has a lot of protein — it keeps you full,” Feldman said. “And it’s in a convenient serving form — you can hold the avocado and just scoop it out.”"
795,"The seaweed flakes add some umami flavor, while the za’atar provides some spice."
796,"“The avocado and egg on its own has a really good texture and is really creamy, but it’s nice to add that spice flavor,” Feldman said."
797,"The seaweed flakes, also known as dulse flakes, are also rich in iodine, which can help maintain a healthy thyroid."

801,"Like its bone broth ice pops — a clever way for the spot to make the typically hot beverage appealing in the summertime — the avocado baked egg is Springbone “throwing things at people and seeing what sticks,” Feldman said."
802,"“At this point we’re experimenting,” Feldman said of the two-month-old restaurant. “What’s consistent is minimal grains, minimal sugar, organic vegetables and fruit. We like to keep it simple and mix it up in interesting ways.”"

834,"Zhang assumes the resourceful animal had scavenged the fruit when it dropped from a nearby street vendor, he told amNewYork."
835,"Avocado Squirrel joins a distinguished lineage of animals that have captured New Yorkers’ attention by way of thrift, gumption and voracity. The grandfather of them all is Pizza Rat, who, in dragging a slice down a flight of subway stairs, embodied the soul of city residents determined to have it all."

839,"“Clearly a millennial squirrel,” one Facebook friend commented, alluding to the avocado’s perceived popularity among 20- and 30-somethings."
840,"The fruit embraced by many lifestyle and fitness influencers as a “healthy fat” has cropped up on menus at trendy restaurants across Manhattan and Brooklyn in recent years, most commonly in the form of avocado toast. (Bucking the trend, Zhang himself does not particularly care for the dish: ""I've had a pretty good avocado toast from Blank Slate in midtown, but otherwise don't really eat [it] . . . I feel like an avocado's flavor and texture is subtle enough to just eat by itself."")"
841,"At least three cafés in the city, Avocaderia in Industry City and Chelsea and Avocado Appetit in Chinatown, have organized their daytime menus of toast, sandwiches, salads and smoothies around the pitted fruit."
842,Have they found their new mascot in Avocado Squirrel?
843,"“He’s the best possible fan, the cutest, I would say,” said Avocaderia co-founder Alessandro Biggi, 30, who first watched the video Friday. He’s considering sharing it on the restaurant’s social media accounts as the “best testimonial ever.”"
844,"With demonstrated interest in his product on the Upper West Side, Biggi isn’t opposed to the idea of expanding uptown."
845,"For its third location, after the opening of its second inside the Terminal Stores Building in May, Avocaderia is currently eyeing a more commercial neighborhood with a signature population of office workers, he said: “We’re looking more near NoMad . . . because we serve mostly breakfast and lunch.”"
846,"But the Upper West Side, which Biggi recently visited for the first time after immigrating from Italy a year and a half ago, is “super cool,” sporting a “very nice vibe and lifestyle in general,” he added. The area is poised to see a significant influx of new dining options this year, of which the dumpling counter Lucky Pickle Dumpling Co. is only the first. “It would be a very good place for what we do, maybe somewhere down the line.”"
847,"Avocado Appetit co-founder Lifu Liu, 24, had yet to view the Avocado Squirrel video when reached by phone Saturday. Although Liu declined to comment on its marketing potential after watching it, his laughter was a ringing endorsement: ""It's pretty funny,"" he said."

854,"Eating processed meats like hot dogs, sausages and bacon can cause colorectal cancer in humans, and red meat is also a likely cause of the disease, World Health Organization (WHO) experts said."
855,"The review by WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), released on Monday, said additionally that there was some link between the consumption of red meat and pancreatic cancer and prostate cancer."
856,"IARC classified processed meat as ""carcinogenic to humans"" on its group one list along with tobacco and asbestos, for which there is ""sufficient evidence"" of cancer links."
857,"Each 50-gram (1.8-ounce) portion of processed meat eaten daily increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18 percent, the agency estimated."
858,"A 50-gram portion would be the equivalent of eating one hot dog or two slices of bacon. Americans eat about 21.7 grams of processed pork per day, according to a 2011 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey."
859,"Red meat was classified as probably carcinogenic in IARC's group 2A list, joining glyphosate, the active ingredient in many weedkillers."
860,The IARC examined some 800 studies during a meeting of 22 health experts earlier this month.
861,"""For an individual, the risk of developing colorectal (bowel) cancer because of their consumption of processed meat remains small, but this risk increases with the amount of meat consumed,"" Dr Kurt Straif of the IARC said in a statement."

863,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
864,"The classification for red meat, defined as all types of mammalian meat including beef, lamb and pork, reflected ""limited evidence"" that it causes cancer. The IARC found links mainly with colorectal cancer - which is a cancer that starts either in the colon or rectum - but also observed associations with pancreatic and prostate cancer."
865,"Inconclusive evidence of a link between processed meat and stomach cancer was also observed, it said."
866,The news prompted animal rights activists People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to offer free vegan diet starter kits and outraged agriculture groups.
867,"The Canadian Meat Council, which represents meat packers such as Maple Leaf Foods and the Candian-based units of Cargill Ltd. and JBS SA, rejected the findings as simplistic, while trade group North American Meat Institute said the IARC report ""defies common sense."""
868,Some scientists and researchers said the news may not add much to long-standing health recommendations to limit consumption of such meat.
869,"The IARC does not compare the level of risk associated with different substances in a given category, so does not suggest eating meat is as dangerous as smoking."
870,"""Nobody is telling people not to eat meat,"" said David Wallinga, senior health officer for health and environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council. ""What they're saying is if you eat it, eat less of it and buy it from sources that have produced it better."""
871, 
872,MEAT-HEAVY DIETS
873,"Meat suppliers and processors argue that meat provides essential protein, vitamins and minerals."
874,"Shares of most meat companies were little changed on Monday. Tyson Foods Inc fell after a rating cut by JP Morgan to ""neutral,"" which focused on the company's shrinking market share in packaged meat."
875,"""I'm not expecting that [IARC] report to be a big issue going forward,"" said Brian Weddington, a vice president of Moody's Investors Service's corporate finance group. ""I think there's still going to be a lot of hot dogs sold tomorrow."""
876,"The medical community has long thought there could be a link between red or processed meat and colorectal cancer, said Tim Key, a professor at Oxford University."
877,"""Eating a bacon bap [sandwich] every once in a while isn't going to do much harm; having a healthy diet is all about moderation,"" Key said in a statement from charity Cancer Research UK."
878,"According to estimates cited by the IARC, 34,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide are attributable to diets high in processed meat. About 1 million cancer deaths per year are due to tobacco smoking, it said."

888,"You’ve probably heard the story by now: In 2008, Ben-Ishay decided to whip up teeny treats in her apartment kitchen in Murray Hill and pitch to caterers after being fired from her uninspired job as an assistant media planner."
889,"With the help of her older brother Brian Bushell and business partners (and friends), Matt Baer, Ben Zion and Danny Omari, a debut Baked By Melissa pickup window opened at Cafe Bari in SoHo on Nov. 27 of that same year. It served eight original flavors — tie-dye, red velvet, triple chocolate fudge, peanut butter and jelly, mint chocolate cookie, chocolate peanut butter cup, cookies and cream and cookie dough."
890,"Looking back 10 years and 300 cupcake flavors later, everything seemed to fall into place perfectly. But if you ask Ben-Ishay, 34, she’ll tell you creating her sweet empire was hardly a piece of (cup)cake."
891,"“I worked my ass off. Early on, I felt like a fraud and it’s not that I was, but it’s just that I was making business calls from the green couch in my living room in the apartment that I had two fake walls up in, you know?” she says. “I remember crying to my brother saying who the hell do I think I am, Melissa of Baked by Melissa? He’d tell me, you are. Of course, you are. That’s why it’s so important to surround yourself with people who support you, in this case, it was my brother.”"
892,"Ben-Ishay practically lived in the kitchen for the first two years of Baked By Melissa’s existence, baking thousands of cupcakes herself while her brother, the former CEO, took care of the storefront groundwork."

895,"“Without my co-founders and my brother and my unbelievable team of hardworking people who are a part of the company today, this never would have happened,” she says."
896,"In her 10th year as the founder and face of her namesake company, Ben-Ishay isn’t spending as much time in the kitchen — but if she could figure out a way to be behind the counter at all 14 of her locations, she probably would."
897,"“It’s all my passion,” she says about juggling being a mother of two, and wearing such as public relations rep, baker and marketing expert. “And, I’m still the one who creates every new flavor.”"
898,"But instead of cold-calling catering companies and delivering cupcakes in bulk via subway, Ben-Ishay now finds herself teaming up with her husband for product development."
899,"“I cannot believe how much has changed. When I look at pictures from the very beginning it doesn’t feel like yesterday. We’ve done so much and I’ve grown so much,"" she says. ""It feels like the most magical 10 years, actually.”"
900,"Looking ahead, Ben-Ishay says she’s focused on expanding the brand with potential new retail locations outside of New York City, though none have been officially announced. Currently, Baked By Melissa treats can be shipped anywhere in the country and delivered locally in Manhattan by ordering online at bakedbymelissa.com."

907,"Rohan Aggarwal, 28, has spent most of his life working in Indian restaurants.
When the Queens-born restaurateur was 6 years old, his father launched Baluchi’s, a now-defunct chain of eateries that served North Indian fare across the city. Aggarwal spent the majority of his childhood weekends handing out menus and washing the remains of sag paneer and lamb biryani off dirty plates at the original Spring Street location. After earning a college degree in hospitality management, he spent a year training employees at his father’s restaurants in India.
But it was American barbecue and comfort foods that Aggarwal wanted to serve when he set out to launch Queens Bully — a restaurant of his own — with long-time buddy Suraj Patel in the 2,000-square-foot space on Queens Boulevard that Baluchi's was vacating in 2015. The multicultural flavors of his diverse home borough would infuse the menu's meats, seafood and veggies.
“Barbecue was not my expertise,” noted the Institute of Culinary Education graduate, who brought on executive chef Arim Isabel to helm the in-house smoker at his gastropub officially opening for lunch and dinner on Thursday.
Is Queens Bully, named after the Boulevard, an enterprising son’s rebellion?
Contrary to what you might expect, it’s a retired father’s American Dream.
“My father always wanted to open a barbecue restaurant,” said the son, who believes his dad, Rakesh Aggarwal, tried his first smoked meats after immigrating to the U.S. “He had a love for barbecue. He ended up purchasing an industrial smoker, but he never ended up using it.”
Now that Ole Hickory smoker is cooking Bayside Brisket and baby back ribs for hours at a time at the Queens Bully in Forest Hills, Aggarwal said.
And it has company: a tandoor, the cylindrical clay oven used to bake Indian meats and bread.
“To be honest, I don’t think there’s any restaurant in New York that has a classic American barbecue smoker and a tandoor in the same kitchen,” Aggarwal said.
The unique composite of kitchen appliances makes a dish like naan pizza — fresh, fluffy flatbread topped with smoked meats — possible.
“We didn’t really want to create a Indian concept, but wanted those flavors present,” said the gastropub co-founder, whose 100-seat establishment draws on inspiration from other ethnic cuisines, too.
“We tried to really collaborate on the menu and create something that would embrace the diversity of Queens,” he explained.
The Corona corn elote — served with cotija cheese, paprika, grilled lime and crème fraîche — is the restaurant’s take on the street corn sold by Mexican street vendors along Roosevelt Avenue, the Astoria lamb burger with feta and mint aioli a nod to the neighborhood’s Greek food, and the Korean fried sticky wings a tribute to the fast food joints lining Northern Boulevard in Flushing.
As for the drinks menu by Mark Seaman, that’s designed to complement the restaurant’s butcher block offerings, with an emphasis on dark liquors like bourbon, rye and whiskey. Diners can order a whiskey flight that pairs cocktails with the day’s smoked meats. There’s also local New York craft beer in bottles and cans and on tap.
Queens Bully isn’t just sourcing its brews locally; it’s purchasing vegetables from the Forest Hills Greenmarket and setting up a hydroponic herb garden in its basement. (The man behind that project is the bartender Jason Sandman, a sustainability engineer with a passion for horticulture and composting.) Aggarwal hopes to open a rooftop garden to grow the eatery’s own produce by next spring.
""Hydroponic"" may not be in Aggarwal Sr.'s vocabulary — ""he'd definitely have no idea what that means"" — but his son says sustainability aligns with his world view as a lover of nature and collector of vintage items.

938,Kid-friendly snack foods are not a new concept at restaurants around the city.
939,"These days you can satisfy your Doritos cravings at Taco Bell and get your Fritos fix at Cowgirl (whose Frito pie is served in the snack bag). For dessert, you can even go to A Salt and Battery for a deep-fried Mars Bar."
940,"But Einat Admony is doing something different at her newly opened Bar Bolonat (611 Hudson St, 212-390-1545, barbolonatny.com). The chef -- you may know her as the chef and owner of Balaboosta and Taïm -- is incorporating the classic Israeli snack Bamba into one of her offerings. (Bamba, for those of you who don't know, is basically a puffy peanut butter-flavored Cheeto.)"
941,"What separates the Everyday Cauliflower dish from orange-tinged tacos and sticky fried candy bars is that Admony has managed to maintain refinement amidst the nostalgia: the Bamba is so attractive and finessed, you might even mistake it for some cool, molecular gastronomical invention."
942,"""Every Israeli grew up eating Bamba,"" says the chef (though even us foreigners can appreciate the appeal). In the dish, the Bamba are sliced up in little coins and layered over the top of fried cauliflower; the peanut-y crunch brings out the savory flavors of the tahini lining the bottom."
943,"And this is just a sample of the vibrant menu at Bar Bolonat. You won't find an Oreo in the tagine or Dipsy Doodles in the curry, but everything is flavorful and delicious, especially the Jerusalem bagel, served with rich, fruity olive oil and earthy za'atar."
944,"To keep things spirited, pair everything with a Shiksa -- comprised of Stoli vodka, Lillet, rhubarb and preserved lemon syrup -- or a Goldstar, which, like Bamba, is native to Israel."

954,It was a sad day when Peels shuttered in January. Who would have thought that such a bustling palace of fried chicken and biscuits would ever close its doors? It was always packed to the brim with a line out the door and once inside was comforting and reliable. Sigh. Such is the New York real estate market.
955,"But before the space on Second Street and Bowery could become another dry cleaning den, Andrew Carmellini came along, giving that corner a delicious new prospect -- Bar Primi (325 Bowery, 212-220-9100, barprimi.com). And,  just like its predecessor, the restaurant is bustling."
956,"Together with chef-partner Sal Lamboglia, Carmellini has created a menu full of pasta, promising ""non-GMO semolina and specialty '00' flours, organic eggs and family recipes."" This means classic spaghetti and clams paired alongside a chewy rigatoni with Jersey corn, maitake mushrooms and scalogno. Ragu alla bologenese smothers strozzapreti, while squid ink campanelle is jet black and topped with a garlic crema."
957,"If you hunger for something other than pasta, there is a daily special ranging from porchetta and hangar steak to the trademarked Sausage Boss (because what is a restaurant these days without something trademarked?)."
958,"Enjoy your meal at the bar downstairs or at the lively communal table. Upstairs, groups can circle around squishy maroon banquettes and couples can tuck into private two-tops overlooking the street. The same beautiful light fixtures hang from the Peels era, but now you'll also find newer accents like the rustic wine racks full of Italian varietals."
959,"As I sat at my table, I couldn't believe I was shoveling mountains of pasta into my mouth in the same space where I used to glug Peels Punch. But it felt good and homey; a delicious change."

969,"If you’re looking for your personal “Cheers,” John Tebeau has a few recommendations.
In his new book “Bars, Taverns, and Dives New Yorkers Love” ($29.95, Rizzoli New York), out this week, the author and artist spotlights bars that are, in a word, beloved — with tips and tidbits accompanying his illustrations of his picks. 
The book is born out of an art project that started five years ago, when the Brooklyn Heights resident started drawing his favorite watering holes, including the Red Hook spot Fort Defiance, where you can now find him three days a week behind the bar, too.
His initial list of six Brooklyn bars has grown to 50 across the five boroughs and include brewpubs, cocktail dens and neighborhood joints.
amNewYork spoke with Tebeau, 54, about his book, and on some of his favorites, below.

How did you start making your list of bars?
I could have made a list easily of 20 or 25 that I just knew were good pretty objectively. But I needed to come up with a bunch more. So I asked my friends by email and Facebook, then I would get in touch with friends of friends that lived in different neighborhoods and they would suggest places. The research was so much fun. It renewed our New York experience and helped my wife and I get to know New York better and love it more.

Was there a bar that you were introduced to that is one of your favorites now?
There were many that I kind of fell in love with that I didn’t know at all. Some of the ones I loved the most are Adobe Blues in Staten Island, and Lee’s Tavern in Staten Island as well. They’re fantastic places. In Queens, there’s a place called Neir’s Tavern, which is one of the oldest bars in New York. It’s a wonderful, local tavern. Harry’s Café in the Financial District I just love. It’s a real kind of urbane, quiet place. And the Bronx Beer Hall up in the Bronx in the Arthur Avenue Retail Market. It’s a little bar in the middle of this indoor market, where you can hang out and watch the game and have a beer and walk over to the deli in the market, or the sandwich guy or pizza place, and bring it back and have it with your beer.

How did you narrow down the list? Were there certain rules or requirements?
There were unspoken rules. I’d go with my gut — does this place feel good? Did it have a good atmosphere? I know that’s amorphous, but did it exude cheerfulness, from the bartender to the décor of the place? And very specifically, did it smell good? Some bars don’t. So a friendly bartender, a place that smells neutral or better, music — I love a bar with a good jukebox. There’s also the sound of conversation, and I really love talking bars. Which comes back to, is it a good atmosphere, is it a socially vibrant place, is it a vital place, is it a cheerful place?

How would you describe your approach to drawing and capturing a place?
My approach comes from a cartoonist’s point of view. I was always a cartoonist more than anything, so the bars are drawn almost like caricatures sometimes. They’re a little exaggerated or distorted.

What kinds of details would lend themselves to being exaggerated?
It would probably be in some cases the feel of the building and the perspective you get when you stand in front of it, especially if it’s a corner bar — you would get that verticality. If the detail was important, I would go deep into the detail. I would play up the ornateness, the architectural flourishes. 

Is there a place like that in your book?
Easily one of my top favorites was the Brooklyn Inn (pictured above). It’s a gorgeous corner bar. That one just looks beautiful.
 
Who was the audience that you had in mind? 
I would say anybody in New York, or that likes to visit New York, that loves to explore cities. It’s a guide of places for people that love places. ... There’s a writer named Ray Oldenburg, who was an inspiration to me, he wrote a book called “The Great Good Place.” He coined the term “the third place,” and it was where you go between work and home. It’s important to people to have these third places. There are so many good ones in New York. We live amongst an embarrassment of riches of great good places.

997,"Philadelphia-based restaurateur Stephen Starr, whose Mexican eatery El Vez opened late last month on Vesey Street, currently the neighborhood's main dining corridor, expects he'll be catering to a local crowd of families and business people to start."
998,"""But as more restaurants come to the area, I think that Battery Park City will become a destination,"" said Starr. ""It's easy to get to, it's easy to navigate and not as tumultuous as midtown or the Meatpacking District."""
999,"And new restaurants are arriving in droves. Later this month, Hudson Eats, a ""fast-casual"" dining terrace at the $250 million-revamped Brookfield Place complex, is opening to the public. It's bringing 14 eateries, including Blue Ribbon Sushi, Umami Burger and Num Pang Sandwich Shop, to what is sure to be a hungry -- and plentiful -- weekday lunch crowd."
1000,"Later this year, Le District, an upscale French market in the same vein as Mario Batali, Lidia Bastianich and Joe Bastianich's Eataly, will open up on the ground floor beneath Hudson Eats. And over the next 17 months Brookfield plans to roll out five sit-down restaurants, with Major Food Group's cult-favorite Parm sandwich shop and an as-yet unnamed concept from Jose Grarces' Garces Group announced so far."
1001,"The area will also be getting an Eataly of its own, with a location near the World Trade Center site recently announced. An international street food market helmed by Anthony Bourdain is also rumored to be opening at 3 World Trade Center."
1002,"But how will these businesses fare at night and on weekends, when offices are closed and there is little sign of life on the streets?"

1005,"""As many restaurants as I've opened, I still wake up in the middle of the night thinking no one is going to come,"" said Starr."
1006,"Danny Meyer, who opened Shake Shack, Blue Smoke and North End Grill in the area between 2011 and 2012 and whose Union Square Events provides catering services to the area's Conrad Hotel, admits that three years since opening in the neighborhood, there are still times when his spots have trouble getting people in the seats. But he remains optimistic."
1007,"""What we really root for is other people's restaurants down here, because that's when we know things are working, and that's about to happen,"" Meyer said recently at an event at the Conrad Hotel. ""We're so excited that we're going to have a lot more company soon."""
1008,"As for whether or not people will make the trek across West Street, those who live in the area are optimistic. Cheryl Wortzel, a Battery Park City resident since 2011, thinks a project like Bourdain's would solidify the area's reputation as a dining destination in its own right."
1009,"""That whole concept in general is so popular,"" she said, referring to retail-dining emporiums such as Eataly and Hell's Kitchen's Gotham West Market. ""Gotham West ? is in the middle of nowhere, but people still go there."""

1044,"This is Halloween. 

 Actually, it's May, but Halloween has hit the East Village permanently with the opening of a new Tim Burton-themed bar, Beetle House (308 E. 6th St.). 
  ""We want to change the way people are eating and drinking in the city,"" said Chris Neil, who co-owns Beetle House with Brian Link. The duo is also behind  Stay Classy, New York, the ever popular Will Ferrell-themed bar that opened this past fall. 
 ""All the bars in New York are very much the same: Irish pub, Irish pub, Irish pub, Irish pub, Irish pub, sports bar, Irish pub,"" Neil said. ""And I'm not Irish and I don't like sports."" 
  Neil, who prefers enjoying a drink without Monday night football fans rooting for some team on TV, was inspired to start the Will Ferrell-themed bar out of a love for the comedian's movies. ""It's a place where you can just laugh and have a good time,"" Neil described. He aimed to recreated this aesthetic with his second bar project. 
  Both big admirers of Tim Burton, Neil and Link decided to create a bar and restaurant with a menu and decor inspired by the artist. Aiming for ""a gothy, Halloween all year kind of feel,"" Beetle House came to life. 
  Tim Burton is in no way affiliated with the bar, though his publicist has been in contact with the bar for future promotions. ""We've never had the privilege of meeting him, but now we have a place where his fans gather in New York,"" said Neil.
  The TV-free bar won't show any of Burton's movies, just stepping into the deep purple walled Beetle House reveals the inspiration. ""All of the decor is vintage, antique oddities,"" Neil said. ""Medical equipment, old books ... all of these antiques are 100 plus years old and from all over New York and the world."" Antiques, worth $35,000, in fact, decorate the bar which pays ode to ""Sweeney Todd,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and pretty much the entire Burton canon. More memorabilia, commissioned art, a spiderweb on the ceiling and a fog machine will be added before the bar's official opening. 
 Beetle House is currently in its soft opening, with doors open at 4 p.m. each day. The official opening night is May 6.  And yes, Yes, Beetlejuice is on the menu. Take a look around.  "

The mac and cheese fantastically crisp on top, dusted with breadcrumbs and oozing with gooey cheese in the middle. Available as individual portions or as on a large group portion, we recommend going with the $35 family size. And yes, you will be fighting over the leftovers.

Made with a creamy blend white cheddar and Asiago and topped with buttery breadcrumbs, opt for the bacon crumbles add-on to complete this masterpiece of a macaroni. Visit on Mondays when mac and cheese is only $5!

1302,"Inspired by a customer who ordered both hot dogs and mac and cheese, chef Marc Murphy streamlined the process by creating a dish that combines both. The soft bun is a perfect cushion for the not too-salty hot dog and Velveeta-like smooth mac and cheese that goes down as easily as an after-school snack. Served on top of french fries, even mac and cheese purists can't resist this inspired creation. Ketchup optional.

	  We tried 12 pumpkin spice lattes in search of the best one in Manhattan.       Photo Credit: Nina Ruggiero     "
1328,"On the crisp, almost-autumn morning of Sept. 17, we embarked on an odyssey we knew would change the lives of caffeine-fueled college girls forever."
1329,We set out to find the best pumpkin spice latte Manhattan has to offer.
1330,"Well aware that an undertaking this bold would require teamwork, we decided to divide and conquer. After researching the 20 most popular PSL spots in Manhattan according to Yelp, we created a map and doled out assignments. Then, we reconvened for a serious tasting session."
1331,What we found may or may not shock you.

1337,"In the East Village, coffee shops eagerly advertised signs with bright orange pumpkins, and down by Wall Street, baristas seemed more than ready to get the season started, serving up spicy nutmeg-topped lattes with a smile."
1338,"But above 42nd Street, the scene was one of a summer not yet forgotten. One editor found that half of her assigned shops would not be selling pumpkin spice for another week. One spot said not until October."
1339,"OK, it isn't technically fall yet, but everyone knows that real PSL devotees start craving one the second the August humidity dissipates, even for a moment. Why wait for leaves to fall before enjoying a cup of pumpkin-flavored heaven? Starbucks knows this logic all too well, and decided to release their not-so-secret weapon as early as Sept. 2 this year. (We may continue our experiment as more shops make the switch.)"
1340, 
1341,Not all pumpkin spice lattes taste like pumpkin.
1342, 
1343,"Of the 12 pumpkin spice lattes we were able to get our hands on, only four had a discernible pumpkin flavor. Others had stronger hints of coconut, gingerbread and even floral perfume, while some were just plain unrecognizable."
1344, 
1345,There is a pumpkin spice latte for everyone.
1346, 
1347,"No really, hear us out. While some of the so-called pumpkin spice lattes didn't taste like pumpkin, they weren't all sugary sweet, either. Some were merely a solid cup of coffee with milk and a side of spice. Word to the haters: Don't knock it 'til you try it."
1348, 
1349,Ambiance matters.
1350, 
1351,"The reason pumpkin spice lattes are so beloved is not their taste so much as the feeling they embody-- the cozy hug of fall. So, although New Yorkers love to grab a cup and go, many of these lattes would have tasted much better if we had the time to sit and enjoy the quirky cafes they came from, feeling the fresh foam against our lips and admiring the leaf-shaped designs some baristas took the time to artfully top them with. Even the best cup of coffee loses something when you splash it on yourself on the subway."
1352, 
1353,So does aroma.
1354, 
1355,"Not all of the lattes had a strong smell, but for the ones that did, it made a serious impact-- positive for some, negative for others. Before you gulp down your next cup, remove the lid and take a whiff. Note to coffee shops: Nutmeg is a nice touch. Making us feel like we're drinking a cheap candle is not."
1356, 
1357,"Now, for the rankings."
1358, 
1359,"After tasting each latte, our team ranked them based on pumpkin flavor, spice, sweetness and coffee taste, judging each category on a scale of one to five. (Yes, we took this pretty seriously. And yes, we were hyped up afterwards.) Then, we did the same for ambiance and value."
1360, 
1361,"OK, Starbucks, we see you."
1362, 
1363,"As much as we hate to admit it, when it comes to the best all-around pumpkin spice latte, Starbucks takes the cake. (No offense, Starbucks, but we were rooting for the underdogs.) While some of the other shops, such as B Cup in the East Village and Grounded in the West Village beat out the coffee super chain in terms of atmosphere, no one could trump its pumpkin spice mastery. Starbucks simply serves a well-balanced cup with the right blend of pumpkin and spice, without being overly sweet."

1426,"There’s no food more quintessentially New York than pizza, be it a dollar slice from the no-frills corner pizzeria or a Neapolitan pie from a buzzy, sit-down spot."
1427,"Once the cheesy province of omnivores and vegetarians, pizza — thanks to advances in plant-based cheese technology and the growing popularity of meatless and dairy-free diets — now appeals to the vegan crowd, too."

1429,Hit up one of these pizzerias for your next vegan slice:
1430,"New York-style slices and pies go all-vegan at this tiny Greenpoint pizzeria with an ’80s vibe. (Owners also operate the popular Champs Diner in Williamsburg.) Crusts here are thin and crispy and the cheese comes in four varieties: Violife, a brand made with potato and cornstarch; NUMU, a soy-based mozzarella produced at the Brooklyn Navy Yards; and house-made almond and Parmesan ricotta. Try the Screamer’s white namesake pie, topped with two kinds of mushrooms and parsley flakes, or the Buffalo, with Buffalo-style cauliflower, dollops of the almond ricotta, a drizzle of vegan ranch and chives ($23 for a medium pie, $28 for a large). There’s not much by the way of seating here, so we recommend eating your ‘za on a bench in nearby McCarren Park. Retrace your steps to end the meal on a sweet note, with a vegan scoop from the Van Leeuwen ice cream shop next door."

1434,"Personal-sized pies at celeb chef Matthew Kenney’s East Village pizzeria are cooked in a custom-built wood-burning oven and served on paper-lined metal trays. The cheeses on top are nut-based: cashew mozzarella covers the plain tomato and eggplant and shiitake mushroom “bacon” pies; macadamia ricotta lends a creaminess to the white pizza with baby kale and roasted corn. Small Mediterranean plates, like an antipasto salad and zucchini lasagna, round out the all-vegan, health-conscious menu. The ambience is sophisticated, but casual, with wine bottles lining the shelves along the walls and seating spilling onto the sidewalk on warm days. Partake in a glass of vino off the restaurant’s extensive list before you tuck into your plant-based dinner."

1437,"Leave it to an Upper West Side pizzeria to brand itself as kosher and “natural.” On a superficial level, Cafe Viva resembles any other city slice shop, but a closer look at the labels behind the glass counter reveals some unique crust alternatives: there’s whole-wheat, corn, gluten-free and spelt. All pies and slices are vegetarian, but vegan options include a Sicilian with kale, tomatoes, onion, vegan lemon aioli and vegan cheese ($4.95 a slice, $32.95 a pie), and the Zen, built on a spelt crust infused with green tea, and topped off with green tea-herbed miso tofu, green-tea basil pesto, two kinds of mushrooms, caramelized onions, sun-dried tomatoes and roasted garlic ($6.96 a slice). All desserts, like the tiramisu, carrot cake and blueberry tofu cheesecake, are entirely plant-based, too."

1439,"Neapolitan pizza gets a West Coast makeover at this New American restaurant serving Cali-inspired seasonal food and beach-y cocktails. The pies are cooked quickly, at high temperatures, in wood-fired Italian Al Forno ovens, but they come with toppings like crushed avocado, roasted leeks and California tomatoes. The majority of the pizza isn’t vegan, or even vegetarian, but you can substitute dairy for tapioca starch-based Daiya cheese for an extra $2 (and you can opt for a gluten-free crust, too). Add some pizzazz to your meal with a $14 cocktail like the Orange Crust (orange-infused vodka and freshly squeezed orange juice) or the Baewatch Fuego (jalapeno-infused tequila, watermelon and lime)."

1441,"This counter-serve spot with locations in Brooklyn and Manhattan serves thin-crust, round pies and grandma-style square ones with a reputation for delivering your money’s worth in terms of food. (Where you’d be tempted to drunkenly devour two or three slices elsewhere, one might suffice here.) Generally a no-frills establishment, the Williamsburg outpost has its charms: a black-and-white tiled floor, subway-tiled and brick walls, a cheery red-and-white striped awning. This is the perfect place to stop for late-night grub with omnivore friends; let them chow down on slices with the house-made mozzarella while you go completely cheese-free. The vegan pie here comes with tomato, garlic, red onions, spinach, roasted red peppers, mushrooms and olives ($25)."

The V for Vegan pie with daiya, its plethora of veggies (artichokes, onions, mushrooms) and its crisscrossing red pepper and basil pestos will satisfy your taste buds and your need for a fast hunger fix (prices range from $12.95 for a small pie to $28.95 for a large). The veggie-smothered, whole wheat-crusted Earth Mother — named after community garden savior and star Bette Midler — is a good option for the calorie conscious. With nine different locations in the city (including at Citi Field), a slice in one of Two Boots’ whimsically-decorated psychedelic shops is never far away."

1445,"Stop by either one of the Williamsburg or Greenpoint locations of this classic New York pizzeria to grab some garlic knots, a “ham” pinwheel (dipped in marinara sauce and not to be missed), or one of their eight to 10 vegan slices available each day. Then settle into one of the curved red booths — a staple of every New Yorker’s childhood to chow down. The vegan pizzas are made with Teese cheese, which is soy-free and made with tapioca starch and coconut oil, but Daiya is available for an extra $3 on specialty pies made to order. Inventive topping combos like the Tiger Style (teriyaki chicken, broccoli, mozzarella, cheddar, and sesame seeds) or the Parma Initiative (baked breaded eggplant, marinara sauce, mozzarella, and cheddar) can satisfy any plant-based pizza connoisseur. But if regular old pizza just won’t cut it, Vinnie’s will “veganize” their infamous pies Pizza on Pizza and The Pizza Box Pizza."

Try the Vegan Regina, made with tomato sauce, NUMU mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and olive oil ($15). Or the Red, White, and Greenpeace with baby arugula, house-pickled red onion and dollops of cashew ricotta ($17). Have a sweet tooth? Indulge in some vegan ice cream made by Van Leeuwen or a vegan ricotta sweet pizza with orange marmalade and powdered sugar for dessert ($12).

1540,"The bright red, yellow and blue mural on the front of the Bronx factory are in stark contrast to the monochrome world inside Zaro’s Family Bakery."
1541,The fourth-generation family-owned business churns out half a million black-and-white cookies a year from Bruckner Boulevard.
1542,"The two-toned treats — one half chocolate, the other vanilla — straddle the line between cookie and cake."

1544,"Zaro is talking with his mouth full, having just taken a bite of the indulgence helped made famous by his great-grandfather Joseph Zaro, who left Poland and sailed to Ellis Island in the 1920s."
1545,"He started a bakery in New Jersey before moving to the Bronx in 1927, where he made babka, challah and other goods typically found in an Eastern European Jewish bakery."
1546,"Joseph Zaro’s sons, Phil and William, took over in the 1950s. Today, Joseph Zaro’s great-grandsons — Michael, Brian, Scott and Richard — run the business."
1547,"The bakery has been making a whole range of baked goods at its current Port Morris facility since 1982, from bagels and pretzels to cakes and cupcakes to babka and rugelach. But it’s synonymous with the black and white."

1550,"The family claims it invented the iconic New York City cookie — immortalized on an episode of the iconic NYC TV show “Seinfeld” — during the Depression. The story goes something like this: “A lady came into the store with two small children and one child liked a vanilla cookie and the other child liked a chocolate cookie. The woman didn’t have enough money to buy two cookies so my grandfather made the black-and-white cookie,” Michael Zaro said."
1551,"The Zaros aren’t the only ones with a claim on the black-and-white cookie. Some sources place its invention at Hemstrought’s Bakeries in Utica, New York, where they are known as “half-moon” cookies, while others trace it back to Glaser’s Bake Shop in Yorkville, which is closing in July."
1552,"If not an originator, plenty of other city bakeries and stores specialize in the treat, too, from William Greenberg Desserts to Zabar’s to Donut Pub."
1553,What makes Zaro’s different?
1554,"“Our cookie tends to be a lot more cookie than cake,” Michael Zaro said. “It has a good weight to it.”"
1555,"There are more than two ways to eat a black and white. Michael Zaro takes one bite right in the middle, then breaks it in half and finishes the chocolate. If he’s still hungry he eats the rest of the vanilla."
1556,"But first, they have to be made. Laura Jaramillo and Juneisi Polance are part of the crew that specializes in black and whites at Zaro’s. With a combination of speed and accuracy, they produce mini- and full-sized versions. As cookies go down a conveyor belt, they grab them, spread vanilla icing on exactly half the cookie and place them on a baking sheet."
1557,"After the vanilla dries, the women take buckets of chocolate icing and deftly apply the second topping, using a thin-bladed metal spatula with a flourish."
1558,"Later in the day, the cookies are shipped to Zaro’s nearly 10 retail outlets to be sold. It’s especially popular among commuters; the busiest store is near Track 34 at Grand Central Terminal, while the two at Penn Station give it a run for its money."
1559,"Zaro’s most recent openings have been in the Bronx; this past fall, it debuted a bakery in Parkchester, and a bakery at its Port Morris factory is planned to open later this year."
1560,"Zaro’s sometimes puts colorful twists on the cookies for special occasions, from orange and black for Halloween to white and green for St. Patrick’s Day. But the signature black and white is the most popular."
1561,"“It’s the exceptional cookie that New Yorkers have grown to love,” Michael Zaro said."

1630,"Starting at 4, the Long Island brewery gave free burgers to the first 100 customers to line up and buy a can of the new Pilsner."
1631,"“Myself, our brewers and our employees have spent a lot of time ‘delayed’ in Penn Station waiting for the train back to Long Island, albeit with a beer happily in hand,” Blue Point president Todd Ahsmann said in a statement earlier this month. “Since the delays are expected to increase during construction, we figured we would brew a beer perfect for that extended wait.”"
1632,"Delayed, according to Ahsmann, “has just the right amount of drinkability with a touch of bitterness.” The beer’s apple-citrus aroma comes from a blend of floral, spicy hops, its honey taste from a mix of three malts."
1633,"“This beer should hold you over while you wait for the train but provide just enough bite to keep you critical of the current state of transit,” added Ahsmann, whose Patchogue-based brewery took home two silver medals for stouts in the 2017 Taste NY Governor’s Cup Craft Beer Competition."
1634,"Responding to Blue Point's rib at the LIRR, MTA spokesman Shams Tarek called the rail system's work to provide consistent service during Amtrak's summer repairs at Penn Station as a ""massive effort."" "

1659,A popular Theater District trattoria is finally reopening in its new space on 46th Street with an everything bagel and pastrami-flavored spaghetti carbonara on the menu.
1660,"Bond 45, which was slated to move from the site of the historic Bond Clothing Store at 154 W. 45th St. to a new home at 221 W. 46th St. as early as the spring of 2016, opened its doors on Sept. 25."
1661,"The Italian restaurant’s new home is a two-story, 7,800-square-foot space with seating for 268 guests and interior design by owner Shelly Fireman, “Hamilton” scenic designer David Korins and “Lion King” lighting designer Donald Holder. The vibe is classic New York style meets Italian details — think reclaimed wood, plush banquette seating, imported Italian tiling."
1662,"What’s particularly unique about the new location: A lower level called Bond Bar Below takes its visual cues from Fireman’s home in Camaiore, Italy, with a hand-carved wooden bar, exposed originals stone walls, a star-field light installation and video screens projecting sunrises and sunsets on Italian coasts in real time."
1663,"On the menu by Bologna native and executive chef Brando De Oliveira are the eatery’s signature dishes — such as fettucine Alfredo and a 48-hour braised lamb shoulder — as well as some new items: a lobster burger, a vodka-sauce pizza, and a spaghetti carbonara mixed with pastrami cubes, topped with a poached egg and sprinkled with everything bagel spices."
1664,"”Shelly Fireman is a proud Jew, but his whole life has been steeped in Italian culture, so it’s a mix of both his worlds,” spokeswoman Leslie Papa said of the entrée that fuses Fireman’s heritage and his love for all things Italian. (Fireman’s hospitality group also runs the popular, mid-priced Manhattan restaurants Café Fiorello and Trattoria Dell’Arte.)"
1665,"Returning under Bond 45's new roof is the vegetable antipasto bar, which presented selections like eggplant caponata, roasted Brussels sprouts with pancetta and Roman Jewish-style fried artichokes. The trattoria will, however, offer diners the option of ordering family-style dishes for the first time in its new quarters."
1666,"The drinks menu by a Roman sommelier and mixologist assembles wines from around the world, locally brewed craft beers and ciders and cocktails like the Bond Cup (pineapple-infused vodka, lime, passion fruit, yuzu) and Fall in Jalisco (tequila, figs, chamomile and sage syrup, lime)."

1677,"

"
1678,"If you’re looking for a frozen treat on a sweltering day in New York City, there’s no shortage of options hailing from all over the globe: you can have your pick of ice cream in scoop or soft serve form, frozen custard, rolled Thai ice cream, Italian gelato, Taiwanese shaved ice, Indian kulfi."
1679,"Suffice it to say, Levantine booza isn’t the first to come to mind. But you can order a taste of ice cream’s creamier, denser and more elastic cousin in one traditional flavor at Cedars Pastry, a Lebanese bakery in Bay Ridge, and, as of Monday, in a whole range of flavors at a new shop in Williamsburg."
1680,"Republic of Booza is now scooping 17 flavors of the frozen, dairy-based dessert for the public on North 4th Street."
1681,"Co-founder Michael Sadler, 29, answered all of our questions about the icy treat he first tried while traveling abroad:"
1682,"Booza is a form of ice cream developed about 500 years ago in an eastern pocket of the Mediterranean, encompassing modern-day Lebanon, southern Turkey, Syria and parts of Greece."
1683,"The two key regional ingredients that distinguish the milk-based frozen treat from Western homologues are sahlab, or ground orchid root, and mastic, a resin exuded from the bark of a tree that grows exclusively on the Greek island of Chios."
1684,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
1685,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
1686,"Mastic, also known as Arabic gum, and a unique production process join forces to give booza “a creamy, elastic texture that makes it smoother and denser than more familiar forms of ice cream,” Salder says. “Sometimes I say that booza is like gelato on steroids, because you take a spoon through it and you will not see any pockets of air whatsoever, which means it packs more flavor per scoop than any kind of ice cream I’ve ever tried.”"
1687,It also melts at a slower rate and holds its shape for longer (which means it won’t drip all over your clothes on a warm day).
1688,"The process begins by pouring a liquid ice cream base with sahlab and mastic into a freezer drum. (Back in the day, these were cooled in iced salt water baths, but now freezer coils do the trick.) The drum serves as a mortar for a three-foot long wooden pestle, which is used to pound the mixture as it starts to solidify. The confectioner alternates between crushing the booza with his pestle and stretching it with his hands."
1689,"”We’ll be doing that in-store, a couple hours a day during busy times, live in front of our customers. It’s a pretty fun, theatric, energetic process,” Sadler says."
1690,"Historically, booza is served in one flavor, qashta, or candied cream."
1691,"That’s where Sadler and his partners — Tamer Rabbani, Jilbert El-Zmetr and Mohammed Makki — saw room to expand the dessert’s parameters: “Nobody else is really making it in a full spectrum of flavors. We’re using booza as a vehicle to explore flavors from all over the world: iconic American staples, global inspirations and our own experimental creations,” says the Cleveland-born Sadler, whose co-founders are Canadian, Australian and Qatari, respectively. (Hence their shop’s democratic name: “We thought the Republic would be its own little collective of discovery,” united by a love of booza.)"
1692,"Alongside strawberry and rocky road, you’ll find red miso, horchata de chufa (based on a Spanish beverage made from the tubers of the nutsedge plant), lucuma (a Peruvian fruit), Sichuan white chocolate and mint tahini chip."
1693,"Republic of Booza’s freezer case also expands beyond the sweet spectrum into the savory, with options like Bloody Mary and gochujang (Korean chili) sorbets."
1694,"Not all flavors appeal to all palates, Sadler and his partners have found: “The cantaloupe-feta sorbet is very divisive. It’s some people’s absolute favorite flavor; for other people, it’s the only one they wouldn’t have again.”"
1695,"At Republic of Booza, the dessert comes in four sizes, the smallest of which may strike New Yorkers as miniature."
1696,"“Our cups have been confused as mini-cups, but by weight, it is no smaller than anything else you’d serve,” Sadler explains. “Even our small … is a full quarter-pound of ice cream.”"
1697,"Small ($5.25), medium ($6.25) and large ($7.25) servings come in cups or sugar or wafer cones; extra-large helpings ($8.25) are sold in cups or colorful Konery artisanal waffle cones."
1698,"Republic of Booza is located at 76 N. 4th St., a modern-looking storefront with a mostly muted color palette and seating for about 15. A few pops of bright color embellish the space, as well as historical accents like freezer drums and pestles and a large wall mural explaining the origins of ice cream and booza. Servers will channel the old-school ice cream parlor vibe with aprons, soda jerk hats, long-sleeved white shirts and vibrant bowties. "

1723, 
1724,"Thirsty (OK, and hungry) brunchgoers, take note: your bottomless brunch may be under threat."
1725,"A little known and obviously rarely-obeyed state law just surfaced. The NYC Hospitality Alliance, a membership organization of hotels, restaurants and bars, issued a press release reminding members of the New York State Liquor Authority's ABC Law, which ""prohibits selling, serving, delivering or offering to patrons an unlimited number of drinks during any set period of time for a fixed price."""
1726,"Bottomless brunches are a dime a dozen in NYC, as we've shown, so what gives? Could this turn into another ""War on Brunch""?"
1727,"One commenter on Eater suggested selling each drink for a penny, ""problem solved."" But the fine print of the ABC Law makes that, and other sneaky cheats, also unlawful."

Look for stands that sell eggs along with other produce, meaning they have fewer chickens on the farm and the chickens probably eat tasty food scraps and wander freely!

1864," You'll need: 
 2-4 sausage patties or 1-2 large links or 1 1/2 cups cremini mushrooms 
 1 tsp flour 
 2 cups milk 
 Kosher salt 
 Black pepper 
 Cayenne pepper   

Heat a small or medium stainless steel sauté pan over medium-high heat --don't use a nonstick pan for this recipe. When the pan is hot (test it with a small piece of sausage—it should sizzle right away), add the sausage all at once. Use a wooden spatula or spoon to mash the sausage down on the pan while breaking it up into chunks (or bite-size pieces). Brown the sausage and get a little of it to stick to the pan to create what fancier cooks call a “fond.”

When the sausage is nicely browned (but not necessarily cooked through), about 5 minutes, you should see three things: well-browned chunks of sausage, a nicely browned residue on the bottom of the pan, and some rendered fat. (If there’s not much rendered fat, you can add a little vegetable oil or bacon fat.) 

For vegetarian gravy, heat 1 tbsp of vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a steel or cast-iron pan until it is hot enough that when you put a mushroom in it, it sizzles immediately. Add all of the mushrooms to the pan and stir so they are coated with oil. Sprinkle with salt and a grind or two of black pepper and cook undisturbed until they're well-browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Then turn to cook further on the other side. 

Sprinkle the flour into the pan, stirring it into the fat. Cook the flour in the rendered fat and sausage/mushrooms for a minute, turning down the heat if necessary to keep the flour and pan residue from burning.

Pour milk into the pan, being careful not to splash. Use the end of the spatula to scrape the residue from the bottom of the pan, then stir the cooked flour, the deglazed fond and the sausage/mushrooms together. Bring the gravy to a boil, lower the heat and cook until it thickens, about  8 minutes. When it’s ready, gravy will be the thickness of heavy cream.

Some people like eggs on top, while others, like egg owner George Weld, think that too much of a good thing is not always as good. 
"
1873,"Along with your eggs and biscuits, you'll probably want some bacon (and coffee).  At egg, the bacon is served candied, but Hanczor recommends cooking bacon in the oven for ease and crispness! Simply heat your oven 400 degrees, line a tray with foil, and cook bacon for 15-20 minutes, checking for crispiness-- just don't overcook and let it burn! Voila, brunch! "

A room that'll give you a sugar high

When you push through a strange room made of inflatable walls, you'll find yourself in this colorful utopia featuring Trolli gummies, this candy unicorn, flying pigs that shoot confetti out of their butts (that's right) and a spinning floor to give you the dizziness that comes with a sugar high.

Yes, the pool of giant 'marshmallows'

Jump on in (sans shoes) and just try and climb out of this pool of foam marshmallows. Jumping in and ""swimming"" around is fun, but it's hard to get out -- you'll work up a sweat, but hey, you're living your candy dreams.

2096,"For Halloween, the pop-up is introducing crowds to the ""Phantom of Candytopia"" and treats for those who come in costumes."
2097,"The exhibit, which has drawn the likes of Drew Barrymore, Gwyneth Paltrow, James Corden and Wiz Khalifa, is $34 for adults and $26 for children ages 4 to 12. A new batch of tickets is on sale at candytopia.com and is expected to sell out quickly.
We got a sneak peek of Candytopia when it opened in August, so, in the words of Willy Wonka, ""Come with me and you'll see a world of pure imagination [below].""

Amazing candy sculptures, like this dragon

2120,Actor Rob Hille suited up in a bulky yellow-and-red costume for the burger chain’s Off-Broadway debut in midtown Tuesday.
2121,
2122,"  
  
  The West Coast and Southwest burger chain Carl's Jr. anticipated its midtown debut at 425 Seventh Ave. Wednesday, Jan. 31, 2018 with an Off-Broadway show starring its mascot the prior evening. ""Written in the Stars"" featured actor Rob Hille in the lead role. (Credit: AMNY / Nicole Levy)
"
2123,Actor Rob Hille has a newfound appreciation for the costumed characters taking photos with tourists in midtown. 
2124,"“I absolutely look at everybody in Times Square as, ‘I bet they have an MFA, too,’” says the Kensington resident, who suited up in a cumbersome star-shaped outfit Tuesday evening as the lead role in the “first-ever Off-Broadway play produced, directed and performed entirely by a quick-service restaurant.” "
2125,"That’s how Carl’s Jr. — the national burger chain with franchises concentrated on the West Coast and in the Southwest, opening its first Manhattan location Wednesday — described the 30-minute production written by Hille’s longtime colleague John Behlmann and mounted at a modest black-box theater in midtown."
2126,"In “Written in the Stars,” Hille plays the company’s cheery mascot Happy Star, a not-so-happy actor struggling to find work in New York City. (In the self-referential opening scene, a casting director tells him the Off-Broadway play he’s trying out for has no actual intention of hiring anyone but a “star” — the figurative kind, naturally.)"
2127,"Getting into character is easier than maneuvering the stage in a costume that extends his wingspan by roughly four feet and limits his peripheral vision: “I just think about what it was like when I first moved to New York City nine years ago, before it all went wrong,” quips Hille, now 35. “I think he embodies the wide-eyed, aspiring actor that we all used to be … It’s kind about him coming to terms with that dream and maybe something else that he would want to do instead that isn’t heartbreaking at all.”"
2128,"Employed as a waiter, Happy Star demonstrates a talent for grilling up charbroiled burgers when the head chef at his restaurant abruptly quits (and marches offstage in a huff about his deferred dream of dancing professionally). Happy’s friends convince him to pursue a career in the restaurant industry and open his own burger joint — a business no less risky in New York City than acting, let us note parenthetically here."
2129,"Unlike his character, Hille has determinedly stayed the course. "

2131,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
2132,"”There’s nothing else I want to do,” says Hille, who pays the bills now as a stagehand and carpenter at St. Ann’s Warehouse in DUMBO, and has worked every kind of job from bartender to truck driver. “It’s just keeping the rent paid and your ear to the ground.”"
2133,"You could say he’s been fated to play the part of the Carl’s Jr. mascot since attending graduate school in Colorado, where a visiting professor at the National Theatre Conservatory pinned his curriculum to one highly unusual fast food analogy: “[He] would come in and talk about acting as just about making choices … The example that he always used was Carl’s Jr. or Jack-In-the-Box? I just remember this guy saying Carl’s Jr or Jack-in-the-box 7.000 times when I was taking this class, and thinking ‘What is Carl’s Jr. and why is this guy so crazy about it?”"
2134,"Hille is personally devoted to Five Guys’ double bacon, double cheeseburger, but like any brand spokesman worth his salt, he says he’s looking forward to trying the Carl’s Jr. version on Seventh Avenue, across the street from Madison Square Garden. (As for the beer and wine on tap at the midtown location, he won’t be turning that down, either.)"
2135,"Does this unconventional gig come with lifetime perks, we have to ask."
2136,"‘I don’t know about for life — I hope I get a burger out of this at least,” he says. “I don’t think I’m going to walk into Carl’s Jr. in San Bernardino the next time I’m visiting my parents, and say, ‘I’m sorry, do you know who I am?’”"
2137,"At the very least, the challenge of emoting in an outfit with stiff, four-fingered gloves, a profile view that is just one red stripe and a smiley face printed on its belly has undoubtedly expanded his range as an actor: “There’s a lot of thumb acting that’s happening in this for me.”"
2138,"Determined to shine in a crowded fast-food market, Carl’s Jr. is now serving the city its $5 “All-Star” meals, “Thickburgers” made with Black Angus beef patties weighing in at one-third or a half a pound, smaller slider versions and ice cream shakes at both 425 Seventh Ave. and 1201 Surf Ave. in Coney Island."

	  The iconic Carnegie Deli location on Seventh Avenue in midtown, open since 1937, will close its doors at the end of 2016. But New Yorkers will still be able to get the famous sandwiches at its Madison Square Garden location.

2145,"Several dozen New Yorkers and tourists lined up at the Carnegie Deli on Seventh Avenue in midtown one recent evening, just days before the famed city icon is set to shut its doors."
2146,"Known for its towering sandwiches and celebrity faces lining the walls, the restaurant, which opened in 1937, will officially close at midnight on Saturday (or Friday night)."
2147,"“It’s good food. It’s a New York icon,” said Brooklyn Heights resident and doctor Liz Dvor, who was stood in line recently with her husband for more than 45 minutes waiting to get inside. She was ready to order the “Woody Allen,” half pastrami, half corned beef."
2148,"Dvor and her husband made a night of it, sipping prosecco out of a bag and patiently waiting their turn."
2149,"“We were committed to it,” she said of visiting the deli before it closes."
2150,The “Woody Allen” sandwich is part of what made the deli so famous. The eatery was featured in the filmmaker’s 1984 film “Broadway Danny Rose.”
2151,"Its numerous other film and TV appearances include the 1996 movie “One Fine Day” and cameos on the History Channel, “60 Minutes,” “Unwrapped,” “Emeril Live,” “Law & Order” and “Dr. Phil.”"

2154,"Its current owner Marian Harper took over the kosher-style restaurant from her father Milton Parker, who served as the “Chief Pastrami Maven” and acquired the eatery from its original owners in 1976."
2155,"For some, heading to the restaurant in its last week in business was simply a last opportunity to feast on the giant sandwiches."
2156,"“It’s a New York institution,” said Norris Nonkin, 61, of Sheepshead Bay. “Go for one last time -- just the experience of saying we went to the Carnegie Deli right before its closing.”"
2157,"On Tuesday evening, Courtney Cassimer, 21, got on the line, having tried and failed to eat there the night before when the deli closed early at 8 p.m. There were already several dozen waiting for a table and a formidable showing for the takeout counter."
2158,"“It’s a staple,” said Cassimer, who lives in Flatbush. “Besides world’s best, it’s world famous.”"
2159,"Customers Tuesday night were told the business would again close early, this time at 11 p.m., but Cassimer begged and was given a reprieve. It would be her first and last time eating at the restaurant. The early closing also didn’t stop many from lining up behind her, hoping they’d be as lucky."
2160,New Jersey resident Donna Rodriguez had never eaten there either.
2161,"“It was closing and it was enticing,” said Rodriguez, who works in Brooklyn. Ultimately, it was the “anticipation of going in and trying something monumental” that drew her in."
2162,"“I can say, ‘hey, I tried that right before’” it closed, she added."
2163,The eatery is scheduled to be open for normal business hours on Friday (8 a.m. to midnight).
2164,"“The deli is working very hard to ensure that all of their customers on their long lines are served,” Justine DiGiglio, a spokeswoman, said in an email."
2165,"But New Yorkers who want their fix don’t have to fret: Carnegie Deli still has locations inside Madison Square Garden, The Mirage Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas, and The Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. It is also a vendor at the annual U.S. Open in Flushing, Queens, according to the company website. And for a taste of New York a bit further away, the deli will still do online deliveries."

2258,"“CBD has wonderful anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, anti-insomnia and pain management benefits, and is incredibly safe and effective,” Upper East Side nutritionist Brooke Alpert says."

2261,"Some prescriptions shouldn’t be mixed with CBD (ask your doctor), but otherwise, “CBD oil is non-intoxicating, has almost no side effects, and is virtually impossible to lethally overdose,” says Alexis Rosenbaum, owner of Rosebud CBD Oil, which is used in the Breslin’s new CBD creations plus sold by the bottle to consumers who want to infuse CBD into their cooking (or drinking). "
2262,"Rosenbaum notes that CBD usage dates back to prehistoric times, though research is nascent. As studies on CBD usage and benefits grow — Rosenbaum reports her products offer “relief and better quality of life from anxiety, inflammation and chronic pain” — the use of CBD will likely become even more mainstream. "
2263,Ordering a dose
2264,"CBD can be found in everything from body creams to bath bombs. To use as an ingredient in food and beverage, the hemp extract is typically mixed with an oil, like coconut, almond, orange or jojoba seed, which has minimal flavor."
2265,"Beyond the Ace Hotel, NYC destinations capitalizing on the trend of late include the upscale diner eatery Bubby’s, which adds a CBD sweetener to beverages like coffee, lemonade and cocktails; vegan chain By Chloe, which has added CBD-infused desserts to its menu; and Chillhouse, a cafe and spa that just unleashed a menu with CBD-honey-drizzled ricotta toast and a CBD hibiscus milkshake."
2266,"New businesses are also making CBD as their main attraction. In Astoria, restaurateur Zsolt “George” Csonka recently opened Adriaen Block, an upscale stoner-themed lounge offering cocktails and nonalcoholic drinks with CBD tinctures. A “munchies” menu also includes CBD-infused sauces and whipped cream. "
2267,"Csonka became interested in CBD because of the health benefits and decided to open a bar  that can help alleviate anxiety, pain and inflammation through food and drink. Csonka uses a CBD peppermint oil, which is not strong enough to affect the flavor of the drinks. "
2268,"“We add CBD to each drink and dish before serving, which allows us to customize them — this lets guests decide if they want CBD or not,” says Csonka, who believes CBD works best with low-proof alcohols (Cocchi Americano and sherry are forefront on the cocktail list). "
2269,Csonka’s menu also has non-boozy CBD drinks for an alternative form of winding down after a long day. 
2270,"“[A]fter two CBD drinks you should find yourself relaxed and mellow,” he says. "
2271,"Despite its ties to the wellness scene, Albert warns that most CBD-infused treats are just that."
2272,"“Consuming a good quality CBD can be a great addition to any healthy diet: The only caveat is that if you’re consuming an unhealthy food with CBD in it, it won’t undo the negative health effects from it,” says Albert. “So a CBD soda, dessert or candy, while providing CBD, is still an unhealthy treat.”"
2273,"Alpert recommends her clients start with 5 mg doses and work their way up to 10-15 mg, depending on the strain and quality of the product. "
2274,Staying power
2275,"CBD may be pervasive now, but for how long? Thanks to New Yorkers’ constant (and let’s face it, futile) search for calm, Csonka believes the CBD craze is here to stay."
2276,"As more people seek an all-natural lifestyle, Rosenbaum also sees CBD playing a part in that. "
2277,"“It started with the farm-to-table movement, poured into beauty and household products, and has now entered the health and wellness sector,” he says. “CBD oil offers a plant-based health, wellness and beauty healing without any high, addiction or lethal overdose. It is definitely here to stay.”"

2433,"The food: How does Italian pizza stack up to New York City pizza? You'll find out at La Rossa. Classic pizzas include the Bufala e Pachino:​, with fresh cherry tomatoes, mozzarella di Bufala and basil, the La Rossa, with San Marzano tomatoes, red onions and red pepper, among others. Pies range from $12 to $23 and salads, small bites and rice balls are priced between $5 and $14."

The restaurant seats 22 guests and reflects the type of ""upscale pizzeria"" you'd find in Rome, according to a release. So, don't expect to grab a $1 slice and go (but you can order out, if you please). "

Then there are your comfort dishes, such as doughnut grilled cheese with tomato soup ($15) and the fondue Pat LaFrieda burger ($15)."

2532,"Ever since Sarah Simmons started City Grit in September 2011, guest chefs, pop-ups and chef collaborations have gained in popularity."
2533,"Alex Stupak of Empellon did a series this past November with chefs Wylie Dufresne (Alder and WD-50), Ken Oringer and Andrew Brochu, among others, David Santos at Louro hosts various chefs nearly every Monday and Daniel Humm of Eleven Madison Park switched restaurants with Chicago chef Grant Achatz of Alinea last summer. Now, with the forthcoming summer opening of RES, an artist residency for chefs by Frank Falcinelli and Frank Castronovo of Frankies Spuntino and Prime Meats, and the pop-up space Fatty Lab by the team at Fatty Crew Hospitality Group, even more chefs are showing interest in this type of partnership."
2534,"""Pop-ups are a great creative outlet to express ideas without having to commit to opening a restaurant, and we want to provide that outlet,"" said Fatty Crew partner Colin Camac, who hosts guests in the old Fatty 'Cue spot in Williamsburg. ""We choose our pop-up chefs from people we have worked with in the past or would like to work with in the future."""
2535,"In December, Chaz Brown, former chef de cuisine of Fatty Crab and latest star of Bravo's Top Chef, kicked off Fatty Lab and served up an array of Brooklyn-meets-Creole-style dishes, including spicy head-on shrimp, gumbo and collards laced with pork. Though they won't divulge their next guest, the group plans to keep running Fatty Lab for a while, and between stints, they will be busy recipe testing and holding private events."
2536,"Another way chefs have been teaming up is through special projects, like the Guest Chefs Give Back program at the popular sandwich shops Num Pang. Founders Ratha Chaupoly and Ben Daitz started this series in February 2012 with Mario Batali, who created the Batali Pang sandwich. This sausage, pickled balsamic onion and Cacio de Roma cheese creation not only showcased Batali's skill at making a sandwich within the confines of Num Pang's tiny kitchen, but also benefited their respected charities. The last collaboration they offered in December was the Gramercy Tavern Pang, featuring Gramercy Tavern chef Michael Anthony and a sandwich inspired by the restaurant's new cookbook."
2537,"""In our opinion, these guys are the best chefs in the city hands down, and also great guys willing to give their time and creativity for all these great causes,"" said Daitz. ""Also, it's fun to work with people that are doing something different than what we are doing."""
2538,This exact concept is why Simmons started City Grit in the first place.
2539,"""I would meet a chef and the first thing they would say, 'Oh my god, I would love to come cook in New York,' so I started to realize there was a demand to have a place where they could cook,"" she said. ""The wheels started turning, and it started out really as something selfish, because I wanted a way to not cook every single day."""

2542,"Hence, City Grit was born inside a furniture store that is within an old school, and has hosted talent from Sean Brock to April Bloomfield to Paul Qui. Yet despite the excitement and team effort, hosting a guest chef isn't always easy."
2543,"""I think a lot of people don't work with guest chefs on a regular basis because it's a lot of work,"" said Simmons. ""We've designed a system for executing these events and it's still hard, like opening a new restaurant every 48 hours."""
2544,"Of course, this also means guests get to experience something unique each time, which is part of the pull, and one that's clearly strong enough to inspire other chef collaborations all over the city."

	  A young Flynn McGarry in the documentary ""Chef Flynn.""       Photo Credit: Chef Flynn Film     "
2552,"In 2012, The New Yorker profiled a 13-year-old who was hosting 10-course tasting menu dinners at his San Fernando Valley home under the headline “Prodigy.”"
2553,"That piece drew the attention of filmmaker Cameron Yates, who soon reached out to the phenom, Flynn McGarry, about making a documentary."
2554,"Fast-forward six years, and McGarry, now 19, runs his own fine-dining restaurant, Gem, in New York City. And the documentary, “Chef Flynn,” is out Friday at the Film Forum."
2555,"Using home videos that McGarry’s mother, Meg McGarry, a director herself, shot, as well as his own footage, Yates follows McGarry as he goes from a little kid hosting dinners for family and friends and using his schoolmates as staff, to getting staging stints at such esteemed restaurants as Eleven Madison Park, to running his hyped 2014 pop-up in New York City, Eureka, at the age of 15, this time with a professional staff under him. Along the way, he also garnered more media attention, from a cover profile in The New York Times to TV spots with Larry King and Jimmy Fallon."
2556,"After initially approaching the McGarrys, Yates spent a year getting to know the family before they agreed to let him make a documentary."
2557,"“I was fascinated by this story,” the NoLIta filmmaker, 38, says. “I come from the Albert Maysles, sort of vérité documentary school of filmmaking. Knowing that your subjects, not only that they trust you, but that you’re in there for the long run, and you want to show something larger than just the small sound bites,” it’s really important for me."
2558,"That time paid off, as it took some convincing to get the McGarrys on board."
2559,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
2560,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
2561,"“At first we were sort of against it, we were a little scared by the idea of that,” McGarry says. “It was happening at such a crazy time as well. As we figured out what was going on and what we wanted to do, it felt comfortable.”"
2562,"Yates started filming in 2013, following McGarry through 2017 as his pop-up attracted more interest and he gained more fame. He also pored over years of family home footage and photos. Yates estimates he ended up with around 400 hours of footage — “everything from early VHS home movie to cellphone video to professional cinematography cameras,” he says."
2563,"“It’s kind of an incredible range over the 18 years in the life of him, growing up and becoming a chef,” Yates says. “I was so excited to be able to be in there and stick around for six years, but also knew that I would be able to tell the whole story because of all this other footage his mother has shot.”"
2564,"For McGarry, the documentary is an opportunity for him to revisit forgotten moments with his family — and see ones he wouldn’t be able to remember."
2565,"“My sister found this clip of me as a two-year-old when everyone was calling me ‘Chef Flynn,’” he says. “It’s a funny thing to see how it all played out on more of a grander scale.”"
2566,"The film doesn’t capture everything, of course; for most of the filming, McGarry and Yates were based on opposite coasts, meeting up for special pop-ups or events in New York City. And when a 16-year-old McGarry traveled around Europe, working in restaurants in Oslo and Copenhagen, he did that on his own."
2567,"“Those experiences I wanted to just be by myself, and didn’t really want cameras around,” he says. “I think that was nice that the story sort of worked its way around all those things.”"
2568,"In the documentary, a young McGarry is captured as saying, “I think New York is the end goal as far as a place for a career in a restaurant.” The film stops short of McGarry achieving just that, with scenes of the chef scouting locations for what will become his first restaurant, Gem, which opened earlier this year on the Lower East Side."
2569,"For McGarry, it was an appropriate ending for the film."
2570,"“I think it’s nice that it ended before that next chapter — just encapsulates sort of one period,” he says. “Well, a pretty big period so far of my life, but kind of stops at a nice time where it’s sort of saying, there is another part to it.”"
2571,"As for what’s next, McGarry doesn’t have any big goal in mind, but is focusing on running his nascent restaurant."
2572,"“That’s the only thing that we’re thinking about,” he says. “Just how can we make this better every single day.”"

The fast-food giant — known for its crispy poultry, Sunday closures and its CEO's stated views on gay marriage — advertised the restaurant at 144 Fulton St. as its largest ever in September, a milestone confirmed by a company spokesman on opening day. The 12,000-square-foot space features large windows, a skylight and three dining levels that can seat 140 guests, including the roof deck featuring a view of the Freedom Tower.

Chinese cuisine on Christmas is a long-loved Jewish tradition, and there are plenty of theories as to why, some of which the Atlantic rounded up.
While many restaurants are closed on the holiday, Chinese restaurants (and movie theaters, another part of the tradition) are often open. There's little-to-no dairy in Chinese food, which theoretically can make it easier to keep kosher, at least if you don't order pork or shellfish.
And as Jennifer 8. Lee, producer of ""The Search for General Tso"" noted to the Atlantic, Jews and Chinese immigrants made up the largest block of non-Christian immigrants on Manhattan's Lower East Side — where today you can still take a meandering walk along Grand Street and watch Chinese restaurant storefronts give way to kosher bakeries.
But Jewish or not, Chinese food is a fine option for anyone who doesn't feel like cooking or perhaps isn't making a trip home for the holidays this year.
Here's a selection of restaurants that are open on either Christmas Eve or Christmas Day to fuel your holiday, whether you celebrate or not. Be sure to check back for more.

Kings County Imperial

This Chinese food favorite, known for its authentic regional flavors, is a good choice for a Christmas dinner because there's no set menu and there are two locations -- Williamsburg for Brooklynites and the Lower East Side for Manhattanites. From dim sum to noodles, stir fry to fried rice and everything in between, Kings County Imperial is offering a feast for those who come in from noon to 10 p.m. It's also open Christmas Eve, New Year's Eve and New Year's Day.

Traditional foods served during the meal celebrating the start of the Chinese lunar calendar — falling this year on Feb. 16 —  won’t weigh you down like Thanksgiving dinner, but they are heavy with symbolic significance.
“Around the New Year everything is about wishing prosperity, good fortune, good luck and long life to your loved ones and the ones around you,” explains Sean Tang, 32, a partner at Pinch Chinese. His Soho soup dumpling and cocktail spot is serving New Year’s specials said to bring diners those blessings during a weeklong celebration later this month.
“You find that a lot of the food that goes into the new year, it’s very subtle,” says chef Dale Talde, 39, whose Chinatown restaurant Rice & Gold is offering a special family-style New Year’s menu for two nights. “It’s not really, really spicy or really, really tart or really, really sweet. It’s almost Zen.”
The reasoning behind these mild flavors, says Talde, who celebrates the annual festival with his wife’s family, is that your mindset on the first day of the new year sets a critical precedent for the next 12 months, and “if you start it out energetic and light and with a sense of calm, the rest of your year is going to be the same way.”

2770,"The standard Chipotle burrito weighs about 17 oz., but burrito size can be increased to 31.7 oz. at no additional cost!"
2771,"In order to hack Chipotle most efficiently, Grosz found six major ordering strategies to get the most bean for your buck."
2772,"Firstly, order a bowl rather than a burrito, but request a tortilla on the side. According to Grosz, this increases your filling by 15%."
2773,"If you're all about that tight wrap, opt for a two-tortilla burrito, free at some Chipotle locations. This increases the weight of your burrito by 25%."
2774,"Doubling up is key to Grosz's menu hacks. Ordering half of each type of rice, both types of beans and pairing up meats pretty much guarantees you're getting more Chipotle goodness at the same cost. "

2810,"In a move that will likely cause waves throughout the fast-food and fast-casual restaurant industry, Chipotle announced today that it will no longer serve any products with genetically modified ingredients."
2811,"“This is another step toward the visions we have of changing the way people think about and eat fast food,” said Steve Ells, founder and co-chief executive of Chipotle, in a press release. “Just because food is served fast doesn’t mean it has to be made with cheap raw ingredients, highly processed with preservatives and fillers and stabilizers and artificial colors and flavors.”"
2812,"This isn't the first time the brand chose to be forthcoming about G.M.O's. In 2013, they were the first chain to tell customers which foods contained modified ingredients."
2813,"The modified ingredients are often components of products like cornmeal, various oils and preservatives, but Chipotle tells the Times it does not expect to have trouble sourcing ingredients."
2814,"But the numbers are staggering. According to the Times, more than 90% of corn and soy grown in the United States is genetically modified."
2815,"Why the fuss over G.M.O's? They were developed in order to allow greater production of corn and soy, though many crops are now modified. Some say animals and humans suffer from eating them, and it is widely-believed that the crops depete soil of nutrients."

2823,"Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's new GMO-free menu claims have lured diners and boosted the burrito chain's stock price, but it has some consumers crying foul."
2824,"A California woman has accused the popular chain in a lawsuit of false advertising after it trumpeted on April 27 that it was the first national restaurant company to use only ingredients that are free of controversial genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."
2825,"In her lawsuit filed Friday in federal court in San Francisco, the plaintiff Colleen Gallagher also alleged that Chipotle violated the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act because its food labeling is false and misleading, and deceived diners into paying more for their food."

2844,"To television audiences across America, Chris Santos is best known as the bald, bearded and more than a little intimidating resident judge on the Food Network’s hit series, “Chopped.” In New York City, though, the 44-year-old chef is also hailed as the king of the Lower East Side restaurant scene, thanks to the popularity of his sceney eateries, Beauty & Essex and The Stanton Social."
2845,"Last week, the enterprising chef added another with the opening of Vandal (199 Bowery, 212-400-0199, vandalnewyork.com), a 360-seat, 22,000 square-foot restaurant designed by David Rockwell (who was also behind GATO and Tao Downtown) and inspired by global street food and street art."
2846,"With a menu that offers a variety of sharable, multi-ethnic small plates, from a grown-up version of the classic street cart pretzel with American Kobe tartare to bacon and miso ramen and grilled Chilean sea bass tacos — plus the sheer size of the space — Vandal is Santos’s most ambitious venture to date."
2847,"And he’s just getting started: This summer, the chef will open new restaurant projects in Los Angeles and Las Vegas, and he will publish his first cookbook in February 2017."
2848,amNewYork asked Santos a few questions about his newest NYC restaurant.

2850,What is the concept behind Vandal?
2851,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
2852,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
2853,"Vandal is a celebration of street culture from around the world, and through its menu and the restaurant’s design, it pays homage to international street fare and street art. It uniquely showcases the work of seven world-renowned street artists, including Hush and Shepard Fairey. The menu is a culmination of inspiration from my life travels and includes nods to street fare from locations as varied as New York, Rome, Peru and Hong Kong."
2854, 
2855,What are your influences as a chef?
2856,"I am influenced and inspired by my travels, which have taken me around the globe. For research and concept creation of Vandal, we visited over a dozen countries to sample local cuisine."
2857, 
2858,How did you become a pioneer in the LES food scene?
2859,"When I opened The Stanton Social in 2005, it was one of the only restaurants in the then still-gritty neighborhood. I was inspired by the history of the LES and incorporated parts of its garment industry history past into the concept and design. So I’d like to think I’ve always been respectful and admiring of the neighborhood itself. Luckily, we had an enormous response from the public to the small plate style of dining we were doing, which not many restaurants were at the time. That paved the way for Beauty & Essex and now Vandal. Since I was one of the first chefs to arrive in the LES, I’m also very involved with local organizations like the Bowery Mission that help empower locals and provide aid to the needy."

2868,Christina Tosi learned to love miso — a fermented soybean paste — while working at Momofuku. She especially loved the savory profile in desserts.
2869,"In her latest cookbook, “All About Cake,” out Tuesday, the Milk Bar founder features a buttery pound cake with miso that’s topped with an apple compote and sour whipped cream for an “unstoppable flavor trio.” Here's the recipe so you can experience the combo, too."
2870,Makes 1 pound cake/serves 8 to 10
2871,1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat.
2872,"2. Spread the miso out in an even layer, about 1/4-in. thick, on the lined baking sheet. Bake it until the miso is browned and quite burnt around the edges, 10-15 minutes. Don’t be a ninny! The edges should be quite burnt and there should be patches of burnt spots all over the top. Remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly."

2875,3. Reduce the oven to 350 degrees. Grease and flour a 1-pound loaf pan.
2876,4. Scrape the miso into a blender. Add the buttermilk and oil and blend until smooth. Pour the mixture into a large bowl. Whisk the melted butter and eggs into the miso mixture.
2877,"5. Whisk the sugar, cake flour, brown sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a separate large bowl."
2878,"6. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ones and stir to combine. If the batter looks lumpy, use a whisk to break up all the lumps."
2879,"7. Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake until the cake rises and puffs, about 80 minutes. At 75 minutes, tap the top of the cake with your fingertips: The cake should bounce back and the center should no longer be jiggly. If it doesn’t pass this test, leave the cake in the oven for an additional 3 to 5 minutes."
2880,"8. Let the cake cool in the pan for 45 minutes, then run a small butter knife or offset spatula between the edge of the cake and the pan to help release it. Invert the pan onto a wire rack to fully release the cake. Turn the cake right side up and let it cool completely before slicing."
2881,"9. Before serving, toast the slices lightly then dollop each with apple compote and sour whipped cream."
2882,Makes about 245 g. (1 cup)
2883,"Add all of the ingredients to a medium bowl and use a whisk to whip them into soft peaks, about 2 minutes, depending on how fast and furious a whisker you are."
2884,Makes about 350 g. (1 1/2 cups)
2885,1. Peel and dice the apple into 1/4-inch chunks. Measure 200 g. (1 2/3 cups) of the diced apple (eat the rest as a snack!).
2886,"2. Stir the sugar, pectin, cinnamon, and salt together in a small bowl. Add the diced apple and toss to combine."
2887,"3. Heat the apples in a small, heavy bottomed saucepan over low heat. The apples will begin to release liquid. Continue to heat the mixture on low until the released liquid begins to boil. Cook the apples on low, stirring occasionally, until they have thickened and softened, but haven’t broken down entirely, about 15 minutes."
2888,"4. Let the mixture cool completely before using. The apple compote will keep in the refrigerator, in an airtight container, for up to 1 week."

2897,There’s no doubt that hard cider is making a spirited comeback in the U.S.
2898,"Anyone who has been to the beer section at the store has probably noticed a proliferation of hard cider brands, from big beer makers like Stella Artois with its Cidre label to smaller but significant producers like Woodchuck Hard Cider."
2899,"On Monday, nearly two dozen cider makers from New York and around the country gathered at the Astor Center in Manhattan to preview their latest batches ahead of Cider Week 2014, which gets underway Oct. 24."
2900,"There was flat cider, cider with fizz, dry cider, dry rosé cider, cider fermented in bourbon barrels, cider fermented with Belgian abbey beer yeast, aperitif cider, cider flavored with ginger, and much more."
2901,"People gathered around tables where the cider makers had set up stations to proffer tastings, sipping samples from wine glasses. Those in attendance represented retailers, restaurants and other tastemakers."
2902,"Autumn Stoscheck, one of the founders of Eve’s Cidery in Van Etten, N.Y., said Cider Week had become an important marketing event."
2903,"“It’s a great way for restaurants and stores who aren’t already on the cider ship to get excited,” she said."
2904,Here are five things to know about cider:
2905,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
2906,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
2907,"1.) It’s fermented like wine, not brewed like beer: Cider is produced from the juice of apples often pressed in cider mills. Fermentation can happen once or more times during production. Champagne yeast is sometimes added to make it bubbly; but it is also common without the sparkle. "
2908,"2.) There are many styles: Different varieties of apples can be combined to produce different styles of cider, for instance to bring out natural tannins for bitterness or to balance out acidity."
2909,"3.) It has a long history in North America: Although it seems novel these days to be drinking hard cider, it wasn’t always. Aficionados say cider was popular in colonial America and for decades was among the top alcoholic beverages in the country. But Prohibition dried up the market."
2910,"4.) Fall harvest: Apples are plucked from orchards in the autumn, ground or crushed and then the fruit pressed in a cider mill to extract the juice. However, because the cider makers are working sometimes a season ahead, this year’s cider may have been made from last year’s apples."
2911,"5.) Pair it: Because cider can be as complex as wine, different varieties can be paired with the right meats and dishes."

2919,"Katzie Guy-Hamilton may be the food and beverage director for the health club Equinox, but her first love is desserts."
2920,"“I have loved desserts since I was quite young,” the Gramercy resident says. “I just really loved to feed people, and it was a really great creative outlet for me.”"
2921,"Before overseeing all things food and beverage for Equinox, Guy-Hamilton was a pastry chef, training at the French Culinary Institute and representing chocolate restaurant Max Brenner as an international brand ambassador."
2922,"A desire to improve her health and feel good overall led a burned-out Guy-Hamilton to the Institute for Integrative Nutrition to become a certified health coach, before landing at Equinox more than two years ago."
2923,"With the release of her first cookbook, Guy-Hamilton doesn’t forget her pastry past, but instead blends her two interests. “Clean Enough: Get Back to Basics and Leave Room for Dessert,” out Jan. 1, focuses on eating real foods and balancing a healthy diet with more indulgent items, like her generous chocolate chunk cookies and Grandma’s chocolate-chocolate-chocolate cake."
2924,"“I think with the explosion of the wellness industry, people have so much shame if they’re just living their lives, and I think that’s crazy,” Guy-Hamilton said. “That’s what made me write this.”"
2925,"As far as confusion around what eating clean means, for Guy-Hamilton, it’s a personal approach (“One person’s healthy ingredient — say cauliflower — is another person’s digestive distress”) that above all stresses whole foods prepared simply."
2926,"“Eating clean means eating real food, and preparing as much of it as you can yourself so that it is clean,” said Guy-Hamilton, 32. “Whole ingredients, unprocessed, simply prepared. The simplicity of eating single ingredients is the most important concept in what is eating clean.”"

2929,"The cookbook features more than 100 recipes divided by “Clean” (your bowls, toasts, greens, prepared vegetables and soups) and “Enough” (cookies, cakes, pie, ice cream and more sweets) that are largely inspired by her travels (see her congee recipe)."
2930,"All the recipes are vegetarian, but that doesn’t  mean you can’t pair them with fish or meat."
2931,"“I wanted to provide the foundation, because the foundation is the most important part of it,” Guy-Hamilton said."
2932,"The author stresses using high-quality ingredients, from dairy to plants, and that pertains to the desserts, too."
2933,"“Buy the best foods you can always buy, within your price range, especially if you’re making things that are treats,” she said."
2934,"Given her background, Guy-Hamilton wanted to share techniques and skills in making cookies, meringues, pies and ice cream, and she hopes that people embrace baking more. But she is quick to add that the “Enough” section of the cookbook is for special occasions."
2935,"“I call dessert ‘sometimes foods,’” she said. “They are not an everyday thing.”"
2936,"Guy-Hamilton knows from experience the virtues of congee. After falling ill during a business trip to Beijing, congee “nursed me back to life,” she said. “It is so gentle on your stomach.” Even if you’re not sick, you can enjoy the rice porridge any way you please. “It’s like a blank canvas — you can make it sweet, you can make it savory,” Guy-Hamilton says. “I like it plain even.”"

2943,"2. To serve, ladle the congee into a bowl and top with a runny egg, pickled ginger, Rooster Sauce, turmeric and scallion along with Super Seed Blend, if using. Or, for a sweet porridge option, dust with cinnamon and turmeric and drizzle with honey."

The menu features illustrations of the bartenders with their favorite drink."
2974,"“It’s a pretty impressive list of people that have gone on to do other things,” Macy said."
2975,"The spring and summer menu is as extensive and varied as Clover Club’s typical offerings, with more than 40 cocktails ranging from sours and cobblers to royales to fizzes to tiki to spirit-forward libations (die-hards can buy a commemorative menu for $20)."

3001,"A subterranean dining spot recently opened beneath RedFarm in the West Village. Step down into the wood-paneled lair and you'll see where Decoy (529 ½ Hudson St., 212-691-9700, decoynyc.com) gets its name. Suspended over the communal table, depicted in paintings and illuminated in the windows are ducks in all shapes and sizes. But it wasn't these particular mallards that lured me to Decoy: it was the promise of a full Peking duck dinner."
3002,"Pull up your chair to the communal table and begin with a series of homemade pickles, crunchy cauliflower, thin strips of asparagus and chunks of squash -- all served in teacups. Then move on to a small plate or two (depending on your party size). Try the crisp and buttery Katz's pastrami triangles, the hulking oxtail dumplings or the light shrimp and snow pea leaf dumplings."
3003,"Then take a shot of duck consommé, a broth so rich that it should be sipped like the finest whiskey in the world. Then comes the Peking duck, with the meat cut in shingles, each topped with that divine crispy fat. Take out a pancake and begin building. There are three sauces and a heap of scallions to add a cold crunch."
3004,"It doesn't stop here. Along with your prix-fixe dinner, you can also order an entrée, a side and fried rice for the table. The lobster with wide rice noodles comes smothered in a smooth black bean sauce, and the fried rice with crab and scallops tastes like it just came from the sea."
3005,"No matter how many extra dishes you order, I promise you'll keep going back to the duck until every last morsel is gone. And no one will judge you for picking up the drumstick and peeling off the last bits of fat with your teeth. It's a primal urge -- and decoys are meant to be sacrificed."

The bar serves around eight of these large-format drinks a night, with favorites including the Madison Park Smash (comprised of cognac, Royal Combier liqueur, lemon, Angostura bitters and mint) and the Mai Tai (agricole rhum, Jamaican rum, Guyanese rum, orgeat syrup, orange liqueur and lime).

3020,Gallow Green at The McKittrick Hotel

3034,It may be time for you to rethink the cauliflower.
3035,"""There's always that expectation with cauliflower that it's not going to be very good,"" said Shane Lyons, head chef at Distilled (211 W. Broadway, 212-601-9514, distilledny.com). ""There's a negative connotation for a lot of people who had it prepared soggy and mushy and flavorless."""
3036,"For a cauliflower dish that isn't soggy and mushy and flavorless, try Lyons' roasted take on the superfood, currently on the menu at the Tribeca restaurant. It's a variation of a dish the chef has been tweaking since his days at Nosh in Colorado Springs. It currently contains pumpkin seeds, a shiro miso sauce and basil and snap peas, which are coming into season."
3037,"""It's one of those dishes that I have in my wheelhouse that I know works,"" said Lyons."
3038,"The key to working with the spongy veggie is starting with a dense, dry cauliflower, cutting off the florets and roasting it on medium heat with a decent amount of oil. You want enough oil because the vegetable will absorb some, and you want enough heat otherwise it'll absorb even more. Once it's roasted, you can drain off any excess oil."
3039,"When ready, the side, which is a good source of vitamins C and K thanks to the cauliflower and snap peas and heart-healthy magnesium from the pumpkin seeds, can be paired with almost anything."
3040,"""You could go the light route, such as fish and salad, or, if you're eating more like a savage, chicken wings and pate,"" said Lyons. ""You can find a balance in between with this hearty vegetable."""
3041,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
3042,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
3043,"A good time to buy cauliflower is around June and August, though it's almost always in season."
3044,"""It's one of the most consistent things you can buy in terms of price and size,"" said Lyons. ""The cauliflower never seems to change."""
3045,"If your cauliflower is wrapped in cellophane, Lyons recommends taking a small paring knife, laying the cauliflower with the stem towards you and then making a rotational cut through the root so you can take the plastic and root off in one swoop."
3046,"""If you're making a lot of cauliflower, it can save a lot of time,"" said Lyons."

3048,"Roasted cauliflower 1 head of cauliflower, cut into florets1/2 cup toasted pumpkin seeds, lightly seasoned with butter10 Thai basil leaves, picked20 snap peasShiro miso sauce (see recipe)Canola oilLemon juice In large skillet over medium heat roast the bite size cauliflower florets in canola oil until they are brown and begin to get tender. Once the cauliflower is almost cooked through, add 1/3 cup of the miso sauce, or more if you prefer, and some vegetable stock to deglaze the fond that will build up on the skillet. Be sure to use as little vegetable stock as possible so that the cauliflower becomes glazed with the miso, not the stock. Once you glaze the cauliflower, add the snap peas and cook them until they become bright green and al dente. Turn off the heat and toss in the basil and pumpkin seeds. Garnish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and some more basil leaves. Shiro miso sauce 1 cup vegetable stock2 tablespoons white wine1/2 cup garlic confit1/2 cup shiro miso1/4 cup confit oil Puree ingredients until smooth"

3056,"For a bright, flavorful pick-me-up this dreary winter, Chef Candy Argondizza has the recipe for you."
3057,"The vice president of culinary and pastry arts at the International Culinary Center recently added a sautéed arctic char with curried Greek yogurt sauce to the menu at L'Ecole (462 Broadway, 212-219-3300, www.lecolenyc.com), the school's in-house restaurant. And though it's made by gourmet chefs-in-training, the recipe is simple enough for those looking to try the flavorful dish at home."
3058,"""It is definitely doable for the home cook,"" said Argondizza. ""It's just packed with flavor and a lot of brightness, which is nice to wake up your palate."""
3059,"The key is the contrast of flavors. Olive oil-marinated cucumbers are the bed of the dish, sitting in a curried yogurt sauce that is then circled by a carrot and dill vinaigrette for a splash of color. The Arctic char, a cross between trout and salmon, sits on top, with a layer of crunch cucumber finishing it off."
3060,"""The char lends itself really well with all those flavors,"" said Argondizza. ""You feel good after you eat it, you're not bloated with a lot of carbohydrates."""
3061,"Argondizza recommends buying the char from a place that sells a lot of fish, so you're confident that it's fresh. She usually shops at the Chelsea Market or Wild Edibles Seafood in Murray Hill."
3062,"""Always ask to see the fish up close and personal,"" said Argondizza. ""Ask to smell the fish, too. It should smell like the ocean. Your nose is really the first indicator if something is off."""
3063,"The gluten-free dish lends itself to variation, too so if you can't find Arctic char, you can substitute it for salmon, which also pairs well with cucumbers. You can also use fat-free yogurt to further cut calories if you're counting. If you don't have a juicer to make the carrot and dill vinaigrette, you can look for carrot juice in the grocery store."

3066,"If you're slightly putt off by the involved recipe, which features separate recipes for the vinaigrette, curried yogurt, cucumbers and char, Argondizza assured that the dish should take about a half an hour if you're organized. You can keep it on your repertoire beyond winter, too, to whip up a flavorful, healthy meal at home."

3129,"Locals and tourists alike are willing to wait in hour-long lines and pay up to $22 for the crafty dessert. But is the allure the non-traditional flavors, the higher quality ingredients or simply the Instagram opportunity? "

Such a stagnant market led many to believe “ice cream was due for an upgrade,” as James Beard Award-nominated pastry chef Dana Cree put it."

3137,"“We pride ourselves on having a menu that’s always changing,” said co-founder Mohan Kumar, who pointed out the shop’s inventive flavors like Cornbread Ice Cream and Chorizo Caramel Swirl."
3138,"“A lot of these flavor combinations were just in Sam’s wheelhouse as a pastry chef,” Kumar said of his business partner and the man behind the menu, Sam Mason. “The Skirt Steak ice cream, for instance, is something he made on ‘Iron Chef.’” "
3139,"For Lower East Side favorite Ice & Vice, it’s all about breaking convention."
3140,"“Our approach to creating flavors is different for each,” said co-founder Ken Lo. “Sometimes we come up with an ingredient first and build on it organically, or we’re inspired by an experience, or we come up with the name first.”"
3141,"One of the shop’s weirdest flavors, Three Little Pigs, a mix of salted bacon butter caramel and bacon praline, started simply as a flavor concept."
3142,"“When we came to the final version, we realized there was so much bacon and thought, ‘There’s practically three pigs in it,’” said Lo."
3143,"Other shops offer similarly weird flavors, like Morgenstern’s Salt and Pepper Pine Nut, which tastes like a frozen version of the classic Italian dish cacio e pepe, and Ample Hills Creamery’s The Munchies, featuring Ritz Crackers, potato chips, pretzels and M&M's."
3144,"Although ice cream artisans say they create these crazy flavors for their customers and for the art of ice cream, their Instagram-worthy treats and impressive social media followings certainly haven’t hurt business."
3145,"Big Gay Ice Cream and Morgenstern’s lead the way with thousands of hashtagged Instagram posts, and with menu items like Morgenstern’s $22 King Kong Banana Split, a dish large enough to feed a family of four—with its five large scoops of ice cream (customer’s or dealer’s choice) topped with oozing sesame caramel, pineapple, and of course, a banana—it’s easy to see why."
3146,"“There are some very clear social media-driven trends,” said Cree, referring to the fish cones and pie-adorned treats that fill New Yorkers’ Instagram feeds. “They drive flash mobs of business but not return customers.”"
3147,"Even with social media frenzy aside, many believe these non-traditional flavors aren’t enough to sustain business."
3148,"Malcolm Stogo, the Ice Cream Hall of Fame’s first inductee and founder of New Jersey’s Ice Cream University, has his doubts."
3149,"“A lot of people buy these flavors once, and that’s it,” said Stogo, noting that it’s mostly tourists who are drawn to the Banana Curry and Fried Chicken and Waffles flavors of the world."
3150,"While serving a slew of eccentric tastes is at the heart of New York’s craft ice cream scene, vendors also pride themselves on churning top-quality product using the best ingredients available."
3151,"OddFellows sources its dairy from an eastern Pennsylvania co-op farm, which is close enough to Manhattan that the product sits in a truck for only two hours compared with the usual five or more. "
3152,"“The secret is in the good dairy and using more cream,” Kumar said. “That’s where the richness comes from.”"
3153,"Such high-quality ingredients don’t come cheap, though, and the added cost is reflected in artisanal ice cream shops’ steep prices."
3154,"A visit to Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream or Morgenstern’s can cost a family north of $40, a big ask next to a $2.74 pint of Dreyer’s. Yet, ice cream lovers continue to line up at both shops."
3155,"“Standing in line with good company for a $6 ice cream cone is kind of a cheap way to spend an evening these days,” said Cree, who penned the celebrated “Hello, My Name is Ice Cream.”"
3156,"“The question will be: Are they willing to stand in line for that in a year?” said Bob Roberts, head of Penn State University’s Food Science department."
3157,Industry veterans like Stogo think the competition lies in marketing.
3158,"“When you shake it out, all these stores are selling the same thing, so it’s all about personality,” he said."
3159,"Stogo was also concerned about the seasonal aspect of the ice cream business. It’s easy to sell in June or July, but sales drop when fall rolls around. A more optimistic Cree believed the artisanal trend is a broader indication of where the industry is heading."
3160,"“As long as artisan ice cream makers put in the extra effort, I think our idea of what ice cream should taste like and how much it should cost will follow,” she said."

3168,"When considering the history of Dominique Ansel Bakery, there’s BCE and CE — Before Cronut Era and Cronut Era."
3169,"On May 10, 2013, the 1 1⁄2-year-old bakery debuted the doughnut-croissant hybrid. It immediately spawned lines down Spring Street, inspired a slew of imitators in its wake and made a celebrity out of its creator."
3170,"Five years later, those lines still gather outside the SoHo bakery an hour before the 8 a.m. opening for one of a couple hundred Cronut pastries, which go for $6 and sell out daily."
3171,"“When we first started with the Cronut, we only had two people in the kitchen and two people in the front of the house,” Ansel recalls as his creation turns five. “It was a different time for me.”"
3172,"Today, the bakery has about 10 people in the kitchen and 10-12 in the front of house, he says. And thanks to the (now trademarked) pastry’s popularity, the pastry chef’s empire has also grown over the past five years. Los Angeles, London and Tokyo now have a Dominique Ansel Bakery. Ansel has also opened a second NYC shop in the West Village, Dominique Ansel Kitchen (also home to the U.P. dessert tasting menu), and his first restaurant debuted in L.A. this past fall."
3173,"The original bakery has continued to make headlines for innovative creations like the Cookie Shot, Frozen S’more and Blossoming Hot Chocolate. But a hundred people aren’t lining up daily for those."
3174,"amNewYork spoke with Ansel, 40, about the Cronut."
3175,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
3176,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
3177,Where did the idea come from?
3178,"I really wanted to push to come up with new things, and the Cronut was just one of them. I put it on the menu for Mother’s Day thinking it was going to be good. I made 35 the first day. Of course we sold out in a few minutes. We made 50 the next day. By day three we had over 150 line up. It was very overwhelming at first. It was a four-person staff managing such a big crowd. We were not prepared for it. People were writing about it, and people were traveling for it."
3179,Did you think it would catch on like that?
3180,"No. Even with all the money of the world, an entire team of creators cannot plan anything like that. It was very organic. It happened very naturally. I think that’s the beauty of it."
3181,How did you come up with the name?
3182,"It was very simple, it happened naturally. I always like to come up with fun names for our pastries, this was just one of them. This was obviously the one I preferred, so we went with it."
3183,I understand it took a few months to perfect the recipe?
3184,"Yeah, it took me about three months. Before we launched it I was perfecting all the layers and textures. It’s pretty complex. The dough, it’s a little technical and scientific to perfect it. I took the time to get the result I had, I didn’t want to rush it. I didn’t want something on the menu I wasn’t happy with. The dough is fermented with a levain — a starter — and laminated — it’s a technique of folding the butter inside the dough and adding layers. Perfecting the recipe is one thing, making it right every day is another. It changes a lot with time, with the flour used, with the water. It’s always, always different every day. And you have to tweak it to make it perfect."
3185,"Over the past five years, how have you noticed the Cronut’s influence across the city?"
3186,"It’s hard to define. The Cronut opened the doors to a lot of creativity definitely. I remember a pastry chef was telling me she was really excited by the Cronut because she was in the kitchen for 20 years, and it was the first time she saw something like this. And the reaction from people gave her the excitement again to go back into the kitchen and try something fun and new and think about pastry and baking differently. It’s a very big compliment for me to . . . make people think about food differently."
3187,Most people now associate you with the Cronut. Does that annoy you?
3188,"I think the Cronut is a beautiful creation. It’s why I’ve been pushing forward and keep coming up with new ideas, from the Cookie Shot to hundreds and hundreds of other pastries that I created after that. That’s not something I’m going to stop doing anytime soon. It’s not a matter of recreating the Cronut; it’s a matter of keep being original and connecting with our guests."
3189,Keep them on their toes.
3190,"Yeah, I see people coming back to the bakery now — they don’t look for the Cronut, they look for something new. They look for the latest creation, they look for the latest thing they haven’t tried. They come back for the creativity, not just for the Cronut."
3191,"Dominique Ansel Bakery will celebrate the fifth anniversary of the Cronut on May 12 by surprising the line with Cronut holes at random times throughout the day and selling a limited-edition set of Cronut holes that includes the first flavors sold at each shop and the current flavor, strawberry fior di latte | 189 Spring St."

3214,"He's right. But then again, Psilakis knows how to get to the heart of what's good about Greek food."
3215,"Earlier this year, Psilakis opened a third outpost of MP Taverna (after Roslyn, on Long Island and Irvington, in Westchester), a casual eatery serving modern Greek cuisine in New York City's most iconic Greek neighborhood: Astoria, Queens."
3216,"For amNewYork's ""Culinary Insiders"" series, Psilakis takes us to Astoria for a taste of the traditions he loves and a visit to his restaurant."
3217,"This Greek sweet shop and café is known for its authentic breads, cookies and pastries, including eight knockout varieties of baklava. Everything is made by hand on the premises, and, according to Psilakis, all are the ""best of what Greece has to offer, as far as sweets."" Psilakis recommends the bakery's buttery, sugar-dusted kourabiedes, ""a cookie my mother makes""; spanakopita, or spinach pie; and melomakarona, spiced, honey-soaked holiday cookies."

The house specialty is loukaniko, a semi-dried sausage cured with either leeks or orange peel, traditionally sliced and pan fried, then served as a meze, or Greek tapas. ""He's really the master of this particular sausage,"" Psilakis says of the butcher. ""This is a really unassuming place, but the sausage is tremendous."""
3221,"This Greek grocery store boasts an impressive olive bar, half a dozen kinds of feta cheese and meze favorites like marinated octopus and tzatziki. Shelves are stacked with imported goods, from regional olive oils to rusks. This is the food Psilakis was raised on; his mother kept a slab of feta out on the table for snacking, accompanied at times by the same Greek-style ""Grandma"" meatballs he serves at MP Taverna."
3222,"Exposed brick gives the bi-level restaurant a rustic charm, as do blond wooden tables, each topped with a glass bottle of olive oil. Though MP Taverna is the new kid on the block, Psilakis isn't trying to compete with Astoria's traditional Greek eateries. The menu and flavors are products of the Greek-American influences Psilakis grew up with, a hybrid he calls ""first-generation"" cuisine."
3223,"Psilakis recommends the tender grilled octopus and the bulgur salad, an underdog ""surprise dish"" bursting with the Mediterranean flavors of sweet herbs, pomegranates, dates and pistachios."
3224,"Here, the focus is less about food as an art form and more as ""a vehicle to create memories."""

3322,1½ sticks (3/8 pound) room temperature unsalted butter
3323,6 slices soft white bread
3324,"12 cups Ramen Broth (Cookbook page 207, can also substitute packaged broth)"
3325, 
3326,For the Bowls:
3327,"½ pound slab bacon, cut into approximately 1½- by ½- by"
3328,¼-inch batons
3329,¼ cup honey
3330,2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper
3331,8 large eggs
3332,1½ pounds fresh or frozen ramen noodles or thin fresh egg noodles
3333,½ cup loosely packed thinly sliced scallion greens
3334, 
3335,Method:
3336,Make the Broth
3337,"Preheat the oven to 400°F. Rub the butter on both sides of the bread, and arrange the bread in one layer on a rimmed baking sheet, leaving any extra butter in pieces on the bread. Bake, turning the pan and flipping the slices occasionally, until the bread has absorbed the butter and is crisp like toast and deep golden brown all over, about 15 minutes."
3338,"Meanwhile, bring the broth to a gentle simmer in a medium pot. When the bread is ready, add the slices to the broth and increase the heat to bring it to a boil. Turn off the heat and let the bread steep in the broth for 15 minutes. Strain the broth through a sieve, stirring and smooshing the solids to get as much liquid as you can. Pour the broth back into the pot and keep it hot while you finish the ramen. The broth keeps for up to 2 hours; stir well before serving."
3339, 
3340,Finish the Dish
3341,"Put the bacon in a skillet, set it over medium-high heat, and let it sizzle, stirring occasionally, until it's crisp and golden, about 10 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour out all but a slick of fat in the pan, reserving the rest for another purpose. Combine the honey and black pepper in the skillet, set it over medium-high heat, and let the honey bubble."
3342,"Add the bacon and cook, stirring frequently, until it's coated in a sticky glaze, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside."
3343,"Bring a large pot of water to a boil and prepare a large bowl of icy water. Carefully add the eggs and cook for 6 minutes (set a timer). Transfer the eggs to the icy water (keep the water boiling) until they're just cool enough to handle. Peel them, halve them, and set aside."
3344,"Cook the noodles in the boiling water according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain in a colander and run under water to rinse off some starch and cool the noodles. Shake to drain them very well and divide among 8 bowls along with the eggs, bacon, and scallions. Ladle the broth into each bowl, gently agitate the noodles with a fork or chopsticks to keep them from clumping, and eat."

3399,"A new dinner series at the Brooklyn Museum’s sit-down restaurant The Norm, launching this Sunday, highlights the impact those four major urban centers had on the rock star’s discography."
3400,"A complement to the museum’s current “David Bowie is” exhibition, tickets for each of the four dinners will cover four seasonal courses prepared by The Norm’s Michelin-starred executive chef Saul Bolton. Bolton — a huge Bowie fan himself, we’re told — will be on hand to explain the influences that regional cuisines and different phases of the Starman’s life has had on the evening’s menu. Brooklyn Museum’s director of exhibition design, Matthew Yokobosky, also will  make an appearance to explain the origins of the “David Bowie is” show, which comes to the end of its three-year global tour in mid July."
3401,"The Norm’s four-part dinner series is only the latest facet of Bowie mania that has swept across the city since the Brooklyn Museum’s exhibition opened its doors to the public in March, taking as many forms as the star’s constantly mutating personas. One Crown Heights wine bar and restaurant is hosting a limited-time craft cocktail menu featuring seven drinks that pay homage to the singer-songwriter’s myriad characters, and music streaming service Spotify has partnered with the MTA to install life-sized Bowie images in the Broadway-Lafayette station, as well as distribute 250,000 MetroCards picturing five of the musician’s eccentric personalities."
3402,"The first edition of the four-part dinner series at the Brooklyn Museum this Sunday will focus on Berlin street food. The meal kicks off at 4:30 p.m. with a cocktail inspired by the rock legend and features dishes like spaetzle — German egg noodles — with fried onion and scallions, and currywurst sausage. Music played from Bowie’s classic Berlin trilogy, three consecutively released studio albums recorded after the artist moved to West Berlin in 1976, and a display of rare images of the musician by Japanese photographer Masayoshi Sukita will set the mood for the dinner."

3430,"The next time you’re dining in Koreatown, order something other than the barbecue."
3431,"That’s the best way to develop your understanding of Korean cuisine and culture, says chef David Chang, founder of the Momofuku restaurant empire and a food and culture special correspondent for the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics."
3432,"“I think that when you talk about Korean food, most people think that it’s Korean barbecue or kimchi, and the reality is … there’s so much more,” the second-generation Korean-American restaurateur said last month at an NBC Sports news conference at Rockefeller Center. “People don’t realize that Korea has been heavily influenced by China, by Japan, by America, and you can see it in its cuisine. It’s not monolithic, it’s just a hodgepodge of many different things. . . . And I think if you can understand Korean cuisine, you can really understand Korean people.”"
3433,"Chang — whose own cooking spans all kinds of culinary traditions, including Korean, Japanese, Italian and American — doesn’t claim to be a consummate expert on Korean food, but he says that all the learning he has yet to do will actually play to his advantage in his role at the Olympics: “While I’m Korean-American, I still am discovering stuff about Korea, so I thought I would be a good bridge,” he told amNewYork."
3434,"When Jim Bell, NBC’s president of Olympics productions and programming, broached the idea of Chang serving as a correspondent over dinner at his Momofuku Ssam Bar in the East Village (the two know each other from Bell’s days as a “Today Show” producer), Chang was stunned, he said."
3435,"“We chatted about my love of sports and Olympics — he’s known that I’m a big sports fan of everything,” Chang recalled. “When asked me if I’d be interested, I was like, ‘You guys punking me? This is ridiculous.’ . . . To be able to talk to the athletes and be in Olympic Village, it’s just so wild — I couldn’t pass up the opportunity.”"
3436,"As part of his assignment, the newly minted NBC contributor visited Korea for the first time in five years last February to tape footage for the channel’s Olympic coverage, which kick off Feb. 9. A preview shown at January's press preview showed Chang visiting the haenyeo of Jeju Island, “sea women” who for centuries have free-dived to depths of up to 20 feet to harvest shellfish like abalone and sea urchins by hand. One diver he met was 89 years old."
3437,"“To hang with these women and cook with them, I really did see a lot of my mother and my grandmother in them,” Chang told the audience in a Q&A session with Bell."

3440,"The chef says he grew up eating traditional Korean food at home, “but I also grew up thinking it was not something I could ever share with people.”"
3441,"The optics of Korean food (“not super pretty” by Western standards, in his words) are something Chang is actively trying to change, as evidenced by an upcoming food docuseries he’s hosting called “Ugly Delicious.”"
3442,"“It’s something we’ve been tackling for a while now: that all delicious food isn’t always super pretty. And I think Korean food is sort of the embodiment of that. If you look at that,” Chang said, pointing to heaps of banchan (foods like pickled radishes and soy-braised beef, typically served as small dishes alongside rice) prepared for last month's event, “that’s not something that’s traditionally beautiful, but it’s super delicious and I think it’s also culturally relative. People in Korea and Asian probably wouldn’t say that’s not pretty, but in terms of how we view things as Instagrammable or picture-perfect doesn’t always have to be the case.”"
3443,"“Ugly Delicious,” which premieres on Netflix on Feb. 23, will “challenge both taste buds and minds,” a news release says of the eight-episode show profiling “chefs, activists and artists [around the world] who use food as a vehicle to break down cultural barriers, tackle misconceptions and uncover shared experiences.”"
3444,"Here in the city, New Yorkers can do some of that work themselves by trying the soups and stews at their local Korean restaurant, instead of ordering the grilled marinated meats."
3445,"Chang’s go-to spot for Korean soup is a little takeout and delivery spot inside the Four Seasons Cafe at 67 W. 23rd St. KoFoo “looks like a bodega … but they actually serve really good Korean food,” he said. “I like to get the budae jigae, which is the army stew.”"

3491,How did the Dead Rabbit-brand whiskey come about? 
3492,"The Dead Rabbit Irish Whiskey has been in the works for a while. We’ve always been advocates of our native spirit and knew that if we were ever to release a product, it would have to be an Irish whiskey. We’ve been working with Darryl [McNally] and the team at Dublin Liberties Distillery closely since the collaboration was agreed — tasting samples and visiting the distillery site, until we agreed on a liquid that we’re all proud of. The bottle and packaging was created by [design and advertising studio] Drinksology in Belfast, who we’ve been working with for over a decade. "
3493,What makes these new Irish coffee glasses so special? 
3494,"The Dead Rabbit Irish coffee glass has been designed for us by an architect in Northern Ireland, and is currently being made in China. The glasses will only be available to purchase direct from the bar. The Dead Rabbit Irish Coffee can only be found here — we know a lot of bars make it to our recipe, and that’s great, but we believe ours to be unbeatable."
3495,"The Dead Rabbit (30 Water St.) will be celebrating St. Patrick’s Day this Saturday with free Irish food, live Irish music and Bushmills Irish Whiskey promotions."
3496,"If you don’t want to brave the crowds, you can make the Dead Rabbit’s Irish coffee from the comfort of your own home."
3497,"“We use protein shakers to get the cream to the right consistency,” Dooley says. “It needs to be pourable, and float on top of the coffee.”"

"
3512,"Standing in front of his namesake pizzeria, Emmett Burke has no problem firing the first salvo."
3513,"“Chicago-style pizza is actually pizza,” the Chicago-born 35-year-old says. “New York-style pizza is actually questionable, where I come from.”"
3514,"New Yorkers are used to such trash talk from the Windy City, but Burke isn’t in Chicago. His deep-dish restaurant is in the heart of the South Village."
3515,"When Emmett’s opened in fall 2013 at 50 MacDougal St., the news attracted both suspicion from thin-crust, Neapolitan devotees and curiosity from those whose only taste of Chicago-style pizza was from Uno franchises."
3516,"New York, it seems, has an appetite for deep dish: Coming on five years later, Emmett’s continues to draw two-hour waits."
3517,South Village-bound
3518,Burke’s pizza career started early; as a kid he delivered pies — the kind that demand a fork and knife.

3521,"“When I was younger I used to think how much fun it would be to have a restaurant,” Burke said. “A voice told me, ‘If you build it, they will come.’”"
3522,"He left the suburbs of Chicago for New York to attend Fordham University, graduating with an undergraduate degree in finance in 2005. "
3523,It didn’t take long for him to notice the absence of up-to-snuff Chicago-style goods in the city.
3524,"“I always felt that Chicago pizza was not well-represented here,” he said. "
3525,"After quitting a finance industry job in 2010, Burke took a few years to test sauces and cooking times before opening Emmett’s in 2013."
3526,"“I’ve eaten so much pizza growing up, I had an idea what it had to taste like,” Burke said. “When I had the taste and the flavor profile I knew from back home, I knew it was time to open.”"
3527,"The ingredients for Emmett’s deep dish pies are either grown locally, made in-house or imported from Chicago."
3528,"The deep dish pie is made in a two-inch-deep pan, and it’s light and airy. (“It’s a misconception that the deep dish is a brick of dough and cheese,” Burke said.)"
3529,"Though Emmett’s stakes its reputation on authentic deep dish, it also offers thin-crust pies and a Chicago-style hot dog (that’s a boiled Vienna Beef wiener topped with dill pickle, sliced tomato, diced white onions, relish, sport peppers, celery salt and yellow mustard in a poppy seed bun). "
3530,"“We don’t have a big menu, but what we do here, we’re really proud of,” Burke said. "
3531,He also prides himself on the atmosphere. It’s the kind of place where strangers talk to each other at adjoining tables and the music covers everything from The Kinks to Alan Vega to Tom Petty.
3532,Waiting for a slice
3533,"New Yorkers and homesick Chicagoans alike wait up to two hours for one of Emmett’s 12 seats at the bar and seven or eight micro tables (it doesn’t help that deep dish takes 30 minutes to make, either)."
3534,"On a recent weekday afternoon, Nicholas Dellatacoma and girlfriend Tina Cortese traveled from Staten Island to the restaurant to celebrate his birthday."
3535,"“We love to eat pizza,” said Cortese, 34, who was there on her second visit, Dellatacoma his first. “We found Emmett’s on a recommendation from a friend that works in the area.”"
3536,"Cortese waited with camera phone in hand as waitress Kayla Curin carved into the pie. She raised the first slice high above the table, as long strings of mozzarella followed, before gently placing it on a plate. "
3537,"“It’s completely different from a New York slice of pizza — it’s thicker and heavier, which is why you need the fork and knife to eat it,” said Cortese, whose favorite pizza comes from Staten Island’s Pizzeria Giove. “It’s definitely a different way of eating pizza from what we are used to.”"
3538,"At the bar, Chicago native Blake Chana, 35, wielded his fork and knife. He has frequented Emmett’s since day one. Before it opened, the Clinton Hill resident once got his deep dish fix by mail-ordering pizza from Lou Malnati’s in Chicago. "
3539,"“Once Emmett’s opened and I tried it for the first time, I was ecstatic,” Chana said. “Never again did I need a pizza to board a plane and fly 800 miles for me to enjoy true deep dish. All I have to do now is walk a few blocks from my office to get a true authentic taste of Chicago.” "

3553,This could have been the original power lunch: A group of women gathered for a luncheon 150 years ago at Delmonico’s without the company of men.
3554,"This simple act, which took place on April 20, 1868, was both shocking and groundbreaking at the time."
3555,"“Generally, in the 19th century, women were not really allowed to be out and about unescorted,” said Valerie Paley, chief historian and director of the Center for Women’s History at the New-York Historical Society."
3556,"In some cases, women who walked around without a man ran the risk of being viewed as “fair game” or even a prostitute, she said."
3557,"But journalist Jane Cunningham Croly, angry she was prohibited from attending a dinner honoring Charles Dickens at the storied lower Manhattan restaurant the previous year, wanted to make a statement."
3558,"She brought members of her newly formed women’s club Sorosis to Delmonico’s and made it their regular hangout, holding monthly meetings at the restaurant."
3559,"“For Delmonico’s to make a stand about this was kind of important and revolutionary,” Paley said."

3562,"Delmonico’s is celebrating this historic moment with a special menu created by Gabrielle Hamilton, the James Beard Award-winning chef and owner of Prune, and an invitation-only event for women on Friday."
3563,"Hamilton’s a la carte menu, which includes dishes such as trout roe and soft-shell crab, will be available for lunch and dinner from April 23-27 and dinner only on April 28, with reservations recommended but not required."
3564,"“Probably 15 years ago, I came across the pretty famous photo of the women’s luncheon at Delmonico’s and have been jealous ever since that I couldn’t have attended in 1868,” Hamilton told amNewYork in an email. “How exciting that 150 years later, I get to cook the damn thing!”"
3565,This anniversary feels especially relevant with the rise of the #MeToo movement.
3566,"“I think up until recently, it seemed like a curiosity to some people who couldn’t believe there was a time when women were discriminated against and segregated,” Paley said. “And now we are living in a moment where we are revisiting those issues — how far we have come and how far we have not come.”"
3567,"Carin Sarafian, sales and marketing director at Delmonico’s, noted the restaurant’s progressive history as the first to allow women to dine unescorted with male chaperones and to employ a female cashier."
3568,"“This marks a huge anniversary, and it coincides with the #MeToo movement,” Sarafian said. “We don’t look at this as a political statement. It’s a celebration of women.”"
3569,"While men could dine anywhere they wanted at the time, women were mostly relegated to ice cream parlors, department store cafes and ladies-only sections of hotels."
3570,"Even the food they were served was different, Paley said."
3571,"“It’s interesting to even consider the fact that food itself had a [gender] inequality,” she said. “Women were presumed to eat little sandwiches, fruits and light soups. They were genteel and alcohol-free.”"
3572,"While the menu of that first luncheon is unknown, Sarafian said, Hamilton looked at dishes from the time to help craft her own."
3573,"“The original menus are comprised of classics, and classics are, fortunately, ‘evergreen,’” Hamilton said. “In some ways I would say it was mostly a matter of curating rather than translating — in other words, deciding which dishes, ingredients and preparations still today feel vital, relevant and, most importantly, delicious.”"
3574,"The first-course selections include beef bouillon with jellied consommé fortified with Madeira served hot and cold ($15), trout roe and shaved radish on a pumpernickel crouton with brown butter ($18) and malakoff (a cheese fritter) on a cornichons-parsley salad ($19)."
3575,The main course includes soft shell crab with asparagus and sauce Américaine ($38); a second entree is still being finalized. The dessert is brûléed rice pudding with strawberry meringue and macerated strawberries ($13).
3576,"Hamilton, who opened her popular East Village eatery nearly 20 years ago, said the women’s luncheon is an anniversary that should be recognized."
3577,"“Some hardworking and forward-thinking women pushed those doors open 150 years ago,” she said. “It feels important to me to continue to hold the doors open for those who come after you.”"

3625,"Di Palo's Fine Foods has been selling Italian cheeses and other products on the corner of Grand and Mott streets in Little Italy since 1925. How has the family done it? According to Lou Di Palo, it's because of the emphasis on the customer."
3626,"Di Palo explains this philosophy in his book ""Di Palo's Guide to the Essential Foods of Italy,"" which is out on Sept. 9."
3627,"""When your turn comes, you are the only customer in the world. You can ask as many questions as you want, sample as many things as you like. We take our time, we talk to you, we try to explain what it is you are seeing and tasting...We want you to go home with a little bit of what Italy is all about, what doing business in this store a hundred years ago was like."""
3628,"This reporter saw that kind of deliberate, personal service first hand. An interview with Di Palo was delayed by 15 minutes because of the high level of attention that was paid to customers in the store."
3629,"Di Palo didn't apologize, and that was fine. The store was so homey, so comfortable (there were even a few chairs), and the air so fragrant, there was little opportunity for displeasure."

3638,"Family and food: certainly two things that go together and make people happy. Di Palo says that's why the store has not only survived, but thrived, after all these years. Even as Little Italy shrinks and New York City changes, Di Palo's offers something that can't be found at just any grocer."
3639,"""Di Palo's Guide to the Essential Foods of Italy"" is not encyclopedic, it's a book of stories about food."
3640,"""It's about our life's work, [but also] how we went to Italy to reestablish our connections with the food,"" Di Palo said."
3641,"Each chapter is about a different Italian food item, from mozzarella to prosciutto to pasta to olive oil. But what makes each chapter interesting are the people that come to life in the descriptions and the rich histories that unfold. Like Di Palo's recalling of the first time he had prosciutto: he was in Calabria with his wife, and saw a waiter pushing a cart with a ""whole leg of beautiful cured ham, the fat as pink as the meat."""
3642,"He had to try it and after the waiter carved the thin slices for him, he reached for his fork."
3643,"""He wagged his finger at me,"" Di Palo wrote. ""He took a slice, and he held it across his face, breathing in deeply to take in its aroma, and then he ate it, right from his fingertips. And so I took his advice -- the aroma was unbelievable ... To this day whenever I eat a slice of really good prosciutto, I think of that moment."""
3644,"Memorable and emotional stories like this fill the pages, as does the history of Di Palo's: how Lou's grandfather Savino first opened the latteria (a dairy), how his parents met and joined the business and how he came to work there too, after making good money in real estate."
3645,"Di Palo, who lives in Bay Ridge with his family, says he wants readers to read the stories and understand the importance of knowing the producers of the food you eat."
3646,"""When you eat food that's made with a lot of passion and tradition behind it, it's always better,"" he said. ""I wanted to show the people that produce the products."""
3647,"Martin Scorsese wrote the foreword to the book, and clearly he feels similarly to Di Palo. Tradition, family, food - that's what's important. He explained a visit he made to Di Palo's after many years:"
3648,"""My life had changed in many ways too since I'd left, but when I walked into the store and saw Lou behind the counter, I was home."""

3687,Check out other schools' dining halls! 
3688,"Many meal plans offer guests swipes, so befriend a student at another school to swap a meal. The options at their school's dining hall may be equally lackluster, but a change in variety and scenery can make the meal more exciting. Manhattan School of Music has a piano in its dining hall and Columbia's JJ's place has a Jamba Juice machine!"

3720,"The father and daughter behind the coffee shop were driven by a desire for a canine-approved place to go with their dogs, Boris and Horton."
3721,"At this coffee shop, you don’t have to choose a cup over your pup."
3722,A “dog-friendly” coffee shop where customers are welcome to bring their pooches inside officially opens in the East Village Friday.
3723,"To be clear, Boris & Horton isn’t positioning itself as the canine-equivalent of a cat café; no dogs will live at the storefront at 195 Avenue A, the coffee joint’s website explains."
3724,"But the combination eatery and retail shop invites dog owners and enthusiasts to sip their City of Saints java, order off an all-vegetarian menu with gluten-free and vegan options, snack on dog-shaped sugar cookies and shop for puppy and human swag (like pet bandannas, leashes and baseballs caps) all in the company of man’s best friend. Boris & Horton also serves humans craft beer and wine in the evenings, and will host adoption events for home-seeking hounds on weekends."
3725,"“Another fun bonus is our dog photo booth, which will be stocked with costumes so guests can get some great shots alongside their dogs,” co-founder Logan Mikhly, 28, said."
3726,"Mikhly and her dad, Coppy Holzman, named their business after their respective dogs, one a pit bull mix (Boris), the other a terrier mutt (Horton). The father-and-daughter team wanted to open an indoor eatery where they could hang out with their pets without incurring health code fines from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, DNAinfo reported last year. (In March, dog lovers rejoiced when the Health Department relaxed its rules slightly, permitting restaurants to allow pups in outdoor dining areas under very specific conditions.)"
3727,"Technically, Mikhly explained, the agency sees Boris & Horton as two separate enterprises: a counter-service coffee shop adjacent to a pet retail store, each with its own entrance. A sign on the glass wall between them warns pups they aren't welcome in the café, but assures them ""it's not [their] fault."" (""Remember that time you saw that squirrel and it looked RIGHT at you?"" it continues. ""That was such a good day. Focus on that."")"
3728,"Human customers, however, are allowed walk between the door through a set of double doors in that wall. Solo visitors with dogs can place and pick up their orders from the cafe’s outdoor walk-up window before sitting down at a table on the retail side; groups can settle down at one of those tables first and then dispatch a representative to the indoor coffee shop counter, where they will claim the order when it’s ready; and fresh treats from the dog biscuit maker maison de pawZ are available for purchase on the retail side, in a “doggie bakery case.”"

3798,We asked Ansel why the Kitchen is a worthy pursuit.
3799,"""Certain pastries can be finessed over and sit out for a while. Others cannot. A chocolate mousse sitting in a fridge for a few hours will harden and turn dense compared to super light consistency of one where the ganache and whipped cream are folded fresh. Certain fruits darken when left out. So why not build a tart fresh to order with the fruits mascerated on the spot? Time is a big ingredient in all cooking.

3843,"Honey, they shrunk the dumplings."
3844,A mom-and-son dumpling shop in the East Village known for its Instagram-famous giant soup dumplings — so big they come with a straw to suck up all the savory broth — is now serving miniature pot stickers.
3845,"A foil to Drunken Dumpling’s bowl-sized “XL XLB” (or extra-large xiao long bao), the quarter-sized “XS” dumpling poppers come in servings of 10 to 12 in an American-style Chinese-takeout container. The delicate morsels are filled with an oyster sauce- and honey-infused blend of pork and scallions, fried in a pan and sprinkled with black sesame seeds, says Yuan Lee, who runs the tiny, 2-year-old restaurant with his mother, Qihui Guan, a former mathematics professor who proved her dumpling-making chops at Joe’s Shanghai."
3846,"“Normally you have to take multiple bites to get to the filling, but with this small dumpling, it’s just one bite of everything,” says Lee, 34, who cooks the pork while his mom rolls out and shapes the dumpling skins. “The flavor explodes in your mouth: You got the crunchy texture, you got the tenderness from the filing and the wrapper, and it’s a little bit semisweet.”"
3847,"Lee says the inspiration for the bite-sized dish came from the photographer and videographer behind the Instagram account BrunchBoys. During a photo shoot at Drunken Dumpling, Jeremy Jacobowitz suggested the restaurant try to make the opposite of its jumbo dumpling, Lee recalls."
3848,"“I really like popcorn, so I thought maybe I can make something small,” says Lee, who immigrated to the United States from China with his mother at age 18."
3849,He was so pleased with the result of his experiments that he jokingly told a friend he would order his mini dumplings instead of popcorn if they were sold at movie theaters.

3852,"“It’s like Chinese popcorn,” he said of the pot stickers that sell for $8.75 a container. “It’s a great summer food to pair with a beer.”"
3853,"As is the case with its enormous xiao long baos, Drunken Dumpling is restricting the number of orders of XS to about 35 a day, to keep the pressure off Guan, now 67."
3854,"“You have to have patience to make the small ones, because it’s not machine-pressed,” Lee says of her work. The dough must be rolled especially thin before tiny portions of filing are wrapped inside. The process takes a “lot more manpower” than traditional jiaozi, or pot stickers, and it can tire his mom out, he adds."
3855,"“Maintaining the quality instead of quantity is more important to us at this moment,” says Lee, who keeps MSG out of his kitchen and sources his pork from the same upstate livestock farm as Gramercy Tavern and Il Buco."
3856,"But Drunken Dumpling will have to increase production and hire more than the two staffers it currently employs if the restaurant opens a new location in Manhattan within the next few months, as Lee is currently planning to do."
3857,"“We want to be closer to our customers and to the people who have been supporting us for the past year and a half, almost two years now,” says Lee, who notes his 24-seat shop’s most loyal customers are traveling from the West Village and the Upper East Side."
3858,"Drunken Dumpling still welcomes plenty of tourists in search of the massive soup dumpling they have seen on their Instagram feeds, but it’s parents with an appreciation for the eatery’s farm-to-table aesthetic who frequently return with their kids. Working side-by-side with his mom on a daily basis, Lee can certainly relate to those customers."
3859,"Since 2016, he has developed a newfound respect for Guan, who transformed a holiday tradition of preparing jiaozi into a profession after arriving in the United States: “Making dumplings is a lot of work, because you’re repeatedly do the same thing over and over and over for 12 hours,” he says. “Also, being a parent in a different country other than the place you came from — it’s a lot of work.”"

3877,"You wrote the cookbook with Max Falkowitz, an executive digital editor of Saveur and long-time customer."
3878,"“She has kept me coming back because her food is so good, and she’s just an interesting, creative cook and she gets really loyal customers,” said Falkowitz, a Queens native who lives in Jackson Heights. “I am in awe every time that I talk with her. She’s constantly challenging herself to make something new.”"
3879,"Falkowitz spent time watching You make dumplings to understand her thought process, sense of vocabulary and how she manipulates the dough, to help translate that for home cooks. One thing he hopes comes across is the chef’s intuitiveness."
3880,"“She has such an effortless and intuitive understanding of how these ingredients come together,” Falkowitz said. “A jaw-dropping moment for me was when she was talking about the way she builds new flavors [and] thinks of everything in ratios. That’s just so natural to her, and it gave me this hope, if we can get people comfortable and get them to feel that same intuitiveness that she feels, then we’ve more than done our job. I think this book has the potential to demystify a lot of questions people have about Chinese food.”"
3881,"You hopes to further spread her love of dumplings with cooking classes, as well as an international dumpling festival at Dumpling Galaxy."
3882,"“We want [it to be like] the United Nations — Polish, Jewish, Indian, German, Argentinian dumplings,” she said. “That’s my next goal.”"
3883,"“Chinese cooks love winter squash,” Helen You writes in “The Dumpling Galaxy Cookbook.” “We usually stir-fry it, cook it into rice porridge (a favorite breakfast of mine) or mash it for crisp and chewy pancakes. But it’s also a happy partner to a pork dumpling filling.”"
3884,"This winter, warm up with her recipe for these pork and pumpkin dumplings."
3885, 
3886,Makes 24 dumplings
3887,"4 oz. pumpkin or butternut squash, peeled and grated (about 1⁄2 cup)"
3888,1 lb. ground pork
3889,2 tbsp. sherry cooking wine
3890,1 tbsp. freshly grated ginger
3891,2 tsp. soy sauce
3892,1⁄2 tsp. kosher salt
3893,24 pan-fried dumpling wrappers (see recipe)
3894,2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
3895,2 tbsp. white vinegar
3896,1 tsp. vegetable oil
3897, 
3898,"1. In a small microwave-safe bowl, cover the pumpkin with parchment paper and microwave for 30 seconds on high until the pumpkin softens but retains some crunch. (Alternatively, steam the pumpkin for 1 minute.) Set aside and let cool."
3899,"2. In a medium bowl, use your hands to combine the pork, pumpkin, wine, ginger, soy sauce and salt."
3900,"3. Make the dumpling wrappers (recipe below). Holding a wrapper in your palm, use a fork to add about 1 tbsp. of the filling to the center of the wrapper, then lightly pat down the filling with the fork to get rid of any air bubbles."
3901,"4. Fold the dumpling into a half-moon, pinching it shut with your thumbs and index fingers, then press the center of the dumpling while pulling on the corners to push out any air bubbles and shape into a curved crescent. Inspect the dumpling for any holes and pinch them shut. Repeat with the rest of the wrappers to make 24 dumplings."
3902,"5. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, vinegar and 1 cup of water until combined to make a slurry. Brush the oil in a medium cast-iron or nonstick skillet and heat over medium-high heat, until the oil starts to shimmer. Add six dumplings with the sealed edges lying flat in the pan, spacing them 1 inch apart, then slowly pour in just enough of the slurry to come one-third of the way up the dumplings."
3903,"6. Partially cover the pan, leaving a small gap for steam to escape. Increase the heat to high and cook for 2 minutes for cast iron (1 minute for nonstick). Lower the heat to medium for 2 minutes for cast iron (3 minutes for nonstick). Then lower the heat to low for 2 to 3 minutes for cast iron (3 minutes for nonstick)."
3904,"7. Cook until the water has evaporated, leaving a paper-thin disk of golden-brown starch on the bottom of the pan. Remove from the heat and slide a thin, flexible spatula around the rim of the pan to loosen the edges of the starch disk, then carefully slide the spatula underneath and flip the disk onto a plate in one piece, crispy side up. Serve immediately, then clean the skillet and repeat with the remaining dumplings."
3905, 
3906,Pan-fried dumpling dough
3907,Makes 24 wrappers
3908, 
3909,2 cups all-purpose flour
3910,1⁄8 tsp. kosher salt
3911,3⁄4 cup lukewarm water
3912,1 egg white
3913, 
3914,"1. MIX THE DOUGH. Add the flour to a wide mixing bowl and stir in the salt. Stir in the water and egg white with your fingers. The flour will look shaggy, like biscuit dough; as the dough comes together, run an open palm around the edge of the bowl and fold the flour into the center, spinning the bowl with your other hand as you go, until it all forms a rough clump. It’s fine if there are still pockets of dry flour."
3915,"2. KNEAD THE DOUGH. Coat your work surface with a fine dusting of flour and turn the dough out of the bowl. Dust your hands with flour and shape the dough into a fat log about the width of your hand. Knead the dough by pushing your hands and wrists into the log and rolling it forward. Then roll it back and push again. Repeat a few times until the log moves easily, adding more flour if it sticks, then spin the log 90 degrees, shape it into a horizontal log again, and knead a few more times, adding more flour if necessary. Use no more flour than you need to keep the dough from drying out."
3916,"As you knead, the dough will get firmer and tougher with a texture reminiscent of a gummy bear. It’s ready when it’s smooth to the touch, like the surface of a pearl, not tacky, with no cracks or pockets of dry flour. There may be some lumps. Put the dough back in your work bowl and cover it with a sheet of plastic wrap. Let it sleep for 15 to 30 minutes. While it relaxes, you can prepare your filling."
3917,"3. KNEAD AGAIN. Dust your work surface with a little more flour, then knead it as before. Work out all those lumps; after kneading about 10 times you should have satin-smooth dough that forms a clean ball you can easily push into, like the gel of a shoe insert."
3918,"4. PORTION THE DOUGH. Form your dough into a log, dust a dough scraper with a little flour, and cut the dough into four equal sections. Roll each section into a log and chop it into six pieces for a total of 24 balls of dough, each about an inch in diameter. Toss the balls with a light coating of flour and cover with a lightly moistened towel."
3919,"5. ROLL THE DOUGH INTO WRAPPERS. Gently smash the balls of dough into flat disks, then lightly roll an Asian-style rolling pin across them to flatten them out a bit more. Hold one disk by its edge and firmly but gently roll your pin from the diskas edge to its center. Roll the same edge a few more times, using more pressure at the edge than at the center. Use your other hand to turn the dough disk and reveal a new edge of the disk; roll again. Continue until all edges are rolled out and the wrapper is about 3 to 4 inches in diameter. Hold your rolled-out wrapper up to a light. If you can see through it faintly, your wrapper is ready to go. Otherwise, keep rolling. Roll the edges to half the thickness of the center of the wrappers."
3920,"As you get faster, you’ll notice that all your active hand needs to do is roll the pin back and forth while your other hand just rotates the wrapper. As long as your hands stay in these fixed motions, youall easily make even, round wrappers though they donat need to be perfectly uniform. Place freshly rolled wrappers under a lightly moistened towel to keep them from drying out."

3930,A guy takes you to a candy store on your first date. You think:
3931,"A) Wow, I want to work there one day."
3932,B) He’s really cute and meeting his parents on our first date is pretty cool.
3933,"C) Wow, I’d really love a chocolate bunny right now."
3934,D) All the above.
3935,"Well, the answer was D. In fact it was love at first bite for Skye and Mitchell Cohen, the third generation of husband-wife owners of Economy Candy, a New York City candy and chocolate mecca that’s been supplying Valentine’s Day surprises since 1937."
3936,"Mitchell Cohen, 32, met his wife Skye, 28, the old fashioned way: They were set up by a grandmother. Skye baby-sat a boy whose grandma lived across the street from Mitchell’s mother. Nana made the introductions."

3952,"What better way to start the Chinese New Year than with new food?
Eggloo, a new Hong Kong egg waffle spot, opened its doors at 61 Mulberry St. just past 11 a.m. on Monday. Teenagers out of school for the holiday crowded the narrow entryway, blaring Taylor Swift, and eagerly ordered matcha waffles griddled to order, stuffed with a plush scoop of homemade strawberry ice cream, topped with mochi, colorful cereal and more. At $8 for a stuffed waffle with two sweet toppings, this was a good use of Chinese New Year money, according to more than one customer.
Ice cream rolls and majestically massive milkshakes have both enjoyed their time in the spotlight: It's time for Hong Kong waffle cones.
Mike Tan, one of the co-founders of Eggloo, grew up just around the corner on Mott Street. He and his mom would stop by Chinatown's only egg waffle cart run by locally famous waffle-maker Cecilia Tan on hilly Mosco Street pretty much daily.
""One day, she didn't show up, and that was it,"" Tan said. He speculates she either made enough money or was just done making waffles, but the absence of his favorite treat ""left a void.""
Years later, Tan was walking down Canal Street with his friend David Lin, who works in finance, and reminiscing about his childhood egg waffles. They thought of all the fun flavors they could bring into the street food and began collaborating on a food business. Tan, who owns a doggy day care in Brooklyn with his mom, had no restaurant experience, and brought on friend Jessica Tam, who works at Momofuku as a wedding cakes specialist. Exactly the type of person you want in your Instagram-gold food business.
Over the summer, the three friends tested their creations at street fairs. The vendors got good reception from their customers, attracted to a street food not so common to New York, and perhaps even more intrigued by the Hong Kong waffles' Instagram-ability.
""People loved us on social media,"" Tan said.
And with a few hashtags of approval, the trio set out to start the brick-and-mortar Eggloo.
On the menu: three flavors of waffles, three homemade ice creams and a slew of colorful, sugary toppings. Warm and fluffy and sweet and summery in one bite, Eggloo's waffle ice cream creations are surprisingly perfect for the season, even amid a winter weather advisory. The steamy comfort of the waffle perfectly blankets that tease of summer, or spring break -- so close you can really taste it.
Eggloo is also experimenting with savory egg waffles, including one with Chinese sausage and another pizza-stuffed waffle. 
""We're planning to experiment a lot more,"" said Tan. 
Eggloo's grand opening is Saturday, Feb. 13, but for a sneak sample of waffle goodness, stop in on Feb. 8, when all orders are topped with a special fortune cookie!

4094,With five locations - and another on the way - Emily and Matthew Hyland felt the timing was right. 
4095,"

4096,"The couple behind the Brooklyn pizzeria Emily always imagined they’d write a cookbook when they were more established. With five locations and counting, the timing seems to be right."
4097,"“Emily: The Cookbook,” out Tuesday, shares recipes from Emily and Matthew Hyland’s Clinton Hill hot spot, which opened in 2014 and has since added an outpost in the West Village. It also features Detroit-style pizza from its Williamsburg spinoff, Emmy Squared, which now has additional locations in the East Village and Nashville."
4098,"There are favorites like The Colony, a round pie topped with pepperoni and pickled jalapeños; the signature Emily, with honey, pistachios and truffle cheese; Detroit-style square pies; and a whole chapter just for the Emmy Burger, which helped put them on the map."
4099,"“We wanted the recipes to stay true to what we do here and what our philosophy is,” says Matthew, the chef behind the restaurants. “Everything I cook is very personal. I try to draw from things from my childhood and places I’ve been.”"
4100,"That means ingredients inspired by comfort foods like Chinese and Indian takeout and delivery pizza, and dishes that pay homage to the couple’s favorite restaurants, like Modern Apizza and the Colony Grill in Connecticut. There are also pies, desserts and cocktails named after friends, family and regulars, like the Luca, a pie for Matthew’s mentor, Luca Arrigoni of Brooklyn’s Sottocasa."
4101,"“The stories of how all the pieces got their names — that’s been such an important part of the plotline,” Emily says. “That’s really close to my heart.”"
4102,The restaurants benefit from wood-fired ovens when making their round pies. But the cookbook is full of tips for home cooks using conventional ovens that don’t get as searingly hot. A classic trick for Matthew when making pies at home is to put the broiler on when the oven hits 550 degrees and to put the pie close to the broiler.

4105,"“It makes your own tiny pizza oven in your home oven,” he says."
4106,His other pro tip? Don’t overtop the pies.
4107,"“I think that’s a classic rookie mistake,” the chef says. “Don’t put too much cheese on. Don’t put too many pepperonis on. It will weigh down the pizza and make it hard to move. It just needs to be balanced. I love as much cheese as possible, but it doesn’t necessarily make for a better pizza.”"
4108,"Since bringing on a strategic partner to help open new locations and expand to Nashville, Matthew has been able to focus more on the culinary side of things, while Emily — a fixture at the front of the house when the restaurant Emily first opened — has been pursuing her yoga passion."
4109,"The couple also has yet another location in the works: a new grilled pizza concept, Violet, inspired in part by Rhode Island’s Al Forno, is slated to open by mid-November in the East Village."
4110,"“We’re opening an homage to Rhode Island — Emily and I met there, and we spent a lot of time eating the cuisine there,” Matthew says. “The recipes come from what I remember liking being young and how I want to interpret that into a restaurant dish.”"
4111,"More locations out of state may be in the works for the couple, and possibly new concepts."
4112,"“I always wanted to open a Tex-Mex place, like queso and fajitas,” Matthew says. “But that’s my next goal in a few years.”"
4113,"Though he may be known for his pizza and burger, Matthew Hyland’s favorite recipe in the cookbook is for Emily’s chicken wings."
4114,"“I love my wings,” the chef says. “The sauce — it’s a mix between Buffalo sauce and Korean wing sauce, so it’s vinegary, rich and spicy, sweet and it’s got a ton of sesame seeds in it. And we cover the wings in Pecorino. So I really like the flavor combination of all that. And they’re nice and crispy, too.”"
4115,Here’s the recipe:
4116,Makes 4-6 servings
4117,1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Line a large rimmed baking sheet (half-sheet pan) with parchment paper. (This helps keep the chicken wings from sticking to the pan and tearing the skin.)
4118,"2. Season the wings all over with the salt. Spread on the prepared pan, skin side up. Roast, turning the wings halfway during cooking, until they are golden brown and show no sign of pink when pierced at the elbow joint, 50 to 55 minutes. (If you wish, the chicken wings can be served at this point. Skip the next three steps.)"
4119,"3. Let the wings cool completely. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours or up to 1 day."
4120,"4. To serve, pour enough oil into a large, wide, and deep saucepan to come about 2 inches up the sides and heat over high heat to 365 degrees on a deep-frying thermometer. Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Place a large wire rack on a large rimmed baking sheet (half-sheet pan)."
4121,"5. In batches, taking care that the oil does not boil over, add the wings to the oil, and deep-fry until they are crisp and a shade darker, about 2 minutes. Using a wire spider or tongs, transfer the wings to the rack and keep warm in the oven until they have all been fried."
4122,"6. Put the wings into a large bowl and drizzle with the Nguyen sauce. Using kitchen tongs, toss the wings in the sauce, being sure not to break them apart. Transfer them to a platter. Sprinkle with the sesame seeds and Pecorino. Serve hot, with the sliced radishes and small bowls of the ranch dressing on the side for dipping."
4123,Makes about 1 cup
4124,"Whisk the sugar and vinegar together in a medium bowl to dissolve the sugar. Add the gochujang and whisk to combine. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic, sesame seeds and black sesame seeds and cook, stirring often, until the garlic is tender and fragrant but not browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add to the gochujang mixture and whisk to combine. The sauce and be covered and refrigerated for up to 1 day."
4125,Makes about 1 1/3 cups
4126,"Process the buttermilk, garlic, pepper, chives and mint together in a mini food processor or a blender until the herbs are minced and the mixture turns pale green. Scrape the herb mixture into a lidded container. Add the mayonnaise and whisk well. Season to taste with salt. Cover and refrigerate for up to 3 days."

4138,"
	  The menu at Emma's Torch is New American with global influences.       Photo Credit: Giada Randaccio Skouras Sweeny     "
4139,"From the front, Emma’s Torch looks pretty much like any other Brooklyn restaurant: whitewashed brick walls, wide windows, metal cafe chairs, long and narrow communal tables. But behind the scenes, everything is different."
4140,"Staffed by refugees learning professional kitchen skills in an accelerated in-restaurant program, the nonprofit restaurant is unlike any other in America."
4141,"Started last year with a brunch-only pop-up in Red Hook, Emma’s Torch relocated to a permanent home in Carroll Gardens in May, where it's open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday and weekend brunch."
4142,"In the kitchen, a cohort of five students hailing from across the globe (Haiti, Vietnam, Syria, Afghanistan, Honduras and beyond) learns restaurant and culinary skills that, in eight weeks, will prepare them to cook in New York City kitchens."
4143,Founder Kerry Brodie had the idea for the concept while working in public policy in Washington D.C.
4144,"“I kept thinking about how someone should do this, and my husband finally said that someone should be me,” Brodie recalls."
4145,"So she quit her job in May 2016, enrolled in the Institute of Culinary Education and started building a community of supporters, including Rachael Ray and Roland Foods, to get her nonprofit off the ground."
4146,"“Food creates conversations and builds bridges between people,” Brodie says of her motivation to pursue Emma’s Torch, named after New York writer — and the Statue of Liberty’s inscription poet — Emma Lazarus."
4147,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
4148,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4149,"Emma’s Torch brings on a new group of five students each month. Culinary director Alexander Harris’ primary goal is to “teach independence” and familiarize students with the vocabulary and movements of a working kitchen, like an apprenticeship."
4150,"“Working in the culinary industry is all about repetition and muscle memory,” he says."
4151,"He’s not hovering over students to make sure they execute perfect knife skills, but rather encouraging them to make mistakes and repeat, repeat, repeat until the language and motion of restaurant cooking is truly internalized."
4152,"After a one-week orientation followed by two weeks of vigorous culinary lessons, students are ready to start working brunch or dinner service one day a week. Like any restaurant kitchen, Emma’s Torch works to minimize food waste, so intro-choppers may be cutting ingredients to be used in a sauce, while those with “more prescient knife skills will chop for a composed salad,” Kerry explains. By the second month, students work restaurant service full-time, and a new class comes in to start the program."
4153,"“It can be overwhelming,” Harris says of the accelerated program."
4154,"The seasonally changing menu is all based on learning techniques necessary for a professional kitchen job. A fall chicken confit teaches students how to cure and confit, and shaved and charred beets tucked into a swoop of hummus is all about using a vegetable in three different ways."
4155,"The menu is New American — which Harris, a Union Square Hospitality Group alum, is very familiar with — but the dishes are influenced by the students from around the globe. Ras el hanout, a North African spice, Aleppo chili from Syria and tahini from the Middle East “make the menu and environment a little more familiar,” Harris says."
4156,"Brodie says the restaurant’s success, of course, is based on the job placement of graduates, and the program has seen alums go on to work at The Dutch, SoHo House, Houseman and other renowned New York kitchens."
4157,"And like any restaurant, it’s also dependent on customers, many of whom have become regulars in the months since the Carroll Gardens opening and are selling out Emma Torch's monthly graduation dinners."
4158,"“Our guests keep coming back and our students are doing phenomenally well,” she says."

4164,Founder Tiffany Hall hopes her story “empowers women to follow their own dreams.”
4165,"
	  Tiffany Hall left behind a legal career to found Empower Cocktails, a ready-to-drink beverage company that aims to be inclusive of female consumers.       Photo Credit: Empower Cocktails     "
4166,"Empower Cocktails, a ready-to-drink NYC-based beverage company, focuses on empowering and celebrating women through its branding, marketing and charity partnerships, a mission that has become painfully relevant in a post-#MeToo world."
4167,"Following a successful career in what she considered to be a male-dominated marketplace, Tiffany Hall, New York lawyer-turned-entrepreneur, decided that if no one else was going to make the distilled beverage industry inclusive of women, she would. She left her legal job at big industry player Pernod Ricard, and soon after beginning a new role at a corporate law firm, founded Empower Cocktails."
4168,"“I saw so many different target consumers and not a lot for women,” Hall said of her time at Pernod. “The idea for us was to create something for women as the preferred group.”"
4169,"Before working in the alcoholic beverage industry, Hall held several jobs in marketing, at various advertising firms and an auction house, so she felt well-versed on the branding side of the business, in addition to the legal."
4170,"“I had experience in the liquor world, and I felt it was within my realm,” she said."
4171,"“The wine and spirits industry is very unique,” Hall said. “It’s really fun, but it’s also a great place to see how to market to different consumers.”"
4172,"With no prior experience in manufacturing or production, Hall set about building Empower Cocktails with a launch date of late 2015. She quickly learned that “every little piece counts—from cap to bottle.”"
4173,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
4174,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4175,She funded the new business entirely on her own. Her legal background proved invaluable when it came time to maneuver through the thicket of regulations that govern the alcohol industry.
4176,"Hall’s mission of female empowerment was not an obvious translation to the company’s branding. While she wanted to celebrate women with the bottle and product, she did not want to isolate male consumers or fall victim to any stereotypes of what women seek."
4177,"“We wanted to do something different,” said Hall. “It was all about attention to detail, and we wanted the cocktail to be great inside and outside the bottle.”"
4178,"She decided on a “hefty but attractive” glass bottle that features a prominent inky, pink “w” on its white label."
4179,"“I wanted it to be nice enough to display on a shelf after you’ve finished it,” the founder said of the 750ml bottle, which retails from $20.99 to $25.99."
4180,"When it came to choosing the actual liquor for Empower, Hall knew she wanted to do something untraditional that would give customers another option when buying booze. “I wanted to use a sweet potato vodka that was produced in the United States,” Hall said, noting that most vodka is made from wheat or rye."
4181,"In her search for such a producer, Hall came across a family-owned sweet potato farm in northern California. After learning more about the farm from afar, the Empower CEO decided to go across the country to pay a visit."
4182,"“I had no idea who they were,” said Hall, whose family and friends were rather skeptical about her journey. “I even remember my mother asking me to call her once I’d arrived so she’d know I was safe!” she said."
4183,"After arriving to the farm, situated an hour outside of Fresno, Hall knew she had found the right producer and has been working with them ever since."
4184,"Determining which cocktail would be Empower’s first, however, was not so easy. “When dealing with a new brand, you want an easy, familiar point of entry,” Hall said."
4185,"After a good amount of field research and some help from family and friends, the classic Cosmopolitan was the clear direction to go, she said."
4186,"Empower debuted its first cocktail, the “Cosmopolitan Martini,” nearly three years ago and has welcomed resulting growth in both its sales and reputation."
4187,"When the brand first launched, Empower was sold only in select New York and Connecticut stores. The “Cosmopolitan Martini” is now stocked in 30 stores across five states and was recently featured in the MTV Video Music Awards gift bag."
4188,"Hall hopes that Empower will soon be available nationally, especially as it launches additional cocktails, and her friends and family are working diligently to help her meet this goal."
4189,"“I think my mom is my best salesperson,” she said, noting how proud and supportive her parents are of the company."
4190,"At the core of Empower’s message is helping women, so it seemed only natural that the brand would partner with various nonprofit organizations that focus on women’s initiatives."
4191,"Empower has worked with the Voss Foundation, Dress for Success Boston, Kicked it in Heels and the Metro-Manhattan Community Foundation over the last few years and plans to expand that list in the future."
4192,"“Early on, it’s been monetary support and product supply for their events, but as we grow, I’d like to help create each organization’s programs as well,” said Hall."
4193,"Empower’s mission seems perhaps more timely than ever, in the near year since the #MeToo movement began, and Hall said she could not be happier to be a part of such an important point in women’s history."
4194,"“I launched before this wave of women’s empowerment began,” she said, “but I think women should always be vocal and have their voices heard. I’m happy to finally see a forum for it.”"
4195,"Although Hall built Empower Cocktails after noticing a dearth of female-driven beverages while working for Pernod, many of the big players in the liquor business have since caught up."
4196,"“I think we are more aware as an industry and starting to see a positive change in the spirits industry in terms of gender balance,” said Paula Glickenhaus, vice president & Women in Leadership global lead for Bacardi."
4197,She believes balanced marketing lies first and foremost within balanced employment.
4198,"“At Bacardi, we want to make sure our employee make-up reflects the markets and consumers we serve,” said Glickenhaus. “In the U.S. alone, women make up half of all spirits drinkers and account for one third of the volume…so the gender balance not only makes business sense, but successful marketing of spirits today is dependent upon appealing equally to women and men.”"
4199,"Bacardi has launched a number of in-house initiatives—including Spirit Forward, which celebrates outstanding individuals in the trade, and Women in Leadership, which focuses on female leadership within the company—to combat the “man-centric” reputation of the industry."
4200,"Diageo, another leader in the alcoholic beverage world, boasts similar gender parity. Earlier this year, the company announced that 40 percent of its executive committee is now composed of women. Its recent introduction of Johnnie Walker Black Label: The Jane Walker Edition donates $1 for every bottle made to organizations that champion women’s causes."
4201,"Despite industry progress, though, Empower Cocktails remains one of only a few liquor brands targeted entirely to a female audience, and many women identify not only with the company’s mission but with Hall as well."
4202,"“I hope that my story empowers women to follow their own dreams,” Hall said."

4305,"Step into Oiji (closed Monday, 119 First Ave., 646-767-9050) and it might remind you of many new restaurants these days, from the exposed wood interior to the Edison bulbs, communal table and sparse decoration. But it's what comes from the tiny back kitchen that sets Oiji apart. Together, chefs Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku of Gramercy Tavern and Bouley, respectively, offer refined, clean takes on authentic Korean cuisine. Everything is pristine; everything is beautiful. And almost everything is under $20."
4306,"Plates at Oiji are small and shareable, each deeply flavored with Korean ingredients. But the chefs use their French backgrounds to add richness in dishes like the jang-jo-rim ($10), butter-soaked rice with a soft-boiled egg, and the honey butter chips ($5) that are sweet, fatty and addicting."
4307,"You'll also notice the refined French technique in the chefs' plating. The beef tartare ($16), for example, is gently mixed in a pickled ramp aioli and topped artfully with dots of mustard seeds, pickled melon, edible flowers and an egg yolk that has been cooked sous-vide until rich and gelled. It's a dish I'd expect at any of the finest restaurants in NYC (and still under $20)."
4308,"The mackerel ($14) is another win, mostly for its presentation. It's served with a tiny broom of pine needles for brushing on a soy-based sauce. I may have preferred it for breakfast on a bagel, but it was playful and a good conversation topic with my date."
4309,"I could also probably eat the cold buckwheat noodles ($10) every day. Served in a flavor-packed broth, they were slick and chewy and the preserved ramps added a delicious crunch. Ditto to the fried chicken ($13) -- a must in NYC these days -- which had the lightest, most flavorful batter I've had in a long time."
4310,"Lastly, the homemade tofu ($7) was modest -- the tiny spongy curds served in a bowl as is -- but it was strangely comforting without anything to overpower the subtle flavor of tofu made just right."

"
4321,"It’s Friday night and dozens of people are hanging out in a Sunset Park warehouse where, not long ago, abandoned railroad tracks ran through the middle of the ghost of a steel manufacturing plant. The exposed brick walls and heavy timber beams hold up ceilings where the skylights used to be fenced in with razor wire, an attempt to minimize burglaries at the old factory."
4322,"But these days, there’s beer here."
4323,"Five Boroughs Brewing Co. joined the industrial block on 47th Street near the water last summer, opening a streetfront taproom and 12,500-square-foot production facility offering a rotating selection of 16 different brews on tap."
4324,"The pet-friendly brewery offers live music and board games, and is attracting beer lovers like Ryan Schneider, 37, a former New Yorker who makes monthly trips to grab a few brews and fly them back to Florida."
4325,"“Their beers are pretty solid,” the software educator who journeyed to Brooklyn to sample a flight, said. The imperial stout, he noted, had “great body and good flavor.”"
4326,"Brew master Nick Griffin and “a lot of different people from a lot of different backgrounds with a lot of different skill sets” are making Five Boroughs Brewing Co. a premier destination, according to co-founders Blake Tomnitz, 28, and Kevin O’Donnell, 35."
4327,"The two friends, who started brewing together on a 15-gallon MoreBeer home-brew system before leaving jobs in the corporate world, set out to discover the answer, “What is New York City’s beer?”"
4328,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
4329,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4330,"“No one really had a straight answer,” said Tomnitz, who started as an amateur brewer while studying at Boston College’s Carroll School of Management. His dorm room equipment was confiscated."
4331,"“For us, it was developing a concept where it didn’t matter what borough you’re from, what neighborhood you’re from, if it was your first craft beer or you’re a craft beer connoisseur,” said Tomnitz, whose 6-year-old dachshund mix Tater sometimes accompanies him to work. “This is your brewery, and this is your beer.”"
4332,"In the taproom, those beers translate to four “year-round core beers,” Tomnitz said, and 12 that rotate every three to four weeks, “depending on both the style of beer and associated demand.”"
4333,"The staple beers are a West Coast-style IPA, Czech-inspired pilsner, gose and hoppy lager."
4334,"And, aiming to design brews “so that there was something for everyone, no matter their flavor preferences or palate,” other varieties have included double and triple IPAs and a low-alcohol, cherry-plum gose. The aforementioned imperial stout, made with a blend of nine different malts, is a strong one, at 12 percent ABV."
4335,"Hoping to produce 4,000 barrels total in its first year, Tomnitz said that Five Boroughs has the “unique ability to be a big production facility but keep a hyperlocal mentality.”"
4336,"The day we visited, Griffin could be seen — through giant picture windows in the taproom — brewing Helles, a traditional German pale lager."
4337,"Five Boroughs Brewing Co.’s beers are available in the taproom via sampler flights, pints or to-go growlers. Or, if you can’t make it to Sunset Park (just blocks from the R stop at 45th Street), Five Boroughs beers are served at restaurants and bars across the city — more than 300 currently, Tomnitz said — including Blind Tiger in Greenwich Village and Bronx Alehouse. Since opening on Aug. 5, over 600 places in the city have sold Five Boroughs on tap. Tomnitz noted that a grand total of 250,000 pints have been crafted to date."
4338,"They’re the new kids on the block who quickly turned into an integral part of the growing craft brew scene. Joining with eight other NYC breweries that opened last year, Five Boroughs is hosting a “Class of 2017 Release Party” on Feb. 22 from 4 to 10 p.m."
4339,"It’s your first opportunity to try collaborative NYC Style Pale Ale, which was planned, brewed and canned by the brewers and owners of nine of NYC’s 30 breweries."

4349,"Ceviches and crudos, flavorful raw fish medleys from Latin America and Italy respectively, are having a moment in NYC eateries, giving many restaurants serving underwhelming sushi and sashimi a run for their money."
4350,Market research group Datassential MenuTrends reports that ceviches and crudos are appearing more and more on restaurant menus in the northeast -- with New York representing the largest share of restaurants in that region. Ceviche is up 26% from 2009 and crudo by 150% in the same time. What gives?
4351,"For Peter Gevrekis, operating partner at Desnuda, an East Village cevicheria that recently opened a second location in South Williamsburg, it's a question of exposure. With demand rising among consumers, chefs are taking note and obliging restaurant goers. But that hasn't always been the case."
4352,"""Japanese had been done for so many years, and nobody was doing something like this,"" he said. ""It took about a year and a half before we got really busy."""
4353,"Eventually business picked up, and now hungry New Yorkers are dropping in to the South 1st Street location for coconut milk-marinated lobster ceviche, and yellow fin tuna tiradito (like Peruvian crudo) with a shishito yuzu truffle glaze."

4361,"""Other than Japanese restaurants, there was really nobody doing anything like that in America,"" he said."
4362,"So he took a chance, and years later, crudo is emblematic of Esca's uncomplicated and refined fare, with dishes like Alfonsino Snapper dressed with Meyer lemon-pressed olive oil. When asked why crudo and ceviche have experienced such popularity in the last few years -- and more recently at new hot spots like ZZ's Clam Bar -- Pasternack quipped, ""I try to set the trends, not follow them."" And with nearly 15 years at Esca under his belt, it seems good taste is always on trend."

4457,"With TV networks, streaming channels and shows like “Ugly Delicious” and “Chef’s Table,” it’s difficult to imagine there was ever a time when food was not a staple of the big (and small) screen. But just 11 years ago, after making the documentary “Hamburger America,” George Motz was shocked to find that there were no real avenues for screening food films."
4458,"“I was constantly being grouped with the same few people making movies about food,” says Motz, “so I figured we could show them all together and actually serve some of the food being shown on the screen.”"
4459,"And with that, Food Film Festival was born."
4460,"“We realized we created this new, multisensory kind of experience,” the festival director and co-founder said. However, it was not until Motz’s buddy Seth Unger, a third-generation event producer, came on board that the event grew to the next level. He joined the team in 2009 and told his friend, “I love this idea, but you’re doing it all wrong.” Unger harvested his years in the music business and working for Mayor Michael Bloomberg at City Hall and helped turn the Food Film Fest into the internationally recognized event that it is today."
4461,"Now in its 12th year, the festival takes place over five days and draws audiences from all over the world."
4462,"“One thing we realized a few years back is that this festival is for everyone,” says Unger. “Literally. If you eat food, you will enjoy this.” Because of this mass appeal, the event has developed quite a sizable following, and some attendees even purchase tickets before any real details are announced."
4463,"In addition to the festival’s usual loyal audience, though, this year’s premiere of one of the final episodes of “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown,” in the wake of the CNN host’s untimely death in June, has attracted a slew of new attendees. The episode’s focus is on Manhattan’s Lower East Side and features appearances from some of the neighborhood’s most famous characters from the music, film and art scenes, as they accompany Bourdain to legendary joints like Ray’s Candy Store and Max Fish bar."

4465,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4466,"“We’ve had an ongoing partnership with CNN Original Series and ‘Parts Unknown’ for the past few years,” says Unger. “We started discussing this event almost a year ago, but given the turn of events, we weren’t sure how things would proceed . . . if at all,” the event producer says. “But after some hard thinking, everyone agreed that the show must go on. We believe that’s what Tony would’ve wanted.”"
4467,"Unlike the other festival premieres, which will take place at the 325-person AMC Empire 25 theater in Times Square, the Lower East Side “Parts Unknown” episode will be shown in the neighborhood. Bourdain grew up in the city and spent a considerable portion of his youth on the Lower East Side, so “having the grand canon of his work end where it essentially began, in New York City, his hometown, is powerful,” says Unger."
4468,"The episode was shot shortly before the CNN documentarian’s death and features meals with famed punk music executive Danny Fields, former Cro-Mags bassist and author Harley Flanagan, and filmmakers Jim Jarmusch and Amos Poe, among others."
4469,"Flanagan, who was 11 years Bourdain’s junior, actually crossed paths with the celebrity chef in the late 1970s and early ’80s, when the two frequented the clubs and bars of the Lower East Side, brushing shoulders with Andy Warhol, Johnny Thunders and the like. Decades later, the Cro-Mags bassist spotted Bourdain’s familiar face at a 2014 mixed martial arts event and soon began teaching his daughter MMA."
4470,"“Although I didn’t really know him back in the ’70s, we shared a lot of experiences on the Lower East Side,” says Flanagan. “Part of our bond was all of our common ground — about the LES, about music, all that.”"
4471,"Bourdain mentioned the Lower East Side episode of “Parts Unknown” to the musician months before it began production, and declared to his friend, “it’s going to feature you.”"
4472,"When the time came to shoot the episode, the CNN host left it to Flanagan to select the gastronomic venue, and the pair wound up at Ray’s Candy Store, where they drank egg creams and reminisced about their younger days in the neighborhood. After their nostalgic treat, he and Bourdain walked through the area, passing the building that Flanagan grew up in, where his neighbors included poet Allen Ginsberg, artist Carsten Höller, and “all the artists, gays, and punk rock people.”"
4473,"“It’s really bittersweet,” says Flanagan. “On the one hand, I’m really honored to be in the episode, and on the other, it makes me really sad.”"
4474,"The musician and author of “Hard Core: Life of My Own” was not only a friend of Bourdain's but also one of his most ardent admirers. “I really do think he was one of the last greats,” says Flanagan, comparing the documentarian to early 20th-century writers whose vivid descriptions of their travels “could take you there."
4475,"“I really liked him, and I really miss him,” he says of Bourdain, who died by suicide a month or so after they filmed the episode. “But the whole thing is coming full circle — he’s ending his journey right where he started it.”"
4476,"The Lower East Side episode of “Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown"" will be shown at the Angel Orensanz Foundation, a converted synagogue on the neighborhood’s Norfolk Street. All proceeds from the event will go to the Bronx Letters Foundation, an educational charity Bourdain passionately supported."
4477,"The 12th annual Food Film Festival will also feature showings focused on brunch, barbecue and New York’s food scene. Each event will serve attendees corresponding foods during the films, so there’s definitely no need for dinner reservations before or after the shows. The festival will run from Oct. 24 to 28, and tickets can be purchased at thefoodfilmfestival.com."

4483,"Honestly, we can’t decide if this futuristic food hall will make busy New Yorkers less anti-social, or more."
4484,"
	  A new ""virtual"" food hall in the Financial District will guide visitors to place their orders from five different menus at one self-service kiosk.       Photo Credit: Sous Vide Kitchen     "
4485,"Anyone who works in a Manhattan office struggles with the same lunchtime predicament: What do I want to eat? Do I actually have time to leave the building and soak up some sunshine or should I order in? Is there a place to enjoy my meal that isn’t sitting at my desk, alone?"
4486,"A new food hall opening in the Flatiron District next week aims to answer those questions with five different fast-casual concepts under the same roof and cashless, self-service kiosks. Calling itself “New York’s first virtual food hall,” Sous Vide Kitchen follows an increasing trend of briskly-paced, automated dining in the city, where busy employees frequently use online services like Seamless and GrubHub and apps like UberEats and MealPal to order their lunches for pick-up or delivery."
4487,"Sous Vide Kitchen grounds four brands previously limited to delivery and catering in one kitchen at 119 E. 23rd St., alongside the Vietnamese sandwich and noodle vendor BONMi NYC Kitchen. (The same food and beverage consulting firm, JBH Advisory Group, created all five, and the name “sous vide” refers to a method they all use to prepare some ingredients, by sealing them in an airtight container, then cooking them slowly in water at at constant, warm temperature.)"
4488,"But while customers will, for the first time, watch servers assemble brisket sandwiches from Pulled & Chopped BBQ, greens and grain bowls from Sous Vide Kitchen, feta- and pita-topped salads from Mediterranean Pure Foods and chicken and rice and beans platters from Eso Latin, they will place their orders and pay for them pretty much the same way they would at the office — with a screen and a credit card. A text message will alert them when their food is ready."
4489,"Sous Vide Kitchen’s cashless, automated system will speed up food prep and service, while minimizing human interaction at the counter, JBH project manager Jonathan Falcon says."
4490,"He adds that it should also solve a problem company employees have at traditional, multi-vendor food halls."
4491,"“If we wanted to enjoy different meals, we ended up waiting in different lines, receiving our meals at different times and not necessarily enjoying our lunch together,” he says. “If we wanted one item from several of the vendors at a food hall, we would have to wait in different lines.”"
4492,"Falcon says that at the new food hall, however, a self-order kiosk system allows customers to mix and match a fire-roasted street corn salad with a spicy lamb baba ganoush bowl, and order on the same line as their friends."

4494,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4495,"All of that proves “better for a group atmosphere,” Falcon says, noting that Sous Vide Kitchen’s 2,600-square-foot space will offer visitors 60 seats at small tables, countertops and high communal tables. (To us, the model resembles the corporate cafeterias of yore, where diners could order pizza, sandwiches and salads at different counters, and pay for them all at one register.)"
4496,"But JBH’s experiment may raise more questions than it can answer: If a worker bee is really pressed for time and looking for convenience, why wouldn’t she place her order via Seamless or Grubhub for delivery? "
4497,"Because “people like to get out of the office for 30 minutes,” says Falcon."
4498,"Then why wouldn’t she order her meal online, or via an app like MealPal, so it’s ready for pick-up when she arrives?"
4499,"Customers really in a rush can purchase pre-packed “grab-and-go” items from a cooler, Falcon offers."
4500,"And do humans so intensely desire limiting their interactions with strangers that they would choose to interface with yet another screen, rather than a new face, during their workday? The project manager says JBH’s own research answers in the affirmative."
4501,"Sous Vide Kitchen rides on a wave of quick-service restaurants experimenting with cashless, self-serve kiosks to varying degrees of success, including burger chain Shake Shack, quinoa bowl automat Eatsa and fast-food giant McDonalds. One undeniable advantage for companies is the reduction of labor costs. "
4502,"A parallel can also be drawn between JBH’s decision to pivot its food brands from delivery and catering to a brick-and-mortar location and Amazon’s strategy to open bookstores in cities like Seattle, Chicago and New York City. "
4503,"Sous Vide Kitchen will operate daily for lunch and dinner from 11 a.m. to 9:30 p.m., starting June 27."

4514,"Joining those three for the food court’s first week in business are the Greenpoint-based cafe Champion Coffee, vegan Mexican street food spot JaJaJa, pastry chef Fany Gerson’s Mexican frozen treat and sweet shop La Newyorkina, the microgreen salad bar Harvest 2 Order and GoFish Sushi Box, a grab-and-go roll and sashimi counter."
4515,"The food hall’s biggest stars — the beloved Midwood pizzeria Di Fara and Greenwich tavern and burger joint Corner Bistro — don’t move in until June 4. Week two also introduces Slovak dumplings from Baba’s Pierogi, lobster rolls from Lobster Joint, ramen from Chuko and a new concept from Nicole Ponseca of Maharlika and Jeepney.

MRKTPL also is working on another food hall at Staten Island’s forthcoming Empire Outlets, set to open in late 2018."
4518,"The city’s food hall frenzy sees no sign of slowing down, with companies like Gotham Hospitality and Urbanspace opening multiple locations to feed New Yorkers seeking convenient, affordable dining options in Manhattan and Brooklyn.

4530,"Not too stuffed with Thanksgiving pie? Of course not! Celebrate the beginning of December with a slice of New York's best pie (and we don't mean pizza). Treat your sweet tooth with a slice from Four & Twenty Blackbirds, black bottom pecan pie from Magnolia Bakery or maybe even try your hand at making Bouchon Bakery's simple pumpkin pie. "
4531,"A day that celebrates fried food! Perfect. For some Spanish flare, stop by Greenpoint's El Born for spinach, chicken and ham ""croquetes"" or grab a sweet banana fritter at the British A Salt & Battery. And if you still have Thanksgiving leftovers -- just fry them up into a fritter! "
4532,"As if every day during the holiday season isn't National Cookie Day, be sure to celebrate this Thursday. Grab a massive warm and gooey chocolate chip cookie from Levain Bakery or opt for a crispier, flat chocolate chip cookie at City Bakery. If you're up for a project, try making your own fortune cookies! "
4533,"If there was ever a day for a mac and cheese sandwich, it's today! Chow down on American classics at Bubby's or fill up on old school Jewish fare at 2nd Avenue Deli. If you're up for it, try making Chef Michael's Mac Lobsta', served piping hot at the restaurant everyday.  "
4534,"When you're forced to use your oven for extra storage, a microwave may be a New Yorker's favorite appliance. Celebrate this special day with frozen gourmet foods from Babeth's Feast or perhaps pick up reheatable eats from tasty counters at Fairway, Zabar's or pre-picked ingredients from Good Eggs.  
"
4535,"Today is meant for a food made from one single ingredient: sugar. Grab a freshly spun cone of cotton candy at Handsome Dan's in all-natural flavors like Peppermint, Earl Grey, Cherry and more!
"
4536,"For the ultimate in NYC brownies, stop into Baked for their signature salted caramel brownies. "
4537,A holiday that can be celebrated from the moment you wake up! Perhaps set your alarm extra early to wait for a Cronut at Dominique Ansel (or just stop in at a regular time for a gingerbread croissant) or grab a light Parisian pastry from Caprices by Sophie or a French treat from Ladurée.  
4538,There's perhaps only one good way to celebrate this holiday in NYC: with Brooklyn Lager! Stop by The Brooklyn Brewery to get it on tap or pick up a six pack (or freshly filled growler) at your local beer store. 
4539,"Grab a hot mug of cocoa today! Stop into City Bakery, Maman's or Jacques Torres for some of NYC's best hot cocoa or make your own, spiked, with our boozy hot cocoa recipes. "
4540,"For biscuits and gravy cravings, head straight to Williamsburg's egg, where fluffy homemade biscuits with sausage or mushroom gravy is served all day long! "
4541,"It seems like National Cupcake Day hasn't stopped since 2011, but you can still celebrate today! Stop into New York originals Magnolia Bakery, Baked by Melissa or Little Cupcake Bakeshop for a cupcake today, or celebrate imported cupcake chains like California's Sprinkles (home of the cupcake ATM!) or D.C.'s Georgetown Cupcake. "
4542,"Dip anything you want into chocolate today! Stop by one of ROYCE's NYC locations to try their 'Potatochip Chocolate,' made from salty potato chips and rich milk chocolate for the optimum crunchy combination. The Upper West Side's Baconery  also sells a crispy, salty chocolate covered treat: chocolate covered bacon!"
4543,"Prep for that Christmas ham with doay's national slow-roasted baby pig day. You can pre-order a whole pig from The Breslin or The Spotted Pig (Chef April Bloomfield of 'A Girl and Her Pig' knows how to do it!) or opt for a smaller portion at Hearth, La Vara or ABC Kitchen."
4544,"Stock up on candies to celebrate this special day! Economy Candy will be your one-stop shop for all things sweet, vintage and totally bizarre. "
4545,"There are so many tasty variations on today's special dish! Opt for Italian fritto misto at Galli, try some crispy fried shrimp puffs at Golden Unicorn, dig into rock shrimp tempura at Haru or dare to go to Times Square for a good old basket of fried shrimp at Bubba Gump Shrimp Co-- hey, you know you've always wanted an excused to stop in, especially during prime tourist season! "
4546,"The first official day of winter also brings a great day to celebrate the burger. Feast on a New York favorite like Shake Shack's Shack Burger, wait in line at Burger Joint, try an elk burger from Bareburger or a gourmet burger at DBGB. "
4547,"Of course the day before Christmas celebrates this sweet, creamy drink. Celebrate in style with an egg nog cocktail at Murray Hill holiday haven Rolfs or grab a pint of local Ronnybrook Farms egg nog at Chelsea Market. "
4548,"As if we had to give you ideas on how to celebrate this one, we suggest visiting one of New York's premium chocolatiers. Visit Mast Brothers Chocolate Factory, Jacques Torres 
 or Rakka Chocolate for your chocolatey day. To feast on chocolate, head to Max Brenner for a totally chocolate-centric meal.  "

4609, 
4610,Ingredients:
4611,2?3 cup (134 grams) sugar
4612,1 tablespoon (14 grams) unsalted butter
4613,4 medium (680 grams) Granny Smith apples
4614,"1 sheet (1?2 of a 171?4-ounce package) frozen puff pastry, thawed"
4615,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
4616,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
4617, 
4618,Method:
4619,1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Arrange four 3 × 2-inch-high aluminum foil or metal molds on a baking sheet.
4620,2. Combine the sugar with 3 tablespoons (44 grams) water in a
4621,"medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar is dissolved. Wash down the sides of the pan with a wet pastry brush. Boil without stirring until the caramel reaches a golden amber color. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter (stand back as the caramel will bubble up and may splatter)."
4622,3. Divide the hot caramel among the molds (there should be about 1?4 inch of caramel on the bottom of each mold). Allow the caramel to cool to room temperature.
4623,"4. Peel and core the apples. Slice off the bottom of each apple so that it stands upright. Cut each apple into 10 wedges, keeping the apple slices together. “Reassemble” the slices of 1 apple in each mold, with the bottom of the apple against the caramel. Bake the apples for 55 minutes, or until they are soft but not mushy. Remove the baking sheet from the oven and set the apples aside while you bake the pastry."
4624,"5. Increase the oven temperature to 400°F. On a floured surface, roll the puff pastry sheet out to a 1?8-inch thickness. Using a biscuit cutter, cut out four 31?4-inch rounds from the puff pastry. Place the rounds on a parchment-lined baking sheet and prick them well with a fork. Bake the rounds for 12 to 15 minutes, until puffed and golden brown. Set aside in warm place. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F."
4625,"6. Push the apples down a bit in the molds. Reheat the apples for about 8 minutes, until the caramel is liquid and bubbling. Place a baked pastry round on top of each apple. To unmold the tarts, slip a potholder under one of the molds, place an inverted dessert plate over the pastry round, and immediately invert the tart onto the dessert plate, being careful to avoid getting the hot caramel on your hands. Repeat with the remaining tarts."
4626,"This is best served right out of the oven, hot on the outsideand the apples just warm on the inside. If you must make it the night before, the puff pastry will suffer. Rewarm it for six or seven minutes before serving, and some of its flakiness will be restored. Serve this with rum raisin or Vanilla Ice Cream."

""Ever since Payard Bistro opened on the Upper East Side years ago, I've had a lot of demand for desserts for the Jewish Holidays,"" explains chef Payard. ""Since we aren't kosher, there aren't that many people working on this kind of thing and I wanted to make something special and unique. I have so many friends who celebrate the Jewish holidays and I wanted to be able to bring something special with me to their homes, so I started experimenting with ideas years ago."" Payard's holiday recipes are inspired by the Jewish tradition of eating apples and honey for a sweet new year, and prepared with French flair.

4658,-1 3/4 cups (254 grams) all-purpose flour
4659,-Pinch of salt
4660,Method
4661,1. Make financier batter. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
4662,"2. Melt the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook the butter until it begins to brown and has a nutty fragrance, about 3 minutes. Set aside to cool."
4663,"3. Put the slivered almonds in a food processor and process until finely ground, about 45 seconds. Transfer the ground almonds to a medium bowl. Sift the confectioners' sugar over the almonds. Add the flour, cornstarch, and salt and gently whisk to combine."
4664,"4. Combine the egg whites, honey, cooled browned butter, and cream in another medium bowl. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean (reserve the pod for another use) into the bowl and whisk to combine. Add the dry ingredients and whish just until combined. Set aside."
4665,"5. Make the apple filling: Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat and cook until it is golden brown and fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add the diced apples and honey and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2 minutes, carefully light it with a match, and cook until the flame dies. Drain the apples in a strainer set over a bowl, reserving 1/4 cup of the liquid. Stir the reserved liquid back into the diced apples."
4666,"6. Pour the apple mixture into the tart shell (recipe follows) and spread in into an even layer. Scrape the financier batter over the apples, covering them completely."
4667,"7. Bake the tart for 45 to 50 minutes, until the top is golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. Place the tart on a wire rack."
4668,"8. Glaze the tart. Put the honey in a heatproof glass measure and microwave on high for 10 to 15 seconds, until hot. (Or, heat in a small saucepan.) Brush the honey over the top of the hot tart. Cool the tart completely before serving."
4669,Tart Shells
4670,"1. Sift together the confectioners' sugar, flour and salt into a bowl. Place the butter in a food processor and process until smooth, about 15 seconds. Scatter the flour mixture over the butter, add the egg, and process just until the dough forms a mass; do not over mix."
4671,"2. Turn the dough out onto the counter and divide it in two. Shape each half into a disc, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours. Half of the dough may be well wrapped and frozen for up to 1 month. Let the dough stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to soften. Lightly butter two 9 1/2 inch fluted tart pans with removable bottoms."
4672,"3. Dust a work surface lightly with flour. Dust one of the discs lightly with flour and, using a floured rolling pin, roll it out into a rough 12-inch circle. Lift the dough often, making sure that the work surface and dough are lightly floured at all times. Roll the dough up onto the rolling pin and gently unroll it over one of the prepared tart pans. Press the dough into the pan and roll the pin over the top of the pan to remove the excess dough. Repeat with the remaining dough and tart pan."
4673,4. Prick the bottom of the tart shells all over with a fork. Chill the tart shells for 20 minutes. (The tart shells can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours.)
4674,"5. To partially bake the tart shells: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter two pieces of aluminum foil large enough to generously line each tart pan. Line the tart shells with the foil, buttered side down, and fill with dried beans, rice or pie weights. Bake the tart shells for 15 minutes. Remove the foil and beans and continue baking for 5 minutes, until just set; the tart shells should have little or no color. Cool completely on a wire rack."
4675,"6. OR to prebake the tart shells: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Lightly butter two pieces of aluminum foil large enough to generously line each tart pan.

4683,Co-owner Francine Stephens told Eater NY on Monday that her restaurant would be raising prices (to retain chefs and other back-of-the-house staff) and adding a 3% surcharge to all bills at Franny's in order to cover the costs of the Affordable Care Act. The additional surcharge was also noted on the dinner menu posted on Franny's website.

4685,"The owners of Franny's also own Rose's Bar & Grill and Bklyn Larder, which makes their number of full-time employees greater than 50, the threshold for requiring companies to provide health care for its employees to avoid a fine."
4686,"Following a prompt Internet backlash against the surcharge, Franny's told Eater on Wednesday that the restaurant would not instate the proposed 3% surcharge, which was intended to support the Affordable Care Act, rather than demonize it. "
4687,"""Through this surcharge, franny's is embracing Obamacare. Clearly our intent was misunderstood and our guests have made it clear that they would prefer to see higher prices as opposed to a surcharge. We've always worked in the service of our staff and guests and will amend our prices accordingly while removing the surcharge entirely,"" the restaurant said in a message sent to guests. "

Seafood and meat are the mix in this elegant bowl: Japanese sea-salt and soy-sauce chicken broth swims with squid, shrimp, bay scallop and cabbage all to be twisted into noodles and slurped seaside.

	  Glaser's Bake Shop, a German bakery on First Avenue in Manhattan run by Herb Glaser, above, and his brother John, is set to close its doors to the public on July 1.       Photo Credit: Marisol Diaz-Gordon     "
5013,"The sheer number of customers on Saturday at Glaser’s Bake Shop, a German bakery established in Yorkville over a century ago, might have made you think it was closing the next day."
5014,"In reality, “we’ve got four months to go,” said third-generation baker and co-owner Herb Glaser, “but if it stays this busy for four months . . . we’ll go out with a bang — which is the way to go.”"
5015,"At age 65, Glaser and his brother John, 67, are ready to trade their 116-year-old family business for retirement, a post on the store’s Facebook page announced Friday. The news was first reported by Eater NY. "
5016,"“It was a very difficult decision to come to,” said Glaser, who, alongside his sibling, bakes the Yorkville institution’s signature black-and-white cookies and its popular brownies Tuesdays through Saturdays. (Glaser’s nephew works with them part-time, too, but has chosen a different career path.) “We struggled with it for quite a while. But we realize what’s involved keeping [the bakery] going, and we just can’t anymore.”"
5017,"In the Facebook notice of the shop’s impending closure on July 1, the Glasers and their employees thanked customers for “their patronage and . . . for having us as a part of your celebrations since 1902.”"
5018,"Mournful expressions of gratitude and wishes for a happy retirement quickly poured in from loyal patrons, who recalled custom birthday cakes ordered, special holiday orders of Christmas Stollen (a traditional German fruit bread) and regular visits to the shop on First Avenue, close to 87th Street."
5019,"“I’ve been going here since I was born and the neighborhood won’t feel like same without the smell of cookies in the air and the warm smiles you are greeted with when you walk into Glaser’s,” one local wrote in her response to the news. "

5022,"Herb Glaser said that while he knows his customers love the establishment he’s run for 43 years, he still appreciates hearing their warm sentiments — and, we assume, their pledges to drop by as often as possible over the next four months."
5023,"“I think what they’ll miss most is the atmosphere here, because it’s a real old-fashioned business and all the customers know us and we know them,” said Glaser, co-owner of the building at 1670 First Ave."
5024,"Although some would like to see the space — which boasts original white tile flooring and apothecary-style wood cabinets — remain an operating bakery, Glaser said that he and his brother are open to all kinds of buyers."
5025,"(More than one customer on Facebook expressed concern that CVS, a drugstore with at least seven locations on the Upper East Side, will claim the storefront.)"
5026,"The Glasers also have yet to decide what kind of baked treat they will give away on the bake shop’s last day, but Herb knows exactly what he’s doing when he retires. He will be living full-time in his house in New Paltz, keeping himself busy by hiking, gardening, repairing antique clocks and possibly picking up the organ again."
5027,Is there more baking in his future?
5028,"""No, unless I get really, really bored,” he said. “Then I think I can work part time up there someplace. There are bakeries up there.”"

	  Blogger Jackie McEwan takes us through her top five picks for gluten-free eating in New York City ahead of National Gluten-Free Day.       Photo Credit: Jackie McEwan     "
5036,"When Jackie McEwan was diagnosed with celiac disease nearly a decade ago, dietary options were only just popping up on menus across the city and eating gluten-free wasn’t yet trendy."
5037,"“I had to figure out what gluten was, what foods I could eat, what foods I had to avoid and the nuances in between,” she recalls. “It was incredibly overwhelming.”"
5038,"The 30-year-old runs a popular Instagram page, @GlutenFree.FollowMe, and blog, glutenfreefollowme.com, detailing the ins and outs of gluten-free eating in New York City and beyond. The website, which breaks down dining options per city, dietary restriction and craving, was exactly what McEwan says she was missing when shifting her way through this major lifestyle change."
5039,"“I did a ton of research and learned how to maneuver being gluten free at restaurants and in my own kitchen,” she says."
5040,"In 2014, McEwan decided it was time to share her growing, pieced-together list of coffee shops, bakeries and lunch spots in Manhattan that offered menu alterations that fit her diet by snapping photos of her meals for Instagram."
5041,"“I was getting so many questions,” she says, in response to her Instagram account that now has more than 100,000 followers. “People I had never met were asking me for more tips on gluten free friendly eateries, products and recipes and I was more than happy to continue to make those discoveries.”"
5042,"More than 3,000 photos of pastries drizzled with chocolate and tarts topped with fruit line her feed, making the restricted diet seem attainable even for those with the sweetest of sweet tooths."
5043,"“I want people to know that being gluten free is not as hard as you think,” she says, that being a diet of flavorless, limited options."
5044,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
5045,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
5046,"Rising in popularity around the time McEwan started her blog, the diet quickly became a popular food trend rather than solely a medical recommendation for those suffering from celiac — a sensitivity to the substance commonly found in cereal grains like wheat and oats. Several health professionals have since come forward to recommend against dining the diet without a medical need."
5047,But McEwan says the diet isn’t likely to go away soon.
5048,"“I’m thankful that the gluten-free diet has become fairly mainstream because people are more educated about dietary restrictions,” she says. “The restaurant scene has become more sensitive to people who follow the diet. Some restaurants even have menus that indicate which items are gluten free, and this definitely wasn’t the case seven years ago.”"
5049,"After chasing gluten-free spots around midtown for six years, McEwan left her job in finance and uprooted to Los Angeles with her husband where she currently resides."
5050,"Having reviewed nearly 60 eateries characterized as 100 percent gluten free across the country, McEwan suggests NYC is one of the more accommodating areas for such diners."
5051,"Below, McEwan shares her five favorites for gluten-free eating in New York City."
5052,Senza Gluten Café & Bakery
5053,"171 Sullivan St., Greenwich Village; senzaglutennyc.com "
5054,"Treating yourself comes easy at this Italian restaurant where the entire menu is catered to those non-gluten eaters. Promising “all the flavor, without gluten” on its website, the spot serves lunch (soups, salads), dinner (antipasti, lasagna, etc.) and brunch (quiche, French toast). The bakery counter is a plus."
5055,"“So many amazing baked goods, and chef Jemiko [Solo] is constantly creating new ones! And you need to get the cheese bread with feta, mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese, egg yolk and butter,” McEwan suggests."
5056,Erin McKenna’s Bakery
5057,"248 Broome St., Lower East Side; erinmckennasbakery.com"
5058,"“Not only is everything gluten-free, it’s also completely vegan! The doughnuts and cupcake tops are my go-to choices but you can’t go wrong with anything here,” McEwan says."
5059,Hu Kitchen
5060,"78 Fifth Ave., Union Square; hukitchen.com"
5061,"The “Hu” here refers to “getting back to human,” aka living a healthier lifestyle. Hu Kitchen does so by offering paleo options in the form of juices, smoothies, organic coffees, wines, plant-based puddings and vegetable bowls."
5062,“Almost everything is grain-free and paleo which I really appreciate. Their market vegetables and desserts are my favorite!” she says.  
5063,The Little Beet Table
5064,"333 Park Avenue South, Flatiron; thelittlebeettable.com/new-york"
5065,Craving a hamburger? Tacos? Nachos? It’s possible at The Little Beet Table. The spot swaps the grains for veggies and gluten-free breads to satisfy your taste buds.
5066,"“Their menu is seasonal, and I love their veggie dishes. I recommend getting a bunch of things and sharing it all,” McEwan says."
5067,Inday
5068,"1133 Broadway, NoMad and Midtown East; indaynyc.com"
5069,"“I always get a make-your-own-bowl and have cauliflower rice as the base with lots of veggies — so fresh and good! Also get the avo-cocoa for dessert,” she says."

5076,"Just because gluten is banned from your diet doesn't mean you have to deprive yourself of pasta.
Giving up gluten can lead to enjoying a whole slew of new foods, but more importantly, perhaps, is the fact that pasta dishes can still be enjoyed. While wheat is obviously banned in gluten-free Italian dishes, corn, rice, chickpea flour, potato and quinoa are all used to make pastas with new textures and tastes -- some even better than their glutinous originals. Yes, it's true!
Rice pasta is reminiscent of Asian rice noodles, used in curries and stir fries, and offers a light carbohydrate that soaks up the sauce. Corn and quinoa pastas taste a bit nuttier and add another dimension to dishes with sauces that bring out the nutty flavor.
Even if you're not gluten-free, celebrate pasta month with these tasty gluten-free pastas."

5093,"🎼If you threw a party, invited ""Golden Girls"" fans you knew, you would see the best spot to meet would be at the new cafe Rue La Rue.🎼
 “Golden Girls” devotees can begin making the pilgrimage uptown to Washington Heights, to sample Rue La Rue, which is both a cafe and a love letter to one of the show’s stars, Rue McClanahan.
The restaurant, which is now serving breakfast and lunch during a soft opening phase, is owned by the fortuitously named Michael J. La Rue – a friend of McClanahan’s who inherited her belongings when she died in 2010. 
The show chronicled the friendships and love lives of three retirees in Miami: McClanahan’s saucy Southern dame, Blanche Devereaux; Betty White’s sweet and innocent Minnesota native, Rose Nyland; and Bea Arthur’s tough, sarcastic New Yorker, Dorothy Zbornak. They’re joined by Dorothy’s critical Sicilian mother, Estelle Getty’s Sophia Petrillo.
The space is decorated with memorabilia and homages to the series – the wallpaper and the bathroom tiling will be recognizable to any fan – as well as more personal items of McClanahan’s, like her upright piano. A television hanging above it plays episodes of ""Golden Girls,"" and items on the menu are named with its characters in mind.
The overwhelming emphasis is on McClanahan – who also had memorable roles on “Maude” and “Mama’s Family,” in addition to turns on Broadway – but her cast mates also make appearances, as do photographs of her husbands.
“Rue said she was nothing like the character Blanche,” La Rue said. “So I put her six husbands up here so people could see she’s exactly like Blanche.”
Here’s a look inside Rue La Rue, which is at 4394 Broadway."

5133,"When it was founded — before we got our carbonated water in cans and plastic bottles, and from SodaStreams — hundreds of seltzer men delivered fizzy water in glass bottles to New Yorkers throughout the five boroughs. "

5137,"At just around 42 degrees, the carbon dioxide gas bonds perfectly with the triple-filtered New York City tap water to make seltzer (one-third of the New York soda fountain staple that is the egg cream, along with milk and Fox’s U-bet syrup)."
5138,"It’s not easy keeping the bubbles in the bubbly water. The machines are from the early 1900s, and maintaining them is a full-time job, Alex said."

In 2013, he launched a delivery service, Brooklyn Seltzer Boys, for home delivery in the five boroughs."

5224,The past year has seen a slew of buzzy openings.
5225,"

5226,"Greenpoint has a low-key reputation. It’s not easy to get to Brooklyn’s northernmost neighborhood — the only subway is the G and it is bordered on two sides by water. And the population is about half that of nearby Williamsburg, according to the most recent census. And yet, Greenpoint has one of the most exciting restaurant scenes in New York City."
5227,"Neighborhood mainstays (Acapulco Deli & Restaurant, Peter Pan Donut and Pastry Shop), Polish restaurants (Karczma) and trendy spots (Le Fanfare, Achilles Heel, Five Leaves) exist alongside each other. All the categories are covered in Greenpoint. Living in the neighborhood in 2019 for a foodie is akin to living in Greenwich Village in 1960 for a folkie. It’s all happening."
5228,"But why is that? Sure, there’s the proximity to nightlife and dining heavyweight Williamsburg, which helps ensure foot traffic, but that’s just part of it. As the city grows and gets more expensive, people are seeking out an experience that resonates. And with restaurants, that’s translating to good vibes and honest, consistent food."
5229,"When farm-to-table restaurant Anella opened in 2009 and wood-fired pizza spot Paulie Gee’s followed a year later, both were seen as pioneers — there were far fewer restaurants and young transplants in Greenpoint then."
5230,"“When we opened I was really like, ‘Oh my god, what are we doing?,’” Anella co-owner Blair Papagni says. “I didn’t know if it was going to work.”"
5231,"Paulie Giannone, who now also operates the spinoff Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop two blocks from his first Greenpoint restaurant, said he knew Greenpoint was going to be the “next neighborhood.”"

5234,"“There were some bars and no pizza that I wanted to serve and I got really excited,” he says. “I thought, ‘This is it. I’m home!’ I saw what was going to happen. There was a little buzz.”"
5235,"Fast forward 10 years and the number of buzzy restaurants has risen exponentially, especially on Manhattan and Greenpoint avenues. In the past year or so alone, Vietnamese-American spot Di An Di; refined, wood-fired Mexican restaurant Oxomoco (which recently won a Michelin star); the Anella team’s bistro Chez Ma Tante; and Bernie’s, a new-age steakhouse from the folks behind another neighborhood hot spot, Frankel’s, have opened, all highly rated and very popular spots."
5236,"Daniel Hildreth, a Department of Education administrator who has lived in Greenpoint since 2007, says the neighborhood is “primed to attract people.”"
5237,"“Greenpoint is a crossroads — it’s the top tip of Brooklyn, it’s near Queens, it’s near Manhattan. There is a lot to do nearby and within it. The waterfront is beautiful,” he says. “It also still feels cool. [There are] lots of interesting people making things and coming from many walks of life.”"
5238,"Though Greenpoint is right next to Williamsburg, it’s hard to reach for most New Yorkers — and that’s also part of its appeal, Giannone says. “You feel like you discovered something new.”"
5239,"Giannone looked to Greenpoint first for his restaurant. So did Justin Bazdarich, chef and owner of Oxomoco, on Greenpoint Avenue."
5240,"“Williamsburg is too much — it’s too expensive, it’s overhyped, it’s oversaturated,” Bazdarich says. “Anything that was cool and unique was so high rent.”"
5241,"Garrett Smith, managing partner at the 3-year-old meat-centric restaurant Cherry Point on Manhattan Avenue, has lived in the Williamsburg/Greenpoint area since 1999. The amount of money in someone’s pocket today versus then is a lot more, which gives restaurants more opportunity in the neighborhood, he says. Indeed, the median household income for Greenpoint and Williamsburg was $71,050 in 2016, compared with $46,690 in 2010, according to the NYU Furman Center."
5242,"“We have $5 Budweiser and a cheeseburger but we also have a dry-aged rib-eye,” Smith says."
5243,"For Papagni, who calls Greenpoint a “gem of a neighborhood,” part of the appeal for both diners and restaurant chefs and owners is how gracious people are with each other."
5244,"“It has maintained a lot of its original residents. There’s a big and active Polish community, an equally big and active Spanish community and there’s new people who’ve opened up businesses,” she says. “I see a harmony in the neighborhood that you don’t see a lot. Greenpoint seems to be particularly accepting.”"
5245,"The success of restaurants in the neighborhood can also be attributed to the strength of the local community, Smith adds."
5246,"“When we opened we saw just how intact the community is in Greenpoint. We got a lot of attention from locals that you might not get in Williamsburg,” he says. “Tons of people poured in. Polish people came in to see how we’re doing, artists and musicians came in.”"
5247,"Locals are equally prone to hit up both the new hot spots and the standbys, further strengthening the dining scene."
5248,"“There are so many more options now, and the cool thing is some of the stalwarts are still hanging on,” Smith says. “They’re not going anywhere.” "

5256, 
5257,It took leaving Manhattan before Mark Bittman first got serious about grilling.
5258,"While growing up in Stuyvesant Town, the food writer would get to grill whenever he visited his cousins in Valley Stream on Long Island. "
5259,"“It was like a complete treat — I found it the most thrilling thing imaginable,” recalls Bittman, 68. “I never had a situation where I could grill.”"
5260,"When he left New York for the first time when he was in his early 20s, Bittman bought a grill and “never stopped,” he says."
5261,"For the latest cookbook in his bestselling “How to Cook Everything” series, Bittman turns to flame-cooked foods."
5262,"“How to Grill Everything” ($30), out this week, covers grilling basics, from essential tools to grilling all manner of foods — meat and poultry of course, as well as fish, shellfish, vegetables, sauces and even breads and desserts."
5263,"“It is something I wanted to do for a long time,” says Bittman, whose previous cookbooks in his “How to Cook Everything” series have tackled such topics as vegetarian dishes, baking and cooking fast. “It’s been on my list for years. It seemed like it was time.”"
5264,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
5265,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
5266,"The 1,000-someodd recipes and variations are designed to be accessible, according to the author. "
5267,"“This is a book with what I hope are really appealing and what I know to be really simple and really accessible recipes,” he says. “I never cooked in a professional kitchen. I’ve never been a chef. There’s no intention to impress anybody with razzle dazzle here.”"
5268,"With more than 20 books to his name, the writer still does hope to surprise people with his latest title."
5269,"“I think the surprises are not in the ingredients but what you can do with the grill,” he says. “The bread and dessert chapter is quite fascinating. It’s something most people, including me, don’t think as being able to do on the grill and yet they work really, really well.”"
5270,"Novice and experienced grillers alike will find something to enjoy, Bittman says, from “classic stuff” like burgers and steaks to vegetarian dishes like stuffed chilies and veggie burgers made with chickpeas to more “cultish” topics like smoking. "
5271,"“People do really, really go nuts over smoking and barbecuing,” Bittman says. “I wanted to try to introduce people to that. But it’s not a barbecue book or smoking book — it’s a straightforward grilling book that includes some barbecue and smoking.”"
5272,"There is also a whole section devoted to condiments, including ketchup hacks “that make the burger more interesting,” he says, like adding hot sauce, minced fresh chili or horseradish."
5273,"Over the years, Bittman — who now calls Cold Spring in Putnam County home — has gotten the chance to grill in the city, such as in Riverside Park. And while not everyone has the space for a Brinkmann Grill, which Bittman uses, and fuel like wood or charcoal, the author stresses that you don’t need much to have a grilling hobby."
5274,"“Tongs and some heatproof gloves are really the most important things,” Bittman says. “The basic equipment is really, really minimal.”"
5275,"You can find “really, really classic stuff like burgers and steaks” in Bittman’s new cookbook, the author notes. And you can also find a little bit of everything else, like plantains. Bittman recommends using ripe plantains (“the soft yellow ones with some black spots,” he notes) since unripe ones might dry out on the grill. Pair this with pork, chicken, fish or green vegetables, he suggests. "

5281,1. Start the coals or heat a gas grill for medium direct cooking. Make sure the grates are clean.
5282,"2. Trim away the ends of the plantains, then cut them in half lengthwise, leaving the peel intact. Whisk the oil, honey, and hot sauce together in a small bowl. Brush the cut sides of the plantains with the mixture."
5283,"3. Put the plantains on the grill directly over the fire, peel side down. Close the lid and cook until the peel starts to pull away from the plantain, 5 to 8 minutes. Carefully turn the plantains over and cook until the glazed side browns, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate, remove the peels, drizzle over the remaining glaze, and serve."

5296,"Greenpoint-based smoked fish wholesaler Acme and Zucker's Bagels, of TriBeCa, attempted to set a Guinness World record on National Bagels and Lox Day, with a lox-and-cream cheese everything bagel clocking in at more than 200 pounds. "
5297,"Acme co-CEO Adam Caslow and helpers assembled and weighed the massive sandwich — 13 inches by 29 inches by 36 inches in dimension — at Acme's smokehouse at 30 Gem St. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, before cutting it up and distributing the pieces to a packed room of witnesses attending the free event."
5298,"Zucker's founder Matt Pomerantz had been practicing his baking for a few weeks, and the bagel itself was expected to weigh 100 pounds, Caslow said Thursday."
5299,"On Friday, sandwich makers spread cream cheese onto the bottom half of the bagel before covering it in roughly 40 pounds of smoked salmon, then piling tomato and onion slices on top, and sprinkling capers over everything. Caslow and crew struggled to keep sliding vegetables securely in place, and, at the last minute, they realized they had to engineer a way to transfer the ginormous bagel from the table onto the scale. "
5300,"""Move that bagel!"" spectators chanted as Acme staffers pushed the sandwich onto a flat cardboard box and, from there, onto the weighing platform."
5301,"If Acme and Zucker's are successful in setting a new Guinness World food record, this won't be New York City's first. We have rounded up a few of the most memorable established in recent years:"

5305,"Last November, at the Italian restaurant inside Macy's Herald Square location, the frozen and canned vegetable retailer Green Giant whipped up a green bean casserole outweighing the 551-pound record of comparable foods like mashed potatoes. That feat required a whopping 780 cans of green beans, 53 cans of mushroom soup, 32 quarts of milk and 65 pounds of French fried onions, a spokeswoman said. It took cooks more than six hours to open all the cans. When a Guinness official weighed and measured the casserole, it clocked in at 637 pounds."
5306,World’s longest line of hot dogs
5307,"In 2016, hot dog institution Nathan’s Famous celebrated its 100th anniversary by assembling in a continuous line a record-breaking 1,916 dogs — in honor of the year the company was founded — at Grand Central Terminal in midtown. To break the previous record of an 846-foot line set in Tokyo in 2014, Nathan’s staff prepared the hot dogs in buns, wrapped them in tin foil, and lined them up end-to-end to create 958 continuous feet. "
5308,Most candles lit on a birthday cake
5309,"Queens resident and serial record breaker Ashrita Furman memorialized what would have been his spiritual guru Sri Chinmoy’s 85th birthday last December by lighting a record number of candles — 72,585, to be exact — on a ginormous spongecake. (Compare that to the previous record of 50,151 candles lit in Los Angeles in April 2016.) It took a team of 100 people at the Sri Chinmoy Centre in Jamaica to prepare the cake in the shape of a picture frame 80.5 feet long and 2 feet wide, place the candles and ignite them with 60 blowtorches. They burned for roughly 40 seconds before they were snuffed out with fire extinguishers."
5310,World’s largest collection of pizza boxes
5311,"Self-described “professional pizza enthusiast” Scott Wiener, whose pizza tour company guides participants through the five boroughs, holds the record for the world’s largest collection of pizza boxes, clocking in at 595 containers. He houses them all in his Flatbush, Brooklyn, apartment. The assembly spans 42 countries and four decades, according to the Guinness World Records website."
5312,Most Carolina Reaper chili peppers consumed in under 60 seconds
5313,"In April 2016, Jamaica resident Wayne Algenio ate a then-record 119 grams of the world’s hottest peppers in less than one minute. (If you think jalapeños are hot, they pale in comparison to Carolina Reaper chillies, which measure roughly 1.6 million on the Scoville heat scale for peppers and hot sauces — making them 300 times as spicy.) Algenio wolfed down 22 peppers at the New York Hot Sauce Expo in Greenpoint last year, but he has since been knocked from his world-record perch; in November, a California man devoured 120 grams of the mouth-burning veggies."
5314,World’s most expensive soufflé available commercially
5315,"If you have an extra $2,500 burning a hole in your pocket, you could spend it on the world’s most expensive soufflé, prepared by the executive chefs at Petrossian. The upscale midtown cafe’s quail egg and caviar dish is topped with gold leaf and a flambéed cognac that sells for more than $4,000 a bottle."
5316,Most sandwiches made in one hour
5317,"On May 21, 2013, the Midwest-based Eckrich Bacon Lovers Deli Meats partnered with volunteers from Operation Homefront, a nonprofit supporting military families and veterans, to assemble a record-breaking 2,706 hero sandwiches in one hour at the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum. (The previous record was a paltry 1,660 sandwiches.) That food didn’t go to waste — it was donated to Operation Homefront and the food rescue organization City Harvest to feed hungry New Yorkers. "

5389,"If you're lucky, one of the hardest decisions you'll make all summer will be choosing between a hamburger and a hot dog at barbecues."
5390,"Or, you could go with both."
5391,"Hardee's debuted its Most American Thickburger on Wednesday, May 20th, just in time to confuse Memorial Day barbecuees appropriately."

5393,"While this seems like a crazy food mash-up any concious eater is destined not to like, a taste test proved otherwise. The hot dog, like bacon, added an addictive saltiness to the burger and the chips and lettuce crunched together with the soft bun in that tantilizing way that makes you just want one more bite."
5394,This former vegetarian couldn't stop eating it. 
5395,"Hardee's has yet to open a restaurant in NYC -- you'll have to go upstate or to Pennsylvania or Delaware to indulge in the Thickburger-- , but New Yorkers are no strangers to meat-on-meat burgers."

5406,"At this shop, the history of Harlem is told through chocolate."
5407,The artisan chocolate shop Harlem Chocolate Factory sells sweets with names such as Bodega Dreams and Mangoes del Barrio that pay homage to the neighborhood.
5408,Jessica Spaulding founded the company in 2014. She helped get it off the ground by winning the NYPL’s StartUP! Business Plan Competition and getting a loan through the Brewing the American Dream program.
5409,"Previously based out of Hot Bread Kitchen’s East Harlem incubator, in February Spaulding opened her own store at 2363 Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Blvd., in Harlem's Striver's Row."
5410,So far she’s faced only one challenge: demand.  
5411,"“We sell out of everything,” Spaulding says. “There’s not a single thing that we’ve made that hasn’t sold out.”"
5412,"amNewYork caught up with Spaulding, 31."
5413,How was it growing up in Harlem?
5414,"It was like growing up in a small town of a big city. It’s not like when you go downtown and everybody has their own thing that they got going on. This is like everybody’s speaking to you, everybody’s saying hello to you, everybody is smiling. Here, people look out for you. If I had to go home by myself, I wasn’t alone; there’s six people that saw me, made sure I got home after I left school, people that gave me something to eat not because I was starving but because I was a child from the neighborhood. They would think I am going home and my mother’s probably working so I must have not eaten anything."
5415,How did you get the idea of starting your own chocolate factory?
5416,"I was on the bus in Brooklyn and I worked around the corner of a chocolate company, Mast Brothers, and I used to get off the bus right in front of their shop and I was just walking by it and going to work every day like, “Man, they did it!” You know what I am saying? Like, they did it so it can’t be that difficult. Then, I was in the public library one day with my kids and there was a sign for a business plan competition and I was like you, if I have a business plan then that will let me know whether or not it is viable."
5417,So what happened?
5418,"But the question was what am I going to represent? All these other people represent places, and then I am like I can only represent the one thing I have known all my life: Harlem. I decided to represent Harlem in chocolate and find a way to connect our stories and the cultures."
5419,How do you tell stories through chocolate?
5420,"What I came up with first is the Champagne on Striver's Row bar. Striver's Row is where everyone who was somebody lived. [The bar] has black currant and popping candy flavor and dark chocolate. It represents something like a glass of Champagne because of how it was like with the affluent parties that happened here. The bar that is closest to where I am from is the Mangoes del Barrio bar, which is a bar for Spanish Harlem. So that bar is for the mango lady on the corner and is mango, chili and has milk chocolate.  "
5421,Where do you get your ingredients?
5422,What we actually try to do is source as locally as possible. Our milk and cream are both from upstate New York and our butter we get from the New England area and not much further. The goal is to have completely a New York State chocolate because New York has some of the most diverse agriculture that people really take for granted. That’s the freshness that people taste; it’s the thing that they are loving because people otherwise are eating stuff that was made a year ago and put somewhere to store.
5423,What do your kids think about their mom making chocolate? Don’t they just love it?
5424,"My son is 7 and my daughter is 4. But my son is now a self-proclaimed dishwasher. It’s like a family affair, you know, all hands on deck. My daughter likes to be in the front with people and checking people out and giving them their change and passing them their bag. When they want to have a little bit of fun, you know, they come in. But it’s also a way to show them what entrepreneurship means because for this area that’s another thing that cannot go unspoken."
5425,How so?
5426,"The levels of poverty and the lack of access leaves entrepreneurship out of the conversation for a lot of children, especially me when I grew up here. I had never been told the word entrepreneurship. I didn’t learn that until I was an adult, and it’s a viable way out for a lot of people who are not just rapping and singing and dancing. A lot of children don’t know that you don’t only have to get a job at these big corporations — you can get a job at a small business that has a little bit more space for you to grow."
5427,What’s separates your brand from all other chocolate brands around the city?
5428,"I think it’s Harlem — showing that perspective. It’s a perspective that’s completely missing in chocolate. You know the chocolate companies around the world, it’s so rare to find any black-owned or even person-of-color-owned chocolate companies, and so that makes the industry lack a certain level of innovation when the diversity is so low. That’s the thing that separates us from everyone — our culture."
5429,Tell me about a customer you fondly remember.
5430,There was this older woman who came in with her daughter and she was struggling to walk and she grew up in this neighborhood. She said there was another candy shop around here and she remembers it from her childhood. She was almost 85 and the look of pride that she had on her face will probably stick with me forever because that’s what I was doing this for — to restore a sense of pride for the culture and history that we already have and preserve it and remind people of these memories.
5431,A customer you not-so-fondly remember?
5432,"We tried to do a sale to introduce our cookies. We had a sign outside that said “2 for 1” and this guy came in and he said, “Alright, I want the two cookies for a dollar!” and we were like no it’s two for the price of one, and it was hilarious because he was so angry and all the customers in here were laughing.  "
5433,What’s the best part about working at a chocolate factory? 
5434,"It’s the broken items! That’s the best thing. If it breaks or if it is not up to standards, then you know it has to go somewhere and we can’t put it in the trash so [points to her stomach and laughs]."

5446,"“Those books have been popular now for decades,” said co-owner Jason Sturm, 42. “You have this growing populace that has been exposed to it, and is now of drinking age and likes to have these reminiscent things they feel comfortable with.”"

5454,"The shot isn’t the only one with Broadway relevance; the bar had already been offering a “SpongeBob SquarePants” drink when the show opened on Broadway last year, and one of the newest offerings is for “Hamilton,” complete with tricorn hats and fake pistols for props (set to, of course, “My Shot”)."

5456,"If you shelled out hundreds of dollars to see both parts of “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” you can get a little break on some pre-show cocktails. The Library Bar at the Hudson Hotel (358 W. 58th St.) is offering ticket holders 25 percent off its specialty cocktail menu inspired by the Hogwarts houses. There’s the Gryffindor (Lillet Rose, Campari, grapefruit and club soda), Hufflepuff (Cava, sugar cane syrup and ginger beer), Ravenclaw (bourbon, Pimms and Coke) and Slytherin (Hendricks Gin, St. Germaine, cucumber juice, simple syrup and lemon juice). For reading material, the bar also has a display of “Harry Potter” novels available by request. The cocktails are priced at $15 each and are available through May 11. "

5488,Harvest in the Square returns for its 23rd year on Sept. 20.
5489,"
	  The 23rd annual Harvest in the Square will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. Sept. 20.       Photo Credit: Claudio Papapietro     "
5490,"As Harvest in the Square, a fundraising event put on by the Union Square Partnership and a favorite of foodies in the area, gears up for its 23rd edition later this month, patrons and sponsors alike reminisce on the good it has done for the neighborhood and look toward the park’s promising future still ahead."
5491,"Although the beautiful, vibrant, and clean Union Square Park that so many New Yorkers know and love today — with its fresh flowers and produce at the Greenmarket, contingent of elderly chess players, and never-ending stream of street performances and art — resembles nothing of the dark days, the park was not always so popular. "
5492,"Just decades ago, Union Square had its share of drug activity, vacant storefronts and little culture. "
5493,"“When I first moved to the neighborhood, you couldn’t even walk around,” said Vicky Braunstein, a social worker who has lived in her 16th Street apartment since 1980. “It was dirty, unsafe and drug-infested, and it felt like people really didn’t care.”"
5494,"The Union Square Partnership, founded in 1984, has worked to improve the neighborhood for its residents, businesses and visitors. "
5495,"While the partnership helped beautify Union Square, helping to transform the neighborhood into one of the most desirable in Manhattan, the organization’s work is not complete."
5496,"“With over 350,000 visitors every day, Union Square is ever-changing,” said Hannah Swerdloff, the partnership’s marketing and special events director, “and that takes a lot of upkeep.”"
5497,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
5498,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
5499,"These days, the partnership funds the park’s repairs, seasonal plantings, and seating area additions, but it also focuses on providing the neighborhood with a series of free programs year-round. From cooking demos with some of the city’s best chefs to outdoor concerts and film screenings, the organization offers events to maintain Union Square’s booming reputation, all free of cost. "
5500,"In order to fund the park’s maintenance and programming, the partnership hosts a few events throughout the year that require paid admission, and Harvest in the Square is unquestionably the star of this lineup."
5501,"Founded in 1995 by the partnership in collaboration with famed chef Danny Meyer, Harvest in the Square features offerings from the neighborhood’s most well-known restaurants. Favorites like Blue Water Grill, Breads Bakery, Tocqueville and Union Square Café, as well as newcomers like BOCCE and Kyma, each prepare a signature dish for the event, and attendees can eat as much food from the more than 50 participating vendors as their stomachs will allow."
5502,"“You really have to bring it to Harvest in the Square,” said Breads Bakery owner Gadi Peleg, who noted that his restaurant will feature a cabbage and sauerkraut strudel at this year’s event."
5503,"“I really get to share everything I love about this neighborhood,” said Peleg, who also owns nearby Nur, another restaurant featured at the Harvest. "
5504,"“We really want to be a part of the community,” said chef Timothy Meyers of BOCCE USQ, a popular Italian restaurant that opened in the park this spring. He noted that the partnership has been instrumental in helping establish the restaurant in the neighborhood. "
5505,"“They do so much for Union Square that goes unnoticed, so it feels only natural for us to give back to them for the Harvest.” (All proceeds from ticket sales go directly to the partnership, so restaurants’ participation in the event comes out of their own pockets.)"
5506,"“The business district here is really run so well, and everything is clean and beautiful because of the Union Square Partnership,” added Peleg, “so we think of the Harvest as an investment.”"
5507,"Tocqueville’s executive chef and owner, Marco Moreira, had similar praise for the organization."
5508,"“When we first moved into Union Square in 1999, the Union Square Partnership welcomed us with open arms,” he said, pointing out that it was particularly helpful during Hurricane Floyd that year."
5509,"“The partnership works so much with businesses in the neighborhood,” said Moreira, “and we are thrilled to be a part of their efforts every year.”"
5510,"“They really build a community in the middle of New York City,” added Meyers, “which is not such an easy thing to do.”"
5511,"Since its first day in Union Square in 1976, the Greenmarket has played a crucial role in the park’s renewal and has been a point of attraction for many restaurants in the neighborhood."
5512,"With more than 140 farmers, fishers and bakers now in attendance each week, the Greenmarket provides much of the produce and other ingredients for nearby dining hot spots."
5513,"“You can always tell when someone is buying for a restaurant when they order 80 pounds of potatoes,” said Braunstein with a chuckle, “but it’s really nice to see them supporting the neighborhood.”"
5514,"While the Greenmarket will have its own table at Harvest in the Square, the partnership also offers participating restaurants a reimbursement of up to $300 for ingredients they purchase from the market."
5515,"But $300 or not, many restaurants prefer to use the market’s fresh fruits and vegetables not only for their Harvest dishes but year-round."
5516,"“The Greenmarket was one of the main reasons I moved to 15th Street,” said Tocqueville’s Moreira. “They have the best produce in the city.”"
5517,"The partnership has encouraged participating restaurants to follow a “zero-waste” theme in their dishes this year, a goal that the organization has been working toward for several years with the addition of recycling and composting initiatives inside the park."
5518,"While some have chosen instead to focus on featuring in-season produce from the Greenmarket or inventive flavor combinations, BOCCE USQ has remained true to the “zero-waste” motif."
5519,"“I wanted to use some of the produce that doesn’t get enough love,” said chef Meyers, who also serves as chair for this year’s Harvest."
5520,"Using “ugly vegetables,” BOCCE will offer Harvest attendees a pizza with ricotta, sweet potatoes and roast veggies, topped with an apple balsamic. All the produce on the pizza will come from Union Square’s own Greenmarket, specifically from Norwich Meadows Farm, which reminds Meyers of his childhood in the upstate New York town."
5521,"Even in its 23rd year, Harvest in the Square continues to draw excitement and anticipation from both its attendees and its participants."
5522,"“There’s always great food, and I love to see what new things the restaurants are featuring,” said Braunstein."
5523,"“You not only get to eat delicious food, but you also get to meet the chefs,” said the partnership’s Swerdloff, who thinks of the park as “everybody’s playground.” "
5524,"“It’s really a party, and that’s the bottom line,” she said."
5525,"Peleg, who’s been a part of the Harvest for six years, feels that the event provides “a beautiful platform for all of us who live and work in the neighborhood to share our best stuff.”"
5526,"The Harvest has indeed come to symbolize the arrival of fall, and, as Moreira said, “all of the community looks forward to it each year.”"
5527,"The tent, which covers the entire Union Square plaza and allows the show to go on, even in the event of rain, causes quite a frenzy of its own."
5528,"“It’s an unbelievably beautifully choreographed thing to see,” said Peleg, who explained that the whole thing is put up and taken down within a day."
5529,"“You walk into that tent, and you don’t even know where to begin,” Braunstein said. “I always try to pace myself, and sometimes, that means going for the burger or pizza last.”"
5530,"“It’s truly the best food event in all of New York, and I feel like I’m home when I’m there.”"
5531,"This year’s Harvest in the Square will take place from 6 to 9 p.m. Sept. 20. Tickets start at $125, or $150 on the day, and can be purchased at www.harvestinthesquare.nyc. "

5539,There are new options for finding poppy seed protein bites and organic cold-pressed coconut oil.
5540,Two Manhattan-based online marketplaces have recently launched that specialize in health-focused pantry goods.
5541,"Bubble, which officially launched earlier this year, stocks some 500 shelf-stable products from more than 100 brands, from snacks like granola and jerky to staples like butters and spices. Public Goods debuted in September with its own line of personal care products before expanding to cleaning products and, last month, food, with a focus on organic staples."
5542,"Jessica Young was director of products and operations at Daily Harvest before building up the millennial-targeted Bubble. She saw a need for health food brands to get their products into customers’ hands, along with a demand from customers for “bang-for-your-buck nutrition.”"
5543,"“There’s a lot of work cleaning up products still to be done in the market,” Young, 30, said. “All the products we’re going to be releasing are takes on classics but with super-clean labels. Nothing has refined sugars, fillers, additives, gums.”"
5544,"So far, vegan goods have been popular, including Mustache Munchies crackers, a “riff on Goldfish,” and Lily Puffs, puffed water lily seeds which “kind of look like a healthy Cheeto,” Young said."
5545,"With Young’s background in product development and chef training, Bubble also is launching its own products each quarter. First to drop: Hella, a vegan hazelnut spread that’s sold out twice so far."

For $59 a year, members have access to the site’s stock of shampoos, dish soap, extra-virgin olive oil, tomato sauce and more."
5550,"“I started this because I wanted to build an online shop for things that people need,” said Hirsh, 39. “A place people could get quality products no. 1, they could trust, and no. 2, they could afford.”"
5551,"For food, there was a priority on stocking certified organic items and fair trade coffee. Snacks, which include popcorn and a variety of crackers, have been especially popular so far."
5552,"Public Goods has nearly 30 products in its food category, all priced under $10, with plans to add condiments, jams and beef jerky this month. Over the next year, the marketplace will add an additional 200 products across all its categories, with the vast majority in food, according to Hirsh."
5553,"“We’ll keep listening to our customers and develop the products that they want,” said Hirsh, whose members are primarily in secondary cities and suburbs. ""Those can be in food or drink or personal care, vitamins, feminine hygiene."""
5554,"Bubble — which counts among its investors Karlie Kloss — is looking to get into perishables and baked goods as it grows its inventory, as well as the hemp category (its next product release is on 4/20, Young teased)."
5555,"“There’s more education than ever about health and wellness, there’s a growing customer base of people who want these products and there’s more people than ever making and inventing new products,” Young said. “We created our own bubble into the health food space.”"

5566,"As Bon Appetit Editor-in-chief Adam Rapaport wrote in the foreword, ""Here was a 'cleanse' that didn't feel like a cleanse."""
5567,"The 140 recipes in the book were developed by food writer Sara Dickerman, nutritionist Marissa Lippert and the staff of Bon Appetit. While the feature has been published by the magazine for the past five years, this is the first time it's in a book."
5568,"The emphasis of the cleanse, according to a press release, is on home cooking and whole foods. And unlike in the magazine, the cleanse is extended beyond winter, with a different, two-week cleanse plan for each season. "
5569,"""Cooking at home is just the best way to know what you're consuming,"" Dickerman said in the release. ""And fundamentally, I think the process of cooking puts you in a better mindset for more considered eating."""

	  Watch out for holiday foods that pack a high-calorie punch, like pecan pie, advises registered dietitian Kristy Del Coro.       Photo Credit: iStock     "
5640,"With so many sides, servings and tempting treats, it can be tough to prevent over-indulging (and a few extra pounds) this Thanksgiving and holiday season. To help, registered dietitian Kristy Del Coro, the senior culinary nutritionist for Rouge Tomate, offers these tips to help keep in mind at your upcoming festivities:"
5641,"1. Watch out for those holiday foods that pack a high-calorie punch: cheesecake, pecan pie, biscuits and casserole dishes with lots of added cream and butter."
5642,"2. Opt for more simply prepared items like roasted turkey, baked sweet potatoes, sautéed or braised greens, vegetable-based stuffing and lower calorie beverages such as spiced teas and no sugar-added apple cider."
5643,"3. If drinking alcohol, stick to wine, champagne or spirits with no added syrups or sweeteners."
5644,4. Drink water or seltzer in between each alcoholic beverage to stay hydrated and stay mindful about your intake of empty calories.
5645,"5. Serve yourself small portions instead of heaping ones, and give yourself time to feel full before going for seconds."
5646,"6. Fill up your plate with vegetables and lean protein first, which will leave less room for the more decadent higher calorie dishes, so that you can still taste them but won't overdo it. Using smaller plates can help!"

5799,A tiny but growing number of the 46 million turkeys destined to be eaten in America this Thanksgiving can trace their lineage to the birds that graced the tables of the country's early settlers.
5800,"Cheaper, big-breasted turkeys full of the white meat consumers now crave have largely pushed out the historic varieties, but small poultry breeders are working to return the holiday's signature dish to its roots."
5801,"More than nostalgia, the movement seeks to preserve the genetic diversity of a famed holiday fowl, while also catering to foodies who prefer the robust taste of the heritage turkeys' dark meat."
5802,"""This is our historical foundation of our food,"" said Frank Reese Jr., a fourth-generation Kansas farmer considered the master of heritage turkey breeding."
5803,"At her homestead farm in rural North Carolina, Julie Gauthier butchered and dressed 14 heritage turkeys this week, plucking each feather by hand before selling the pastured birds fresh to customers who had placed orders as early as August."
5804,"The turkeys, also known as ""Standard Bred,"" can take twice as long to grow to full size and cost as much as six times more per pound than those popularly sold in grocery store freezers."
5805,"""Heritage turkey is a superior product to a supermarket turkey,"" said Gauthier, a veterinary epidemiologist who also raises rare chickens, ducks and geese on her Wake Forest farm."
5806,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
5807,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
5808,"""They're much more flavorful,"" she added."
5809,"The fowl included Beltsville Small White turkeys, one of the rarest heritage varieties that Gauthier and a national conservation group are on a mission to save."
5810,"The eight-to-12-pound turkeys saw brief success in the 1940s and 1950s after being developed to meet the demand of smaller families, refrigerators and ovens, but were nearly extinct by the 1970s."
5811,"The Livestock Conservancy started a recovery program this year for the Beltsville Small White, using eggs and adult breeder birds donated by a research lab with one of the variety's few remaining purebred flocks."
5812,"Compared with the 46 million turkeys the National Turkey Federation estimates are eaten at Thanksgiving alone, only about 30,000 to 50,000 heritage turkeys are consumed each year, said Jeannette Beranger, who works at the Livestock Conservancy."
5813,"But the number of heritage breeding birds has increased after precarious lows in the 1990s, she said, and a core of enthusiasts are now interested in raising the animals."
5814,Beranger has an idea to further raise the old-school poultry's profile.

5823,A South Bronx coffee shop and a Venezuelan street-style hot dog cart are among the new food vendors joining the High Line-up this year.
5824,"Three vendors in total made their debut Saturday at the elevated Meatpacking District park, taking their place alongside returning favorites."
5825,"“Each of these vendors echoes the High Line’s commitment to community,” High Line co-founder and executive director Robert Hammond said in a statement describing Boogie Down Grind as “a coffee café incubated in the South Bronx [that] prioritizes hiring local neighborhood residents”; Perros Y Vainas as “a true street vendor bringing traditional Venezuelan food to New Yorkers who may have never experienced it before”; and Tastalu as a maker of “authentic Italian paninis.”"
5826,"Boogie Down Grind is offering hot espresso beverages, cold brew and other iced drinks, according to the release. Perros Y Vainas is selling steamed buns and sausages (perros) loaded with toppings (vainas) like crunchy potato sticks, sweet corn and white cheese and sauces like a garlic variety and guacamole. And Tastalu is preparing its sandwiches with freshly baked bread and locally sourced produce."
5827,"Returning vendors — the majority of which will open at 11 a.m. seven days a week — include the seasonal wine bar Terroir at The Porch, L’Arte del Gelato, Mexican sweet shop La Newyorkina, ice cream sandwich company Melt, Chelsea’s La Sonrisa Empanadas and the handmade ice pop maker People’s Pops. All except the latter, which sets up shop in Gansevoort Plaza below the High Line in May, are now open for the season."
5828,"A tourist magnet that also draws New Yorkers in the less crowded evening hours, the High Line was founded in 1999 by neighbors who advocated for the preservation of the 30-feet-high rail track with Hudson River views on Manhattan’s west side. The park is maintained and operated by the Friends of the High Line nonprofit, and it hosts not only food vendors, but public programs and art installations."

5840,"Add cream, Bourbon, sugar, molasses and salt to potatoes. Simultaneously, mash potatoes with a large fork or potato masher and mix all the ingredients together.  If the potatoes need more liquid, add a little water. Stir until smooth.  Simmer covered, for 30-40 minutes or until potatoes are so soft that they resemble a puree. This second cooking makes the potatoes foolproof since any hard pieces of sweet potato have a chance to cook down before serving. When potatoes have cooked down, add the Tabasco and nutmeg if using and taste. Adjust salt as necessary.  If desired, top with mini marshmallows and run under broiler until golden brown. Serve immediately and refrigerate any leftovers. The mash re-heats very well. "

  On Saturday, March 2, John Sierp, chef at Home Base restaurant and an FDNY lieutenant, explained how cooking in the kitchen isn't much different from his days cooking in the firehouse.

"
5904,"They say if you can’t stand the fire, get out of the kitchen. But as an FDNY lieutenant and executive chef, that’s not a problem for John Sierp."
5905,"Earlier this month, Sierp was in the kitchen of the new Kips Bay restaurant Home Base, sporting a fire department T-shirt and working out recipes with sous chef Jennifer Goodman for their menu of comfort-food twists."
5906,"The two had already put the seal of approval on wings with Thai peanut sauce and fried Oreos with ice cream at the American bistro, now in its soft opening."
5907,"They were perfecting a General Tso’s cauliflower — beer-battered morsels of the veggie with a sweet and spicy sauce. They were still experimenting with Cuban egg rolls, which is like a “Cuban sandwich in an eggroll,” Sierp says, and a gluten-free, vegetarian zucchini pasta with roasted garlic and broiled cherry tomatoes."
5908,"Another menu offering, the French onion soup sandwich, features thick, toasted bread slices with sweet caramelized onions and both Gruyere and Swiss cheeses and a small ramekin with onion soup for dipping."
5909,The primarily self-trained chef has long found himself taking charge in the kitchen.
5910,"Sierp, 46, got his start cooking as a college student, making meals for his frat brothers at the University of Delaware. The Staten Island native would call his Italian mother back home in Great Kills and ask for recipes and advice on making meatballs and sauce."
5911,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
5912,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
5913,"“I would tweak them from there,” he says."
5914,"When Sierp joined the FDNY in 2003, assigned to Ladder 169 in Brighton Beach, he continued to cook for his crew."
5915,"“The guys in the firehouse are much more difficult to cook for than the frat guys,” says Sierp, who cooked “everything from fish to steak to pork chops to pasta dishes, soups, to different types of crazy sandwiches. You name it, I cooked it.”"
5916,"Sierp’s baptism by fire in the restaurant business began 10 years ago at M1-5 in TriBeCa. With no experience other than his frat house and fire station cooking, plus his mom’s advice, he answered a call from one of his old frat brothers, Serge Zborovsky (a partner in Home Base), who asked him to be the chef at his new restaurant."
5917,"“I had no experience with being a restaurant chef,” Sierp says. “He just knew I was a good cook and I loved food and was passionate, and I learned on the fly how to be a restaurant cook.”"
5918,"“I asked questions and read recipe books and took a class on catering, and that class was the only formal training I ever had,” Sierp continues."
5919,"Since then, Sierp has consulted for three Staten Island restaurants, The Hop Shoppe, The Pizza Parlor and Richmond Republic."
5920,"He’s also made the TV rounds, perfecting some of his techniques as a two-time contestant on “Chopped,” where he came in second place both times. He was a judge on “Throwdown with Bobby Flay” and a guest on the “Rachael Ray Show” and “The Martha Stewart Show,” where he cooked a pasta dish with chicken and a sherry cream sauce that he perfected at Ladder 169."
5921,"“We got along really well,” Sierp recalls of Stewart. “We joked, I even asked her out on a date.”"
5922,"Sierp is now a lieutenant at Ladder 8, aka the “Ghostbusters” firehouse, in TriBeCa. As a lieutenant he no longer cooks for his crew. But of course you can find him in the kitchen at Home Base (which was previously the restaurant Raise New York, where Sierp was also the executive chef)."
5923,"""We came up with the name because we wanted to be like a second home,"" Sierp says. ""We wanted to be a home base for people in the area."""
5924,"Home Base is located at 416 Third Ave. and is open Monday-Friday starting at 5 p.m. and at 11 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday. For more info, visit homebasebistro.com."

6023,"Who created the first Coney Island hot dog? No, it wasn't Nathan Handwerker of Nathan's Famous."
6024,"According to historian Michael Quinn, the man widely believed to have invented the hot dog was Charles Feltman. In 1867, Feltman, a German immigrant, began serving sausages on pastry buns made at his bakery in Park Slope. He called them Coney Island Red Hots (not spicy, just hot in temperature and red in color!). Handwerker was actually his employee!"
6025,"Quinn, a lover of history and Coney Island, says the time has come to set the record straight. Feltman's of Coney Island makes its debut on May 28."
6026,"""We have so much history down here,"" said Quinn, 39, who grew up near Coney and never left Brooklyn. ""In the past couple of years, Coney Island has seen such a chance. This is the best its been in my lifetime... These days, when people order food, they like a story behind it."""
6027,"Feltman's will first operate as a pop-up, starting at Sycamore in Ditmas Park. In the meantime, Quinn will search for a permanent location along Surf Avenue, where it all began."
6028,"Feltman's will sell natural (no nitrate) all-beef hot dogs to start and will eventually also sell pork sausages. He will use potato rolls, not pastry rolls. Each dog will cost $2, compared to $4.15 at Nathan's. According to Quinn, Handwerker undercut Feltman back when he first started Nathan's in 1916, selling dogs for 5 cents compared to Feltman's 10 cents."
6029,Quinn said the idea to bring Feltman's back has long been an interest to him. He is the editor of the local website TheConeyIslandBlog.com and also runs Coney Island Walking Tours.

6034,"The idea has created a lot of buzz, too."

6045,"British chef Dan Doherty — a judge on the new BBC show “Britain’s Best Home Cook” alongside “Great British Baking Show” alum Mary Berry — is set to open his first restaurant on American soil at the 28-acre mixed-use development on Manhattan’s far West Side next spring, according to a news release circulated Tuesday."
6046,The former executive chef at London’s 24/7 dining destination Duck & Waffle has partnered with the London-based hospitality group rhubarb to launch his yet-to-be named restaurant and bar on the fifth floor of Hudson Yard’s The Shops & Restaurants building on 10th Avenue.
6047,"Don’t expect to order shepherd’s pie and fish and chips at Doherty’s new eatery. The concept is “East meets West,” with a menu featuring dishes the likes of Singapore chili crab croquettes; scallops apple, kohlrabi and Chinese chili oil; and beef fillet, chili, daikon and soy-cured egg. (With the preponderance of chili, we’re guessing things will get spicy.)"
6048,"On the table on weekends, you’ll find brunch mash-up items: English breakfast bibimbap with fried rice, egg, smoked bacon and spiced sausage; black sesame waffles with smoked miso ice cream; and Korean pancakes. "
6049,"The design of the 5,800-square-foot space on the fifth floor of The Shops & Restaurants will also reflect the “East meets West” theme, with “teak timber screens and oriental features, seamlessly blending industrial west with authentic east,” according to the news release."

6065,"The award-winning D.C.-based chef’s first New York project, Mercado Little Spain, is among the buzzy dining concepts to lure diners to Manhattan’s Far West Side now that Hudson Yards is opens.The massive commercial and residential development excited Andrés because it is “a completely new neighborhood in a city that I’ve loved ever since I came to this country.”"
6066,"Mercado is one of the more than two dozen restaurants, bars, cafes and shops that make up Hudson Yards’ dining collection. In its conceptual stages, it has been likened to a Spanish Eataly and will celebrate the cuisine and culture of Andrés’ native Spain through three restaurants, two bars and more than a dozen kiosks serving tapas."
6067,"“New York is a city of beautiful immigrants, Spanish and many, many others, and what we’ve tried to create with Mercado Little Spain is our tribute to my native country, a little piece of Spain in an exciting new corner of Manhattan,” Andrés says. "
6068,"Mercado will be accompanied by new restaurants from other world-famous chefs, from David Chang’s Kāwi to Michael Lomonaco’s Hudson Yards Grill, along with new-to-New-York concepts, like Bay Area-based sustainable meat company Belcampo and department store Neiman Marcus’ eatery Zodiac Room."
6069,"The menu of options will also be lush with local food brands, like Shake Shack, Van Leeuwen Artisan Ice Cream, Fuku, Jack’s Stir Brew and Citarella."

6072,"Development group Related Urban teamed up with chef Thomas Keller to curate Hudson Yard’s culinary lineup. They worked to ensure different price points and diverse cuisine to offer “something for everyone in this neighborhood coming to life,” says Kevin Stuessi, vice president of Related Companies, who compared the process of developing a coherent culinary program to building a puzzle and finding fits for the missing pieces."
6073,"As a dining destination, Hudson Yards will enhance the options for visitors to the High Line, with its proximity to the elevated park’s north end, and the Javits Center. It will also serve a bridge between Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen. For Stuessi, a highlight will be the outdoor space — a premium in Manhattan — which has inspired restaurants to offer picnic baskets and boxed items to go."
6074,"The majority of new restaurants are slated to open this Friday, an almost unfathomable feat in a city where opening day can be synonymous with delays and postponement."
6075,"“We have an absolutely incredible construction and tenant coordination team,” Stuessi says with a laugh when asked how they’re pulling off the large batch of openings. “They’re working with us to bring them all to life in one moment.”"
6076,"Already, there’s a sense of community in the new neighborhood."
6077,"“You see people from different restaurants walking in each other’s spots, grabbing a coffee,” Stuessi says."
6078,The benefit of proximity has also helped the restaurants work together on staffing and supply needs; Stuessi recounts that the hospitality businesses were able to share applicants with their neighbors when good candidates presented themselves but job openings were already filled.
6079,"“There is a sense of camaraderie with everyone opening a restaurant in Hudson Yards at the same time,” says Sam Gelman, vice president of operations at Fuku, Momofuku’s fast-casual fried chicken sandwich mini-chain."
6080,"The Hudson Yards outpost will feature Fuku’s new bone-in fried chicken program and menu of sides, along with its signature spicy fried chicken sandwiches and chicken fingers. "
6081,"In addition to familiar names like Fuku and Shake Shack, Hudson Yards will see a few eateries dipping into the New York dining scene for the first time, like Belcampo. It’ll be serving its burgers, grass-fed and finished steaks, bone broth on tap and bone broth-based soups for the first time outside of California."
6082,"Grain bowls with fresh veggies will also be new to the menu, a nod to the potential regulars living and working at Hudson Yards who may crave a lighter option. Another change Belcampo is making for Manhattanites: takeout."
6083,"“We’re planning on launching with a focus on food delivery systems like Seamless and Grubhub,” says Anya Fernald, co-founder and CEO of Belcampo, who is anticipating an “immediate high volume” of orders from hungry New Yorkers who don’t like to wait."
6084,"Correction: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story did not note the restaurants are opening Friday."
6085,"More than 25 restaurant and food concepts are planned for Hudson Yards, with a majority making their debut this week. (Some, like Sweetgreen, have already opened, while others, like new concepts from Danny Meyer in The Shed and Stephen Starr in the Equinox Hotel, as well as a Maison Kayser, will follow.) Here’s a look at everything on the food front that’s slated to open on Friday: "

6114,"Ice & Vice, founded by Paul Kim and Ken Lo, is known for its unusual flavors. The Lower East Side shop packed up its cups and cones and opened a temporary midtown kiosk on Monday, focused entirely on politically themed flavors. The menu includes “Freeze Global Warming,” a grape and lavender ice cream, “No Means No,” a raspberry rose lemonade flavor, “No Borders,"" vanilla and chocolate brownie chunk coated with dulce de leche, and “No Hate,"" a vanilla ice cream with raspberry jam filling and rainbow sprinkles. "

6116,"Chelsea Lipman, the graphic designer and founder behind the “I Scream” kiosk concept, said the pop-up was inspired by the Women’s March in Washington."
6117,"“Being a 24-year-old graphic designer, I just didn’t really have any disposable income to give so I came up with ‘I Scream’ actually as a play on words. So, it’s ‘I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream,’” she explained as a line of hungry customers continued to grow behind her. ""We’re all screaming about different things. When we come together as a collective, that’s how we’re able to get things done.”"
6118,"Lipman partnered with Ice & Vice through Urbanspace, an organization aiming to build pop-up markets across the city.  "
6119,"“I really hope that people come to this kiosk and feel inspired and realize that first of all, you can make a difference no matter how much money you do or don’t have, and, second, that everybody deserves to be heard and should be heard,” she said."

6174,Meat
6175,"Almost everyone loves a burger. (Don't forget cheese for those who want a little ooze on their patty.) But in order for your party to be a real stunner, why not offer a few different options? We like Italian sausages, skirt steak (which cooks great on a charcoal grill) and, of course, Nathan's all-beef franks."
6176,Vegetables
6177,"Not everyone eats meat, and even those who do generally want a veggie on the side. An easy and fast way to serve veggies at a barbecue is to shish kebab them. Chop up whatever veggies you like -- onions, peppers, tomatoes, eggplant -- into chunks, put on skewers and marinate before adding to the grill. Asparagus (especially now when it's in season) is a definite crowd-pleaser. Rule of thumb for veggies: Marinating is key."

6179,"Dressed-up condiments are an easy way to take your barbecue spread to the next level. Jalapeno and cumin mayo (just mix them together!) is a great topping for burgers or a dipping sauce for veggies.

6207,"It's all part of the vision of developers Belvedere Capital, Jamestown and Angelo Gordon to make the 6-million-square-foot warehouse complex into a destination for the city's ""innovation economy"" of creative startups, tech firms and manufacturers."
6208,"""In New York City and beyond, the artisanal and ethnic food industry has exploded -- entrepreneurs want to make things again, and often they want to make food, and consumers are much more interested in a locally-made, sustainable product,"" said Industry City CEO Andrew Kimball. ""That fits in very well with the kind of authentic, locally-made vibe that we're trying to bring to Industry City across every sector, not just food."""

6251,"Most recently, the city got a couple of European chain outposts: Ben’s Cookies from the U.K. and Ole & Steen from Denmark."
6252,"Known for its “chunks not chips” cookies, Ben’s Cookies opened a two-month pop-up by Penn Station earlier in the year, expanding briefly beyond its permanent and first U.S. store in Union Square."
6253,"The bakery, which came to the city in 2017, started in the U.K. in the 1980s and has expanded to several countries, including Kuwait, Japan and Singapore. Ben’s Cookies offers a range of flavors, including milk chocolate and peanut butter, snickerdoodle, lemon and coconut."

6256,"Also in Union Square, Danish bakery chain Ole & Steen opened its first stateside branch in January. Founded in 1991, the Copenhagen-based bakery is ubiquitous in the U.K. and Denmark, where it is known as Lagkagehuset. In the U.S. location, the bakery sells Danish classics such as the open-faced sandwich smørrebrød on carrot rye bread, ølander roll with Danish cured ham and Gouda cheese, and a soft cardamom bun called the kløben.  "
6257,"One big draw for these franchises to launch in NYC is the diverse customer base. That was the case with Hong Kong-originated Tim Ho Wan, which came to NYC in 2016, Chan said. "
6258,"If you can make it in New York, you can make it anywhere."
6259,"“Since New York City is one of the biggest cities, with a huge diversity of [ethnicities], different people with different taste buds, we figured why not New York?"""
6260,"Since 2010, Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong and neighboring Asian countries has attracted many with classic dim sum such as steamed shrimp dumplings and pan-fried turnip cake. Its star dish, though, is the famous baked barbecue pork buns, which are equally popular in the U.S., Chan said."
6261,"Tim Ho Wan has fared well in New York, Chan said, noting that it has fueled the brand’s expansion into other states. After opening another location in Hell’s Kitchen, outposts are now planned for Irvine, California, and Las Vegas."
6262,"“The people of New York have been very kind and good toward Tim Ho Wan,” he said. “Opening the flagship store in New York City in the East Village location has helped the brand a lot.” "
6263,"Also from Asia is TKK Fried Chicken, which opened in fall 2018 by Madison Square Park. TKK is a Taiwanese fried chicken restaurant that partnered with bubble tea chain Kung Fu Tea to come to NYC. Kung Fu Tea, which got its start in Flushing, and now has more than 200 outposts nationwide, recruited TKK for the partnership on a trip to Taiwan in 2016."
6264,"Famous for its fried chicken and kwa kwa bao, which are balls of fried chicken skin wrapped around sticky rice, mushroom and pork, TKK also offers chicken sandwiches and tenders, as well as combo meals. Because of the partnership, TKK has a full Kung Fu Tea stand within the restaurant, a unique feature for this location. Encouraging customers to enjoy chicken and bubble tea at once, the two brands want to make this combo the next burger and milkshake, said Joyce Xu, marketing associate for Kung Fu Tea and TKK."
6265,"For TKK, the biggest lure to setting up in NYC: its melting pot makeup, which encompasses groups far beyond those of Taiwanese descent, Xu said."
6266,"“The greatest thing about New Yorkers is their openness to diverse, international offerings.” "
6267,"The fact that the city is such a big gastronomic and cultural hub helped with TKK’s venture, she added. This “foodie” environment that results in many curious customers wanting to try new or unfamiliar products makes the city an even bigger attraction, she said."
6268,“TKK has no doubt benefited as the first Taiwanese chain to offer Taiwanese-style chicken like drumsticks and thighs.”
6269,"Speaking of fried chicken, South Korea’s Pelicana Fried Chicken also opened its first U.S. store in Flushing, in 2014. That location gained a lot of traction, enough for Pelicana to open six more spots in the city since. Beyond Flushing, it counts shops in Astoria, Bayside, and Sunnyside in Queens, Koreatown in Manhattan, and Fort Greene and Greenpoint in Brooklyn."
6270,"Like most Korean fried chicken places, Pelicana, which has been around in Korea since the early 1980s, gives diners the option to get regular, undressed fried chicken or poultry coated with a spicy sauce – or, half and half. In the U.S. spots, customers have a wider variety of sauces, such as honey garlic, scallion and spicy barbecue, which can be served on the side as a dipping sauce instead with the pieces tossed in it. Aside from fried, the restaurant offers chicken sandwiches, burgers and sides including onion rings and cheese sticks."
6271,"In the past two years, other international chains, including German’s Soup from Guyana, Ikinari Steak from Japan, Bourke Street Bakery from Australia and Copper Branch from Canada, have come to NYC as an entry point to the U.S. And in the coming months, diners can expect even more overseas places to plant outposts in the city. Chains slated to open in the spring and summer include Zooba, an Egyptian street food restaurant based in Cairo, and Uncle Tetsu, a Japanese cheesecake shop (currently only on the West Coast)."
6272,"As the city continues to bring in more people from around the world, expect the restaurant scene to continue to expand and evolve. The “diverse, lively and adventurous” culture makes NYC an attraction for businesses, TKK’s Xu said."
6273,"“NYC is a key destination for the best food and drinks, a place frequented by foodies, tourists, people from all walks of life,” Xu said."

6291,You can find an Irish music session every Monday and a perfectly poured pint of Guinness daily.

"
6294,"If you took a small Dublin pub, brightly painted front door and all, put it in the belly of an Aer Lingus jet and then trucked it to Clinton Hill, you’d have Hartley’s."
6295,"True to form, every Monday evening, Irish music fills the tiny, two-year-old bar — not just during St. Patrick’s Day shenanigans."
6296,"At a recent session, Dan Neely, who has a doctorate in ethnomusicology and has written about the history of ice cream truck music, was on tenor banjo. He was joined by Matt Stapleton on guitar and Katie Fischer, a TV producer, on fiddle."
6297,"It was Neely’s first time playing at Hartley’s, but the musicians are hardly strangers. In New York’s Irish music circle, there are few degrees of separation. Stapleton played at the Cuckoo’s Nest in Woodside for years with Kevin McHugh, a uilleann piper, and Neely joined them there frequently; Fischer was a regular at Neely’s session at Lillie’s near Union Square."
6298,"At Hartley’s — owned by Irish transplants Mike O’Sullivan, Jim Dunn and Dan Grace — there’s no stage. The musicians grab a chair or a pew-like bench against the wall and sit among the patrons — not unlike the intimate setup in any pub back in the old sod. There’s often a pint on the table and an Irish sandwich within arm’s reach as bar-goers tap their feet to the jigs and reels."
6299,"“It’s an extremely cozy arrangement, but it really gives the players a chance to build up a rapport with the regulars,” Neely said."
6300,"There’s hardly ever a set list. Most of the tunes played by the trio came from the book “O’Neill’s Music of Ireland,” published in 1903, Neely said."

6302,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
6303,"“Irish musicians everywhere in the world play songs from O’Neill’s,” said the musician. “It’s one of the main repositories of tunes and remains hugely influential.”"
6304,The ensemble wowed the tightly packed bar with “Sunnyside” by a contemporary musician named Niall Vallely. The jig is an ode to the section of Queens where many Irish immigrated.
6305,"Accompanying the tunes, Hartley’s offers a menu of traditional Irish fare made from scratch in a basement kitchen by Bushwick-born chef Ernesto Barnaby. There’s popcorn with Irish cheddar for $6 to pair with a perfectly poured, properly chilled pint of Guinness. The spiced beef sandwich ($13), with onions and cheddar on house-made soda bread, comes steaming warm from the kitchen. The Irish cheddar toastie with salmon ($12) features soda bread topped with house-cured salmon and cheddar imported from Ireland."
6306,"Cheri Keating, a makeup artist who recently moved to Brooklyn from Los Angeles, was “lured into Hartley’s by the promise of a Guinness poured right and at the right temperature and real Irish stew,” and ended up staying for the music, too."
6307,"“I had delightful conversations, shared some laughs and even made a new friend,” she said. “I guess I found my new local.”"
6308,"For St. Patrick’s Day weekend, Hartley’s, located at 14 Putnam Ave., will have an Irish music session on Friday starting at 5:30 p.m. On Saturday, it opens its doors early, at 10 a.m. The music starts up again on Sunday at 6:30 p.m."

6327,"For a 15-year stretch ending in 2005, Coogan's co-owner Peter Walsh showed up to work every St. Patrick's Day at the ungodly hour of 5 a.m. He needed time to prepare for the annual holiday breakfast party, hosted at the Washington Heights mainstay by a cardiologist with an expertise in Irish poetry. The price of admission to Dr. Michael Cohen's fete? Only the recitation of a William Butler Yeats poem.
""That was my favorite way to start St. Paddy's Day,"" says Walsh, 71, of the tradition.

6350,"
	  Victoria Blamey, formerly of Chumley's, is the challenger on this weekend's episode of ""Iron Chef America.""       Photo Credit: Food Network     "
6351,"A double-decker burger soaked in bone marrow, slathered in American cheese and sprinkled with crispy shallots brought “Iron Chef America” contestant Victoria Blamey to the forefront of the public’s attention last year: In a New York Times review of the revived Chumley’s, critic Pete Wells praised the chef’s creation as “an erotic poem on the theme of fat,” a greasy mess well worth the $25 price tag."
6352,"A few days before her showdown with Iron Chef Stephanie Izard was scheduled to air on the Food Network, Blamey couldn’t reveal the featured secret ingredient that anchors each televised cook-off during our phone interview, but a teaser for the episode that aired Sunday hinted that the “New York burger master” has “a beef” with her competitor."
6353,"So let us set the record straight: Blamey enjoys an occasional burger as much as the next person, but she’d rather be cooking seafood."
6354,"“I’m not the kind of person to be cooking T-bones and rib-eyes and stuff like that. I come from a culture in Chile that we love meat, but I love a big variety of things,” explained the Chilean native, who currently lives in Brooklyn Heights."
6355,"She’d never even served a burger before her time at Chumley’s, the historic West Village speakeasy that restaurateur Alessandro Borgognone relaunched as a restaurant in late 2016."
6356,"“I understood I had to make a burger, so [the 86’d was] my version of a burger I would like to eat,” said the Atera alum, now 38. “It wasn’t a lot of brainpower. It was just literally things that I like eating.”"
6357,"But it wasn’t so much the food she served as the décor at Chumley’s — dim lighting, velvet curtains and leather banquettes and stools — that fed Blamey’s reputation as a “beef chef,” Blamey says."
6358,"“I’m tired of hearing so much meat going on, to be really honest.”"
6359,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
6360,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
6361,Blamey said her next project (she left Chumley’s in December for “personal” reasons) will ideally be more focused on the fruits of the sea.
6362,"At a pop-up dinner at Fitzcarraldo Project in Bushwick this April, her menu incorporated some Chumley’s favorites alongside the kinds of dishes she really likes cooking and eating: spicy fish head stew; pickled oysters with avocado, white chocolate and cauliflower; grilled mackerel with braised seaweed and fried walnuts."
6363,"Blamey is still in talks with hospitality groups that can provide the kind of infrastructure and equity share she’s looking for in her next gig, she says, but she already has a clear idea of the restaurant she’d like to open. Ideally, it would serve innovative “larger tapas”-sized plates in a casual setting with more than 60 seats. Sustainably sourced seafood and game meats, like rabbit, would be on the menu."
6364,"“I don’t want to serve something that is boring. So many things right now are more of the same,” she says, echoing New York magazine Adam Platt’s recent critique of neighborhood restaurants. “So much money thrown into the decoration, and then the food is almost like a second act.”"
6365,It’s between two acts of her own that Blamey agreed to an “Iron Chef America” showdown.
6366,"“I used to watch it, because my ex-husband loved the show, but then when I came here and I was working, I barely watched TV,” she said."
6367,"When the series reached out to her in December before launching a 13th season earlier this month, she was thrilled and the timing was just right. The contestant asked two former Chumley’s colleagues to serve as her sous chefs and entered Kitchen Stadium prepared to take the competition seriously in January."
6368,"“It’s super intense,” she said of the experience. “You go into this battle and you seriously forget about everything you’ve ever done.”"
6369,"When the taping was over, her team headed to the nearest In-N-Out for…. you guessed it: “I had whatever the biggest burger was,” Blamey recalled, referring to the chain’s off-the-menu “Animal-style,” “and I ate it in like two seconds.”"

6679,Awards organizers named a total of nine local chefs as finalists for one of the country’s most notable accolades in the restaurant industry.
6680,"The female contenders up for recognition as the nation’s top culinary professionals are: Dianna Daoheung, executive chef at Black Seed Bagels, in the outstanding baker category; Gabrielle Hamilton, chef and owner of the East Village’s Prune, in the outstanding chef category; Clare de Boer, chef at Hudson Square’s King (rising star chef of the year); and Amanda Cohen of Dirty Candy, Missy Robbins of Lilia and Jody Williams of Buvette Gastrothèque (best chef in New York City)."
6681,"James Beard Awards judges — experts in their fields who aren’t employed by the foundation or on its board — have previously recognized Hamilton’s New American fare, Robbins’ housemade pastas, Williams’ small French plates and Cohen’s vegetable-centric dishes as noteworthy contenders."
6682,"But their high-profile salute to six women chefs in New York City comes in 2018 amid broader discussions of the limited representation and acknowledgment of women in professional kitchens across America, as well as the widespread incidence of sexual harassment in the restaurant industry. "
6683,"In an essay for Esquire in November, Cohen herself described women as “second-class citizens in the restaurant world. "
6684,"“We have less access to investors and are perceived as less profitable investments because, in large part, we have smaller profiles than male chefs,” she wrote. “We get nominated for fewer awards, our restaurants get reviewed less often, and we get less press coverage than men.”"
6685,"Critics have observed that the Michelin Guide, the gastronomic bible assigning highly coveted stars, has repeatedly overlooked widely acclaimed restaurants led by women, including Lilia and Prune. Women chefs lead only six of the 72 starred restaurants in the 2018 edition."

6690,"“Culture shift takes time, but as an organization that people look toward to shape cultural norms within our industry, we feel a responsibility to drive real impact,” Quatrano said."
6691,"James Beard Award winners will be named on May 7, at a gala at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. "

6717,"It opened with little fanfare last month, but the soft launch is no indication of quantity or quality: Japan Village is a massive mecca for Japanese food lovers. Across 20,000 square feet, the market-food hall hybrid is a one of a kind in NYC and offers yet another reason to travel to Sunset Park."
6718,"Adding to the burgeoning Industry City — after two years in the works — Japan Village quietly welcomed customers on Nov. 17. But, within weeks, it was already enjoying a noisily crowded space and long lines, with patrons flocking for Asian grocery shopping taken to another level."
6719,"From the exterior, you’ll know Japan Village by the extensive koi fish murals. Inside, the warehouse space houses the biggest Sunrise Mart in the city — it's owned by the father and son behind that market, which has three locations in Manhattan — as well as a food court of sorts with several stands, including one sit-down restaurant, a bar and a liquor store. "
6720,Japan Village owners Tony Yoshida and son Takuya Yoshida were recruited by Industry City’s director of development Jim Somoza a couple of years ago to give patrons a real Japanese cuisine experience.
6721,"“What we wanted was you to go in and truly feel like you were transported to Tokyo,” Somoza said. “It’s very important to us that everything is totally authentic.”"
6722,"After moving to Brooklyn from Manhattan, where he lived near longtime Japanese grocery store Katagiri, Somoza didn't find viable options for Japanese groceries in his new borough; this fueled his desire to bring one to Industry City, the multibuilding complex with an array of restaurants, retail shops, offices and a courtyard. "
6723,"Somoza promptly reached out to the Yoshidas, who also own the popular speakeasy Angel’s Share and Michelin-starred Kyo Ya. The initial plan was to open up another Sunrise Mart, but it quickly snowballed. "

6726,"“It grew from a 2,000-square-foot Sunrise Mart to a 20,000-square-foot Japan Village,” Somoza said. "
6727,"Upon entering, on the right side is the newest Sunrise Mart, which offers a wide variety of produce, snacks and other goods imported from Japan. While it sells items similar to ones found in other Asian grocery stores, the selection is extensive for virtually every kind of product. "
6728,"Customers can find items like the popular Japanese Kit-Kats, which come in flavors (green tea, raspberry, rum raisin) not found in their American counterparts, a big collection of matcha powders, Tohato cookies and other snacks, instant noodles and frozen gyoza. It also has meat, tofu and seafood sections with wagyu, washugyu beef, homemade bean curd and sashimi-grade fish. "
6729,"With these offerings, “we want to further spread the culture here and highlight all 47 of Japan's prefectures, especially ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics,” Tony Yoshida said in a statement.  He seeks to accomplish this, he noted, through partnering with Japanese companies that have made their products in traditional ways for generations. "
6730,"Even though it is still in its soft-open phase, the mart is seeing a lot of foot traffic, with checkout lines stretching along the perimeter of the store on a recent visit. Despite the wait, one customer particularly enjoyed this section of Japan Village."
6731,"“The most interesting part, for me, is the grocery store. I love to see products from other parts of the world, and they offer a lot,” said Laura Peruchi, an Upper East Sider."
6732,"Steps away from the grocery store is a large array of Japanese eats, with both fast-casual and sit-down options — something the other Japanese grocery stores in the city don’t have. Most of the dining spots are stands where customers simply order, pick up the food and sit at nearby tables, which are scattered throughout the space. "
6733,"Among your options are Café Japon, a coffee shop and bakery; Moriya, serving donburi (rice bowls); Gohei, focused on udon and soba noodles; street food stand Hachi, with takoyaki and okonomiyaki (octopus balls and savory pancakes, respectively); and ramen-centric Setagaya. The casual food stands are priced cheap to moderate, depending on the booth, going from $3 for an onigiri, or rice ball, to $15 for a bowl of black garlic ramen. And at Gohei and Setagaya, customers can sit right in front of the chefs and watch them prep their meal."
6734,"Adding to the mix is sit-down restaurant Wakuwaku, an izakaya and cocktail bar with a menu of Japanese-style tapas, skewers and sashimi planned for its January opening. Also still to debut is liquor store Kuraichi, with sake and Japanese whiskey among its offerings. "
6735,And there's more.
6736,"Plans are underway for a targeted summer 2019 reveal of a second floor, with items expanding beyond foods to cosmetics, pottery and paper goods. All will be imported from Japan, with the Yoshidas tapping small to midsize exporters who usually don’t have the means to sell their products overseas. "
6737,"“The idea is to bring all of these additional products made traditional ways,” Somoza said."
6738,"Going forward, Tony Yoshida seeks to continue sharing “everything we love about Japan with our local community in a fun and authentic way."" And Somoza promises to keep that authenticity. "
6739,"“My only real goal is, and I know this is going to happen, I want it to maintain a very authentic Japanese feel and experience,” he said. “That is very, very important to us.” "

6748,"Buckle your seatbelts and let down your tray tables: JetBlue flights to California are getting romantic. That is, if you’re wooed by wine and cheese."
6749,"JetBlue is quickly becoming the food lover’s airline. After establishing itself as the first U.S. airline to serve rosé in the sky in August 2015, JetBlue partnered with NYC’s Saxon and Parole (316 Bowery) to design seasonal, high altitude-friendly culinary options for first class passengers."
6750,"In October, JetBlue launched a blue potato farm at Kennedy Airport, the first of its kind, growing 1,000 pounds of potatoes and 2,000 herb plants each season in organic soil supplemented by food waste from Terminal 5. The produce is used in JetBlue’s in-flight options, including Terra potato chips, as well as in airport food service."
6751,"And beyond luxe in-flight options and farm-to-sky snacks, JetBlue is pleasing high altitude epicureans with a gourmet, curated snack box right out of a Flatiron hot spot: Beecher’s Handmade Cheese (900 Broadway)."
6752,"Three single-pour wine bottles specifically chosen for their palatability at high altitudes -- Reserve de la Baume Colombard-Chardonnay, Reserve de la Baume Cabernet Sauvignon and Segura Viudas sparkling wine -- all pair with Beecher’s cheeses, sold on flights from NYC to San Francisco and Los Angeles. "
6753,"Beecher’s selected four cheeses -- Aged Flagship (nutty, crumbly) , Dutch Hollow Dulcet (creamy), Marco Polo (peppery, buttery) and Jamaican Jerk-seasoned No Woman (spicy, smoky) -- based on their creaminess, saltiness and deep flavor profiles to best translate to the tastes of a snacker at 30,000-feet altitude, a Beecher’s representative explained at a media tasting on Thursday night. Though she had yet to take a JetBlue flight with a Beecher’s box, she admitted to bringing snacks from Beecher’s on other flights, which is pretty good advice for any traveler. "
6754,Beecher’s cheese retails at $19-22 per pound at the store and $12 for an in-flight snack box with pre-sliced tasting portions.

With your fingertips, a pastry blender, 2 knives, or steel blade of the food processor, mix, cut, or process butter into the dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal with a few slightly larger butter lumps. Add the fresh herb(s) of choice and toss lightly to distribute."
6798,"If making by hand, stir in buttermilk with a rubber spatula or fork until mixture forms into soft, slightly sticky ball. If dough feels firm and dry bits are not gathering into a ball, sprinkle dough clumps with additional tablespoon of buttermilk (or milk for the yogurt dough). Be careful not to overmix. If using food processor, pulse until dough gathers into moist clumps. Remove from food processor bowl and form into rough ball."
6799,"With lightly floured hands, divide dough into 12 equal portions. Lightly bat a portion of dough back and forth a few times between floured hands until it begins to form a ball, then pat lightly with cupped hands to form a rough ball. Repeat with remaining dough, placing formed dough rounds 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheet or pizza pan. Brush dough tops with melted butter or milk. (May be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to 2 hours.) Bake until biscuit tops are light brown, 10 to 12 minutes."

	  A page from the new book ""Food Anatomy,"" by Julia Rothman       Photo Credit: Julia Rothman/Storey Publishing     "
6845,Julia Rothman doesn’t consider herself a foodie. But she is fascinated by food.
6846,"The Brooklyn illustrator has done two books that are in the food realm — “Farm Anatomy” and “Nature Anatomy” — and her third, “Food Anatomy” (out now, $16.95) is all about how we eat, from place settings to exotic fruits to sandwiches of the world to common cakes."
6847,"“I like eating good food and I go out to dinner a lot, but I’m not in that world,” says the illustrator, 36. “I’m an average person who loves to eat and wanted to learn about food and explore it through drawing.”"
6848,We spoke with Rothman about her latest book.
6849, 
6850,Did anything you learned in making this surprise you?
6851,"It’s the quirkier stuff that I like the most, like learning the short order lingo for restaurants — like Adam and Eve on a log are two eggs and sausage. I didn’t know those things, and it’s funny to find out and think about what’s going on in the back kitchen. I went and watched people make noodles — that was really interesting. In Finland, we made traditional Finnish rye bread from a root [sourdough starter] that was 100 years old. And trying all the fruits that I’ve never tried before. Trying to eat a durian — that didn’t go so well. I didn’t actually get it into my mouth — the smell, I thought I would puke. All I did was a small drawing of a durian in the book, but I felt like I still wanted to try it and experience that. I did as much as I could while we were working on this. I can’t draw it without eating it, that won’t be right."

6855,What local research went into the book?
6856,"A lot of the things from other countries I would try to find here, so like going to Flushing, Queens, and going to the Asian markets there. I did that a couple times. Going to Sahadi’s, a Middle Eastern grocery store. The spices were all there. I was writing every single spice down to make sure I had gotten them all to see if we wanted to include them in the book, because half of them I didn’t know. I love that place. I love buying all the stuff in bulk, the way it’s handled, the number you get and they call your number — an old-style kind of place."
6857, 
6858,Did you travel anywhere else beyond Finland?
6859,"I was going to Uganda anyway, because my sister researches primates there. While I was there I ate all the food there, and some of that made it in — matooke, these squished bananas. Also I was in Amsterdam and was eating all the cheeses there. Anywhere I traveled, I tried to eat things, because I knew this book was coming up. In Finland, I got to go to a strawberry farm and ate strawberries for two days straight, they were amazing. The sweetest strawberries I’ve ever had. Karelian pies are also made there — traditional Finnish rye bread on the outside, and then there’s rice porridge poured into it — it’s a little pastry. I can’t find that in New York at all. I find that very surprising, because it’s an amazing, delicious thing. I think people would love it here."
6860, 
6861,"Going in, did you have anything you knew you wanted to be included?"
6862,"The thing that wanted me to do this book was learning about cashews and how they grow. One day I was like, how do cashews grow? I learned there’s this apple, and they’re at the bottom, and there’s this one cashew for each of these fruits. It was a crazy revelation as I’m stuffing my face of cashews by the handful. That’s how this whole thing got started. Once I found that out, I thought, I better check on every nut. Are there other nuts that grow in weird ways and I never thought about it? I think the average person doesn’t think about that — how does this grow, where did it come from, how did it get here? I think it makes you appreciate food more."
6863, 
6864,Why do you think illustrated books are appealing?
6865,"These books are really accessible. It’s a simple way to explain things, with drawings and pictures. It’s not these really long, dense paragraphs of information — it’s more like little details that are really interesting and fascinating to people. And I think it covers a wide range of stuff. It was nice to hear that it appealed to young people as well, I didn’t expect that, I thought it was an adult book. But a lot of librarians and people who home school are into the books because they use them to teach their kids about farms and nature, which is amazing. On Instagram, people will tag me and it will be like, kids sitting with the books and redrawing the pictures. When I was a kid, I did the same thing with books. It’s come full circle, it’s heartwarming to see that."

6898,"Alan Rosen, third generation owner of Junior’s Restaurant, proudly upholds the family's cheesecake legacy. For over sixty years, generations of New Yorkers have visited Junior’s to eat fresh brisket, pastrami rubens, and of course, their New York Original Cheesecake, and also to kibbutz."
6899,Ingredients:
6900,-One recipe 9-inch Junior’s Sponge Cake Crust (recipe follows)
6901,-Four 8-ounce packages cream cheese (use only full fat) at room temperature
6902,-1 2?3 cups sugar
6903,-1?4 cup cornstarch
6904,-1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 2 extra-large eggs
6905,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
6906,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
6907,-3?4 cup heavy or whipping cream
6908,Method:
6909,"1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Generously butter the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides. Make and bake the cake crust and leave it in the pan. Keep the oven on."
6910,"2. Put one package of the cream cheese, 1?3 cup of the sugar, and the corn- starch in a large bowl and beat with an electric mixer on low until creamy, about 3 minutes, scraping down the bowl several times. Blend in the remaining cream cheese, one package at a time, scraping down the bowl after each one."
6911,"3. Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat in the remaining 11?3 cups sugar, then the vanilla. Blend in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after adding each one. Beat in the cream just until completely blended. Be careful not to overmix! Gently spoon the batter over the crust."
6912,"4. Place the cake in a large shallow pan containing hot water that comes about 1 inch up the sides of the springform. Bake until the edges are light golden brown and the top is slightly golden tan, about 11?4 hours. Remove the cheesecake from the water bath, transfer to a wire rack, and let cool for 2 hours (just walk away—don’t move it). Then, leave the cake in the pan, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until completely cold, preferably overnight or for at least 4 hours."
6913,"5. To serve, release and remove the sides of the springform, leaving the cake on the bottom of the pan. Place on a cake plate. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Slice the cold cake with a sharp straight-edge knife, not a serrated one. Cover any leftover cake and refrigerate or wrap and freeze for up to 1 month."
6914,"Master Baker Michael Goodman says: “Always bake the cheesecake in a water bath, as we do here at Junior’s. It keeps the heat in the oven moist and helps the cake bake slowly, gently, and evenly. This helps ensure that your cheesecake comes out of the oven with a smooth top—and no large cracks.”"
6915,Junior's Sponge Cake Crust
6916,Ingredients:
6917,For one 9-inch cake crust:
6918,-1?3 cup sifted cake flour
6919,-3?4 teaspoon baking powder
6920,-Pinch of salt
6921,"-2 extra-large eggs, separated"
6922,-1?3 cup sugar
6923,-1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
6924,-2 drops pure lemon extract
6925,"-2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted 1?4 teaspoon cream of tartar"
6926,Method:
6927,"1. Preheat the oven to 350°F and generously butter the bottom and sides of a 8- or 9-inch springform pan (preferably a nonstick one). Wrap the outside with aluminum foil, covering the bottom and extending all the way up the sides."
6928,"2. In a small bowl, sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together."
6929,"3. Beat the egg yolks in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high for 3 minutes. With the mixer running, slowly add 2 tablespoons of the sugar and beat until thick light yellow ribbons form, about 5 minutes more. Beat in the extracts."
6930,"4. Sift the flour mixture over the batter and stir it in by hand, just until no more white flecks appear. Now, blend in the melted butter."
6931,"5. Now, wash the mixing bowl and beaters really well (if even a little fat is left, this can cause the egg whites not to whip). Put the egg whites and cream of tartar into the bowl and beat with the mixer on high until frothy. Gradually add the remaining sugar and continue beating until stiff peaks form (the whites will stand up and look glossy, not dry). Fold about one-third of the whites into the batter, then the remaining whites. Don’t worry if you still see a few white specks, as they’ll disappear during baking."
6932,"6. Gently spread out the batter over the bottom of the pan, and bake just until set and golden (not wet or sticky), about 10 minutes. Touch the cake gently in the center. If it springs back, it’s done. Watch carefully and don’t let the top brown. Leave the crust in the pan and place on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on while you prepare the batter."

6939,"The home of the best cheesecake in the world won’t be leaving Brooklyn anytime soon, after its owner said yesterday that he rejected a $45 million bid to develop the site."
6940,"Alan Rosen, the third generation owner of Junior’s Restaurant, announced yesterday that he rethought his plans on selling the two-story building that is home to the flagship location of the eatery."
6941,"Rosen, 45, told amNewYork that he turned down offers to buy and develop the property at 386 Flatbush Avenue, including one for $45 million, because his family’s business has been too important to him and the community."
6942,"“You do a lot of soul searching during a process like this,” he said. “When you love something you realize how much it's not for sale.”"
6943,"City preservationists say the eatery’s change of fate is a relief in light of a string of closures of longtime shops and restaurants in the city such as Pearl Paint store, Rizzoli Bookstore and J & R Music and Computer World."
6944,Rosen had announced he was going to sell the 64-year-old Downtown Brooklyn restaurant in February and insisted that prospective buyers keep the restaurant open. He said at first he thought about closing the location and relocating to a nearby spot.
6945,"But after hearing the offers, he had to reconsider selling it, because some of the potential buyers showed no interest in keeping Junior’s open its original while they reveloped the site."

6949,"Rosen’s grandfather, uncle and father opened Junior’s in 1950 and the family has been close with the staff throughout the restaurant’s history."
6950,"Rosen said he enjoys chatting with the Brooklyn regulars and visitors who want a slice of the cheesecake from the original joint, even as the restaurant has grown into a chain throughout the tri-state area."
6951,"“People have been telling me great stories when they came here for anniversary or this and that,” he said."
6952,"Margaret Newman, the executive director of the Municipal Art Society of New York, said Junior’s kept the “vibrancy in the neighborhood.” “We think there's a certain amount of diversity that each neighborhood has and I think they're very much a part of the Brooklyn culture there. They've been there as long as I've been in New York,” she said."
6953,"Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the Historic Districts Council, who has frequented Juniors, said he was proud that Rosen put his family’s legacy above the money."
6954,"“I think it's wonderful that the owner, Mr. Rosen, is showing that there are other values to be upheld rather than monetary gain,” he said."
6955,"Rosen said he had a lot of sleepless nights before coming to his decision, but was satisfied after he received tremendous feedback from customers."
6956,"“Thank you all,” Rosen said of his customers. “We will be there for them and I can’t wait to see what the next 64 years will be.”?"

6966,"The end result is a quinoa-lentil-wheatberry blend, along with walnuts, roast cauliflower, broccoli coins, carrots, roasted tomatoes, shaved Parmesan and just a pinch of arugula, all mixed with a kale pesto dressing."
6967,"A version of this salad was a big hit last winter, as health-conscious New Yorkers are increasingly incorporating whole grains into their diets."
6968,"""People are eating carbs again, they just want healthy carbs,"" says Pensiero, who is a registered dietitian. ""Certainly grains fit the bill -- they give that good type of fiber that satiates you ... and soluable fiber that helps maintain good blood sugar levels and aids in heart disease prevention."""
6969,"The recipe calls for roasted tomatoes and roasted cauliflower, which, if you want to save some time in the kitchen, Pensiero recommends buying in a grocery store."
6970,"You could also buy a mixed-grain blend instead of cooking the different grains separately, she says."

7014,
7015, 
7016,Nutritionist Stephanie Pedersen first tried the ketogenic diet after several of her clients asked her about its weight-loss benefits.
7017,"Since then, she’s been seeing more buzz around the low-carb, high-fat diet, which is also used to treat neurological disorders and to manage health issues like type 2 diabetes. "
7018,"“I’m definitely seeing interest in the product world, the book world and just people in general,” Pedersen, 50, said. “Everyone wants to talk about it.”"
7019,"The author of more than 20 books, Pedersen explored the diet for her latest, “Keto Lunches: Grab-and-Go, Make-Ahead Recipes for High-Power, Low-Carb Midday Meals” (out March 20, $19.95)."
7020,amNewYork spoke with the Kips Bay resident about the diet. 
7021, 
7022,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
7023,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
7024,I feel like I’ve heard more about the keto diet in the last few months.
7025,"It’s so interesting, because it’s a quote-unquote old diet. It started in the 1920s to help treat epilepsy. It works really well for that. I think part of the reason it’s become popular is we had Atkins, then paleo came along. Now we have keto, which I tell people is like paleo on steroids. It’s the strictest of those low-carb diets. I think it’s just an outgrowth of the whole Atkins, paleo thing. "
7026, 
7027,What does the diet end up looking like?
7028,"When I say carbs, I mean all carbs, not just pasta. Sugar is a carbohydrate, so this diet is really low in fruit and even vegetables. It’s very restrictive of the types of vegetables that you can eat. "
7029, 
7030,What are some key foods people end up stocking up on?
7031,"Avocado is one of the few plants. Bacon — it’s pretty hard to be a keto if you’re a vegetarian. Organ meats like liverwurst show up a lot. Pork, beef, salmon, chicken thighs versus chicken breasts. Coconut has a few carbs in it but it does show up. Nut butters and nuts show up a tiny bit; because they have carbs they are super-limited. Basically avocado and bacon — those are the two you’re going to see. A lot of keto people believe in a lot of full-fat dairy. "
7032, 
7033,Was it challenging for you to come up with recipes?
7034,"It was funny to come up with the recipes. Basically, how many fats can we throw into this thing? But by the time I got to the 25th recipe I was like, man, these are going to start looking all the same unless we don’t start getting a little creative here. You can only use avocado and bacon in so many permutations. So there were challenges. The other challenge was, people like to look for what’s familiar, especially at lunch. How could I make this look like a sandwich even though we can’t use bread or wraps?"
7035, 
7036,How did you solve that?
7037,"In the keto world, you start looking at green veggies, which are usually the veggies that are totally compliant. You’d get something like a big leaf — a chard leaf is really popular because they get really big — and you load it up with all the fillings and you wrap it. If you want something that looks more like two slices of bread, a lot of ketos — and we do this in the book, too — will slice low-carb vegetables like eggplant the same thickness as bread and grill them. And some ketos will actually use the meat as bread. You’ll see people take two burgers and stuff the inside of the burger with bacon and cheese and avocado. It’s hilarious. "
7038, 
7039,Is this a diet you can do long-term?
7040,"That’s a question that comes up a lot with this particular diet. Some do get on it to get a health condition under control; there are a lot of people who do stay on this or try to for life. Because it is so restrictive, there are a lot of people who fall off the wagon and get back on."
7041, 
7042,Are there any negative side effects?
7043,"A lot of people at first will feel a lot of cravings for fruits and other sugars. That usually levels out after a week or two. Some notice when their body stops using glucose for energy and uses stored fat, they’ll notice some fatigue. That usually passes in a few days. The other thing is, you have to plan ahead. You have to bring your lunch, which is kind of a pain in the ass. You could be a difficult dinner guest. It could be hard to go out with friends. Those are things that are kind of a downside as well — your lifestyle is completely revolving around this. "
7044, 
7045,Are there any misconceptions about the diet you wanted to address?
7046,"I think a lot of people do not realize that it is not quite the same as Atkins. Atkins is much less restrictive — there’s more fruit, more veggies. There are keto people who won’t use ketchup or condiments because they have carbs in them. Another misconception is it’s just another low-carb diet. What makes keto different from other low-carb diets like paleo or Atkins is its emphasis on fats; it’s not just a low-carb diet, it’s a high-fat diet. "
7047,Burrito bowls are a popular lunchtime pick but can be hard to do on the keto diet thanks to the high-carb rice. So Pedersen knew she needed to include an option in “Keto Lunches.”
7048,"Instead of rice, her chicken enchilada bowl uses cauliflower rice. “That’s how I solved a lot of the no-grain issues,” she says. "
7049,And it can be topped with compliant toppings of your choosing.
7050,"“It makes people feel like they’ve having a treat,” Pedersen said. “And it’s super easy for people who aren’t super comfy in the kitchen — it’s just easy and foolproof.”"

7058,"3. Cook until the chicken is tender, about 10 minutes. Turn off the heat and remove just the chicken."
7059,4. Place the chicken in a large bowl. Shred the chicken using two forks.
7060,"5. Add the shredded chicken back to the sauce in the saute pan, and turn the heat to medium. Allow the mixture to simmer for 10 minutes or until any liquid has disappeared. Remove from the heat and set aside."
7061,"6. Meanwhile, prepare the cauliflower rice per the bag’s instructions and dice your preferred toppings."
7062,7. To assemble the bowls: Place the cauliflower rice in the bottom of a sealable food container. Layer with the chicken mixture. Top with toppings of your choice. Seal and place in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

	  Keurig K-Cup machines are hazardous to the environment.        Photo Credit: Keurig     "
7071,"Keurig K-Cups are extremely popular. The small, individual-size coffee pods are getting more and more popular at an unprecedented rate. A new article in The Atlantic reports that drip coffee-maker sales are stagnant, while pod-machine sales have increased six-fold since 2008."
7072,"You have a Keurig machine in your office, right? Maybe in your home, too?"
7073,There is often a dark underbelly to convenience and ease. Keurig technology does not run counter to this.
7074,There is even a robust campaign to boycott K-Cups called Kill the K-Cup (killthekcup.org).
7075,Reasons to throw your K-Cups to the curb:
7076,K-Cups can't be recycled and aren't biodegradable:
7077,"Because each pod is so indivudualized and easy to throw out, each pod also includes much more packaging. Each plastic pod goes right into the trash. So easy, but so irresponsible. The cups are made from plastic #7, which is recyclable in only select Canadian cities, The Atlantic reported."
7078,"""That plastic keeps the coffee inside protected like a nuclear bunker, and it also holds up during the brewing process. A paper prototype failed to accomplish as much."""
7079,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
7080,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
7081,(Note: Keurig says it wants all K-Cups to be recyclable by 2020.) In the meantime...
7082,"They are insanely popular, making the recycling issue even more pressing:"
7083,"Almost 1 in 3 American homes now has a ""pod-based coffee machine,"" according to The Atlantic. Last year, sales topped $9 billion. A recent report in Mother Jones reported that in 2013, the number of K-Cups in existence would circle the globe 10.5 times."
7084,They are expensive:
7085,"Ease always comes with a cost, but K-Cups are actually more expensive than you might even expect. A pound of high-end coffee (fair trade, roasting and growing process come into play here) is generally less than $20 per pound, but according to some number crunching in The New York Times, K-Cup pods command $50 per pound."
7086,"""When it comes to single-serve systems, you’re not just paying for coffee, you’re paying for convenience and the technology that makes it possible to brew a single cup in seconds."""
7087,And yet the quality is low:
7088,"People drink coffee for all kinds of reasons, and taste isn't always #1. In fact, according to The Washington Post, the boom in K-Cup popularity is due to convenience, more than anything else."
7089,"""The bulk of this country runs not on single-drip artisanal coffee, but standard, pre-ground coffee, which, by most coffee snobs' measures, is one of coffee's most inferior forms."""

7178,You don't have to be in New Orleans to enjoy the traditional king cake during Carnival season. 
7179,"The two-month period between Epiphany (Jan. 6) and Mardi Gras (March 5) is when the cakes are most in demand, especially at chef Olivier Dessyn's Mille-Feuille Bakery & Cafe, which has been busy pulling its galette de Rois out of the oven since December."
7180,"""People have been calling like crazy,"" said Matthew Parker, an employee at Mille-Feuille. ""They were in very high demand before [Epiphany] came and after. It's beyond delicious."""
7181,What is a king cake exactly?
7182,"There are two types of king cake — the traditional French galette des Rois, which is typically made to celebrate Epiphany (Three Kings Day), and the colorful king cake — baked to celebrate Mardis Gras. Both types hold a small figure that one must discover while eating it."
7183,"The galette typically holds a small crown or bean figurine while the king cake is baked with a small baby figure. The rule with both cakes is the same — whoever finds the figure is ""crowned"" ""king"" or ""queen"" for the day."
7184,How are they made?
7185,"A typical French galette is made with a top and bottom puff pastry, which sandwich frangipane, a custard-y filling. Mille-Feuille's Galette des Rois is made with almond cream and frangipane inside a flaky puff pastry and includes a small porcelain charm that is baked inside. "

7188,"“What is really funny is after January, we don’t talk galette anymore,” said Stephanie Liot, a spokeswoman for the bakery. “And shops won’t sell it in spring, summer or fall, even though the buttery crust puff dough is wonderful and the frangipane — the almond, custard cream and rum flavor — is so delicious. We are programmed to forget it and remember mid-December.”"
7189,"Most French bakeries sell the galette during January, but some like Mille-Feuille sell it until Mardi Gras."
7190,"The king cake associated with Mardi Gras is more of a brioche that is most popular in New Orleans, Loit said."
7191,"To celebrate the fun that comes with Carnival, the king cake is usually baked as a Bundt cake (there’s no middle) and is splashed with frosting before it is covered with royal purple, gold and green sprinkles. Instead of a bean, a baby figurine is placed inside."
7192,Why a baby?
7193,"The figurine, which is either plastic or porcelain, is meant to symbolize the baby Jesus, whether it’s a bean or a baby. But in recent years, the baby and bean have come to symbolize luck and prosperity. "
7194,"""We buy a large galette to share and we place it on the table,"" Liot said. ""A charm — a little fève (bean) in porcelain — is placed into the galette. The youngest person of the family has to go under the table and close his eyes and tells who gets the next slice."""
7195,Where can I find one in the city?

7510,Big aLICe Brewing Co. relies on local ingredients and vendors as it brings its barrel-aged beer program to Brooklyn.
7511,"
	  Kyle Hurst, co-founder of Big aLICe Brewing Co., draws a draft at the taproom's newest location in Industry City, Brooklyn.          "
7512,"You’ve heard of farm to table, but what about farm to taproom?  "
7513,"BIG aLICe BREWING CO., named for the Queens landmark “Big Allis” generator (and of course, its origin neighborhood), is taking its New York State Farm Brewery license seriously — sourcing local ingredients from city and state as much as possible, especially so as they expand with a new location in Industry City, Brooklyn."
7514,"Started by homebrewers Kyle Hurst and Scott Berger in 2013 on a 10-gallon pilot system, the duo later added a small taproom and expanded production in their LIC location on 43rd Road off Vernon Boulevard. In the following six years, they’ve increased distribution throughout the five boroughs, Long Island, greater New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and most recently, opened a dual location in Industry City with a full taproom and much more space for their barrel-aged beer program."
7515,"“When we first started out, it was more or less me and a fellow homebrewer thought we could get everybody else to pay for our hobby,” co-founder Hurst said with a chuckle. “After our first year open, we got the bigger equipment you see in Long Island City. Two years after that we got bigger fermenters, and another two years after that we added this place. So it’s been kind of a continual growth... it’s been a fun ride.”"
7516,"They team was passively looking for opportunities for expansion, and when they saw the new space at 52 34th St. on a whim, they knew they “needed to figure out how to make it happen,” Hurst said."
7517,"Besides the space itself, the location near other unique, growing business like Japan Village, Barrow’s Intense Ginger Liqueur and Brooklyn Kura makes a welcoming community for the brewers."
7518,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
7519,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
7520,"Being a licensed New York State Farm Brewery means that Big aLICe’s beer is primarily made from locally grown farm products. Hurst said his original brewing partner was in a community-supported agriculture program, so they’d try to use whatever came in that week or month’s delivery in their brew, and then “that just translated into what we’re doing now.”"
7521,"When they were first starting the business, Hurst said they were sure to include language in their operating agreement that they would “source local or sustainable products, to our own detriment, if necessary."
7522,"“We wanted that language so if we ever took on partners later, they would know we’re operating that way intentionally,” he said. “Not necessarily what’s best for the bottom line, but what’s best for the environment.”"
7523,"The LIC location is also run on 100 percent renewable energy, using only wind and solar power, and they were just deemed a “Green Power Partner” by the EPA."
7524,"If an item isn’t locally grown, the team still tries to source it locally. They have coffee roasted by Native Coffee Roasters in LIC, and the lemongrass for their ""Lemongrass Kolsch"" is from a small Thai grocer in Queens."
7525,"“We try to support other small, local businesses,” Hurst said. “We probably could go direct to a source for something we get a lot of (like the lemongrass)... but it’s a nice little relationship we have with those other vendors."""
7526,"The cherries for “Fistful of Rubies” — a red wine barrel-aged sour ale that strikes just the right balance between the required tartness of a sour and the juicy sweetness of cherries — are from a homebrewer who lives in Queens, whose family owned cherry trees and offered to give them to Big aLICe if he could have some of the finished beer. The jalapenos for the Jalapeno Rye are grown right in Hellgate Farm, a network of rooftop gardens in Queens. And the brewery sponsors its own beehive, so they get rooftop honey in LIC, as well."
7527,"One of the main purposes for the new space, besides a proper tasting room, is to grow their barrel-aged beer program with room for up to 60 barrels."
7528,"“We’re all about creativity in our beers, and it [barrel-aging] was the way to add another level of complexity,” Hurst said."
7529,"Their first foray into barrel aging was a saison aged in gin barrels from Breuckelen Distilling a couple years ago, and it came out so well they decided to try again. That led to adding more barrels, getting a barrel rack, and then quickly reaching peak capacity in LIC with 16 or 20 barrels."
7530,"“We knew we liked what barrel-aged beer was, and we knew didn’t have enough room to do it in earnest,” Hurst said.  "
7531,"Right now Big aLICe is still brewing and fermenting everything in Queens, and then bringing it to the new Brooklyn location to age. Depending on the barrel, aging can take weeks, months or even a year. For instance, Hurst said they aged an imperial stout in Islay Scotch barrels, and because of how peaty the scotch was, it only needed to be aged for a couple weeks."
7532,"The beer menu is similar to the LIC taproom — with favorites like Ways and Beans (a coffee porter) and the Queensbridge IPA available in both locations — but there are also some exclusive to Industry City. This includes the barrel-aged “Jalapeno Rye,” whose spice counteracts its malty flavor nicely; “Fistful of Rubies,” one of the only beers Hurst said they get a line for; and Biere de Fierté, a lemongrass Belgian Tripel aged in white wine barrels, brewed for Pride 2018."
7533,"Another brew exclusive to the Brooklyn location is the rum barrel-aged “A Ship in Harbour,” which Hurst thinks is one of the coolest experiments they’ve done so far."
7534,"“We got a rum barrel from Long Island Spirits, gave it to our coffee roaster to age coffee beans in... and then we put a stout in,” Hurst explained. “And then we gave it back to Long Island Spirits and they put rum back in it. So in a couple years we’ll get that barrel back and do the whole thing all over again.”"
7535,That “coolest experiment” title could be beat with their current local collaboration experiment: using the yeast from Brooklyn Kura’s sake to see how it ferments in their beer. Hurst says maybe they’ll try to get a barrel from another local distiller and make in a three-way collab.
7536,"Also expect live music in the Brooklyn space, and new releases over the next few weeks, like the barrel-aged version of “Sleep Now in the Fire,” a smoked porter, and “Gritsette,” a grisette-style beer made with grits in a collaboration with a South Carolina brewery."
7537,"Industry City is only a block and a half from the N/R/W/D 36th St. Station, and there is even a private shuttle bus from the Financial District."
7538,"“We can’t control whether or not you like our beer, but we do try to make sure you have a great experience,” Hurst said. “We’ve got great people behind the bar, and great people sitting alongside you at the bar. We set it up so the tables are communal seating, so you can sit with some people you don’t know and hopefully have good conversation about, or around, beer.”"

7600,How is working at a bakery like working at City Hall?
7601,"“You need to have gallows humor,” says Peter Madonia, 65, an alum of two different mayoral administrations and co-owner of his family’s third-generation business on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx."
7602,"As the first deputy FDNY commissioner under then-Mayor Ed Koch, the career civil servant saw his fair share of emergencies. As chief of staff, a role Madonia served under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Madonia says, “You have the press 90 feet away, who all they want to do is write a bull’s-eye on your head.”"
7603,"Temperatures rise just as high, both figuratively and literally, on any given day in the back of Madonia Bakery in Belmont, where a four-deck oven can bake up to 80 large loaves at a time."
7604,"“You got to keep [things] light otherwise you want to kill each other. It’s close quarters, it’s hot… things are moving fast,” says Madonia, who returned in December, after 16 years in the public and nonprofit sectors, to supervise the making of the shop’s signature breads and sweets with co-owner Charles Lalima. The former chief operating officer at the Rockefeller Foundation timed his homecoming to anticipate the bakery’s 100th anniversary this year, and to coincide with the “controlled chaos” of the holiday season."
7605,"At that time of year, “We yell, we scream,” says floor manager Mona Parubi, a Madonia employee for the past 15 years. “It’s drama over here.” "
7606,"It would take a few months for Madonia to settle back into his old stomping grounds, where, as a teenager, he’d reluctantly worked school day afternoons and picked up weekend deliveries. He knows how to do it all: mix, roll and bake."
7607,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
7608,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
7609,"“Fifth Avenue and Arthur Avenue are two different worlds, different people, different customers,” says Parubi, who started working at the bakery at age 18 as an Albanian native with a limited knowledge of English. “In the beginning, [Madonia] was a little tough… a little nervous. He’s very, very calm now.”"
7610,"Madonia agrees: “I’ve completely mellowed out,” he says with a smile. The former executive has traded the pressure of overseeing $200 million in grant funding for the responsibility of managing a much smaller operation, nestled into a supportive ecosystem of Italian specialty shops. "
7611,"But the two institutions have more in common than you might think: “The notion that you have the longevity, the stick-to-itness, the ability to evolve as an institution for 100 years really hit home for me at Rockefeller,” which celebrated that milestone in 2013, Madonia says. “So in my head I always knew that by 2018, it was time for me to come home.”"
7612,"The story of Madonia Bakery begins in a small town on the outskirts of Palermo, Sicily, where Peter Madonia’s grandparents met and where he believes his grandfather was an apprentice baker."
7613,"Mario Madonia established his business in the Bronx on Adams Place in 1918, selling traditional Italian breads like the crusty pane di casa."
7614,"According to the family, his wife gave birth to their youngest son in 1924 inside the actual bakery, when a car crashed into the window front, sending her into labor three months early. No one thought Peter Sr. would live, but a makeshift incubator — a shoe box insulated with cotton and stashed near the oven — pulled him through."
7615,"The elder Peter and his brother, Frank, took over the business in the 1960s, by which time their father had already relocated it to the epicenter of the Arthur Avenue neighborhood, next door to the Arthur Avenue Retail Market. They passed along control to Peter’s son Mario two decades later, ushering in a period of significant development for the bakery."
7616,"“My brother really took the business to the next step in the ’80s, when the store was half the size it is now,” says Peter Madonia, who pursued a very different kind of work at City Hall after graduating with a master’s degree in urban studies at the University of Chicago. “He renovated, he took a larger space, he started to advance different products” — such as the bakery’s cannoli, “small, crunchy shells, piped fresh to order with dense, citron-laden semifreddo [that] could inspire a cult,” in the words of a glowing New York magazine review — “and built a much bigger biscotti line.” (Today, there’s an entire wall dedicated to the cookie, which Madonia pronounces with a Sicilian accent as “bish-cotti.”)"
7617,"Then tragedy crumbled everything. In 1988, a car accident killed Mario at age 38, prompting his brother’s return to the bakery."
7618,"The bakery’s rises and falls in fortune over the last century speak to its resilience, Peter Madonia says: “It’s been through economic downturns .... It’s been through ownership change. My brother was running the business and one day he wasn’t. We survived that.”"
7619,"Peter Madonia brought on his business partner, Lalima, five years later, and left management of the shop’s daily affairs to the experienced baker when Bloomberg offered him a staff job trimming the city’s $7 billion budget deficit in 2002. Peter Sr., who has since passed away, kept his eyes on the place, too. The patriarch greeted customers from his customary perch on a shelf next to the self-serve coffee into his 90s. "
7620,"Now that Madonia is back, both owners devote most of their time in the bakery in the late morning and early afternoon to quality control, eyeballing, touching, sometimes even tasting breads and cookies that may not meet their standards, and pulling any off the shelves that don’t. (They leave the 5:30 a.m. shift to Parubi and Lalima’s son, Jason.)"
7621,"“Yeah, you’re making the same things over and over again,” Madonia says, “but bread,” which can be affected by all kinds of factors from atmosphere to temperature, “is a living product.”"
7622,The equilibrium of a neighborhood can be as precarious as that of a loaf and the bakery that makes it.
7623,"Centered around Arthur Avenue, the Bronx’s Little Italy is a neighborhood defined by Italian markets, butchers, pasta and pastry shops run by the same families for generations: “It’s not any individual business, it’s a collective that I think makes us unique and allows us to continue the authentic products that our grandparents made,” says Madonia, the chairman of the local Business Improvement District. “People come back for that.”"
7624,"As much as 80 percent of Madonia’s customers drive from 10 to 40 miles away for the bakery’s hand-rolled breads, according to its own research. On a Thursday morning earlier this month, a former neighbor now living in Virginia came in to order an olive loaf and a black-and-white cookie at the counter."
7625,"The question is how to retain the loyalty of those pilgrims, of the police officers who regularly stop in to chat with Parubi in the mornings and of the neighborhood employees who pop in for an afternoon snack — while drawing in foodies from other boroughs and tourists from around the world. "
7626,"Lalima’s balancing strategy has been to preserve the old recipes and add new ones, like a whole line of specialty bread, incorporating ingredients like olives, fennel and raisins and jalapeño and cheese. He’s currently testing out a roasted garlic bread."
7627,"As BID chairman, Lalima’s partner has two brands to consider: “Bread, meat, cheese — you can buy it all [in Little Italy], and it’s all handmade and authentic, with generational roots through all of it,” Madonia says. The question he asks himself, is “How do you maintain that? If real estate prices start to skyrocket, will families cash out?”"
7628,"Belmont sits in New York’s 15th congressional district, the poorest, most Democratic district in the country as of 2016. But the area has seen an influx of businesses and development proposals for new residential buildings in recent years."
7629,"“People ask me all the time: What’s your legacy plan?” continues Madonia, whose daughter works as a guidance counselor at a nearby public school. “I say, ‘Someone has to want this, someone has to feel this the same way I felt that it was right for me to come back here.’ I traveled the world, but I felt it was right to come back.”"
7630,"Twenty minutes later, on a tour of the flour-dusted, distinctly toasty baking facilities, he’s feeling slightly less sentimental about his return: “This is completely the wrong business for my body temperature and body type,” Madonia says, joking."

7671,"As the worst winter season seen on the East Coast in years slowly melts away, one thing New Yorker’s will miss come warm weather is the delectable Mallomar cookie."
7672,"Traditionally sold only during the cold months of the year, these chocolate-covered graham cracker and marshmallow cookies are nearly impossible to find come March, (we know, we looked!) unless you’ve saved a few boxes in the freezer. However this year, that’s not necessarily the case."
7673,"In celebration of the Mallomar’s 100-year anniversary, the master chefs over at Bouchon Bakery are serving up their expert take on the classic cookie that’s coveted by New Yorkers city-wide. It's called the ""Mallowmore."""
7674,"The idea ""is to bring back some of the originals from your childhood,” said Sebastien Rouxel, Executive Pasty Chef for the Thomas Keller Restaurant group and the culinary genius behind Bouchon’s take on the classic cookie."
7675,"After being dipped in freshly-made dark chocolate, the cookies are topped with cocoa nibs before the chocolate has the time to crystallize."
7676,"“We want to reinforce the flavor of the chocolate and bring a little touch of our own,” said Rouxel. The house-made fresh marshmallow, cocoa nibs and dark chocolate puts Bouchon’s cookie in a league of it’s own. “We're known for taking U.S. classics and making them the best we can,"" said Rouxel, noting that the choice to use dark chocolate instead of traditional milk chocolate is “healthier,” because there is less sugar."
7677,"According to Rouxel, Mallomars bought in grocery stores are “made to last,” meaning the chocolate on top can often times be months old. “We want to make sure we use high quality ingredients, just like everything else we do here at the bakery. We don’t buy anything, we try to make everything from scratch.” "
7678,"Mallomars were introduced in 1913, when Nabisco sold their first box to a grocery store in Hoboken, N.J. Mallomars were never sold after March because they'd melt during delivery. And even with the advent of refrigerated shipping trucks, the choice has been to keep the cookie traditional, and only available seasonally."

7692,"Our/Vodka has opened micro-distilleries in Berlin, Amsterdam, London, Detroit and Los Angeles, each producing its own city-specific spirit. Now, it’s New York’s turn."
7693,"On Friday, Our/New York opened in Chelsea at 151 W. 26th St., with a tasting room, bar and shop."
7694,"Following the opening of the first Our/Vodka distillery in Berlin in 2013, New York was planned to be the second. But city real estate, zoning, permitting and licensing being what it is, it’s now the sixth."
7695,"“It turned out to be so complicated,” Our/Vodka founder Åsa Caap says. “Of course, there’s a lot of safety measures that go into a product like this in Manhattan. Luckily we had no idea. I don’t think we would have tried [laughs].”"
7696,But not opening in New York wasn’t an option.
7697,"“It’s the capital of the world,” says Caap, who is based in Stockholm. “It was our dream from the beginning.”"
7698,"Though it is the sixth brand, Our/New York does have the distinction as the first legal distillery to open in Manhattan since Prohibition."
7699,"The distillery started producing its vodka in mid-May, with the production process taking about a day and a half. The first run made enough for more than 2,100 bottles."

7702,"“We really took our time to make sure everything was done right,” says Our/New York partner Dave Ortiz. “It’s really important that our first batch is absolutely correct because it’s such a big deal.”"
7703,"All the Our/Vodka spirits use the same wheat-based distillate from Sweden (“That is the secret sauce,” Ortiz says). But otherwise the ingredients are localized, from the wheat or corn base to the water."
7704,"Our/NewYork is made from a corn-based ethanol and, of course, New York City tap water, which is 60 percent of the product."
7705,"“We all say our water is the best,” says Ortiz, an East New York native who now lives in the East Village. “We do make the best pizza and the best bagels.”"
7706,"The resulting New York-made vodka has a slight floral note, is 80 proof and costs $22.99 a bottle."
7707,"“The taste profile of all our vodka is that it’s just smooth and clean vodka,” Caap says."
7708,"Of the Our/Vodka family — which is owned by Pernod Ricard — only the New York vodka will be available at the distillery’s bar. It’ll be used in cocktails, including several martinis, on a menu from bar manager Rustun Nichols, a veteran of the Wythe Hotel."
7709,"Spirits by other local craft distilleries will be stocked behind the bar, including Kings County Distillery, Greenhook Ginsmiths and Van Brunt Stillhouse."
7710,"“It’s not just a run-of-the-mill bar where you can get a Maker’s Mark or whatever,” Ortiz says. “When you come here, you’re going to get something special.”"
7711,"For snacks, Ortiz brought on friend Medwin Pang, of Flatbush restaurant Hunger Pang, to create a menu that reflects the “basic New York City food group”: pulled beef sliders, for burgers; flatbreads, for pizza; and hot dogs in a blanket."
7712,"“We cover all the New York items,” Ortiz says."
7713,"In addition to visiting the bar or shop, guests can schedule tours of the distillery. Ortiz, an artist, also eventually plans to showcase local artist work and hold events, including an upcoming cookbook release party for Superiority Burger’s Brooks Headley."
7714,"“It’s all about us being local,” Ortiz says. “This place is a platform for people to do things like that.”"

7724,It might be tempting to reach for a slice of pizza or indulge in a big burger right after running a marathon. But the best thing to do is to reach for something easy to digest.
7725,"So says chef and nutrition coach Elyse Kopecky, co-author of “Run Fast. Cook Fast. Eat Slow.” She wrote the new cookbook with Shalane Flanagan — last year’s TCS New York City Marathon winner."
7726,"The cookbook is a follow-up to the two’s bestselling “Run Fast. Eat Slow.” and features recipes that are quick and easy to make for runners, athletes or those just looking to eat healthy, nourishing meals."
7727,"For those running in Sunday’s NYC Marathon, a key thing to keep in mind is digestion, Kopecky advises. After logging 26.2 miles, blood flow is focused on your muscles, and away from your digestive system."
7728,"“Digestion might not be optimal after the race,” says Kopecky, who recommends reaching for something like a smoothie with ginger to help settle your stomach before having a celebratory meal."
7729,"The chef also recommends steering clear of protein powders, which can be hard to digest, and reaching for foods packed with protein and healthy fats, like scrambled eggs with sweet potato and spinach."
7730,"And for those days after the race, a nourishing soup, like the ones in the cookbook, can also aid in recovery and repair."
7731,"“Your immune system is pretty hit hard,” she says. “The soups can help prevent you from catching a cold, which you are more susceptible to right after running a marathon.”"

""The coconut milk has natural antiviral properties to help fend off cold and flu viruses. Plus the curry powder adds anti-inflammatory superpowers."""
7735,"1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the carrots, celery, onion and salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened but not brown, about 5 minutes. Add the curry powder and cook, stirring continuously, for 30 seconds, being careful not to let the spices brown."
7736,"2. Add 5 cups water, sweet potato, coconut milk, tomatoes and chickpeas to the pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer covered, stirring occasionally, until the sweet potatoes are soft, about 20 minutes (be careful not to overcook). "
7737,"3. Stir in the kale and simmer just until wilted. Turn off the heat and stir in 1 tbsp. of the lime juice. Taste and add more lime juice and salt, if needed."

7747,"The room was bustling. Swarms of restaurateurs, foodies and Harlem VIPs poured into the gold and brown confines of Ginny’s Supper Club and crowded the bar, as the Nate Lucas Band played a jazzy tune and singer Cherry on Top belted out a high note."
7748,"It was a chilly Wednesday night in 2019, but if not for the iPhones scattered throughout the room, you’d swear you were at the Cotton Club in 1925, at the height of the Harlem Renaissance.  "
7749,"“Tonight is really a big deal for us,” said Marcus Samuelsson, sitting atop a stool at the front of the underground venue. “We wanted to do a dinner to celebrate friends and family but also to honor black history,” the Ethiopian-Swedish chef and Food Network regular said, as 80 guests found their assigned tables and the room quieted."
7750,"Samuelsson, dressed in a colorful apron — notably the same one worn by members of his Red Rooster team — and his signature beret, was referring to his restaurant’s Green & Fanny Dinner Series, the first evening of which was about to commence."
7751,"The dinner series, which will continue throughout 2019, seeks to both honor the legacy of black history and to highlight often overlooked, untold stories. Fittingly, it’s named for Nathan “Nearest” Green, the slave who served as Jack Daniel’s mentor and who has now, many centuries later, been recognized as the master distiller behind the iconic whiskey brand, and for Fanny Hern, the 18-year old slave who, along with 15-year old Edith Fossett, ran Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello kitchen."
7752,"“Their legacies illustrate the anonymous, but significant contributions from African-Americans to kitchens and our understanding of food ways throughout history,” said Samuelsson."
7753,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
7754,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
7755,"In addition to the Red Rooster head chef, each dinner will be hosted by one or two leaders in the food and arts scenes who are making significant contributions to the African-American community. Wednesday's welcomed renowned sommelier and winemaker André Mack, who curated a selection of  riesling, Chardonnay, pinot gris and pinot noir from his label to accompany Samuelsson’s African-inspired menu. Philadelphia-based artist Kendra Dandy, who has worked with brands like Estee Lauder, Bobbi Brown and Vans, co-hosted and led a discussion with Mack throughout the evening."
7756,"“André is part of the Red Rooster family and is rooted in Harlem,” Samuelsson said. “Not only did he used to be my neighbor, but he is a prime example of what can be accomplished as an African-American in this industry.”"
7757,"The wine expert worked at a number of restaurants before discovering his love of wine. “You might know some of them,” Mack said to the crowd of eagerly listening guests on Wednesday night. “Anyone know McDonald’s?” he joked. “How about Jack-in-the-Box?” The sommelier then explained that his entrée to wine was through the popular sitcom “Frasier,” noting, “the best way to foil pretention is through humor.” Mack then went on to manage the wine lists at the world-famous kitchens of French Laundry and Per Se before founding his own label, Maison Noir, in 2007."
7758,"“Marcus is a friend and enthusiastically shared this amazing event with me,” he said of the Green & Fanny dinners. “I think this is an excellent way of continuing to show black excellence in a time of division and tension, and I’m happy to join him in this wonderful, important series.”"
7759,"The menu at each dinner embraces the food and ingredients of black history, but presents them in a modern, signature Marcus Samuelsson manner."
7760,"Attendees of Wednesday’s dinner were welcomed to the gold, brown and red supper club with bites of spicy crab cakes and deviled eggs, alongside a choice of either rosé (from Mack’s Oregon vineyard) or a tequila-based rosé cocktail. As they settled at one of the room’s 15 tables, all adorned in colorful tablecloths and topped with wine glasses, and greeted their seatmates, an amuse bouche of cured turnip in a smoked peanut shiro and finished with a rice cracker was served with a glass of Mack’s Mouton Noir Riesling."
7761,"Next was a piece of flavorful bluefin tuna atop dirty rice and coated in a bone broth aioli, paired with the winemaker’s 2014 Chardonnay. Guests then ate bits of arctic char on a hoe cake with avocado and black bean and drank Maison Noir’s pinot gris, which Mack was sure to distinguish from the popular pinot grigio. As though the first three courses weren’t already enough, Samuelsson then served a tender lacquered duck with “all the fixin's” complemented by a glass of pinot noir. Finally, the dinner concluded with a sweet potato, marshmallow, and pecan baked Alaska."
7762,"“We used food that is of the African diaspora, focusing on ingredients that came here through the slave trade and African rituals of preparation like pickling and smoking,” said Samuelsson. He also noted the menu’s inspiration from his personal history. “Courses like the Pickled Arctic Char reflect my Swedish roots, and the Shiro is from Ethiopia—these are things that are essential to my background and heritage, food from my own migration.”"
7763,Each dinner in the Green & Fanny series will feature different food and wine offerings.
7764,"Although it seeks to celebrate Black History Month, the Green & Fanny Dinner series  was launched only on the penultimate day of February and will notably host its other events throughout the rest of the year. “We were determined to do this dinner during Black History Month, which provides a great jumping-off point to have a discussion and celebration of African-American excellence,” Samuelsson said. “And this will be in the spirit of not just this first dinner but of the ongoing series.”"
7765,"“Sometimes, when businesses reach out to me for just this month, I’m like, I’m around the rest of the year,” Mack said. “I believe that we deserve more than just a month, as does everyone else,” he continued. “We should celebrate what makes us unique year-round and embrace who we are.”"
7766,"As Wednesday’s dinner showed, the series is as much about fostering growth and adding to history as it is about honoring the past. “This is a moment for established Harlem icons to meet young new talent and a moment for people to get to know each other and meet new friends,” Samuelsson said. And as fashion icon Lana Turner, whom the chef affectionately dubbed “our Anna Wintour” and introduced as “the Queen of Harlem,” shared a laugh with jewelry designer Paula Collins and Miami chef and James Beard Award nominee Brad Kilgore, it appeared Samuelsson’s mission had been accomplished."
7767,"The Green & Fanny Dinner Series will host its next event in April, once again at Ginny’s Supper Club, below Samuelsson’s Red Rooster Harlem."

7776,"The six-part series first announced last fall follows Samuelsson as the “Chopped” judge and co-owner of popular Harlem eatery Red Rooster travels the country to showcase the diversity of immigrant cuisines and cultures. The fourth episode, airing July 31, takes the Ethiopian-born and Swedish-raised chef only a subway ride away from his Harlem home: In Richmond Hill, Queens, Samuelsson visits the local Indo-Guyanese community to try Trinidadian roti and doubles, cook a traditional Guyanese chicken curry for the springtime festival of Phagwah and play cricket. He also joins Guyanese-American DJ and music producer Jonathan Madray, known as JonOne, at the entertainer’s home for a traditional meal with his family. "
7777,"Other episodes of the show, produced by the Vox Media site Eater, send Samuelsson to Detroit, New Orleans, Chicago, Miami and Washington, D.C., according to a final itinerary released Tuesday."
7778,"“Chasing flavors has been my lifelong passion,” Samuelsson said in a statement earlier this year. “To now be able to bring viewers on that journey with me to these amazing communities in cities across the U.S. is truly a dream come true. We get to go deep into the markets, pull up to the roadside stands and be welcomed into homes — all the places where people share and celebrate food together.”"
7779,"With a focus on travel, culture and community, the James Beard Award-winning chef’s new show emulates an example set by the late Anthony Bourdain’s “No Reservations” and “Parts Unknown.” "

7792,"For celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, immigration isn’t just a hot-button issue dominating the news cycle. It’s a personal one: the 47-year-old Harlem resident was born in Ethiopia and raised by his adoptive family in Sweden, and the comfort food at his neighborhood restaurant, Red Rooster, draws on the cuisine of all three countries he’s called home."
7793,"“Aren’t we all immigrants? Unless, you’re Native American,” Samuelsson said in a recent interview about his new TV show, “No Passport Required.”"
7794,"The six-part series premiering on PBS this Tuesday follows the “Chopped” judge as he travels the country to showcase the cuisines and cultures of different immigrant communities, including the Indo-Guyanese enclave in Richmond Hill, Queens."
7795,"“We’re showing real America and it looks vastly diverse, and the food has never been better,” Samuelsson said of the show, the first hour-long episode of which showcases the Arab-American community in Dearborn and Detroit, Michigan. “People want constantly quick answers or a monolithic answer to a very layered culture, so with a show we wanted to be able to tell very complex stories with unique narratives.”"
7796,"Samuelsson argues that the key to getting over what he sees as a false and hostile narrative in America about immigrants like himself — that they use government resources without giving back, that they remain exclusively loyal to their native countries and that they’re more likely to commit crimes than American citizens — is exploration within the nation's own borders: ""Why can’t we start traveling within our country with the same open eye and be equally interested the way we are when we go to Europe?” Unlike travel and food shows that feature exotic locations, “No Passport Required” keeps its lens trained on the states."
7797,"Samuelsson hopes that after watching the Richmond Hill episode, New Yorkers might consider doing some exploring themselves, stopping by Sonny’s or Singh’s for some roti (West Indian unleavened flatbread that's wrapped around fillings like goat or chickpeas and seasoned with tamarind and pepper sauces) the next time they head to the Rockaways."
7798,"amNewYork spoke at length with the chef about his adventures in Queens, the limitations of immigration coverage in the news and the influence the late Anthony Bourdain had on his show:"

7802,"I’ve lived in New York for a long time. I wasn’t familiar with the Indo-Guyanese community in Richmond Hill, so my friend Raymond, he’s the one who told me about it. If you’re Indo-Guyanese, you might be more spiritually Hindu and Indian, but your language is English."
7803,Why is the narrative of inclusion and the ways immigrant communities contribute to American culture and the local economy right now? Do you consider this show a form of political activism?
7804,"I don’t think it’s a political statement at all; I think it’s an opportunity to tell what the real America looks like, in a delicious, cultured way. It’s also extremely inspirational, because once you start talking about immigrants, you very often start talking about people who worked very hard, fought really hard to get here and then started their own business."
7805,"When you see the whole body of work, the shows start to tell that [immigration is a] very layered [issue]. It could be very different on a human level for each person. Of course, we know that when we talk, but the news cycle doesn’t give a lot of space for that."
7806,"One thing I find interesting in the Detroit episode is that you’re not just interested in telling the story of first-generation immigrants, but of their descendants and what it’s like to have a dual identity. Why was it important for you to focus on that?"
7807,"I wanted again to talk about the complexity [of immigration]: you can be Arab-American, and Muslim or not Muslim, first of all. You can be like Samir, who’s been in the country for 50 years and has a thriving business. Or you can just come straight from Syria, like one family that we showed. Arab-American doesn’t mean just one thing."
7808,What could be more American than to talk about these issues in a detailed way and give it the breadth of an hour that it really deserves?
7809,"If you did a “No Passport Required” episode about your own neighborhood, Harlem, what and/or who would you profile?"
7810,"Oh my God, I would love to do a Harlem episode, and hopefully we can do a second season."
7811,"My food festival, Harlem EatUp!, is all about digging into the entrepreneurs and the community at large and highlighting that. El Barrio is where you obviously have great Latin food and the Puerto Rican and Mexican-American communities. But also, to tell the Senegalese story in West Harlem would be really interesting. Or going a little further up to the Heights — the Dominican story would also be really good."
7812,"You dedicate the first episode of your show to Anthony Bourdain, and your show seems to build on the legacy of shows like “Parts Unknown” and “No Reservations.” How would you describe his influence on this project?"
7813,"Tony, for me, was completely a mentor and someone that I dearly miss as a friend, but also loved working with. I asked him tons of stuff regarding this show, because he knew it so much better than me. He brought us closer to the world, to the unknown, so that obviously inspired me a lot. Without him, there wouldn’t be an audience for “No Passport.”"
7814,You play a game of cricket with a Queens cricket club in the Richmond Hill episode. How’d you do?
7815,"When in Queens, right? You have to play cricket…. I was horrible, but I had fun. In my mind, I was really good."

7870,"For a healthy addition to your diet that packs a punch, think green. And no, we're not talking about your good old green tea, but its powdered cousin, matcha.

Like green tea, matcha gives you a caffeine boost while also being high in antioxidants. But because it is the whole leaf ground into a powder, versus tea leaves that are then seeped or strained, you get the added benefits of ingesting the whole plant.

""Matcha provides all the awesome perks of green tea -- metabolism boost, strong anti-cancer, powerful antioxidant -- intensified,"" said Lauren Slayton, founder of the Manhattan-based nutrition practice Foodtrainers, who pointed to a 2003 University of Colorado at Colorado Springs study that found that the concentration of EGCG, a potent antioxidant, is 137-times greater in matcha than a standard green tea.

If you're looking to incorporate more matcha into your life, the powder can be used for tea (just whisk it in near-boiling water until you have a foam), or easily blended in smoothies. You can also add the versatile ingredient to water when cooking quinoa or brown rice, or even baked goods like banana bread, recommended Slayton.

""Matcha has a mellower, less bitter flavor than green tea,"" said Slayton, who likes the DoMatcha brand. ""Plus, it's a really pretty color.""

The powdered green tea is also popping up all over town, from drinks like lattes and cocktails to even desserts. Pastry Chef Becca Punch recently introduced a green tea and lemon custard with matcha crumble on the dessert menu at the Musket Room.

""By adding in the matcha, I'm able to give it a complex, earthy base without being overpowering,"" said Punch.

Though a matcha macaron may sound tempting, Slayton warns against enjoying too many sweets when you're really looking for a healthy fix.

""A pinch of a healthy ingredient doesn't make a pie any less pie-like -- unless of course the other ingredients are improved too,"" said Slayton. ""Beware of the health halo when something has matcha in its name.""

With that caveat in mind, here are creative matcha concoctions available in New York City:"

7934,1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
7935,"2. Wrap peppercorns, chilies, and bay leaves with cheesecloth, tie with kitchen twine and reserve."
7936,3. Sprinkle short ribs on both sides with salt and pepper.

7964,"By this point, you’ve likely seen the photos of Meat Barbie. "
7965,"She’s pictured clad in a floor-length gown constructed from thin slices of raw short rib, a cluster of rainbow-colored pom poms in her hair. She stands atop a mound of ice, her arms posed as if she’s about to begin waltzing with Ken."
7966,"Meat Barbie’s edible haute couture — on the menu as an $18 hot pot addition at Niu Pot, a Chinese restaurant in Flushing — calls to mind the infamous Lady Gaga “meat dress,” which riled up animal activists when she wore the outfit sewn from cuts of flank steak to the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards. (“I am not a piece of meat,” she later affirmed in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres.)"
7967,"When she first arrives at our table at Niu Pot, I can’t help thinking of her as anything but a “piece of meat.” Every feminist fiber of my being screams out, “This is male objectification of the female form personified!” "
7968,"Barbie has been pimped out. Her nude figure and her fleshy threads exist solely as objects of literal and sexual appetites. Day after day, she is undressed layer by layer with dexterous chopsticks and consumed by the insatiable male gaze."
7969,Where is her dignity? And how can I free her from meat bondage?
7970,"What tempers my outrage is Ken’s presence at our neighbor’s table. Robed in his own flesh skirt and planted in his own bowl of ice, he leans — as if bowing in subservience — toward a boy of 6 or 7 watching TV on his tablet. Ken is utterly humiliated. The boy is entirely oblivious."

My boyfriend, our friend and I also have ordered scallops, okra and other veggies to thicken up our chicken broth, but we won’t plop everything in at once. The secret to hot pot, our friend T.J. explains, is to cook only what you can eat in one small bowl’s worth at a time; otherwise you’ll end up with rubbery meat."
7975,"The strips shrink as they cook, floating amid bubbles on the broth’s surface. A taste by chopstick confirms that yes, Barbie’s attire is tender and delicious."
7976,"She remains proudly erect as we tear her garment to shreds in simulated violence, but her aloof expression — blue eyes wide open, painted eyebrows aloft, lips slightly curved — is open to interpretation. Is she traumatized victim, serene martyr or divine Aphrodite? Should we be protecting, thanking or worshipping her? And should the lens through which we examine this bizarre Meat Barbie phenomenon shift if it’s a woman, not a man, undressing her? What if my stripping of Barbie to her breast-like mounds and her “Barbie”-embossed underwear really signifies all the years I’ve spent trying (and failing) to liberate myself from society’s impossible standards for feminine beauty?

7988,"At the two-day tasting event, Yankee Stadium will be serving its adobo bao, a steamed bun filled with chicken and pork rinds, and Citi Field will be offering its classic New York deli pastrami sandwich, one of the stadium’s most popular concession items. You can still grab a pastrami sandwich (for $12.75) at a Mets home game at the Queens ballpark, where Aramark senior executive chef Patrick Schaeffer runs the kitchens."
7989,"Schaeffer, who’s predicted his home team will make it to the World Series this season, shares some juicy facts about the meaty sandwich with a cult following below:"
7990,"It takes a very, very long time to cook the brisket meat just right."
7991,"Once kitchen staffers have covered the beef with the stadium’s proprietary (a.k.a secret) rub, they slow cook it. "
7992,"“We have a team that gets here about 20 hours before the gates even open and starts to smoke and braise these pastrami,” Schaeffer said."
7993,They prepare roughly 800 pounds of  pastrami meat a day.
7994,Cooks prepare the meat in a huge commissary kitchen beneath the ballpark’s field level concourse.

7997,"“Our main commissary where we do a lot of the bulk production and where the pastrami is actually made and prepared would rival any of the commissary kitchens in any hotel in New York or across the country,” Schaeffer says of the facility’s size. It’s at the same level as the ballplayers’ dugout, and it’s only one of several kitchens in the stadium. "
7998,"All together, Citi Field employs six executive chefs and anywhere from 250 to 450 cooks, chef supervisors and other kitchen staffers, depending on the size of the stadium crowds."
7999,"The pastrami may be made in house, but the rye bread is from a New Jersey bakery."

8002,"Last year, the New York City-based trading card company Topps released a special series for opening day, highlighting the best ballpark eats. Citi Field’s pastrami sandwich got its own card, which called it a “celebration of New York’s diverse cuisine.”"
8003,"The Mets actually eat it, too."
8004,"The players are fans of Shake Shack burgers and the Bash Burgers from Josh Capon’s ballpark branch, but their locker room also has its own kitchen and culinary team, so they get to make special requests, too. On Friday, the team dug into pastrami sandwiches, Schaeffer reports."

8011,"As co-owner of The Meatball Shop, Michael Chernow is the city's foremost ball joke enthusiast. But it's not all balls to the wall at his newest spot, Seamore's (390 Broome St., 212-730-6005). This NoLita eatery is about the seafood."
8012,"A fisherman since childhood, Chernow is bringing his love of fish to the masses -- and the masses are into it (just check out the line). Once you've made it in, there's a lot to enjoy about Seamore's. The spot is bright with natural light and the open kitchen in the back makes the space even more bustling. Grab a seat at the bar or head to a table, many of which are communal so get ready to knock a few elbows."
8013,"Seamore's has a wide variety of fish on the menu, and it's constantly changing. On one night I had blowfish tails -- dense white fish the size of a rib that I could pick up and gnaw off the bone. The flesh was fiery hot, leaving my lips tingly until I left."
8014,"Another menu winner is the Oh-Boy ($16). I know fried chicken sandwiches are all the rage right now, but this sandwich is a tough competitor. The skate is perfectly fried and seasoned; it's crispy and just melts into the pickled peppers and house sauce when you take a bite. It's messy, but that's part of its allure."
8015,"On any given night, you can go with the customizable Reel Deal ($21). Select your fish from three specials and then your sauce, with options including a creamy harissa cashew and miso brown butter. The whole thing is served over three sides, which rotate often."
8016,The staff is extremely knowledgeable about the fish options. Unsure about the texture of tilefish or what the heck porgy is? Just ask.

But instead of cones and sweets, this friendly spot is churning out plate upon plate of satisfying dumplings, each one handmade using a Cheng family recipe and healthy, sustainable ingredients."
8132,"And starting Jan. 19, they will be offering weekly two-hour dumpling-making classes ($85 per person) at the restaurant. Sit with them on Monday nights from 6:15-8:15 and make your own fillings, learn to delicately wrap the dumplings and even become an expert at pan-frying. After you cook them up, you'll get to devour your dumplings and, if there's any left, bring some home for later."

There are also often dumpling specials; on a recent visit, there was a beef and kimchi one."

8144,"No longer are Little Italy and Chinatown the main cultural havens of NYC—other ethnic enclaves like Little Pakistan and Little Guyana have emerged as generations of immigrants enrich neighborhoods with their foods and traditions, buoying the diversity of our city."
8145,"Though perhaps acknowledged only by local residents thus far, in Astoria another “mini” neighborhood is popping up with an increase in the young Irish population. The neighborhood already has a rich Irish immigrant history—with most moving to western Queens from Manhattan in the early 1900s  for cheaper rent and more job opportunities, particularly in construction and utilities— but neighborhood staples are now joined by more modern eateries opened by those newer to the area."
8146,"“Lots of Irish used to live in Woodside and the Bronx, but they’re kind of migrating over to Astoria now, so lots of Irish bars are popping up, which is great,” said Louise Egleston, a bartender at staple Cronin and Phelan’s. She said it helps make the neighborhood feel “more like home.”"
8147,"Joseph Byrne, co-owner of newer pub The Wolfhound, agrees. “Compared to when I first moved here in 2013, there are so many more young Irish . . . there’s definitely a growing community here,” he said. For the first time in many years, there’s been representation of Astoria in the New York Gaelic Athletic Association’s Irish football league, which the bar owners cultivated."
8148,"With well over 20 Irish pubs within the main Astoria avenues — from über traditional eateries to bars with upscale twists, to joints of the more Irish-American variety — Astoria is the place to be this St. Patrick’s Day weekend. Here are 10 of the best spots for embracing your Irish heritage (or lack thereof):"
8149,40-11 30th Ave.
8150,"From frozen Irish coffee to an Irish breakfast flatbread, Passage’s menu is the definition of a “new spin” on classic Irish pub fare. Named after a small fishing village in Waterford where  Vikings entered the country, the restaurant has an interior with a medieval feel, with heavy wood tables and chairs, ironwork lighting and old signage. The bar boasts 168 Irish whiskeys—supposedly the most in NYC, and therefore  probably in the country. This weekend doubles as Passage’s third birthday party, with a full four-day lineup of festivities. Thursday will offer live music by Allen Gogarty and $5 Smithwick’s, Friday includes more live music and $5 “favorites” like curry cheese fries, Guinness, frozen Irish coffee, chicken burgers and Jameson shots, Saturday will be a full-day St. Paddy’s Party with a special holiday menu, and Sunday will have Irish dancers at 4 p.m., Passage’s traditional “Sunday Roast” and live music at 6:30 p.m."

8154,"The Quays (pronounced ‘keys’) is the friendliest neighborhood pub, whose regulars swear owner Dee Flattery, from Roscommon County, pours the best pint of Guinness in New York. She has a few secrets to it — like starting with a completely dry glass and having the keg lines cleaned multiple times a week — but it's best to discover it in person. If you’re in a sociable mood, The Quays prides itself on feeling like family."
8155,3718 28th Ave.
8156,"Sports bar meets Irish pub at The Irish Rover, which opened in 1994. Board games, trivia, arcade machines and a bar loaded with TVs may not be quite what you have in mind for an Emerald Isle pub, but Irish locals love this relaxed spot to kick back with a pint. They’ll be having Irish ballad, folk and rebel music and dancing from “Dreams of Freedom” on Saturday at 9 p.m."
8157,32-01 Broadway
8158,"If the weather is nippy this weekend, cozy up by Gilbey’s fireplace for a drink. Feel free to bring your own food, as they don’t serve any, and know this as a relaxed spot to take a rest in between more rowdy visits. As usual, they pour a good pint of Guinness."
8159,3814 Broadway
8160,"If you’re looking for classic Irish comfort food, Cronin and Phelan’s is the place. With Irish soda bread baked daily, fresh cream for Irish coffee, and daily specials of shepherd's pie, fish and chips and beef and lamb stews, you can fill up here before hitting up the local bars for Jameson and Guinness. They’ll be celebrating St. Paddy’s Day mainly on Saturday, with specials like bangers and mash, Irish lamb stew and, of course, corned beef and cabbage (or corned beef on rye). Just be sure to get there early."
8161,38-14 30th Ave.
8162,"Co-opened by a former bartender at The Quays, the young Irish owners of The Wolfhound also pride themselves on a good Guinness pour, one of their tricks being that the keg is only about five feet away from the tap. Music is a priority, with weekly shows featuring bands directly from Ireland. On Thursday, they’ll have one of those bands kick things off, a DJ on Friday and Saturday, and an authentic Irish traditional session on Sunday at 3 p.m. Then Monday is their third annual St. Patrick's “Industry Night” for everyone who worked so hard over the weekend, with discounted drinks."
8163,4202 Broadway
8164,"A longtime neighborhood pub, Doyle’s Corner is another great spot to have on deck if you need to break up the drinking with some greasy bar bites. Expect more standard American bar food here — like quesadillas and jalapeno poppers — but there are also fish and chips to be found. A pool table and darts round out this neighborhood watering hole, with outdoor seating options, as well."
8165,31-86 31st St.
8166,"If you want something other than Irish beer or whiskey, Daly’s Pub was voted as having the Best Bloody Mary in NYC. Daly’s St. Paddy’s Day celebration will take place on Saturday, with drink specials, giveaways, dancing and a live DJ at night. There’s a beer garden in the back, so you’ll be set if the sun is out."
8167,38-01 Ditmars Blvd.
8168,"The menu for Jack Jones reads more like an upscale gastropub, with bar bites like “deviled eggs with soy and seaweed” and “masala almonds and crispy chickpeas.” But have no fear, tucked behind the bar is a “Siopa Beag,” or a small grocery store stocked with imported Irish products. The draft list holds much more than just Guinness, with craft selections like Long Island’s Montauk Wavechaser and Weihenstephan from Germany, and a mixologist-catered cocktail menu that takes things up a notch. Jack Jones will have live music on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and will have traditional Irish fare available all weekend. They’ll keep the celebration going through Monday, when they’ll host a “Recovery St. Patrick’s Day” with all draft beer starting at $2 and increasing in price every half hour."
8169,4515 Broadway
8170,"Lavelle’s is one of the oldest Irish bars in the neighborhood, harkening back to 1966. If you want something super simple and super old school, where you can either reminisce with the bartender or nurse a drink in the corner without being disturbed, this is the spot for you."

Frankie's Spuntino owners Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli let Bowien set-up shop for a three day a week pop-up in their back carraige house slash dining room. Hour long waits were guaranteed. More recently, another pop-up was announced - this one at Mile End's Manhattan location."
8181,"People gossiped, people wondered aloud: when would Mission Chinese return, officially, in its own space? On Friday, Bowien tweeted and Instagrammed the news: a new location was found."
8182,"Bowien then spoke with The Times, confirming that he had signed a lease in the former Rosette space at 171 East Broadway."

8213,"David Arnold turns the spigot on the enormous tank of liquid nitrogen that sits at the entrance of Booker and Dax. He is immediately engulfed in a vapor cloud, as if he had stepped over a steaming manhole cover on a city street. The tank hisses and sputters angrily as he fills his pitcher."
8214,"He will use the liquid nitrogen to chill the inside of a glass by adding a small measure of the liquified gas and swirling it around, before dumping it unceremoniously onto the bar. The liquid quickly disappears in another vapor cloud; but it has done its job -- the glass is perfectly chilled. "
8215,"Next, the cocktail scientist will pour in a pre-made cocktail called Gin and Juice, which is made by spinning grapefruit juice in a centrifuge until it is almost clear before adding Tanqueray, chilling it with even more liquid nitrogen and carbonating the concoction."
8216,"At the other end of the bar Tristan Wiley sticks a 1500° poker into a glass of liquid, causing flames to shoot up two feet in the air. More hissing and sputtering ensues as the alcohol burns off and the sugars caramelize. The drink -- dubbed the French Colombian -- is a mix of Pernod, cinnamon, brown sugar and lemon but the scorching has transformed the flavors and rendered it piping hot in the process."
8217,"Another cocktail called the mustachi-ode is made from a pistachio syrup that has been made using a centrifuge and comes laced with bourbon and Becherovka, an herbal bitter from the Czech republic. The cocktail gets its name from the artful moustache that the bartender paints into the froth on top of the drink with Angostura bitters."
8218,"These techniques -- taking classic cocktails and reimagining them or inventing completely new creations not previously technologically possible -- is commonly referred to as ""molecular mixology."" The term is derived from, and indeed inspired by, ""molecular gastronomy"" -- the modern culinary movement that uses science and contemporary technology as its foundation."
8219,"For his part, Arnold bristles at the term, finding it pretentious and short sighted. He looks at what he is doing as simply a continuation of the art of bartending, which has always been implicitly aware of chemical interactions. The layering of liquids with different viscosities being the most obvious example. Indeed, liquid nitrogen was first mentioned in cookbooks in the 1890's and he claims that his hot poker references pre-civil war techniques."
8220,"Arnold doesn't feel that he is changing the essential character of the time honored classics, rather he is improving the way they are made. His take on a Manhattan, for example, involves pre-blending the cocktail, storing it in a bottle in the freezer before serving it in a glass chilled with liquid nitrogen. The flavor of a classic Manhattan is there but it stays colder longer and does not get diluted by melting ice."

8223,"While this new cocktail movement is still in its infancy, it is growing in popularity. Arnold attributes the success of Booker and Dax (the bar, located in the back of Momofuku Ssäm Bar) just celebrated their one year anniversary) both to the fact that there are not too many places serving these types of cocktails but more importantly to their friendly service and delicious drinks. People may like to watch flames and liquid nitrogen clouds, but they won't keep coming back if the drinks don't taste good."
8224,"He may, however, have a hard time shaking the molecular mixology term, especially because his former day job was as Director of Culinary Technology at the International Culinary Center. What Arnold is really trying to do is rationalize the way bartenders work behind the bar, by using more effective techniques and the latest technologies. The result for the customer should always be a delicious cocktail. Of course, a sideshow of a little fire and ice can't hurt, unless you get too close!"

8231,"RIP Ramen, 2004-2015."
8232,"At least that's according to Momofuku chef and founder David Chang, who declared in an essay for Lucky Peach that the Internet has ""killed innovation in ramen."""
8233,"Ramen is a mainstay of Chang's Momofuku restaurants, and he writes that it ""wasn't cool"" to serve ramen in 2004, when Momofuku Noodle Bar opened. Chang recalls his days of going to wd~50 to envision his own version of ramen--to say nothing of having to wait for cookbooks from Japan to arrive."
8234,"But ""now the Internet's changed everything,"" he writes. ""People can get all the information they want instantaneously, and that has killed innovation in ramen."""
8235,"What's more, he writes, ramen is now everywhere--and it all tastes the same. ""I don’t want to go to every city and taste the same [expletive] thing,"" he writes."
8236,"And forget about that ramen burger. ""The ramen burger is not an invention—it’s the lowest hanging fruit. I’ve heard tell of a ramen burrito—that’s the [expletive] end of everything,"" Chang writes."
8237,"In a counterpoint, Lucky Peach editor David Meehan (and author of the book Momofuku Brunch) writes that ""ramen is better than it’s ever been. We know more about it, we have greater access to it, and for every mind that’s opened to it as a possibility, the chances for it to spread in popularity and improve are exponentially improved."""

8258,"Craving a taste of his native Liberia 4,500 miles away, maintenance worker Alfred Jones drove just 20 miles from his New Jersey home and waded knee deep into rows of pick-your-own African vegetables at Morris Gbolo's World Crops Farm."
8259,The Garden State's newest crops were ready for harvest and Jones plucked baseball-sized eggplants known in Liberia as bitter balls and a tiny yet tangy plant called kittely to make the traditional stews he loved as a boy.
8260,"""It tastes and smells very much like home,"" said Jones, 75, who emigrated in 1979 and lives in nearby Glassboro."
8261,"New Jersey, officially nicknamed ""The Garden State"" since 1954, is striving to revitalize its farming sector. It is seizing on trends such as the ""Eat Local"" movement, agritourism and ethnic crops that appeal to a growing population of Asian, Hispanic and African residents, including those flocking to Gbolo's fields in Vineland."
8262,"The slogan has long confounded travelers whose only glimpse of the state is from its New Jersey Turnpike, with views of refineries and gargantuan fuel tanks. But the state has found new ways to pump up its Garden State credibility, boosted by proximity to neighboring New York City and Philadelphia, whose citizens often consider New Jersey their own backyard."
8263,"With roughly one-tenth of the U.S. population living within 100 miles of central New Jersey - much of it affluent - the state is in a geographic sweet spot for agritourism, said Brian Schilling, a specialist with Rutgers Cooperative Extension, linked to the state university."

8268,"Even at $150 a ticket, Farm to Fork dinners regularly sell out, and a Tour de Farm cycling and tasting tour that started in 2013 with 100 riders has grown exponentially to more than 1,000 riders, said organizer Mitchell Morrison."
8269,"New Jersey's location is the reason the legislature approved the nickname in the first place in 1954, said Richard VanVranken, a Rutgers agricultural agent."
8270,"""It was about everything in New Jersey being ripe for the picking for New York and Philadelphia. That drives a lot of what we do, being able to serve the huge markets that we're right in the middle of,"" VanVranken said."
8271,"Riding new trends, the state is moving to recover its footing: The state had 1.7 million acres (690,000 hectares) of farmland in 1950, an expanse that has shrunk to 715,000 acres today, said New Jersey Agriculture Secretary Douglas Fisher."
8272,"Since hitting a low point in the 1990s, when number of farms dropped to 8,100, that count has risen to 9,100, many of them serving niche markets."
8273,"What is more, New Jersey is still a vegetable-producing powerhouse, ranking among the top 10 producers of crops including cranberries (third biggest in U.S.), bell peppers (third), peaches (fourth), spinach (fourth), cucumbers (fifth) and blueberries (fifth)."
8274,But the state also is sowing seeds of innovation to cultivate its appeal to an increasingly urban and immigrant market.
8275,"Agritourism is now a source of income for one in five farms in New Jersey, which relies more heavily on agritourism than other states, Schilling said. While New Jersey ranks 40th in the U.S. in total farm sales, it is ninth in the nation in terms of agritourism income, he said."
8276,"To insure a fertile future for the Garden State, Rutgers agricultural agents put to work the results of a 2006 study of Asians and Hispanics on the U.S. East Coast that found they tend to spend more money each month on fresh fruits and vegetables than the national average and that purchasers of ethnic foods put food freshness ahead of price."
8277,"Agents reached out to farmers such as Gbolo, who fled his Liberian home amid a civil war in 2002 and wanted to get back to farming. With Rutgers' help, Gbolo grew a first crop of African vegetables in 2009 on a small plot leased from former New Jersey agriculture secretary Art Brown."
8278,"Six years later, Gbolo owns a 13-acre parcel and competes with Brown for customers who earlier this month harvested cassava and African black nightshade - to cook the leaves, avoiding the poison berries."
8279,Gbolo keeps a list of the myriad names for each vegetable - depending on the customer's native land - and it came in handy when his cellphone rang out in the field.
8280,"""You got sour-sour? How about clan-clan?"" asked a woman on the other end of the phone, using the Sierra Leonean names for roselle and jute."

8290,"""It's a feeling,"" says the soba master. ""My fingers are like a sensor. Touching -- texture -- gives me information from the buckwheat."""
8291,"What may appear to be blind intuition is carefully honed technique. After more than a decade of culinary experience in Japan, Kotani founded Worldwide Soba, Inc., in New York, where he works as a restaurant consultant and professional educator. Former students include chefs Gail Simmons and Lee Anne Wong."
8292,"This morning, Chef Kotani is hand-cutting soba -- thin, buckwheat noodles -- for Daruma-ya, his new restaurant in Tribeca and just the latest in the city to specialize in the Japanese noodle."
8293,"Behind him, two whirring machines spit out endless ropes of another Japanese noodle -- ramen. While ramen has been raging in popularity for years, it seems soba is finally edging into the city's restaurant scene, where the handmade noodles have been a rarity thanks to a process that is expensive, time-consuming and somewhat fickle."
8294,"""Ramen is easy,"" says Kotani. Soba, on the other hand, is complicated. ""It needs high technique, high skill, high experience."""
8295,"As with anything, the noodles are only as good as the ingredients, and Kotani swears by stone-ground Japanese buckwheat because it's processed four times slower than its U.S. counterpart. His dough consists of a traditional Japanese 80-20 percentage ratio of buckwheat to wheat flour, though micro measurements of flour and water can change with the weather. Factors like humidity and room temperature come into play before Kotani determines his daily measurements."

8299,"""It needs moisture,"" he explains. ""With a high humidity, 60% or 70%, I can make good soba."""
8300,"Kotani kneads, eyes closed, until it feels right and the dough forms into a smooth, round ball. He uses a long, cylindrical stick as a rolling pin, working the dough back and forth until it flattens to a paper-thin 1.5 millimeters. It's then floured, folded, pressed and sliced with a special soba cleaver. Each precise cut yields a tiny pile of identical noodles."
8301,"Once cooked, the buckwheat noodles can be eaten cold with ""tsuyu,"" a dipping sauce made with dashi, soy and mirin (a sweet sake), or warm in a soup-like broth."
8302,"No matter how you take it, soba isn't just healthy, it's the ultimate cure-all, swears Kotani. Packed with vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B4 and B6) and the antioxidant rutin, the buckwheat noodles improve everything from hangovers to longevity, maintains the chef. In fact, Japan's own soba craze began 200 years ago, when the nutrient-dense noodles were found to combat widespread malnutrition, explains Kotani. The health trend prevails; today, there are nearly 5,000 soba restaurants in Tokyo."
8303,"""If everyone would eat soba just once a week, they'd enjoy a more healthy life,"" he says."
8304,And how does it feel to be a daily soba eater?

Indulge in the restaurant's chilled soba smothered with the ultimate triple-threat combination: uni, ikura and black caviar.

While there are permanent gourmet mac and cheese stations throughout the city (S'MAC, Macbar), according to the executive chef, guests should taste the difference for themselves."
8350,"“It’s definitely the quality of our products that sets us apart,” he says. “I’ve been to quite a few other restaurants in the city, some that specialize just in mac and cheese and I was so underwhelmed by the cheese flavor that was frankly hard to find. I think mac and cheese can be very bland — a lot of places will put too much sauce in it, or not enough but I think for us, it comes down to the quality of the ingredients.”"

8380,"“I was walking around this cave, and I felt like I was inside a gooey, drippy, cheesy crazy weird thing, but it was real, it was stone,” says the founder of Nameless Network, a three-year-old, Gen Z-focused digital media company we can’t say we were familiar with before news of its upcoming Museum of Pizza (a.k.a MoPi) broke Wednesday. “I’d never seen anything like it, and I wanted to recreate that experience I had and bring it to New York.”"
8381,"Thus was born the idea for the “cheese cave” taking its place alongside a pizza art gallery, a “pizza beach” and other large-scale ‘za-inspired immersive rooms for two weeks this October at a location to be announced, according to a news release."
8382,"An experiential exhibition dedicated to one beloved victual and promoted as the perfect backdrop for Instagram selfies is nothing groundbreaking in 2018; Rahma credits the wildly popular Museum of Ice Cream for sparking his own pizza-inspired concept. What is unique about the Museum of Pizza is the first phase of its marketing campaign: A series of fashion magazine spread-style photos depicting models of all colors, ages, genders and sexual orientations eating pizza in highly eroticized ways. A muscly man, nude except for his briefs, feeds himself and a woman straight out of an American Apparel ad. An S&M aficionado wearing a gimp mask and plastic bolero eats a pepperoni slice out of the hand of an off-camera partner. A gender-queer pizza-lover dangles a plain slice in front of their genitalia."
8383,"No, the family-friendly museum will not be a sexual one, Rahma promises. But its first set of promotional images — composed by photographer Kate Owen, populated by subjects who turned up at an open casting call and fueled by dozens of pies from Two Boots, Williamsburg Pizza and Fornino — are intentionally sensual and provocative: “It started with this idea of pizza fetish.”"
8384,"The Museum of Pizza is less about pizza as food than pizza “as ideology,” says the 31-year-old Nameless Network CEO who previously worked as director of audience development for the New York Times’ video arm and as associate director of global marketing for Vice Media. "
8385,“We’re looking at … the reasons why everyone from the working class to the internet media cool kids and Twitter people love pizza so much. It’s less about eating it and more about thinking about it and fetishizing it.”

8388,"Rahma and his team envisioned an advertising campaign that would be, in his words, “relatable in the sense that when you see it, you’re like, ‘Hell yeah, that is how I feel about pizza. I love pizza. Pizza’s bae.’” (The Brooklynite whose favorite pizzeria is a “tossup between Two Boots and Williamsburg Pizza” says he personally loves pizza so much he’s planning on getting a slice tattooed on his body: “I’ll probably get it on my heart. Close to my heart.”)"
8389,"The campaign’s luxe production quality and cerebral concept is intended to telegraph just how seriously Nameless Network is taking its first step from the digital world to the physical one, Rahma tells us. In addition to immersive settings, the Museum will feature games, film screenings, musical performances and fine art."
8390,"“We want people... to get their money’s worth,” Rahma says, throwing shade on pop-ups he’s personally found wanting in the past. “By investing a lot of money up front… we wanted to make sure that people understood… we were taking this very seriously, and not just throwing up an Eventbrite page.” Rahma, who intends to fund the museum with ticket sales and sponsorships, declined to say exactly how much his company had spent out of its own coffers on advertising so far."
8391,"Speaking of major event letdowns: The specter of last year’s New York City Pizza Festival — ticket holders for which arrived to find empty tents and a few skinny slices — inevitably hangs over another pizza showcase, but Rahma swears that the Museum of Pizza will deliver every visitor the one free slice its event page promises. No word yet on the local vendor supplying them, but “for sure, it will be a full slice of pizza,” Rahma vows."
8392,"The Museum of Pizza pops up in New York from Oct. 13 to 28. Tickets are $35 for most, but admission is free for adults 60+ and kids ages 3 to 12. A percentage of proceeds will go toward a yet-to-be-announced nonprofit feeding families in need. "

8399,"The Connecticut restaurant that was the setting of the 1988 movie ""Mystic Pizza,"" which helped launched Julia Roberts' career, has been cited by state labor authorities who found it owed employees $105,000 in back pay and unpaid overtime."
8400,"Located in the touristy port town of Mystic, the restaurant which has long capitalized on its role in the film about the lives of three waitresses was also ordered to pay $23,000 in civil penalties for the wage-law violations."
8401,"""It's always surprising to us when a business so well known thinks it can violate wage laws and that no one will complain,"" said Resa Spaziani, supervisor of the Labor Department's Wage and Workplace Standards Division, who once waitressed at Mystic Pizza."
8402,"The Connecticut Department of Labor investigated the restaurant after complaints by three employees. It found that over the past two years, workers have been paid less than the state minimum wage of $8.70 per hour and have not received mandated overtime wages."
8403,"The probe determined that John Zelepos, who has owned Mystic Pizza for more than 40 years, paid cooks, dishwashers and hosts as little as $5.69 per hour, while some employees were paid $7.40 per hour."
8404,A woman who answered the phone at the restaurant on Friday declined to comment.
8405,"The Labor Department reviewed employees' work hours from May 2012 to June 2014 and determined that employees worked up to 93 hours a week and were not paid required overtime, the agency said."

8414,Rapper Nas is getting a new crib in his old hood.
8415,The hip-hop legend turned venture capitalist — who invested in the fried chicken and waffle spot Sweet Chick with the promise of expanding into his home borough of Queens — will see the chain open a fifth outpost in Long Island City in early April. 
8416,"“To be able to open it in Queens and be able to fulfill the promise is pretty dope for me,” said Sweet Chick founder and CEO John Seymour, 39, who made the acquaintance of his favorite rapper through a mutual contact in the media industry in 2015."
8417,"A Queens location was part of their dialogue from the very beginning, Seymour said."
8418,"But Sweet Chick would add its third and fourth restaurants in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, and Los Angeles before a friend alerted the restaurateur about a 1,500-square-foot space for rent on Vernon Boulevard in Long Island City."
8419,"When Nas met Seymour at the storefront less than a mile south of the Queensbridge Housing project where he was raised as Nasir Jones, “He was just like, ‘Wow. This is dope,’ ” Nas’ associate recalled."
8420,"“He came onto the street and you could see the Queensborough Bridge, and he was telling me a story about how, ‘I used to walk over here when I was kid, and there was a diner over here that we used to come to,’ ” Seymour continued. “He was just like nostalgic about the whole thing.”"
8421,"That element of nostalgia will extend into the new restaurant’s design: when Sweet Chick opens in the location that previously housed the Michelin Bib Gourmand favorite Alobar next year, it will feature a backroom inspired by Nas’ father, the jazz trumpeter Olu Dara."

8423,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
8424,"“Me and Nas were talking about it, and I was like, ‘I want it to be a spot where your father would have loved to hang out back in the day,” said Seymour, who ascribes the mid-20th century origins of his chain’s signature dish to a Harlem supper club where musicians getting off work too late for dinner and too early for breakfast would order a compromise between the two."
8425,"For brunch, Sweet Chick offers only the standard fried chicken and Belgian waffle plate ($16), but its dinner menu features all kinds of $18 chicken and waffle combinations, from the General (General Tso’s sauce on a rice and broccoli waffle) to fried chicken Parmesan (tomato sauce, mozzarella, basil and a Parmesan waffle.)"
8426,The eatery’s “moodier” back room — its atmosphere conjured by dark leather booth seating and iconic jazz photos on the walls — will be open to the public during its busiest hours and available for private parties.
8427,"“It will also be Nas’ hangout when he’s in town,” Seymour said."
8428,"The hip-hop artist and record producer’s Instagram account show his connections to the community, particularly the nearby NYCHA housing projects, remain strong: Last December, Nas participated in a toy giveaway at the campus’ Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement House; he also sponsored an annual “The World is Yours” camping trip for children living in the Queensbridge development."
8429,"The Sweet Chick co-owner and venture capitalist (whose L.A.-based firm is called QueensBridge Venture Partners) has expressed interest in hiring Queensbridge residents to work at the company’s Long Island City restaurant, too, according to Seymour."
8430,"“I know [the new location] is a big deal for him,” the Williamsburg resident said, “because Nas is invested in a lot of tech companies, but he’s not invested in something so tangible as this.”"
8431,"The restaurant began officially recruiting staff in early March: ""We are looking for the dopest of the dope, so let us know why you think you would be a great fit for our squad,"" a post to the chain's Instagram account announced. "
8432,"Sweet Chick is slated to have its grand opening at 46-42 Vernon Blvd. on April 9. A spokeswoman could not confirm whether Nas will be in attendance that day, but you know what he says: ""Some dreams stay dreams, some dreams come true."""

There are all kinds of donuts, and they are made all over the world. There are even different spellings of the word, too. Do you doughnut or donut?
In New York City, there is no shortage of donuts. Indeed, while new Dunkin Donuts franchises proliferate at an alarming rate, mom-and-pop donut operations thrive (and expand.) Brooklyn's relatively new and widely hailed Dough is opening a branch in Manhattan at 14 W. 19th St. soon, and Manhattan-based Doughnut Plant, in business since 1994, is opening a third location near the Barclays Center in Brooklyn in October.

8467,"There are a lot of doughnuts in this city all claiming to be the best, but one stands out amongst the pack: the Chocolate With Cocoa Nibbs from Dough (448 Lafayette Ave., Bed-Stuy, 347-533-7544, doughbrooklyn.com). The doughnut itself is a good combo of airy and cakey with just the slightest hint that it's actually a fried calorie bomb. The chocolate glaze is every chocolate lovers dream and the sprinkling of crunchy, bitter cocoa nibbs balances the sweetness perfectly. Bonus: 10 seconds in the microwave the next day restores it to almost perfect freshness (you know, if you get distracted and forget to eat the whole thing in one sitting). -ALISON FOX"
8468,"I am not a huge fan of donuts (ice cream is my diet-killer of choice), and I especially don't love donuts with a filling. But there is one donut in the city I will make an exception for on both accounts-- the crème brûlée donut at Doughnut Plant on the Lower East Side. "
8469,"I am a savory girl, with only a touch of sweetness, so desserts are usually the last thing I crave. There are some buttery cookies that get me, and some caramel-laden ice creams (looking at you Phish Food and Salted Crack Caramel from Ample Hills) that I melt into, but other than that, it's cheese and crackers and pickles, all the way. But back to the topic at hand. If i'm picking a favorite donut, it's hands down the sour cream from Peter Pan (727 Manhattan Ave., Greenpoint, 718-389-3667, peterpan-donuts.com). This cake-like treat is surprisingly light, given the additional dairy, but the sour note adds depth and complexity and a little bit of character. And it's glazed, guaranteeing that you'll still get a sugar high. Why else would people eat sweets? -GEORGIA KRAL"
8470,"If you want a taste of old Astoria, Cafe Boulis (30-15 31st Ave., Astoria, 718-806-1014, cafeboulis.com) is the place to go. The Greek bakery’s signature dish is loukoumades, a Greek pastry made of fried dough. Boulis’ “Famous Loukoumades” can be soaked in the traditional honey, or you can pick a variety of toppings including powdered sugar, chocolate syrup and agave nectar. Plus, the staff will make the loukoumades right in front of you in a machine brought over from Greece. When I first moved to Astoria, my Manhattanite friends wrinkled their noses at my life choices but said generously “Astoria? Great food.” The response annoyed me at first, but after finding Cafe Boulis and their loukoumades, I can’t really argue since even the doughnuts in Astoria are better. -CAROLINE LINTON"
8471,"Entemann’s, Brooklyn-born, Long Island-raised, and located in their own case at the end of the supermarket aisle for decades, that's my favorite. A classic variety pack of donuts features chocolate, powdered sugar, plain and crumb. My cabinets growing up were stocked with Entemann's donuts and they were the only company I knew that made a crumb variety. -DAN RIVOLI"
8472,"A Voce Madison's Bomboloni alla Toscana is a delicious dessert that you can easily share. The sugar-coated Tuscan doughnuts are filled with a vanilla pastry cream and served with a salted caramel sauce for dipping. It's the perfect pairing.

8473,"Open 24/7, The Donut Pub (203 W. 14th St., 212-929-0126, donutpub.com), which was featured on an episode of ""Louie"" (but I had been going there long before the show), is always open to give you a sweet fix. My favorite is the red velvet cruller, glazed and delicious. -SCOTT A. ROSENBERG"
8474,"Leske’s Bakery (7612 Fifth Ave., Bay Ridge, leskesbakery.com) is famous in Bay Ridge for its Danishes, Brooklyn blackout cake and black-and-white cookies. But their donuts are so addictive you’ll be thinking about them for days. Their pillowy PB&J is filled with the perfect balance of not-too-sweet jam and peanut-buttery goodness. You'll want to lap up any remaining drop of jelly that oozes out. Don’t like jelly-filled donuts? Try their deceptively simple glazed chocolate donut, which is as buttery light as a French cruller. -CRISTIAN SALAZAR"

The restaurant launches its new frosty treat on Sunday from its Chelsea location (585 Sixth Ave.), expanding to all outposts on Aug. 1. According to the company, dairy-free hummus ice cream gets its sweetness from dates and creaminess from almond milk or coconut cream. Flavors include chocolate, strawberry and cookies and cream.

8608,"In 2017, the same year Eleven Madison Park ranked No. 1 on The World’s 50 Best Restaurants list, it closed its doors for a four-month renovation.  "
8609,Now you can see what went on behind closed doors in a new documentary series.
8610,"“7 Days Out,” premiering Friday on Netflix, documents the week leading up to major cultural events, from the 144th Kentucky Derby to the 142nd Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show."
8611,"One of the six episodes is devoted to the reopening of Eleven Madison Park on Oct. 8, 2017. Cameras follow as co-owners Daniel Humm and Will Guidara revamp the three-Michelin starred Manhattan restaurant, addressing problems both big (no gas) and small (softening down the banquette fabric) days before opening to the public.  "
8612,"“It’s one of my favorites from the bunch,” said executive producer Andrew Fried, who also is an executive producer and director of Netflix’s “Chef’s Table.”"
8613,amNewYork chatted with Fried about the episode.
8614,How did you think of including Eleven Madison Park?
8615,"We knew we wanted to identify the largest cultural events of the calendar, be it in the worlds of sports, fashion, what have you. . . . [Will Guidara and Daniel Humm’s] story to me is a compelling one because of the nature of their partnership, because they are a restaurant run truly by two sides of the equation — Daniel who of course runs the kitchen, and Will who runs everything from a hospitality standpoint and front of house — and the way that those two elements balance each other in their case, I think, is truly unique. So I’ve always been interested in trying to find a way to tell their story. When I initially approached Will about this series, I didn’t know that Eleven Madison Park was actually scheduled to close. I approached him about the opening of the NoMad Hotel in Los Angeles. And he said, ""Well sure, we could talk about that, but you know, we’re closing EMP and then we’re gutting it and then we’re going to be reopening it after the summer, and would you be interested in that?"" I realized immediately that to be able to tell the story of the No. 1 restaurant in the world closing its doors, re-imagining itself, reinventing itself, and then the pressure of what it would be like to reopen with the stakes so high was a type of story we could only dream about."

8618,"It looks like you were given a lot of access, at all hours even. But were there any ground rules or considerations when it came to when you could film?"
8619,"No, to be honest. Certainly in this episode, there are always production concerns of just how many hours in the day you can work your crew. But in terms of access, it was unfettered in terms of what we were able to film. I think there’s the responsibility of a filmmaker when you’re given that type of access to not just roll the camera on everything. You do need to start to distill: what is the story we’re telling and what’s interesting here? So that’s partially how you build up the trust with your subject, is when they realize that you’re not just filming everything, but you’re trying to focus on a specific story and track that story. Certainly once they allowed us to be capturing even anything within the dining room on opening night — “well we can’t have cameras on opening night in the restaurant” was their initial response — but once they understood that we needed some of that to pay off what we’d been doing, then we knew there weren’t really any restrictions at all. We were able to tell the story in its entirety."
8620,Was there anything that made the episode that you are particularly looking forward to people seeing?
8621,"In a general sense, I’m just excited for people to see the level of detail and the level of commitment to excellence that is involved in pulling this off. I think it’s hard to truly understand what it takes to have a restaurant that performs at the level of Eleven Madison Park. Will likes to say that he and Daniel spend 95 percent of their time working on things that only 5 percent of the people will ever notice."
8622,Was there any point in the shoot where you wondered: how are they going to pull this off?
8623,"We were concerned, at some point when they were having to do their food prep at the NoMad because they didn’t have gas at EMP, there were definitely some concerns along the way of, are they going to get gas, and is this restaurant going to be able to open in time? But I guess that’s just the restaurant business, right? We were naive. I’ve never seen the opening of a restaurant at that level."
8624,"For people who maybe once in their life will dine at EMP, or maybe never, they can get a glimpse of what goes into that."
8625,"That’s fully part of it. You are granted access into worlds that otherwise most people would never be able to be a part of. Whether it’s a meal at Eleven Madison Park on opening night or being in the paddock before the Kentucky Derby starts, there are rarefied situations that most people don’t get to experience. But our show takes you there and hopefully leaves you feeling like you’ve come pretty close to experiencing it."

But since pizza is the epitome of fast and casual, what does fast-casual pizza even mean?"

8674,"On the more traditional slice of the pizza spectrum, Rossopomodoro, a Neapolitan pizza chain imported from Italy, has served its signature thin-crust pies in Eataly and its stand-alone West Village restaurant for several years. Chef and owner Simone Falco believes this style of pizza is fast casual, as each pie uses high-quality ingredients and can be cooked in 90 seconds. Still, the West Village restaurant, with reservations, table service and personal pies starting at $16, doesn’t quite fit into the cheap, grab-and-go definition of today’s fast-casual scene. So in 2018, Falco will be opening a spinoff concept, Simò Pizza. "

8676,"The first Simò Pizza location is slated to open in early 2018 at 90-92 Gansevoort St. in Manhattan, with a second location to follow in Downtown Brooklyn in the summer."
8677,"Also opening in 2018 is New England import Oath Pizza, which serves pizza crusts grilled and seared in avocado oil for something “totally nontraditional and guilt-free,” CEO Patrik Hellstrand says."
8678,"This rush to fill the pizza market with high-end yet affordable options may be a response to the enduring opulence of exclusive, wholly unaffordable spots in NYC, especially Manhattan. "
8679,"“Pizza definitely seems to be having a moment in New York right now, but I think that’s really part of the macro-trend toward people wanting great food at all levels,” Hellstrand says."
8680,"In our age of inclusivity, a $1,000 gold-and-caviar-topped pizza may be fun to look at on Instagram, but what the people really want is good, cheesy pizza. Fast and cheap — the way it should be."

8707,Vintage61
8708,"The name for this Seaport District ""sports bistro,"" as owners Jason Casano and Laurent Vasseur are calling it, is inspired by a year good to both the New York Yankees and Bordeaux wine. The menu, which is divided into baseball-themed categories like ""On Deck"" and ""Extra Innings,"" features American bistro fare with French influences (think steak frites, all kinds of burgers and chopped salad).

The new Una Pizza Napoletana is serving the same wood-fired, 12-inch Neapolitan pies Mangieri has been churning out since age 15, but this time, they have some company: small plates like shaved turnips with ’nduja-mascarpone and desserts like strawberry panna cotta from Wildair and Contra chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra.

The main seating area features a large communal table, a 35-foot bar, and quirky embellishments like cuckoo clocks, and paint-can flower vases. Until the restaurant secures its liquor license, it’s BYOB."

8717,Yamada Chikara New York
8718,"From an alum of the renowned Spanish restaurant El Bulli (closed in 2011), comes another Manhattan's latest Japanese omakase offering. Chef Chikara Yamada's first eatery in the U.S. doesn't specialize in sushi; rather, the focus of its $180 tasting menu is kushiage, a dish of deep-fried skewered meat and vegetables. Skewers on the debut 10- to 12-course menu include a combo of oyster and bacon; a trio of gorgonzola, apple and honey; and sea urchin with soba powder and seaweed. The whole gastronomic experience ends with a match tea ceremony."

8720,Bistrot Leo
8721,"Restaurateur John McDonald has flipped his downtown Italian eatery into a French bistro helmed by a Daniel Boulud protégé, Brian Loiacono. Bistrot Leo is open for dinner now, but aims to serve all three meals of the day, seven days a week, once it’s fully up and running. Start off your meal with some crudité with smoked onion aioli for the table ($11), and then kick things into higher gear with some foie gras on brioche ($24) or some escargot in a garlic butter sauce ($21). For your main course, options include steak frites ($38), naturally, and an Atlantic wild cod poached in olive oil and accompanied by chorizo, capers and a white bean purée ($32).

8930,"
	  Each weeknight seating at Niche Niche on Macdougal Street offers a minimum of four glasses of wine for $40.        Photo Credit: Courtesy of Niche Niche © Noah Fecks     "
8931,"With a restaurant scene as expansive as New York’s, city-dwellers have little need for home cooking, let alone the age-old dinner party. Our shoebox-sized apartments boast at most a few seats, and our ovens are more likely storing sweaters than roasting chicken. Yet, in missing out on dinner parties, we’re undoubtedly missing out on myriad  wonderful memories filled with delicious food, engaging conversation and endlessly flowing wine. That’s why Ariel Arce, the woman behind Tokyo Record Bar and Air’s Champagne Parlor, is filling this niche with her new 25-seat “dinner party restaurant,” Niche Niche."
8932,"The MacDougal Street spot, located just a few blocks south of Air’s and Tokyo Record Bar, has wine at its very core. Every evening is hosted by a different member of the wine community — Frenchette’s John Connolly, Napa winemaker Dan Petroski, and Grant Reynolds of Charlie Bird, Pasquale Jones and Legacy Records, to name a few — who leads guests through tastings of their choosing and educates them on each. “The whole point of Niche Niche is to create this cultural wine space and to show that the world of wine is so much bigger than the few places and people who dictate what we drink,” says Arce."
8933,"The restaurateur began incubating the one-night-wine-host-residency concept at Air’s about two years ago but only started actively thinking about Niche Niche last April. Serendipitously, she found the King Street-adjacent space soon after and began transforming it into an upstairs open-kitchen restaurant and a cellar below."
8934,"Niche Niche forgoes the traditional wine list, instead encouraging patrons to go to the numerous refrigerators filled with whites, champagnes and rosés or to the downstairs cellar and pull their own wine. This system is both less stressful for the staff and allows the restaurant to change the wine offerings daily, letting each host add his or her selections to the mix."
8935,"Every weeknight, at 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. seatings, guests flood the upstairs lounge area, sipping their first vino and socializing with their fellow diners, before filling the 25 bar and table seats around the room. Most of these folks have reservations, but the restaurant always keeps a few spots open to walk-ins. Throughout the evening, they will receive a minimum of four glasses of wine, usually more, all for just $40 and for an additional $40, can feast on complementary dishes prepared by chefs Zach Fabian and Aaron Lirette."
8936,"The affordability of Niche Niche is a signature Ariel Arce trait and one that she’s pioneered at Tokyo Record Bar and Air’s. Each host at the new restaurant must stay below the $40 per person price tag and must serve at least four wines throughout the night but is otherwise given free rein. Taking price out of the equation, she believes, allows guests to judge the wines based on their own taste rather than on industry standards. “Sometimes, people think the $60 bottle is just OK but love the $12 bottle,” Arce notes. “People are just doing the thing we wanted them to do, to try all these wines.”"

8938,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
8939,"“I see Niche Niche as another extension of myself,” she continues, “and the things I want to create in the world of dining — inclusivity, affordability, and accessibility.”"
8940,"While Arce’s restaurants are known for their delicious food and booze, excellent music and innovative concepts, it is the people who work at each who really make the drinking and dining experiences so memorable. Indeed, anyone who has ever visited Air’s or Tokyo Record Bar will tell of great grub and tantalizing tunes, but it’s the people behind the bar, in the kitchen, and occasionally even boogieing on a makeshift dance floor who keep them coming back for more."
8941,"“Dining has always put the customer first and can make the staff feel really less than,” Arce explains. At her venues though, the staff come first. “If we can take care of each other first,” she says, “we can take better care of our customers.” It’s this philosophy that gives way to the extremely friendly environment found at each of Arce’s spaces. Staff members aren’t begrudgingly taking orders and bringing diners to their seats, as is the case at so many New York restaurants, but instead are there because they want to be and often have as much fun as the guests themselves."
8942,"In fact, Arce only has about three employees who are legitimately full-time; the rest of her team pursue other vocations — photography and DJing, for instance — outside the restaurant doors and spend only a few nights a week working at the Greenwich Village spots. For this reason, the restaurateur has needed to hire just a couple new staff members for Niche Niche, with most of her existing team filling the vacant roles. “Everyone has basically been saying, ‘I’ll take this night, I’ll take this one,’” she says."
8943,"Chef Fabian, like most of the Niche Niche team, is a staple at Tokyo Record Bar and Air’s and, while helping Chef Lirette open the new restaurant, has been running between the two spaces since last week’s opening. “If it continues like this, we’ll have to get him a scooter or something!” Arce said with a laugh."
8944,"The vibe at Niche Niche is casual and familial, and, thanks in large part to the staff, the meals succeed in recreating the dinner parties that Arce and so many of us enjoyed growing up. “You are literally coming into our home, and we want it to feel that way,” says Arce, though thankfully, without the political disagreements and endless questions about your romantic life. That, she leaves to your own family."
8945,"Niche Niche is located at 43 MacDougal St. and is currently open Monday through Friday. The schedules for March and April hosts can be found online, and reservations can be made through Resy."

8953,Queens won’t be the only borough with a night market come this weekend.
8954,"Billed as a “global food celebration,” the first-ever Bronx Night Market will assemble more than 40 food and beverage vendors representing the city’s diverse culinary offerings in Fordham Plaza on Saturday."
8955,"The monthly, open-air festival — a collaboration between quarterly magazine Edible Bronx and the Bronx-based creative agency Blox, with support from the Fordham BID — will also feature local merchants and live performances, according to the event website."
8956,"The market, organizers said, is an “effort to bring awareness of just how amazing our borough is, and how much there is to offer by way of food, drink, culture, and performers.”"
8957,"More than half the vendors serving up international eats will be Bronx-based businesses. Those include: Empanology, a catering company making Puerto Rican-style empanadas with creative fillings like chicken truffle mac ‘n’ cheese and summer squash; Tripla Panna Ice Cream, a fledgling ice creamery scooping out of the Mottley Kitchen cafe in Mott Haven; and Millie Peartree Fish Fry & Soul Food, a Southern kitchen serving up catfish strips and fried shrimp on the Grand Concourse."
8958,"“We choose vendors based on the menu, business practices and of course, THE FOOD,” organizers said."
8959,"Empanology founder Jason Alicea, who will be serving at least four savory pockets and one sweet one, calls the food scene in the Bronx “super underappreciated” and said he is especially looking forward to the market’s debut because his business opens its first brick-and-mortar shop the following weekend in Mott Haven."
8960,"Like the Queens International Night Market, the boogie down borough’s version will also highlight local artisans and merchants, such as The Bronxer founder and photographer Alex Rivera, painter Christy Ayala and The Lit. Bar owner Noëlle Santos."

8975,Finding a quiet place to share a meal and conversation can be a challenge in the city that never sleeps.
8976,"But it’s a necessity for Manhattanite Greg Scott, who has hearing loss."
8977,"Scott, by day an industry research associate at a finance firm, is the creator of SoundPrint, a free app that allows users to measure noise levels in restaurants, bars and other venues as well as search for places by sound level on a map."
8978,The idea came to him as he tried to navigate the dating scene in the city.
8979,"“I would search for quiet spots online so I could better converse and connect with a date,” Scott told amNewYork in an email. “I would arrive and the place would be super noisy — music blasting or with poor acoustics and interior design.”"
8980,"SoundPrint, which officially launched last month, has received 25,000 decibel level submissions, Scott said. About half are from New York City, with the majority being restaurants, followed by bars and cafes."
8981,"Scott said while he originally developed the app for people with hearing loss and other sensory disorders, those with normal hearing use it, too."
8982,"“Many people don’t enjoy raising their voices to be heard or straining their neck to decipher what someone is saying during a dinner,” he said. “Another goal is to alert the restaurant and bar owners that there is a sizable segment of the dining population that desires a more acoustic-friendly atmosphere.” "
8983,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
8984,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
8985,"Noise — whether it’s from bars, airplanes or construction crews — is one of the top complaints phoned into the city’s 311 line."
8986,"Rather than penalize loud venues, Scott wants to highlight places where diners don’t have to shout to be heard."
8987,"“This is not about turning New York City into some quiet little village,” said Arline Bronzaft, a board member of the environmental group GrowNYC and leading expert in the impact of noise who advised Scott while he developed the app. “It’s about lessening the din so good sounds can be heard.”"
8988,"Like other sound level apps such as Noise Hunter and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health’s (NIOSH), SoundPrint uses a smartphone’s microphone to measure decibel readings, but adds a crowdsourcing component. "
8989,"The average reading for a venue is placed in one of four categories based on hearing health guidelines researched by NIOSH, the Environmental Protection Agency and others, Scott said. A reading of 70 A-weighted decibels (or dBA) or lower is deemed quiet, 71-75 dBA is moderate, 76-80 dBA is loud and 81 dBA and up is very loud."
8990,"Many of the NYC sites on the map are concentrated in Manhattan, but Scott said he is hoping for more submissions from the other four boroughs. "
8991,"Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said he doesn’t see apps like SoundPrint being a detriment to businesses."
8992,"“Some customers seek a quiet restaurant due to hearing loss or because they simply want a more intimate atmosphere, while others seek a loud, party-like scene,” he said. “There shouldn’t be any issues as long as the app is used to direct people to restaurants where they can get the experience they want.”"
8993,"Scott said reaction from the industry has been positive, with some restaurants reaching out to feature designated quieter areas. One eatery that had high readings on the app, Pepe Giallo in Chelsea, even had an acoustic consultant install paneling to reduce noise levels, he said."
8994,"“We want to work with the venues and help them,” said Scott, who recently added guidelines for mitigating noise issues to SoundPrint’s website. “That’s one of the main goals/purposes in addition to helping people find the quieter spots.”"

9005,"Acclaimed chef Masaharu Morimoto (of ""Iron Chef"" fame) opened his first ramen restaurant in April. The elevated Japanese menu features such noodle dishes as the pork-based tonkotsu ($10-$13), the spicy tantan with coconut curry ($10-$13) and tsukemen, pictured -- ramen dipped in a separate bowl of soup ($14). The ramen was specially made for the chef by Sun Noodles and is a hand-massaged noodle that resists becoming soggy in the broth. Beyond ramen, appetizers include pork belly bao ($4/each) and sticky ribs ($7/two). 342 Lexington Ave., 646-201-9273, momosanramen.com"

Chinese Club opened in their other Malaysian spot, Pasar Malam, this past spring and is modeled after Lo's great-grandfather's own Chinese Club in Darjeeling, India. The spicy menu is also inspired by her Hakka-Chinese and Indian-Chinese household, resulting in such dishes as tandoori kung bao chicken ($10.95). There are nearly a dozen noodle offerings, too, from Darjeeling Hakka lo mein, pictured, to Calcutta chili garlic egg noodles (both $9.95). 208 Grand St., Williamsburg, 718-487-4576, thechineseclubnyc.com"

With food this good, it wouldn't be surprising if this is the first of many over here, too. There's a long menu (complete with pictures!) to help you navigate the offerings. Among the noodles, a must are the dan dan ($8). The homemade noodles are slick with chili oil -- leaving a little heat on your tongue and lips. Don't miss the sweet and sour Shanghai ribs ($12) or the clay pot dumplings ($12) either, and leave room for some dim sum. 401 Sixth Ave., 212-633-8900, Facebook.com/MadamZhusKitchenNYC"

Add-ons include bamboo shoot and the house-blend hot spices. The rest of the name stands for oysters, kitchen and cocktails, so you can also dabble from the raw bar, steamed buns and the new drinks menu. 3452 Broadway "

9135,"New Yorkers have strong opinions about many things, and brunch is no different. The leisurely mid-day meal is as synonymous with the city as taxi cabs and bagels. But if you are tired of the standard fare, several restaurants offer off-the-beaten-path dishes to both tantalize and confuse your taste buds. From steamed egg custard to ravioli Benedict, these unique plates take familiar flavors to a whole new level."

9137,The ravioli Benedict at Il Tesoro
9138,"At this Upper East Side restaurant, Sicilian-born Chef AJ Black brings the techniques of his Italian heritage to each meal. The result is a brunch menu that features velvety poached eggs on top of a variety of ravioli combinations and earthy polenta with roasted vegetables and a runny egg. The standout, though, is the ravioli Benedict. Black's homemade pasta with cinnamon-apple filling, mushroom sauce and a poached egg will make even the most steadfast brunch-goer rethink what defines the brunch staple. ""We thought that's something different totally,"" said Black. ""Like a new invention in Italian cuisine."" $15; 1578 First Ave., 212-861-9620, iltesoro.com"

""[It's] just like the bacon, egg and cheeses you get in the suburbs on a Sunday morning,"" said Emily, who, like her husband, was raised in the suburbs of New York. ""We just want pizza to be fun and exploratory."" $16; 919 Fulton St., Clinton Hill, 347-844-9588, pizzalovesemily.com"

The intriguingly-named concoction features eggs and cheddar cheese wrapped in bacon, which is slathered in maple syrup before cooked. No surprise, breakfast sushi has been a bestseller since day one.

Still, there are some standard breakfast components to the hearty dish: it comes with toast. $15; 435 Hudson St., 212-647-9196, enjb.com"

9224,"We've reeled in some of New York's best places to buy fresh fish -- just in time for the meatless Fridays of Lent.
While buying and cooking fresh fish may sound daunting, especially in a tiny New York apartment with questionable circulation, there are so many great places in NYC to purchase fresh seafood. We're surrounded by water, after all.
You need not be a fish expert in order to purchase your favorite restaurant cut. ""A sign of a good fish market is that you should be able to ask your fish monger what to buy,"" says Adam Geringer-Dunn, executive chef and owner of Greenpoint Fish and Lobster. ""He may not be the best cook, but he should have cooking suggestions.""
To start, tell your fishmonger what you like to eat or have experience preparing. Fluke and flounder are usually fairly easy to come by and even more difficult to mess up.
Another key to spotting a good fish market is whole fish, not just fillets. ""Look for clear eyes, bulging out, not sunken in, and flesh that's firm,"" says Geringer-Dunn. Even if you're not planning on buying and de-boning a whole fish, product that looks like it just came out of the water is a good sign that the market is using fresh, healthy fish.
Choosing fresh versus farmed can incite another dilemma, and while fresh is oftentimes preferred by health professionals and sustainability activists, farmed can also be a safe and perhaps better alternative. Check the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (seafoodwatch.org, or download the free app) to see if the fish you're about to purchase is sustainable and in season, and if fresh or farmed is the best choice. 
Once you're set on buying fish, head to one of these fish markets to bait and catch the fish best for you."

9228,"To start, tell your fishmonger what you like to eat or have experience preparing. Fluke and flounder are usually fairly easy to come by and even more difficult to mess up."
9229,"Another key to spotting a good fish market is whole fish, not just fillets. ""Look for clear eyes, bulging out, not sunken in, and flesh that's firm,"" says Geringer-Dunn. Even if you're not planning on buying and de-boning a whole fish, product that looks like it just came out of the water is a good sign that the market is using fresh, healthy fish."
9230,"Choosing fresh versus farmed can incite another dilemma, and while fresh is oftentimes preferred by health professionals and sustainability activists, farmed can also be a safe and perhaps better alternative. Check the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch (seafoodwatch.org, or download the free app) to see if the fish you're about to purchase is sustainable and in season, and if fresh or farmed is the best choice. "
9231,"Once you're set on buying fish, head to one of these fish markets to bait and catch the fish best for you."
9232,"The only sustainable seafood market in Greenpoint, this Brooklyn destination also functions as a restaurant, complete with counter side seats and table service in the back. One sure sign of a good fish market is fast turnover -- by selling fish retail and as a restaurant, this venue helps turn product quickly and keeps expenses lower than if they had unusable raw fish at the end of the day.
Greenpoint Fish only sells sustainable fish, either from local fishers or shipped in overnight. A daily rotating list of available seafood lists the boats or farms from which each fish originated, and the market tries to have a close relationship with as many fisherpeople and boat captains as possible.
The market carries plenty of fresh fillets and whole fish, as well as seafood like clams and oysters. Further, Greenpoint Fish is branching out to discover more interesting, environmentally friendly and healthy (no pesticides, no hormones) fish products. What you're buying here isn't cheap, but it's high quality and a worthy splurge.

9237,"One of NYC's biggest fish markets, The Lobster Place sells thousands of pounds of both wholesale and retail seafood every day.
Located in Chelsea Market, this fish market is often packed with tourists opting for the notoriously fresh takeout sushi or the freshly boiled lobster by the pound.
The best deals (and perhaps product) is found in the retail fish market, where live lobsters can be chosen by weight, an enormous selection of clams and oysters can inspire plenty of home-cooked dinner, and fresh cuts of sushi-grade fish can lead to an at-home sushi night. Pre-marinated, skewered, seasoned or crusted fresh fish are also available to help cut out a few steps while preparing fish at home.
An online store shows what's in stock, provides cooking tips for everything from king crab legs to blowfish tails, and allows you to place an over-the-phone order for quick pickup in the store. But browsing the colorful, enticing fish (some of which is pre-cooked if you really prefer not to cook fish) is irreplaceable.
Executive chef John Beatty of CATCH is a fan of this market. ""The best days to hit The Lobster Place are Wednesdays and Thursdays,"" he recommends. This is when they bring in fish that has just arrived from the larger marketplace. ""As a bonus, you have the option to buy the fish whole as is -- and for no extra charge they will clean and portion for you!""

9268,"In  a city of a thousand cultures, the options for dinner are nearly endless. But if you’ve narrowed the menu down to at least two choices, have no fear—the likelihood is that you can have both."
9269,"The New York “melting pot” metaphor can be taken quite literally within the city’s food culture, as there are a number of restaurants that specialize in not one, but two or three types of cultural cuisine. Some — like a DJ with an ’80s power ballad and current pop hit — mash up the flavors of both cuisines into brand new meals, while others simply offer classic dishes from both cultures."
9270,"Whether it be because of rich immigration histories or the creativity of the chefs and owners, these combo spots are perfect for when indecision next strikes. And, knowing the  number of takeout menus in your drawer, you know it will."
9271,Asian + Latin American
9272,"La Caridad 78 — Upper West Side, Manhattan"
9273,"Chinese-Cuban seems to be one of the more popular cultural mash-ups in NYC. Though crema de maiz (cream of corn) soup served alongside wonton and egg drop seems like an unlikely combination, the history behind the menu might surprise you. Thousands of Chinese immigrants traveled to Cuba during the 19th and 20th centuries, and there was a booming Chinatown in Havana. But as Fidel Castro came into power, many fled to the U.S., especially New York, where they opened restaurants again. Whether you want a side of rice and beans or lo mein, or both, you can have it at La Caridad 78."
9274,"MamaSushi — Harlem & Inwood, Manhattan"
9275,"Japanese meets Dominican at MamaSushi, where executive chef David Nuñez uses his wide range of experience in Asian-Latino fusion to offer a whole new kind of sushi. Try rolls stuffed with plantains, chimichurri-style meat, yuca fries and the item that brings the two food groups together: avocado."

9279,"What began as a food truck now has three brick-and-mortar locations in Manhattan and one in Brooklyn, and of course trucks still circling around the city that you can keep up with on social media. Started by Queens native and Columbia grad Edward “3D” Song, Korilla BBQ transports the best of Korean barbecue cooking via a Mexican standard: the burrito. This means loading up a tortilla with bulgogi or gochujang pork, rice (sticky, fried or black), kimchi, beans and a killer sauce. Owners say the idea came from the need for convenience, and wanted the “fusion” element to be obvious in their name."
9280,"“At Korilla, we want to ensure you can enjoy Korean barbecue on-the-go, and a burrito is the perfect vehicle,” co-owner William Song said. “Our name, Korilla, can be pronounced like Korea as you would ‘tortilla.’”"

Telio serves both Greek and Italian specialties — from moussaka and kotopoulo paidakia to linguine carbonara, veal parmigiana and brick oven pizzas."
9284,"Pizza Palace — Astoria, Queens"
9285,"If you ask a Greek person where the best gyro is near Ditmars Avenue in Astoria, you might be shocked to hear “Pizza Palace.” But this is actually a common thread in the neighborhood known for its Greek influences (see: Romano’s Famous Pizza, Gyro Uno, Boston Pizza). Most pizzerias in Astoria serve gyros and platters alongside pies, and most say — perhaps unsurprisingly — that they are the best picks at these restaurants, named for something else entirely."
9286,Japanese + Italian
9287,"Basta Pasta — Chelsea, Manhattan"
9288,"For a more high-end fusion experience (and no option to order-in), try Basta Pasta in Chelsea. The restaurant originally opened in Tokyo in 1985, where the open-kitchen concept was introduced, and five years later came to NYC. Watch as chefs cook your meals of spaghetti and mozzarella with shiitake mushrooms, or linguine with fresh sea urchin and basil."
9289,"Natsumi Tapas — Gramercy Park, Manhattan"
9290,"Restaurateur Barbara Matsumura brought together Italian chef Andrea Tiberi and sushi chef Hiroyuki Nagao to create a menu that combines the tastes of Italian and Japanese cuisine in truly unique ways. Green tea ricotta flatbread, chicken katsu penne and Ciao Meatballs (with basil pesto teriyaki) are just a few examples of how unlikely flavors can come together deliciously."
9291,
9292,Asian Fusion
9293,66S Fusion — Brooklyn
9294,"Asian Fusion may be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of “fusion restaurants,” which started as far back as the 1960s, but really came into full force in the ’80s and ’90s when non-Asian chefs  started adding Eastern ingredients to their dishes, mostly within French cuisine. Now it can mean anything from a combination of different Asian cuisines to a combo of Asian and American tastes. 66S Fusion in Brooklyn offers more Japanese/American choices, from burgers to sashimi to filet mignon with shishito peppers."
9295,Miyabi II Asian Fusion — Staten Island
9296,"Known for its extremely fresh fish and the best sushi on the island, if not in the city, Miyabi II is a must-visit. The diverse menu includes Malaysian curry, Thai red snapper, hibachi and bento boxes, truly living up to its name in both hot and cold options."
9297,Mexican + Italian
9298,"Emilia’s Pizza — Astoria, Queens"
9299,"There has been many a late night (or early morning) where the grand debate between “pizza or tacos?” has taken place. But luckily both of your drunk cravings can be satisfied in this city. From quesadillas, burritos and tacos made with hand-rolled corn tortillas, to a wide variety of pizza flavors (including chorizo and jalapeno toppings), comfort food has a whole new meaning at Emilia’s."
9300,"Great Burrito — Flatiron District, Manhattan"
9301,"A bit of a hole-in-the-wall, Great Burrito’s sign can make you do a double-take. The self-explanatory name is right in the middle, and then immediately to the left it reads “Italian Pizza” in large letters. Still, don’t be fooled by its identity crisis. Find authentic Mexican street food here, in large (and cheap) portions, alongside pizza pies if you find yourself craving a slice to wash down your torta. Open 24 hours, and cash only."

Staten Island Borough President Jimmy Oddo said he wasn't surprised about the findings. ""Our heart disease statistics bear this out,"" he said in statement.
When it came his borough's love for extra cheese, the borough president joked that ""this is probably a good time for a friendly reminder that four different types of cheese is not what they meant by the 'four major food groups.''
Michael Burke, the owner of Deninos Pizzeria & Tavern at 525 Port Richmond Ave., said the extra cheese isn't as big as a trend at his eatery compared to their sausage pies.
""We've been doing this the same way since 1951,"" he said."

9599,New restaurants and bars seem to open every day in New York City. Here’s a look at some of the latest eateries and watering holes to debut.
9600,"Bialy breakfast sandwiches and egg creams are on the menu at this new corner luncheonette from Nate Adler (Huertas), chef Will Edwards (Reynard, Marlow & Sons, Diner, Roman’s) and general manager Flip Biddelman (The Modern). The nostalgic menu is inspired by the foods the native New Yorkers grew up eating, with veggie gyros and Reubens on offer. Breakfast and lunch service is available to start, with dinner (including a whole rotisserie duck feast) and a liquor bar to follow. Now open daily from 8 a.m.-4 p.m.; 58 Marcy Ave., Williamsburg, 718-636-0902, gertie.nyc"
9601,"Former Mission Chinese chef Angela Dimayuga, who is now the creative director of food and culture for the Standard hotels, is behind this new gay bar in the former narcbar space next to the Standard, East Village. No Bar marks the first official queer-focused venue for the hotel chain, with drag shows and other special events on the calendar. Now open Sunday-Wednesday from 5 p.m.-2 a.m., Thursday-Saturday. from 5 p.m.-3 a.m.; 25 Cooper Square, 212-475-5700, standardhotels.com"
9602,"Korean cuisine, with an emphasis on tableside induction dining, is the focus of this restaurant (pronounced “on”), located near Koreatown. Find dishes like edamame pancakes, seasonal jeongol (Korean hot pot), galbi-jjim (braised short ribs) and, for dessert, pear shaved ice and yakgwa mille-feuille, a Korean-French pastry hybrid.

9613,"For New York's cash-strapped foodies, it's the most wonderful time of the year."
9614,"NYC Restaurant Week, the biannual promotion that features reduced prices at hundreds of the city's top restaurants, is in full swing. This winter edition of Restaurant Week is actually three weeks and runs now through March 7, with 291 participating restaurants offering a discounted lunch and dinner prix fixe."
9615,"The culinary tradition dates back to 1992, a time before OpenTable and #foodporn, when it debuted during the Democratic National Convention as a one-off culinary event to draw in convention delegates and attendees. Spearheaded by Tim Zagat and Joe Baum, the week-long event featured 95 eateries serving a lunch prix fixe for $19.92. It was so successful, the restaurateurs brought it back the following year, with lunch this time costing $19.93."
9616,"Twenty-two years later, Restaurant Week is still going strong. And like any young adult, it's had some noticeable growth spurts. For one, the price has continued to go up, with lunch now costing $25. Also, it is several weeks long and runs not once but twice a year, during the summer and winter."
9617,"Most noticeably, the number of participating restaurants has tripled, with many now serving both lunch and dinner. Along with Restaurant Week originals, such as Tribeca Grill, Delmonico's Restaurant, Le Cirque and Barbetta, there are 42 new dining choices this year, including Harlem hotspots The Cecil and Lido and the Brooklyn Museum's new restaurant, Saul."
9618,"Though restaurants come and go, the mission of Restaurant Week has remained the same since the start."
9619,"""When Restaurant Week was created, it really was to take the mystery out of what the price will be,"" said Kelly Curtin, executive vice president of membership and destination services at NYC & Company, the city's marketing organization that now oversees NYC Restaurant Week. ""It takes barriers away, so anybody can experience a beautiful meal at an important restaurant in the city."""
9620,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
9621,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
9622,"For chefs, this can mean the chance to reach a whole new audience."
9623,"""We want to expose our cuisine and service to new guests who may have not tried my restaurant or who don't frequent the neighborhood regularly,"" said Chef David Burke, who has two restaurants participating in NYC Restaurant Week right now."
9624,"With multiple weeks of dining deals available, diners can try new restaurants to their stomachs' and wallets' content. Kim Pham, a senior at New York University, is currently vying to break her personal Restaurant Week record of eight this winter."
9625,"""Being a college student means a lot of time eating dollar pizza from St. Mark's,"" said Pham, 21. ""But that doesn't mean I want to sacrifice on quality."""
9626,"Beyond diners, restaurants benefit from the promotion, too. Last winter, participating restaurants made $6 million during what is typically a slow time of year for the industry, according to NYC & Company. Since NYC Restaurant Week Winter 2011, the company estimates that the program has generated $41.6 million in total revenue based on OpenTable data."
9627,"""It's one of our vibrancy programs,"" said Curtin. ""We're able to create this program to fill up the restaurants. We get people out dining."""
9628,"The numbers are difficult to track, but people are coming out. Last winter, some 210,000 diners made online reservations -- that's not counting walk-ins or reservations made directly with restaurants. When online reservations opened on Feb. 10 for this winter's installment, the traffic strained the NYC & Company servers."
9629,"""Reservations are usually off the hook ... especially right at the beginning,"" said Curtin. ""There's a lot of demand."""
9630,"Still, this is New York, and Restaurant Week isn't without its detractors. One common complaint is that some restaurants serve off-menu items that are of a lesser quality than regular menu items. Pham avoids this by carefully vetting her Restaurant Week picks."
9631,"""I make sure all items featured on the Restaurant Week menu are on the regular menu,"" said Pham, whose reservations this winter include David Burke Kitchen, Morimoto, ilili Restaurant and TAO Uptown. ""I want to make sure I'm getting the most accurate representation of the restaurant."""
9632,"The lack of outer-borough options is also obvious, with only four out of this year's 291 participating restaurants not in Manhattan. Though the price point -- a three-course meal that's a deal at $25 for lunch and $38 for dinner -- factors heavily into this."
9633,"""It's apples and oranges,"" said Robert MacKay, director of public relations for the Queens Economic Development Corporation. ""It's not economically feasible for a lot of our restaurants."""
9634,"To that end, the corporation has been running its own version of restaurant week in Queens since 2004. NYC Restaurant Week has inspired similar spinoffs in Brooklyn, Staten Island and the Bronx. It's even helped launch theater promotions in the city, such as Off-Broadway Week, a 2-for-1 ticket offer that is running now through March 2. Outside of New York, you'll find restaurant weeks in cities across the country, with Denver, Baltimore, Cleveland and Louisville, Ky., recently hosting their own."
9635,"""Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery,"" said Curtin, adding, ""We're the oldest and the largest with the most diverse number of cuisines. It reflects the diversity of New York City."""
9636,"Restaurant Week runs now until March 7. Three-course prix fixe for lunch is $25, dinner $38, excluding beverages, gratuities and taxes. To see the full list of participating restaurants and to make reservations, go to nycgo.com/restaurantweek."

In the six months or so leading up to the announcement of 2019’s awardees, StarChefs worked to identify the city’s most impressive young chefs, meeting with more than 120 chefs, bartenders, artisans, sommeliers and restaurateurs. A network of more than 1,100 Rising Stars alumni nominates recipients who are under 40 years old (unless they’ve changed careers) and have worked as an executive chef for less than 10 years. These hospitality professionals, whom former honorees can also recommend via StarChefs’ social media and website, additionally must have menu control at their respective restaurants."
9743,"“We look for chefs who are leaders, who have sound technique, business savvy, love for their community, who are progressive, and who their peers can learn from,” says Antoinette Bruno, StarChefs CEO and editor-in-chief."
9744,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
9745,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
9746,"Once the outlet has compiled a list of chefs it will consider, an editorial crew of two people spends roughly two hours at each chef’s venue, where they taste and photograph the nominee’s creations and scrupulously interview him or her. Bruno explains that the Rising Chefs Awards criteria are based on national standards. “If a chef wins in Philadelphia, it’s not because they’re cooking some of the best food in Philly,” she says. “It’s because they’re cooking some of the best food in the country.” The judges evaluate dishes on “presentation, creativity, taste and execution.”"
9747,"For many of these nominees, a visit from StarChefs is akin to a visit from Andrew Zimmern or a Michelin Guide inspector. “I was very meticulous while preparing for their visit,” says Manuela Sanin, a pastry chef at Flatiron’s Eleven Madison Park and one of this year’s Rising Stars. “I had an itemized prep-list for all the mise en place and a timeline broken down by the hour. I made sure everything was set up, organized and ready to go by the time they showed up.” All of Sanin’s nervousness soon diminished, though, and once the StarChefs crew arrived, she said, “it was very fluid and fun.”"
9748,"Perhaps the toughest part of StarChefs’ job, however, is having to compare what looks like apples to oranges — that is, weighing the different calibers and specialties of so many chefs against one another. “Anyone with an appetite can have an opinion about food. That’s the joy of food. Everybody eats. It’s universal, and we all have our own tastes,” says Bruno. “The StarChefs staff includes professionals who have been in the industry for years, most of their lives. As a team, we have culinary degrees, we are former chefs, and we have been eating across the country and the world for decades. But most of all, we love food, the people who cook it, and the industry as a whole.”"
9749,"Although it is one of the newer organizations in the food and hospitality industry, StarChefs has quickly become a well-respected and influential resource, and receiving its Rising Star Award comes with the clout and acclaim that can help launch a chef to new heights."
9750,"“Often the StarChefs Rising Stars Award is the first major award or national recognition a chef, sommelier, bartender, or artisan may receive,” says Bruno. “Because StarChefs is on the ground in restaurants interviewing and tasting with hundreds of chefs across the country every year, we have insights into the hospitality industry on a micro level.”"
9751,"Previous winners of the Rising Star Award include big names like Wylie Dufresne, Jonathan Benno, Marco Canora, and Jean-Francois Bruel, who all received the honor early in their careers and have gone on to garner esteemed reputations in the restaurant world. Many of this year’s honorees hope that the Rising Star Award will have a similar effect on the shaping of their own futures."
9752,"“It offers a sense of satisfaction knowing that people are beginning to recognize there’s something special here,” says Rising Star Eric Bolyard, the head chef at La Campagnie de Vins Surnaturels in SoHo. “It reinforces that staying authentic to my food and sense of hospitality is working [and] will only encourage further evolution of the foundation we’ve already built.”"

10104,"In New York City, staying on top of the hottest new restaurants can be like an Olympic sport. Rushing to get a table and eat at the best new spot is a cutthroat game."
10105,But true restaurant lovers also appreciate the good old standbys — restaurants that have been open for decades or even a century or more.
10106,Browse through our timeline of some of the most time-honored eateries in the city:
10107,"Sometime between 1762 and 1767 in lower Manhattan, Fraunces Tavern began serving ale and food. It has not been a functioning restaurant in the entire time since, however. The historic building was home to prominent New Yorkers, is called the oldest building in Manhattan by the Sons of the Revolution, was host to the secret society the Sons of Liberty and is a site on the New York Freedom Trail. Today, it’s a tavern again, serving Colonial-style shepherd’s pie, tomahawk steaks for two and raw oysters (of course). It’s also the home of the Fraunces Tavern Museum."
10108,"Fun fact: George Washington dined at Fraunces Tavern with his officers in the Continental Army on Dec. 4, 1783, after the British withdrew from New York."

10112,"In 1827, the Delmonico brothers set up a small shop in the Financial District selling fine pastries, coffee, chocolate, wine and liquor and Havana cigars. No doubt seeing that luxury sold, the brothers bought a plot of land at the intersection of Beaver, William and South William streets, and Delmonico’s restaurant was born in 1837. It was the first dining establishment in America to use tablecloths. "
10113,"Fun fact: The classic American foods lobster Newburg, eggs Benedict and of course, the Delmonico steak (a boneless rib-eye brushed with melted butter and beef fat after it comes out of the broiler) were created here."
10114,"56 Beaver St., Financial District, delmonicosrestaurantgroup.com"
10115,"This unobtrusive Gramercy tavern and beer hall has been a fully functioning restaurant and drinking establishment for 150 years — even during Prohibition, when a flower shop served as a front. The original design elements (the rosewood bar, the pressed tin ceiling and the original tiled floor), still delight guests. On the menu are burgers and Italian fare. Pete’s was once called Healy’s, named after its owners."
10116,"Fun fact: The writer O. Henry lived near Healy’s, and the tavern plays a role in his story “The Lost Blend.” It’s also rumored he wrote his famous story “The Gift of the Magi” at the tavern."

10118,"Perhaps you’ve seen the  life-size cow on the outside of the building that’s been home to the Old Homestead Steakhouse since 1868? It’s basically a beacon, beckoning  historic restaurant and steak lovers alike. This classic New York City establishment has never strayed — servings are large, and the prime dry-aged rib eye is a must order. Old Homestead is the city’s oldest steakhouse — beating out both Peter Luger’s and Keens."
10119,Fun fact: It’s said that the “doggie bag” was invented here. The portion sizes were so large that customers always had leftovers to take home.

10121,"The home of one of New York City’s most iconic hamburgers fills  with revelers during happy hours (just as it was portrayed in “Mad Men,” if you remember when Peggy danced for Pete). It’s a favorite of tourists, New Yorkers and bigwigs alike; famous faces to grace the Irish saloon include Frank Sinatra, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and Nat King Cole. The raw bar to the right of the entrance features an impressive selection of local oysters and clams."
10122,"Fun fact: P.J. Clarke’s didn’t get its name until 1902. From 1884 until then, the bar was managed by a “Mr. Jennings,” who opened after seeing a demand for a watering hole for the Irish immigrants who worked in the area."

10124,"Producer Albert Keen established this restaurant in the former Herald Square theater district, where it hosted its fair share of actors and other professionals in the playmaking business. According to the restaurant, it has one of the largest collections in the world of churchwarden pipes (the kind Sherlock Holmes smokes); hundreds, if not thousands, line the steakhouse’s ceiling. The Keens’ clay pipes were brought from the Netherlands, were registered by the guests who smoked them and kept clean by “pipe boys,” in whose ranks Teddy Roosevelt, Babe Ruth, Adlai Stevenson and John Barrymore once belonged."
10125,"Fun fact: While most old-school New York City steakhouses are best-known for porterhouse steaks, rib eyes and prime rib, at Keens, you really should order the Mutton Chop, a saddle of lamb nearly two inches thick."

10127,"Eating at Peter Luger Steakhouse in Brooklyn is a rite of passage for any serious foodie. Devouring a porterhouse steak, onion and tomato salad, thick-cut bacon, creamed spinach and a dry martini will never feel as good as it does here. Originally called Carl Luger’s Café, Billiards and Bowling Alley, the restaurant opened in 1887 in what was then a predominantly German section of Williamsburg. When Peter Luger died, a local businessman who ate two steaks a day there bought the restaurant and maintained the business."
10128,Fun fact: Peter Luger only buys USDA prime steaks for its restaurants. They’re dry-aged on site.

Willy Katz joined the business in 1903 and eventually bought out the brothers, but despite management and name changes, Katz’s has remained true to its style and menu over the years. If you want a pastrami and corned beef sandwich, matzo ball soup or chopped liver, head to the Lower East Side. Katz’s prides itself on making its cured meats with a slow, 30-day process."
10131,"Fun fact: The famous scene from “When Harry Met Sally,” where Meg Ryan’s character fakes an orgasm, was filmed in Katz’s. The owners told Gothamist that the scene is reenacted once or twice a week, even now, two decades after the film was released."

Visiting the knishery is like taking a step into the Lower East Side of yore, but fillings have expanded beyond the traditional potato and kasha to sweet potatoes, jalapeños and more. Martha Stewart and director Morgan Spurlock have both gone on record as calling the baked, round knishes here the “best ever.”"

Mayors, dignitaries, ballplayers and New York celebrities like Woody Allen are all “regulars,” and with only 12 tables, there’s not much space for anyone else. The food is classic red sauce Italian and the meatballs are considered to be some of the best in the city."
10137,"Fun fact: The host and one of the owners who holds court at Rao’s most nights is a familiar face. Frank Pellegrino is also an actor. You’ve seen him in “Goodfellas” and on episodes of “Law & Order” and “The Sopranos,” in which he appeared regularly as FBI Chief Frank Cubitoso."

10139,"Gennaro Lombardi launched his namesake business after emigrating from Naples, Italy. Lombardi’s — where other great pizzaoli like John Sasso of John’s, Patsy Lancieri of Patsy’s, and Anthony Pero of Totonno’s all studied their craft — is considered the birthplace of New York-style pizza. The coal oven-baked pies were first sold in 1897 out of a grocery store, and the pizzeria we know today opened in 1910. Its sauce-less pie topped with freshly shucked clams is particularly beloved among locals. "

While some descendants of that community still remain, and a few Italian bakeries and butcher shops do, too, the crown jewel is Bamonte’s Restaurant. This red-sauce joint with original chandeliers is a perfect distraction from modern life. Stop in for a plate of the huge handmade cheese ravioli, served in a light tomato-and-meat sauce, or the lasagna with chicken and spinach."

Both old-timers and newcomers to the neighborhood enjoy the food at Ferdinando’s, especially the panelle (Sicilian fritters made with chickpea flour) and vastedda (cow’s spleen) sandwiches, layered high with ricotta and Parmesan. Ferdinando’s also makes a delicious pasta con sarde, with garlic, olive oil, fennel, sardines and pine nuts."

(We’re talking about chandeliers from a Torino palace owned by an Italian royal family, a harpsichord dating back to 1631 and a stone fountain in the romantic outdoor garden here.) White truffles offer a taste of luxury and figure predominantly on the menu when in season. Specialties include the bollito, agnolotti pasta and risotto. "

Their brother Ralph designed the octopus sculpture that famously hung from the ceiling of the restaurant’s main dining room for more than two decades. "
10152,"Fun fact: The restaurant had, until not too long ago, enforced a strict dress code of proper attire, no shorts and no tank tops. Changing demographics and superstorm Sandy’s devastation forced the owners to reconsider."

10175,Oyster summer season is in session.
10176,"The mollusk may be the unofficial food of summer in terms of bringing people together, especially when paired with drink specials. But how well do you know it?"
10177,"""I noticed a lot of people love oysters but they don't know a lot about them,"" says Julie Qiu, an oyster expert and founder of the website In A Half Shell. ""But knowing a little bit more helps them appreciate what they're having and what you should look for and what standards to hold."""
10178,Here's what you need to know before your next oyster happy hour.
10179, 
10180,Reputation is key
10181,"""The first thing that people should do is actually go to a reputable oyster bar,"" says Qiu, who is a fan of The John Dory, Cull & Pistol, Maison Premiere and AQUAGRILL. ""Having someone who is knowledgeable about oysters makes a world of difference in how you can enjoy them. You just don't want to go to any old place for dollar oysters."""

10185,"Fresh, fresh, fresh"
10186,"Eating raw seafood has its risks. Going to a reputable place that has a high turnaround can also help make sure you're getting the freshest oysters possible. There are also ways to tell if your oyster is of good quality. ""The meat should look really hydrated, that it feels like there's a lot of liquid, or oyster liquor,"" Qiu says. ""A fresh oyster shouldn't smell fishy."" If it looks like you got a bad oyster, send it back. ""I've been known to send oysters back, simply because the shucking was just done so poorly or it was clearly not a good oyster,"" Qiu says."
10187,"Want the freshest oysters? It's all about the shucking. ""I like going to oyster bars where I see the shuckers opening the oysters in front of me,"" says Qiu. ""I know theyare opened fresh rather than someone opening them in the back and letting them sit there all day."""

10192, 
10193,The 'R' rule
10194,"There's a popular rule that you should only eat oysters during months that end in the letter ""R."" And while the winter is the best time of year for oysters on the East Coast -- the water is colder, making them fatter and sweeter -- there really isn't any seasonality now thanks to shipping, refrigeration and strict harvest regulations, says Qiu. ""The 'R' rule now is currently a myth you don't have to follow,"" she says. ""However, I would not condone recreationally going out and harvesting oysters from really warm water and eating them. That's probably not the best idea."""
10195, 
10196,East Coast vs. West Coast
10197,"Most menus in NYC feature oysters from the East Coast or the West Coast, and they taste very differently thanks to the environment, ""just like grape varietals,"" says Qiu, who likens oysters to wine. ""It's hard to generalize, but the East Coast oysters are going to taste more oystery, if you will, they're going to taste like a mollusk ... [while] West Coast oysters will take on a really distinct vegetal and cucumber note. Almost always, they tend to have a creamier texture, which can be a turn on or turn off for people."""
10198, 
10199,Oyster vocab
10200,"Here are some words to know when talking about the taste of oysters, as defined by Qiu. Use them to impress your friends."
10201,"Briny: ""Briny notes the salinity or ocean quality of the oyster. The higher the brine, the more it will feel like you're taking a dive in the ocean."""
10202,"Sweetness: ""That's when you chew into an oyster -- you will actually taste sweetness in the body."""
10203,"Minerality: ""I'd describe it as licking a rock. It's actually more delicious than what that sounds like."""
10204,"Finish: ""Sometimes oysters can linger on your palate for a long time and others abruptly stop once you swallow. The ones that tend to linger are the West Coast oysters."""
10205, 
10206,The going rate
10207,"In general, East Coast oysters will cost $2.50-$3.50 a piece and West Coast $2.65-$4, says Qiu, with prices impacted by the fact that oyster farming is very labor intensive. There are breaks, though. ""Happy hour definitely exists and makes oysters so much more accessible,"" she says. ""Most happy hours also offer a single variety of oyster, such as Blue Point, which I think is perfect for anyone that just wants to have an oyster fix and not really think about where they're from. They usually tend to be local and relatively fresh."""
10208, 
10209,Accoutrements
10210,"The accoutrements are the various toppings that accompany oysters, and range from lemon and mignonette sauce (shallots, vinegar and black pepper) to ponzu and yuzu. Qiu recommends first trying your oyster ""naked"" before adding any. ""If you really want to truly appreciate the natural essence in an oyster, try the first one without any of the accoutrements,"" she says. After that, she likes adding a minimal amount of mignonette or lemon with East Coast oysters, and ponzu and yuzu for West Coast. But never generic cocktail sauce. ""Save it for the shrimp,"" Qiu says. ""I feel like it was never intended for something as delicate as the oyster."""
10211, 
10212,Faux pas
10213,"There is a wrong way to eat an oyster. ""Don't pour the oyster liquor from the oyster,"" Qiu says. ""I see people dumping the seawater, and that's really an essential part of the experience. The proper thing to do is slurp the entire thing."""
10214, 
10215,Reading material
10216,"For further reading about the oyster, Qiu recommends ""A Geography of Oysters"" by Rowan Jacobsen and ""The Big Oyster"" by Mark Kurlansky. Qiu has also published her own book, ""New York Oyster Map"", which features 30 raw bars in NYC and a history of the oyster in the city."
10217,

""It's a little intimidating for people, but I really encourage them to learn how to shuck oysters,"" she says. ""You can buy them so much cheaper, and opening them yourself at home is such a game changer."""

10227,"New York seems to have a week dedicated to everything: fashion, restaurants, Broadway, honey, and now, oysters."
10228,"New York Oyster Week is September 11-28th, offering much to learn and enjoy. There is much more to oysters than just a perfect shucking technique and a quick, briney slurp: the tasty bivalves help clean water, develop ecosystems and have a massively positive environmental impact."
10229,"The fourth annual Oyster Week kicked off Thursday evening with the first-ever Brooklyn Oyster Riot at the Palm House at Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Eight shellfish farms from as close as Fishers Island, NY and as far as Bay Center, WA, provided freshly-shucked oysters to help oyster lovers taste the difference between East and West Coast varieties. "
10230,"Kevin Joseph, co-founder of Oyster Week, has a vivid enthusiasm for oysters, and was happy to share his knowledge (and oyster spawning -- i.e. oyster porn-- iPhone videos with this lucky reporter)."
10231,"""I started Oyster Week because I love oysters, and I wanted to make a living from my passion. Oysters do great stuff for the environment and oyster farmers are geniunely cool people."""
10232,"Unlike other farmed fish or seafood, oysters are practically impossible to raise in an unsustainable way, so all oyster farmers are helping the environment."
10233,"""Oysters help maintain the ecosystem,"" Joseph explained. ""They create habitats and living conditions for other creatures."""
10234,"Every time you eat an oyster, you're promoting oyster farming, which is, in fact, helping the environment."

10237,Plenty of New York restaurants help support the environment by serving oysters.
10238,"""In a world where everyone is trying to be more green friendly and make more sustainable choices in regards to their food, the oyster shines brighter than any other pearl!"" said chef Michael Citarella of The Monarch Room."
10239,"The restaurant also loves that farmed oysters, unlike other seafood, has the benefit of being very traceable. Each bag is legally required to have a tag that identifies its harvest location, harvest date, and grower and/or distributor."
10240,"""This is comforting to us as a restaurant and kitchen as we are able to know exactly where our products are coming from and ensure they are safe to consume by the platter-full,"" he said."
10241,"Steve Malinowski from Fishers Island Oyster Farm just outside of New York City grows oysters by ""suspending oysters in a water column, resulting in positive environmental impact."" The more oysters they grow, the better the surrounding ecosystem becomes."
10242,"In addition to being delicious with cocktail sauce, raw oysters are full of protein, iron, omega 3 fatty acids, calcium, zinc and vitamin C. It sounds almost futuristic to think of a food that not only nutritionally benefits the human body but also improves the environment."
10243,"But yes, oysters are here, and have been consumed for centuries, by humans and animals alike."
10244,"In fact, the late 1800s marked the end of wild oysters in New York Harbor: 19th Century palates craved so many that they became over fished, and the population was depleted. While the current harbor waters are too polluted to farm edible oysters in, oysters help maintain the brackish waters, and are crucial to improving the conditions of the local estuary."
10245,"The Billion Oyster Project collects shells from consumed oysters to help re-populate New York Harbor with a population of one billion oysters. Help from volunteers and schools, including The Harbor School on Governors Island, has resulted in replenishing 7.5 million oysters to New York Harbor."
10246,"New York Oyster Week celebrates the oyster's ""considerable and extraordinary role in the history, culture, cuisine, economy and ecology of New York."" New Yorkers can celebrate the role of this tasty, nutritious and beneficial food at plenty of upcoming events including Oystoberfest, Kevin Joseph's famous Merroir and Terroir tasting, a Local Oyster Showcase as well as many more informative and tasty events."

10252,"Let's take a look at the age-old question: waffles or pancakes?
The two are basically the same: the ingredients to make each are practically identical, and absolutely identical if you're using Bisquick or some other mix. But that's where the similarities end.

10257,"Just look at those square boxes, perfect for holding syrup and butter. Pancakes don't have those. "
10258,The way gravity makes the edges drape. The way the number of pancakes creates both excitement and dread. The fact that you can put a pat of butter between each one and have no trouble melting it... Ahhhh!
10259,"A waffle is flexible. Just look at this tasty, savory, delicious spread. Cheese on pancakes? Not gonna happen. "
10260,"A griddle is kind of old-fashioned and romantic, isn't it? It brings to mind retro diners, small-town truck stops along a desolate highway or long-lost memories of a southern breakfast at Grandma's house. Waffles just don't carry that same heavy nostalgia. "
10261,"Sure, you can put whipped cream and fruit on a pancake, but ice cream and chocolate go better with waffles. It has something to do with the bread-like nature of a pancake vs the cookie-like nature of the waffle, if you ask us. "
10262,"Seriously, this is some real fun! Have you tried it? (It can be discouraging and not that fun if you can't catch the pancake for the life of you. Don't say we didn't warn you.)"
10263,"Nope, you haven't. While of course we're aware that waffle fries aren't waffles at all, and are cut from potatoes just like regular fries, waffle fries look like waffles and taste awesome. So there. "
10264,There's absolutely no way you can make Beavis out of a waffle. So that's plus 1 for flexibility of shape for team pancakes! 
10265,"Remember what we said about waffles lending themselves to dessert? Here's another example: waffle stix, put on a stick and topped with scoops of ice cream. Enough said. "
10266,"Latkes, or potato pancakes, could never be made in the shape of a waffle. I mean, please go ahead and try, but just don't forget to take pics and tweet / Instagram them @amNewYork! "
10267,"Do you see the flexibility of the waffle?! It's pretty incredible. We've never thought of putting cheese and veggie toppings on waffles before, but it sounds pretty effing tasty. "
10268,"Pancakes stay moister than waffles, which allows for more variation on ingredients. And these vegan apple pancakes do look pretty tasty. "

10297,"If you like calzones, you’re going to love panzerotti."
10298,"
	  A panzerotto is ... what, exactly? We explain.        Photo Credit: Panzerotti Bites     "
10299,"Italian street food isn’t hard to find in this city. You go to street fairs for zeppole, those crispy, fried dough balls sprinkled with powdered sugar; you head to outdoor markets like Madison Square Eats for arancini, stuffed, fried rice balls; you can hit up any number of ice cream shops across the five boroughs for scoops of creamy gelato."
10300,But panzerotti — those are a different story.
10301,"The second restaurant in the city to sell them opened in early January on Smith St. in Carroll Gardens, so we asked Panzerotti Bites co-owner Vittoria Lattanzio, 26, to help explain exactly what you’ll be getting when you place your order."
10302,"(In July, Lattanzio and her husband, Pasquale de Ruvo, left behind their lives and family in Italy to “follow this dream” they had of cooking the dish full-time for New Yorkers, she says, so you know she’s passionate about it.)"
10303,So what exactly is a panzerotto? 
10304,"It’s been called everything from a “Southern Italian turnover” to a “grown-up Hot Pocket,” but we think it’s easiest to picture it as a calzone’s fried, smaller cousin."
10305,How is it made?
10306,"It all starts with pizza dough. Lattanzio and de Ruvo, graduates of a pizza school in Italy, are making theirs from scratch with flour, water, extra-virgin olive oil, salt and yeast."
10307,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
10308,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
10309,"“We are professional pizza makers, and also we have studied the world of the panzerotti-making process,” Lattanzio says, “so we also do special doughs made with cocoa or coffee, so the panzerotti turns brown.”"
10310,"After the dough is rolled out, it’s filled with any mix of sweet or savory ingredients. The most traditional combo is mozzarella, tomato sauce and oregano, but Panzerotti Bites is also offering dessert options like a blend of Nutella and ricotta cheese."
10311,"“After that, you have to close it, making it look like a half-moon shape,” Lattanzio continues. “And then you fry it,” for a crispy but fluffy finish. Lattanzio and de Ruvo are using canola oil for that purpose."
10312,Where in Italy does it come from?
10313,"The calzone may hail from Naples, but the panzerotto is from the Puglia region of Italy, or the “heel of the boot,” from which Lattanzio and de Ruvo both hail. (They grew up in two different small towns, but met in the region’s capital, Bari.)"
10314,"“It’s something that Apulians really feel is their own specialty food,” Lattanzio explains, “because they all do it at home, with their own mom and grandmothers, with their whole family during parties or events.” Panzerotti Bites has fine-tuned her mother’s recipe for the dish, she says."
10315,What’s the origin of the name “panzerotto”?
10316,"In the Italian dialect spoken in central and southern Italy, “Panza” is a variation on the standard word for belly, “pancia.” A panzerotto is swollen like your belly after a particularly gluttonous meal."
10317,How do you properly eat one? 
10318,"Mayor de Blasio, take note: The panzerotto is a street food, so “don’t use any knives or forks, just your hands,” Lattanzio advises. At Panzerotti Bites, it will be served in a white cone ideal for eating on the go. “It can be eaten everywhere, from Central Park to your own house, during a party, while you are here, while you are walking.”"
10319,"You’ll also want to wait at least two minutes before you bite into a fresh one, she adds: “When it comes out of the fryer, it’s very, very hot, so we also suggest you pay attention.”"
10320,My mouth is watering. Where can I buy one now?
10321,"You've got two options, as far as we know of. The Greenwich Village shop Mr. Panzerotto (124 MacDougal St.) sells the fried dough pockets with a wide variety of fillings at prices ranging from $6 to $9. Go the classic savory route with Mr. Prosciutto (ham, tomato sauce and mozzarella) or the vegan way with Miss Spinach (spinach, vegan cream cheese). Grab a bagel-inspired Mr. Salmon (smoked salmon, avocado and cream cheese) in the morning and a Miss Nutella (Nutella and ricotta cheese) for dessert."
10322,"Selections on the menu at Panzerotti Bites (235 Smith St.) include the tartufo panzerotto (mozzarella, porcini mushrooms, black truffle oil), the avocado panzerotto (mozzarella, smoked salmon, avocado, cream cheese and sesame seeds) and the white chocolate and Oreo cookie panzerotto."

10329,"
	  Members help run  the Park Slope Food Coop, keeping costs for quality products as low as possible.       Photo Credit: Beth Kaiserman     "
10330,"Park Slope Food Coop won’t be moving into your neighborhood — at least, not yet."
10331,"One of the world’s largest worker-owned cooperatives, Park Slope Food Coop (PSFC) currently has 17,000 members — and more are constantly applying, Joe Holtz, general manager and general coordinator, said. "
10332,"With interest from more prospective members than it can serve, PSFC is considering a possible second location. But other coops aren’t sure if this would help or hurt the coop community overall."
10333,"PSFC aims to keep its member pool steady, accepting new members only as current ones leave. With 17,000 people, some generally leave the coop each week, Holtz said, allowing room for new members hungry for organic products at affordable prices. New members must attend an orientation before being allowed to shop, and the seats tend to fill up quickly, Holtz said."
10334,"“People still put up with it and want to join,” Holtz said. “If we look at the world in a positive way, say ‘there’s a positive thing, let’s do more of it.’ The world wants coops? Fine. But then that hasn’t solved our problem of having more people who want to join [than] can join.”"
10335,"A ‘Second Location Study Committee’ has been assigned to research and decide whether to make a proposal to proceed toward a second location, Holtz said. The coop released a poll in early March asking what neighborhoods people would want a second PSFC in, including Bay Ridge and Astoria, Queens, and the coop community was invited to a meeting March 15 to discuss the idea. "
10336,"Holtz, 68, has been with the coop since it opened in 1973. It was the first of its kind in the city, and Holtz was its first paid employee. There are now 77 full-time and a few part-time employees, along with regular members who work shifts. In the worker-owned cooperative model, each member is considered a “worker-owner” who helps run the coop, keeping costs for quality products as low as possible. For PSFC, that means working 2.75 hours every four weeks. Each member can also vote on any new initiatives for the business.  "
10337,"PSFC bought its building in 1980, then two others in 1988 and 1999, respectively. "
10338,"Along with Flatbush Food Coop, founded in 1976, PSFC provides advice and assistance to other coops. Once members have been a part of PSFC for 12 months, they can work at other coops to count toward their monthly hours."
10339,"This makes it easier for Celena Mayo, 52, and her husband to be members at both PSFC and Lefferts Community Food Coop, which is around the corner from their home. She loves having selections beyond “one variety of something wrapped in cellophane,” like many chain groceries and even mom-and-pop stores might offer, she said."
10340,"“I really like the idea of being able to have a say in the food that we eat. I like the fact that we both support small farmers and support the neighborhood,” Mayo said."
10341,"Other NYC food coops include Bushwick Food Coop, Lefferts Community Food Coop, Windsor Terrace Food Coop, Bay Ridge Food Coop, Greene Hill Food Coop and the in-progress Central Brooklyn Food Coop. PSFC and Flatbush Food Coop have also assisted the 4th Street Food Coop in Manhattan."
10342,"Greene Hill Food Coop opened its new location at 1083 Fulton St. on Aug. 4 with help expected from PSFC after it was forced to leave its former one at 18 Putnam Ave. by May 1. The coop, founded to serve Fort Greene, Clinton Hill and surrounding neighborhoods, relied on an Indiegogo campaign and member loans to relocate."
10343,"“When we were looking to relocate we needed to be very cooperative in that we’re not depleting members from another operation,” Matthew Talmage, a Greene Hill Food Coop board member, said. "
10344,"The coop’s committees used the time the coop was closed to “hone their processes,” Talmage, 51, said. Greene Hill will receive a forthcoming loan from PSFC, which also gave them a loan in 2014."
10345,"“[PSFC] has been supportive in that sense as well as organizationally, restructuring and making sure the operation is even more solid than it had been. They’re very helpful with advice because they have so many years of experience in it,” he said."
10346,"Meanwhile, on the other side of Prospect Park, the smaller, newer Lefferts Community Food Coop is hoping to keep its doors open, holding a fundraiser that will run until the end of September. Last week, Lefferts Community Food Coop received a gift of $2,500 from the Cooperative Economics Alliance of New York City, but hasn’t reached a deal with PSFC for loan assistance, Elizabeth Oliver, 39, said, calling it a “chicken-and-egg” situation."
10347,"“We want to grow, but can’t get more members unless we can make improvements to the store and expand inventory,” she said. “If we had that little boost from [PSFC], we feel confident we could really kick things up a bit.”"
10348,"Lefferts Community Food Coop started as a buying club in 2009 at board member Karen Oh’s house before becoming a brick-and-mortar store in November 2014. The first two years they didn’t pay rent; the building’s owner is a friend of a coop member. The coop now pays below market rent, but wants to prepare for when the building is eventually sold."
10349,"“It’s a very different landscape than when Park Slope Food Coop came around,” Oliver said. “[We] always come back to the coop principle: coops cooperating with each other, not just within their own coop. We’ve seen a little bit of Park Slope trying to help out.”"
10350,"There’s certainly concern among coops about a potential second PSFC, but first the proposal must be voted on — if the committee decides there still is a proposal, Holtz said. "
10351,"PSFC is an “amazing institution” with the power to help grow more coops in Brooklyn, which are “super necessary” and could benefit many communities, Oliver said."
10352,"“To put the other idea in of opening another coop just seems crazy to me,” she said."
10353,Another PSFC could hinder the efforts of existing food coops.
10354,"“If they were to open up an operation near any one of the existing coops, I don’t think the two would be able to survive in the same place,” Talmage said."
10355,"Another location would likely impact new coops too. Central Brooklyn Food Coop aims to open in or near Bed-Stuy and Crown Heights. If another PSFC opens in Central Brooklyn, that could complicate their efforts to attract members."
10356,"“I want to take that into account — the fact that we’re not going to stop being supportive,” Holtz said."
10357,Talmage also wonders whether the same structure that worked to create PSFC in 1973 would work today.
10358,"“People are wondering if the success of Park Slope Food Coop might have been the perfect matrix of situation: real estate at the time, organization, price, neighborhood dynamics — all of that coming together,” he said. “What started as a ragtag group like other food coops, in every one of those regards, the situation has changed so much from the early ’70s that following the exact same sort of buildup structure might not work again. Can doing the exact same thing again be a success? Who’s to say?” "
10359,"The cost and effort of a new location could affect PSFC’s ability to continue helping other coops. The goal for all of NYC’s food coops remains the same: “quality healthy food to make everybody’s life better,” Talmage said."
10360,"“All other coops are hoping to be involved in [PSFC’s] deliberate process too,” he said. “Ultimately the strength of one coop is going to psychologically and publicly help any other food coop. [It can be] a positive force for all when it’s successful.”"

10371,"From former Del Posto executive chef Mark Ladner’s Pasta Flyer to By Chloe co-founder Samantha Wasser’s The Sosta to Eataly Downtown’s I Ravioli counter, New York has seen a large crop of fast-casual pasta spots pop up over the last year, serving fresh plates of spaghetti and more at affordable prices and faster-than-fine-dining speeds."
10372,Now Sola Pasta Bar in SoHo is taking that trend to the next level: the open-kitchen restaurant launched what it’s calling the city’s first pasta food cart in midtown east Wednesday.
10373,"The cart at 53rd Street and Park Avenue — which will be manned for the first few days by Sola chefs Alex Campedelli and Luigi Speranza — debuted with five pastas on the menu, all priced at either $8.50 or $9.50. A pasta and drink combo is $10.50, and a cannolo at $2 extra rounds out your meal."
10374,"Sola Pasta Bar is preparing sauces and house-made pasta on the premises at its SoHo location, a spokesman said, but cart employees will boil the pasta and finish it off in a pan after each order is placed. It's served in a cardboard receptacle with a plastic lid that resembles a takeout ramen container. "
10375,"The restaurant will ultimately deploy a fleet of three carts to reach a larger cross section of the office lunch crowd, parking at spots near 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue and Zuccotti Park in the Financial District."
10376,"Sola Pasta Bar, the brainchild of Michelin-starred Italian chef Massimo Sola and two partners, opened its doors at 330 W. Broadway in August."
10377,"The eatery’s carts may be the first mobile food vendors in New York to serve an exclusively pasta lunch, but the menu at the authentic Sicilian street food truck Picciotti NYC includes anelli al forno and penne, and the Italian food truck Ponti Rossi, which appears to have retired last fall, offered everything from lasagna Bolognese to orecchiette Pugliesi."

No one's favorite part of the pizza plays host to Hyland's latest great idea: pepperoni-studded crust.

""We can have more fun down here,"" Hyland said. ""A lot of the stuff we do is nostalgic, it's lowbrow.""

10500,"More than 20 pizza makers from across the United States, and a small contingent from Naples, Italy, will sell tastes of their signature pies and slices during the first-ever New York Pizza Festival taking place on Crescent Street in Belmont’s Little Italy district over Columbus Day weekend."
10501,"The outdoor festival, will be free to attend, but if you want to eat (and who doesn't?) you'll need to shell out cash in advance. Tickets -- priced at $20 for three slices, $30 for six slices and $100 for a VIP fast-pass plus 10 slices -- are now on sale at nycpizzafestival.com. Drink vouchers are also available, and are sold separately. "
10502,"The event is modeled on one of the world’s largest celebrations of cheese-y, saucy flatbread, the annual Napoli Pizza Village in Naples."
10503,"“Our idea,” says Fred Mortati, 52, an Italian foods importer whose Financial District-based group Pizza Academy Foundation is organizing the event with the Belmont Business Improvement District, “was to have a similar concept to what’s overseas: a two-day celebration to bring some of the most renowned pizza makers from around the U.S.. . . to have these stands lining the street in New York, where people can come and enjoy and try these expressions of pizza.”"
10504,"A fixture at the Naples event, famed pizzaiolo Gino Sorbillo says he's happy to see the New York Pizza Festival come to life in the Bronx, and to participate: ""The pizza world is strong all over the world, especially in New York, and after Napoli Pizza Village, New York will be another great spectacle and pizza community gathering,"" Sorbillo says in a statement. "
10505,"Pizzerias thus far committed to visiting what Mortati calls “arguably the No. 1 city for pizza, after Naples” include: San Francisco’s Tony’s Pizza Napoletana from 12-time world pizza champion Tony Gemignani; Seattle’s Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria; Atlanta’s The Local Pizzaiolo from Giulio Adriani, the four-time world pizza champion behind Forcella in New York; and Chicago’s Spacca Napoli. New York favorites like Kesté Pizza & Vino, Denino’s and Speedy Romeo are also on the lineup curated by local pizza historian and tour guide Scott Wiener and “Pizza Today” magazine editor-in-chief Peter LaChapelle."

10508,"While there appears to be an initial emphasis on Neapolitan-style pies — the most traditional of which are prepared with cheese, tomatoes and flour imported from Italy and baked quickly in wood-fired ovens for a spotty crust with a wet center — Mortati promises pizza aficionados variety: “Each restaurant has their own beliefs and styles and makes the product they want to make. There are participants who follow a very authentic Neapolitan tradition. Then there are going to be participants that have a New York-style product that use different ingredients and different techniques, so I think you’re going to see a lot of everything.”"
10509,"Pizzerias will be cooking up their pies right on the street, in wood-burning brick and electric deck ovens supplied by two sponsors, Mortati says. "
10510,"Mortati knows full well that the general concept of a New York Pizza Festival comes with baggage: In September, what was supposed to be a “day long celebration of dough, cheese, tasty sauces and delicious toppings” became the “Fyre Festival for pizza” when organizer Ishmael Osekre drew thousands of hungry and subsequently enraged ticket holders to a Bushwick lot with three tables and a few cold slivers of the headlining dish."
10511,"“People will get a lot to eat,” says the co-owner of Orlando Foods and a co-founder of Pizza Academy Foundation, an aspiring nonprofit dedicated to promoting Italian culture, food and artisan pizza. “They will not be disappointed.”"

10557,Eataly will end its use of plastic straws and stirrers this summer as momentum grows for a citywide ban on the single-use items.
10558,"The popular Italian marketplace will ban plastic straws at its five locations across the country by July 31 as part of its “commitment to reduce waste,” according to Nicola Farinetti, the Eataly USA CEO. In total, the company goes through about 18,000 plastic straws each week."
10559,"“Since our founding, we have always worked alongside our producers, defending local food traditions, preserving food biodiversity, and promoting quality artisanal products. Like our producer partners, we know that high-quality ingredients cannot exist without a healthy, clean environment,” Farinetti said in a statement."
10560,"Eataly made its announcement just before a Thursday City Council hearing on legislation that would outlaw single-use plastic straws and stirrers in the city’s eating and drinking establishments. The straws could be swapped out with biodegradable paper or metal alternatives meant to be used multiple times. Under the measure, sponsored by Brooklyn Councilman Rafael Espinal Jr., businesses that violate the policy would face escalating fines, which start at $100."
10561,"Other cities have begun enacting similar bans — including Seattle, Malinu and Miami Beach — and Espinal’s office has said that at least 65 partners have already signed onto the idea, including restaurants Pier A, Gramercy Tavern, and Freehold in Brooklyn. Environmental groups like Wildlife Conservation Society, Lonely Whale and The Sierra Club have all endorsed the bill as well. On Thursday advocates joined Espinal in City Hall Park to rally for the bill’s passage."
10562,"“It’s becoming increasingly clear — that recycling alone — cannot help us,” Espinal said. “We have to reduce the consumer products themselves, because it’s the only way to protect our environment and our sea life. But we can begin reversing this trend today, and it could be as simple as changing how we drink our iced coffee in the morning or our cocktail at night.”"
10563,"Eataly began transitioning its shops away from plastic straws in April, and said they will soon only use paper straws and wooden coffee stirrers. The company also plans to replace its plastic utensils with compostable equivalents."

10576,"The organization is now asking all New Yorkers to join that effort with a new campaign, “Give a Sip,” and pledge to stop using plastic straws."
10577,"“Plastic pollution is one of the primary conservation issues that are out there right now,” said Jon Forrest Dohlin, director of the New York Aquarium, which is part of WCS. “In terms of damaging wildlife, it’s almost unprecedented.”"

10583,The city of Malibu in California enacted a ban on plastic straws that takes effect June 1. Food and drink businesses in Seattle will have to stop offering plastic straws and utensils by July.

10586,"Lea D’Auriol, founder of the nonprofit Oceanic Global Foundation, is helping lead efforts to reduce plastic use in New York."
10587,"“Every piece of plastic that has ever been created still exists in one form or another,” D’Auriol said. “Plastic is an amazing material but we are using it in a disposable way.”"
10588,"Oceanic Global recently partnered with Zirkova Vodka to create the Oceanic Standard, a guide that helps bars and restaurants eliminate plastic straws and single-use plastics and implement other practices to make them more sustainable and environmentally friendly."
10589,"Freehold, a Williamsburg bar, restaurant, coffee shop and shared workspace, was one of the first to get involved. D’Auriol reached out to the owners about their plastic practices about a year ago while co-working at the space."
10590,"“I told them I love their venue but they were using way too many plastic straws,” said D’Auriol, who showed the owners a viral video of a sea turtle getting a plastic straw painfully removed from its nose."
10591,She found a receptive audience.
10592,"“We calculated that we were going through about 1.5 million plastic straws per year at Freehold,” principal owner Brice Jones said."
10593,"Today, the venue is down to zero, using paper straws in place of plastic."
10594,"“It’s become an educational conversation piece between our bartenders, servers and our customers, and has really sparked a beautiful movement within the hospitality community that we hope to see continue to progress and expand,” Jones said."
10595,"So far, 35 New York City restaurants and bars that have pledged to ditch the plastic straws as part of the Oceanic Standard. Oceanic Global is also joining forces with WCS as part of its efforts to eliminate single-use plastics."
10596,"“I think New York City has the opportunity to be a leader on this issue,” D’Auriol said."
10597,"WCS officials said they have secured pledges from 41 partners to stop using plastic straws, including the Alliance for Coney Island, which represents businesses and amusements along the famous boardwalk and in the neighborhood, and the popular Financial District bar Dead Rabbit."
10598,"“We taste every cocktail we put out, so over the course of a night, a week, a year — the amount of straws I was seeing get tossed was immense,” said bartender Melissa Markert, who oversees the Dead Rabbit’s sustainability program."
10599,"Earlier this year, the bar switched to reusable metal straws for tasting cocktails and paper straws by request only for guests."
10600,"“The response has been great,” Markert said. “I constantly have guests commenting positively when they see our new straws.”"
10601,Will New York City follow in Malibu’s and Seattle’s footsteps? WCS officials said they would support legislation calling for a ban of single-use straws in NYC.
10602,"For now, Dohlin said it’s important for people to realize even little changes can make a big difference in reducing the amount of plastic that goes into the environment."

10782,"

10783,"When phrases like “flavor profile,” “terroir” and “variety,” are thrown around, people immediately associate them with wine (and maybe a little pretension). But few know that these attributes can—and should—also be applied to the world’s other sipping obsession: coffee."
10784,"And, as sommeliers can identify where a grape was grown just by a sniff of the glass, or a wine’s degree of acidity with a swish in the mouth, there are experts of the same caliber that can identify those properties from a taste of brewed coffee."
10785,"In fact, there is a test that proves these skills for coffee connoisseurs, called the Q Grader Certification. Started in 2003 by the Coffee Quality Institute, there are roughly 4,000 Q Graders worldwide — and only 10 registered in New York City."
10786,"An exhaustive three-day training program followed by a three-day long exam identifies which experts truly know their stuff, according to Specialty Coffee Association of America standards — from identifying the 36 common aromas in coffee to finding the “defect” in a small sample of roasted coffee."
10787,"Just to get an idea of the complexity and advanced knowledge needed: the exam consists of 22 tests, from sensory skills assessments, which involve identifying the degrees of salt, sour and sweet in coffee samples, to cupping tests, in which takers taste samples to score them on a 100-point scale for properties like acidity, sweetness, etc. The pass rate tends to be very low."
10788,"Five of New York City’s 10 Q Graders sat down to talk about how they got into the business, why they took the exam, and what it meant to pass — for both their careers and their identities."

10791,"For Mayita Mendez, coffee has always run in the family. She is a fifth-generation coffee producer on her mother’s side, and her family owns a farm in El Salvador."
10792,"“My whole motivation has been to support my family, and help them share the coffee with roasters and sell it at fair prices,” said Mendez, whose family produces coffee above an 80 on the industrywide 100-point grading scale. “I wanted to learn how to taste properly so I could go back to the farm and know if it was good or if there was something off. I wanted to help make the coffee better.”"
10793,"She started as a barista at one of Irving Farm’s shops, and after about a year was hired as a sales representative, which allowed her to attend coffee events and learn about Q Grading. Irving Farm supported her in taking the test, and since it took place at the very lab where she worked, she was able to access specialty equipment and practice as much as possible—by attending cuppings, practicing with “Le Nez du Cafe” (the 36 vials with essential coffee aromas), and tasting defect coffee."
10794,"“I was so excited [when I passed], because it gives you, as a woman in a male-dominated industry...a stamp of legitimacy,” she said. “Being able to have that stamp of ‘actually I’m a Q Grader,’ shows that [they] actually need to respect my opinion. That I know what I’m talking about.’”  "
10795,NYC coffee shop picks: Everyman Espresso on 13th Street.; The Plant Shed on the Upper West Side (for atmosphere)
10796,"What she wish people knew about coffee: “Be an awakened consumer...I don’t think people realize how much work it takes to get to a cup of coffee. Coffee producers make the least amount of money in the chain, so understand where your coffee is coming from, if the people are being paid fairly.”"
10797,
10798,"Candice Madison is a bit of a rebel in her love of coffee—as a U.K. native, she grew up drinking tea and said there was “practically no coffee culture” in England for most of her life."
10799,"Her interest in coffee began to expand when she realized she was a “supertaster” — she’s among the 25 percent of the population who have more than the average number of taste buds and taste at a higher acuity. What Madison used to be told was “super fussy,” was now more of a super power for working with coffee."
10800,"“When I realized coffee could taste so different—not only could you make milk beverages and espresso beverages that tasted amazing, but when I found out actual coffee itself wasn’t the same, that blew my mind. And not just that but that the flavor profile was so different country to country, or origin to origin, and specific to variety or terroir or to where it’s grown...They talk about wine that way but no one talks about coffee that way.”"
10801,"After working as a barista for a year and a half, she decided she wanted more control over the coffee-making process and got a job at a roasting company. The company she worked for had very basic equipment—just a barrel over an open flame. “All I had was a timer and my nose, so I had to learn how to roast intuitively. I also cupped every single batch that I roasted, so I started to know what to look for.”"
10802,She had heard of the Q as a “really really really hard test” and being “incredibly demanding.
10803,“People walk in and are so scared...I had so much fun.”
10804,"Once you pass the Q, you hold the license for three years, and after that have to go back to “calibrate” to keep your certification. When Madison went to ""calibrate,"" the two women running the whole Q grading program asked her to be a Q Instructor, which was very humbling for her. She said it’s been a “super rewarding experience” thus far."
10805,"“I love getting to lecture, and the groups I teach are in very diverse positions from around the industry. It can be intimidating so I’m happy a lot more people are doing it now.”"
10806,NYC coffee shop picks: Kinship Coffee in Astoria; Everyman Espresso on West Broadway
10807,"What she wish people knew about coffee: “Try everything...you don’t have to follow any rules. Also, people think coffee’s expensive...if they knew the work that went into producing the quality of coffee people now demand, they would be shocked and horrified by how little they pay for coffee. From the way it’s picked to sorting at the mill, you want to ensure people are being paid a living wage.”"

10809,"Ezra Baker’s first career path was quite different from coffee — he graduated college with a degree in biochemistry. But, after working at a biotech firm for a couple years and not enjoying it, he decided to follow some friends to NYC and made the move from Athens, Georgia. He’s been working in coffee since then, as a barista at high-end cafes all over the city from Gimme! Coffee to Cafe Grumpy to Black Fox Coffee."
10810,"“My brain already worked in a scientific way so I liked that aspect of coffee,” he explained. “I also always liked making things for people—I had always enjoyed cooking, etc.”"
10811,"Baker heard about the Q early on in his career, and described it as “almost Illuminati-seeming” in its exclusivity.  After passing the test this October—on the first try, which only 9 percent of people do—he felt “more in tune with my talent."
10812,“I have the vocabulary to express things now that I didn’t have before [taking the exam]. You’re able to communicate what you tasted much more clearly.”
10813,"It’s awarded him more opportunities and “opened a lot of doors,” and has improved how accurately they cup and score coffee at his job. So, taking the Q is, as he puts it, “crazy but worth it.”"
10814,"NYC coffee shop picks: Black Fox Coffee (“Even though I worked there, this is still my go-to spot.”)"
10815,"What he wish people knew about coffee: “Black coffee is not scary! It’s actually not supposed to be bitter or hurt. It’s supposed to be a nice, sensory experience...I always tell people ‘coffee is a fruit, it’s supposed to be fruity.’”"
10816,
10817,"When Dan Streetman got a job at a coffee shop in his college town of College Station, Texas, to make some extra money, he had never drank coffee before. Ever. Though he admits trying straight espresso for the first time was “jolting,” it only took a few months for him to develop a taste, and become fascinated with how many variables were involved in the world of coffee brewing."
10818,"“It blew my mind how different coffee could taste, depending on the bean, or different extraction method...I really wanted to understand all of the factors that go into making a coffee taste different,” he said. Streetman ended up working for the roaster for that shop next, where he learned all about building relationships with coffee farmers, sourcing from origin and cupping different kinds of coffee."
10819,"In 2011 he became the Green Buyer for Irving Farm, where he has been ever since. He said he’d heard of the Q as “that mythical, super difficult test everyone talked about,” and in 2012 one of the importers he was working with was a Q instructor, so he decided to take the test in hopes of expanding his coffee experience. He had already been traveling to origin countries, cupping a lot of different coffees, and felt confident in his skills evaluating and using the SCAA cupping form. Though he struggled with the sensory skills test and had to go back and retake that section, he said it “felt awesome” when he passed. “It was so rewarding and validating.”"
10820,NYC coffee shop picks: Intelligentsia Coffee in the Highline Hotel; Third Rail Coffee at NYU
10821,"What he wish people knew about coffee: “Drink what you like, and really appreciate it. There is so much work that goes into it.”"
10822,"Like Streetman, Erika Vonie started working as a barista during her college years. When she graduated in 2009 and had difficulty finding a job with her film degree, she moved to Philadelphia and continued working in cafes. She quickly realized what an “infinite wealth” of coffee knowledge was out there, and that there was much more you could do for a career besides just opening a shop."
10823,"When one of her bosses noticed that she was “over-explaining” the process of each drink she made to customers, he suggested barista competitions. She competed in a range of competitions, including the United States Barista Championship, and loved every minute of it."
10824,"Vonie later made her way to New York and began working for Variety Coffee Roasters, where she was encouraged to take the Q Certification test. She passed on the second try (“Everyone was so positive and supportive...they all want you to pass.”) and since then has felt its effects. “It’s a great resume booster in general, but it also holds a lot of clout. It shows people that I’m serious, and I’m in it for the long haul.”"
10825,"Last year, she won the highly competitive New York Coffee Masters competition and is now the director of coffee at Trade Coffee, a coffee e-commerce site, where she prides herself on the quiz she created to help people find their own coffee niche. “There’s a reputation for specialty coffee of being kind of pretentious or ‘gourmet.’ I want to help make it more accessible and break down that pretension. Everyone like something!”"

10855,"A visit to the annual Queens International Night Market, which returned to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park on Saturday with a special preview edition, promises a whirlwind tour of the world’s cuisines in one evening under the stars — and may require a little advance preparation.
Frugal foodies will find tastes of 50 different street foods for no more than $6 each, a varied (and somewhat esoteric selection) that founder and organizer John Wang curates with the city’s diversity in mind.
“My unofficial mission is to eventually have a stand or vendor from every country that’s represented in New York City,” says Wang, 36, a former lawyer who models his months-long event on the night markets his family frequented during childhood summer trips to Taiwan and the local food markets he’s drawn to on trips abroad. “Over the last three years, we’ve had 80 countries that we’ve represented so far, which means I’ve learned about eating food from 40 to 50 countries that I would never have otherwise.”
Eats at this year’s night market, which also hosts 25 art and merchandise vendors and live performances, include Brazilian coxinha, Indonesian kue pancong, Thai sai ua and — we would list more, but we personally got lost at “coxinha.”

10858,"“My unofficial mission is to eventually have a stand or vendor from every country that’s represented in New York City,” says Wang, 36, a former lawyer who models his months-long event on the night markets his family frequented during childhood summer trips to Taiwan and the local food markets he’s drawn to on trips abroad. “Over the last three years, we’ve had 80 countries that we’ve represented so far, which means I’ve learned about eating food from 40 to 50 countries that I would never have otherwise.”"
10859,"Eats at this year’s night market, which also hosts 25 art and merchandise vendors and live performances, include Brazilian coxinha, Indonesian kue pancong, Thai sai ua and — we would list more, but we personally got lost at “coxinha.”"
10860,"Like Wang, we had to do a little research. Behold our starter guide to the tasty snacks on sale, for the uninitiated (ourselves included):"

10889,"Ishimori, who previously owned the East Village's beloved Stogo, which was priced out of the neighborhood in 2012, had been looking for a storefront to share her love of food and community, but New York rental prices remained forboding."

10896,"While Ishimori is passionate about cooking, she missed the customer interaction she enjoyed while running her previous eatery. Ishimori's friend, Celeste Carlesimo, who founded Tasti D-lite and later sold the brand, still owns the 86th St. franchise and suggested that Ishimori consider opening a pop-up in the space."
10897,"At first, Ishimori was unsure about the space: though she ran a successful vegan ice cream business at Stogo, she wasn't sure that a dairy-based shop like Tasti D-Lite would be the best space for her vegan cooking. But because the weather was turning colder and her desire to share her food was growing, Ishimori decided to try running a pop-up, Junie Dish."
10898,"Ishimori uses organic ingredients whenever possible, purchasing in local greenmarkets and in Chinatown, and shopping in larger stores like Sunrise Mart and Whole Foods when necessary."
10899,"Junie Dish's menu is simple: the only dish is vegan ramen, which comes in small ($8) and regular ($12) sizes. The noodles are Canton wheat or gluten-free bean thread and the dish is adorned with a variety of toppings, from shiitake mushrooms to baby bok choy, almost in the style of soft-serve customization. Her broth is made with umami-packed mushrooms and kelp, and packs additional heat when stirred with her house-made garlic chili oil."
10900,"Served in to-go containers, the ramen is surprisingly easy to enjoy on the go, and the cardboard cup makes for ideal broth sipping on a chilly day. Vegetables are served crisp and the noodles are pleasantly soft, and this ""delicious food that just happens to be vegan"" is arguably one of the neighborhood's healthier fast (but not that fast -- no microwaves are used at Junie Dish) food options."

10910,"Typing the phrase “#ramen” into Instagram’s search bar will result in 6.7 million posts, many of the ubiquitous foodie pic variety and some rather bizarre videos of people eating what can only be described as python-like noodles. As more and more ramen shops spring up around New York City, it appears that everyone, from the blogger with a following in the millions to your 85-year-old grandmother, knows and loves ramen."
10911,"Behind this ostensibly overnight food trend, though, are hundreds of years of rich cultural history and an increasing wave of globalization."
10912,"In order to fully grasp the reputation of ramen as a Japanese essential, we must first turn slightly westward, to China."
10913,"“There’s a history of noodles in China going back thousands of years,” explains Barak Kushner, who teaches Japanese history at the University of Cambridge and authored the 2012 book “Slurp! A Social and Culinary History of Ramen, Japan’s Favorite Noodle Soup.” He notes that noodle technology was initially pioneered by Buddhist monks and spread over centuries to Japan. “By the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a love of soba noodles in Edo (Tokyo’s forerunner),” says Kushner. Bowls of noodles became a popular serving option, and over time, these came to include soup."
10914,"As industrialization took off in Japan during the 19th century, many Chinese people moved to the country, and they brought with them new noodles, made with wheat for a springy, al dente bite. Right around 1910, Japanese workers, who were the primary consumers of the inexpensive and easy noodle bowls, began to crave a meatier, more caloric meal, and what we now call ramen was born."
10915,"In the wake of World War II, the United States supplied Japan with large quantities of wheat to help with food shortages. This led to the government-encouraged production of wheat noodles and therefore ramen. The dense, traditionally working-class dish took off in the post-war landscape and quickly spread outside the major cities."
10916,"Finally, in 1958, instant ramen, a product that any current or former college student knows all too well, was introduced and rapidly became a sensation, proving an ideal on-the-go, cheap meal for a nation that was still rebuilding."
10917,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."

10919,"Ah, the 80s: a decade of shoulder pads, hair metal and a whole new wave of culturally influential movies. As the world watched Molly Ringwald pull out a bento box of sushi in “The Breakfast Club” in ‘85 and witnessed Charlie Sheen hand-make nigiri in 1987’s “Wall Street,” an ongoing fascination with all things Japanese officially began. Suddenly, the small island nation was a major world player, especially in the food scene."
10920,"“Japan was economically hurting in the ’80s,” says Kushner, “but its gross national cool began to spread internationally.”"
10921,"At the same time, there was a boom in “B-Class gourmet” domestically, and a more culinary approach was taken to ramen, with shops popping up all over and different regions branding varying ingredients."
10922,"Of course, instant ramen had already grown popular around the world, and especially in the United States, but it was still at that point written off, what with its 60 cent price tag and “just add water” recipe, as a fast food embraced only by those who couldn’t afford anything else."
10923,"As Japan’s cultural influence grew, though, it “gained a food culture beyond sushi,” as Kushner notes, and the gourmet treatment of ramen happening in Asia slowly made its way to the States."
10924,"The past few years have seen a spike in the number of ramen restaurants around the city, and the trend doesn’t show any sign of slowing."
10925,"With different forms of noodle soup, from pho to matzo ball, and a pasta culture already popular worldwide, ramen has been well-received in the west. “It’s cheap, accessible, and doesn’t require changing your taste or palate at all,” says Kushner.  “Ramen is like the sandwich of Asia,” universal but easily adaptable to local flavors and ingredients."
10926,"“When I first started out, ramen really had no respect,” says Ivan Orkin, the owner and chef behind Ivan Ramen. “People were surprised that a fine-dining chef would ‘lower himself’ to ramen.” Orkin, a native New Yorker, long identified with Japanese culture and opened his first two ramen restaurants in Tokyo before writing a cookbook and opening up two New York locations. He attributes much of the noodle dish’s success in America to the rise of comfort food in the culinary world and sees ramen as “leading the pack.”"
10927,"“I think in New York, it’s taken off almost more than anywhere else,” says Orkin. “Besides anything else, ramen is just really fun, and once you have it, you’re kind of hooked.”"
10928,"In the same way that an interest in Japanese culture once paved the way for ramen’s popularity, the dish’s success is now leading to increased interest in Japan. “Ramen is an extension of Japanese culture,” says Orkin, “and its popularity has caused many people who would never even think of Japan to want to go visit.”"
10929,"Ichiran, another favorite in the ramen scene, opened its first U.S. location in 2016 in Bushwick following the success of its 65 Japanese shops. In addition to bringing its signature and flavorful ramen to the city, the restaurant chain made a point of staying true to its Japanese roots in its culture and aesthetic."
10930,"“The thing people look at here is the design,” says Ichiran publicist Kayla Copeland, noting the venue’s solo booths, no tip policy, and minimal server interaction (guests see only a waiter’s hands). “It’s weird and different but the kind of weird and different that you want.”"
10931,"Ichiran, which opened a second New York location in midtown last year, and recently announced a Times Square outpost, slated to open in winter of 2019, hopes that its New York presence will help get the rest of America on the ramen train."
10932,"“I think people have been afraid to try it in other parts of America,” says Copeland, “but New York is the perfect place to start.” The chain plans to expand across the country in the coming years."
10933,"And even with so many ramen destinations in New York, none seems too worried about competition. “The beauty of ramen is that you can love Ivan and you can love Ichiran or Ippudo,” says Orkin, alluding to the different styles and flavors that each shop produces. “I never think there’s too much competition.”"

10943,"This includes heartier fare like butternut squash, a heart-friendly fruit with its doses of dietary fiber and, thanks to its orange color, carotenoids, which help protect against heart disease. It's also a source of potassium and vitamins B6 and C and has anti-inflammatory properties."
10944,"The squash is versatile when it comes to cooking, too, popular in a variety of pastas, soups or salads. At Chalk Point Kitchen, it stands out in a small plate recently added to the menu: roasted butternut squash with old-fashioned ricotta, fresh basil, toasted pepita seeds and aged balsamic."

10952,"The chef likes a good, aged balsamic vinegar for the dish, though a store-bought balsamic glaze will also do. For the seeds, he also like pepitas, or Mexican pumpkin seeds, which can be found in most gourmet markets."
10953,"""It gives a good crunch and texture to the mix,"" says Isidori. If you can't get your hands on pepitas, though, you can substitute with pine nuts, walnuts or almonds."

Cut the squash in half to remove seeds and then cut into approximately 1”-1½” cubes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a bowl, dress cubed squash with olive oil, salt and pepper. Place on a sheet tray and roast in oven until tender (approximately 45 minutes). For the ricotta: In a bowl, season ricotta with salt and pepper to taste. For the pepitas: Season pepitas with salt and pepper. Place on a sheet tray in a single layer and roast in the oven at 350 degrees for 20 minutes or until golden brown (stir seeds after 10 minutes). For the balsamic reduction: In a small sauce pot, reduce balsamic vinegar until it has reached a thick consistency. Cool. Assembly: Place roasted squash on a plate. Spoon a few dollops of ricotta onto the squash and drizzle over with balsamic reduction. Garnish with roasted pepitas and basil leaves."

10967,"At Seamore's, a new seafood spot in Nolita that specializes in healthful, fresh cooking, the restaurant takes care of its vegetarian customers by offering seasonal vegetables, a variety of salads, a veggie burger and a vegetable taco. For the latter, this season, the market-driven menu features a charred broccoli taco with tofu crema, chili glaze and pickled daikon."
10968,"""People are used to eating seafood or meat in a taco, so it could feel a little like it's lacking if there's not that in there,"" chef Gregg Drusinsky says. ""But one thing that I always look at when doing a veggie taco is to make something that is just as delicious if not more delicious than something that would have fish or meat in it."""
10969,"Drusinsky likes broccoli because of its abundance, low price point and crispiness when roasted, though you could easily substitute with cauliflower or any root vegetable, he says."
10970,"Home cooks can opt to blanch the broccoli quickly in boiling water first before roasting. The roasted broccoli is then tossed with a chili glaze comprised of gochujang, mirin and Datu Puti, ingredients that can be found at stores such as Southeast Asia Market or online at sites like Amazon."
10971,"""We're so close to Chinatown over here,"" Drusinsky says. ""A lot of the time we'll get inspired by something we see, and generally it's approachable enough to put elements of that on the menu."""
10972,"The roasted broccoli is then served on a tortilla that's been lined with a tofu crema base, because ""one thing that nobody likes when they eat a taco is to eat a dry piece of tortilla,"" Drusinsky says. ""There's something at the bottom of the tortilla to help with the mouth feel and make it a little more rich."""
10973,"It's crucial to use fresh tortilla, says Drusinsky, who gets his daily from Tortilleria Nixtamal in Corona, Queens. It should also be charred before assembling the taco."

10978,The end result is a vegetable taco that even die-hard meat lovers will enjoy.

""A roasted chicken is good when someone takes the time and seasons it properly and roasts it and bastes it and puts a lot of love into it. If you gave vegetables the same amount of care and attention, people would be surprised with the result."""

11048,"Once roasted, you can let the pot and blender do the rest of the work. In addition to the nutrient-dense, antioxidant-rich pumpkin, the recipe features coconut milk, carrot juice and ginger, which simmers on the stove for 20 minutes before being blended into a puree."
11049,"Walker uses coconut milk, instead of a soup standard like chicken stock, so that the soup is vegan."

The celebrated chef said that skyrocketing real estate taxes and the rising minimum wage made it impossible to cover all costs, after 17 years in business. The civilized dining room at Annisa had showcased Lo’s unique style of multicultural American cooking: “It’s still not easy to say what Ms. Lo’s style is, but it is hers, and hers alone, and the city is a more exciting place for it,” New York Times critic Pete Wells wrote in his 2014 three-star review."

11195,"Isabella’s: You could say the appeal of this Upper West Side dining staple, which closed abruptly in May after almost 30 years on the corner of 77th Street and Columbus Avenue, was its attractive location. Isabella’s Mediterranean-inspired fare never won any accolades, but its broad menu and sidewalk patio did make it the perfect brunch spot on a weekend outing to the Museum of Natural History (and a good shooting location for one “Curb Your Enthusiasm” episode). The building’s landlord and the conglomerate that owned the restaurant blamed each other for the restaurant’s untimely end."
11196,"Public: This Michelin-starred restaurant with several James Beard awards to its name closed up shop in June. Shockingly, it wasn’t NoLIta rent prices that sunk Public; it was an anticipated two years of building renovations that would make the eatery unsustainable. When it opened in 2003, its Australian fare and industrial-vintage design made its “something of a game changer,” according to the Times. Its legacy lives on in those chefs who perfected their skills in its kitchen, including Ann Redding of Uncle Boons and Matt Hyland of Pizza Loves Emily."
11197,"Bouley: After 30 years in three locations, this French fine-dining establishment by long-influential chef David Bouley served its last meal in TriBeCa in July. Its star power had dimmed in recent years, but back in the ’90s, it won a four-star review from the Times and one of Zagat’s slots for the top three dining rooms in the city. You could say Bouley made its most profound mark on the city’s dining culture as an incubator for culinary talent: Dan Barber of Blue Hill at Stone Farms, Eric Ripert of Le Bernadin and Christina Tosi of Milk Bar all worked as chefs in the restaurant’s kitchen before launching their own projects."
11198,"Cup & Saucer: After nearly 30 years under the ownership of two Greek immigrants, John Vasilopoulos and Nick Tragaras, this old-school diner on the eastern edge of Chinatown fried its last eggs and bacon in July. Regulars loved the greasy spoon’s unchanged décor (including a cup and saucer design on the floor and mustard yellow spinning stools), plentiful comfort food and welcoming staff. The restaurant’s death knell, according to the owners, was a steep rent hike."
11199,"Franny’s: Owners Francine Stephens and Andrew Feinberg announced their pizzeria’s imminent closure on its website in July, offering no explanation other than “it’s time to say goodbye.” The couple opened the restaurant — a favorite among neighbors and a destination for Manhattanites — in its first Flatbush Avenue location in Prospect Heights in 2004. Franny’s was heralded as a trailblazer on the Brooklyn dining scene for ushering in an era of high-end ingredients, attentive service, casual settings and relatively affordable prices."
11200,"Schiller’s Liquor Bar: Restaurateur Keith McNally opened Schiller’s at 131 Rivington St. in 2003. Its casual vibe and checkered black-and-white floors soon made it a Lower East Side mainstay, drawing locals and visitors alike. Novelist Richard Price (or his publisher) cemented its iconic status by selecting a photo of Schiller’s exterior for the cover of his 2008 book “Lush Life.” The McNally family decided to shutter the restaurant’s doors after their lease ended in August, citing a rent hike as the reason they wouldn’t renew."
11201,"Queens Kickshaw: Owners Ben Sandler and Jennifer Lim closed this Astoria neighborhood favorite in August to make way for a new restaurant, but locals still mourned the loss of its fancy grilled cheese sandwiches, vegetarian-friendly cuisine and craft cider selection. Queens Kickshaw originally launched as a sandwich and coffee joint, but, over the course of six years, it transformed into a community center of sorts, hosting live music, farmers markets, cider promotions and other special events."
11202,"Riviera Cafe: A piece of old Greenwich Village died with this 48-year-old sports bar when it served its last pint in August. In a video posted to Instagram not only after, actress and neighbor Sarah Jessica Parker described its closure as a “freaking bummer.” “I’m not even a big football fan, but I loved hearing the cheering, hooting and good times as I walked by,” she said of the noted refuge for New England Patriot fans. Asked why the cafe was ending its run, longtime general manager Steve Certell told Gothamist, “We’ve outlasted tens of thousands of restaurants in New York, we’ve had a successful run and now we’re closing.”"
11203,"HiFi Bar: Under the name Brownie’s, this classic East Village bar hosted such prominent rock artists as Spoon, My Morning Jacket and the National on its stage. A relic of the gentrified neighborhood’s bohemian phase, HiFi later became home to a digital jukebox some called the best in town. In a Facebook post, owner Mike Stuto attributed his decision to close the joint in October to the “indifference” of millennials and his unwillingness to transform the place into something they’d appreciate (but he wouldn’t)."
11204,"Rue La Rue Café: This “Golden Girls”-themed restaurant may have been extremely short-lived, but it enjoyed an enthusiastic following when it opened in Washington Heights in February. Owner Michael J. La Rue had decorated the place with memorabilia from the cult-favorite show, many of the items gifts from the late actress and his close friend Rue McLanahan (aka the lusty Blanche Devereaux). La Rue notified guests in November that the cafe had closed “to process the lessons learned during the rehearsal period this last year,” and it remains unclear whether it will reopen."
11205,"Saltie: For the past eight years, fan have voyaged to this small, nautically themed Williamsburg shop for cherished sandwiches like the salty Scuttlebutt, loaded with hard-boiled egg, feta, black olives, capers, pickles and pimentos aioli. Owner Caroline Fidanza, previously the chef at Andrew Tarlow’s Diner, announced Saltie’s closure at the end of December earlier this month on Instagram. Her post included an invitation to “come by and cry into your sandwich” and the hashtag #itsnottherentitsme."
11206,"NoHo Star: The 32-year-old neighborhood fixture, serving up part New-American, part Chinese fare, bids the older downtown crowd adieu on Dec. 31. Paperwork filed with the state’s Department of Labor cited “economic” reasons for closing. Founder George Schwarz — the German-Jewish émigré behind not only the NoHo and its sister cocktail bar, but Elephant & Castle and One Fifth — died in December 2016."
11207,"Le Cirque: The circus-themed French dining establishment has lived at three different locations during its 43-year history of catering to the whims of the powerful and the famous. The Maccioni family says it will close the storied restaurant in the Bloomberg Tower on East 58th Street after dinner on New Year’s Eve and search for a fourth, smaller space. High rent is reportedly the cause, but Le Cirque has also struggled with bankruptcy filings, class-action and sexual-harassment lawsuits and sinking reviews in recent years. Back in its heyday, the restaurant was “the epitome of a clubby Manhattan fine-dining scene whose snobbishness, far from undermining the enterprise, was the mighty engine of its success,” food writer Helen Rosner noted."

11213," As predicted, the bread bun is facing its imminent extinction.   ""Is that a ramen burger?"" a woman in a likely- vintage jumper asked her friend as they pushed through the crowd gathering on East 9th Street today at noon.   The two debated what a group of Japanese business men, the growing line of East Villagers and curious bystanders were all waiting to enjoy. The answer, simply, was a rice burger. 
 Yonekichi, which means ""lucky rice"" in Japanese, is the latest trendy food spot to open in the East Village. Located on Ninth Street between Second and Third Avenues, an area dubbed ""Little Tokyo"" for its growing cluster of Japanese restaurants, Yonekichi serves a creative, New York-ified version of a favorite Japanese snack food. 
But if you're looking for Shack Shake style patties, you're in the wrong line. Yonekichi serves their crisp rice buns with a variety of made-to-order fillings: ginger mujifugi features sweet bites of pork shoulder ($8) and the saikyo salmon includes a fresh fillet marinated in miso ($9). For a more traditional burger, the tsukune, a chicken meatball patty topped with shishito peppers ($7.75), most resembles your average quarter pounder. Vegetarian options, like the Kinpira made of sautéed lotus root, carrot, sesame seeds and togarashi ($6.50), are also available. 
 Yonekichi's menu also includes Furi Furi, Japanese for ""shake shake,"" which are crispy, thick-cut potatoes topped with your choice of salt, pepper, yuzu or wasabi, and served steaming hot, ready to be shaken in their thick paper bag for optimal seasoning coverage. The pickle dog, a spicy Japanese cucumber on a chopstick, limited to fifty per day, is a refreshing cold treat, ideal to munch on during the wait for your main order. 
 Yonekichi's soft opening will run all week, from 12 p.m. - 10 p.m. The burgers aren't fast food though: as of now, it takes the kitchen staff of four about twenty minutes to create their masterpiece in the tiny Yonekichi kitchen.   But the wait is well worth it.

11360,"New Yorkers are slurping ramen like never before, so it should perhaps come as no surprise that along with a surge in cravings for Japanese food comes a desire for Japanese beverages."
11361,"While New Yorkers are well-versed in beer and wine, knowing their lagers from their ales and carbernet francs from cabernet sauvignons, it seems that sake remains a bit of a mystery. Perhaps picking the most decorative bottle, or the sake with the best value is easiest at a sushi restaurant, but New Yorkers deserve to be more informed when making sake choices."
11362,"With restaurants boasting sake lists longer than wine lists, and World Sake Day coming up on October 1st, now is the time for New Yorkers to become Sake experts."
11363,"Chris Johnson, also known as Sake Ninja and the sommelier at Williamsburg's Cherry Izakaya, explains the basics of sake. "
11364,"""Sake is broken down into three groups, differentiated by polishing ratio, i.e. how much of the rice is milled or polished,"" Johnson explains."
11365,"The entry level sake is considered Junmai, pure rice sake, and Honjozo (sake with a little brewers alcohol added). These are both generally polished to somewhere between 60 and 70 percent rice remaining (Junmai has no minimum requirement). Junmai tend to have more rustic earthy flavor profiles with more mineral and rice notes."
11366,"The next category is Ginjo (including Junmai Ginjo), which is milled to between 50 and 60 percent. These sakes tend to have more floral and fruit notes: the more you polish the easier it is for the yeast to show its flavor characteristics and the more delicate notes from the rice. Think melon, banana, green apple, pear, tropical fruits, white flowers and sunflowers. "
11367,"Daiginjo (including Junmai Daiginjo) is the ultra premium and is polished below 50 percent and sometimes down to as low as 18 percent. These sakes have removed all the impediements to fermentation, and have layers of delicate flavors and more depth in the fruit and floral notes."
11368,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
11369,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
11370,"Johnson recommends that novices start with Ginjo sakes, as the balance of fruit and floral components is easier to recognize."
11371,"Each sake has its own best temperature, but Johnson says your best bet is to ""place sake in the fridge for about two hours, call some friends over, grab some wine glasses or sake cups, open the sake and toast with 'Kanpai!'"""
11372,There are no major sake producers currently in New York (perhaps home sake brewing will be the next DIY fad) but plenty of talented importers make sure to bring in the good stuff from Japan's 2000 sake breweries to New York.
11373,"To taste over 370 sakes (or perhaps a limited selection of the extensive offerings), along with Japanese dishes from highly-acclaimed New York restaurants, check out New York's annual Joy of Sake event on Thursday, September 18 at 6 p.m."
11374,"And if you want to get more into local sake, head to TAO Downtown to taste their new sake brand, ENTER, available in two varieties: black dot (junmai) and gold dot (junmai daiginjo)."

11380,Is this the salad bar of the future?
11381,"
	  Harvest2Order is a new salad bar concept at North 3rd Street Market in Williamsburg, serving hydroponically grown microgreens.       Photo Credit: Harvest2Order     "
11382,"Blame the recent E. coli outbreak linked to contaminated romaine lettuce from the Yuma region in Arizona (which sickened 172 people in 32 states, including five in New York) for the inordinate time you’ve spent thinking about your salad greens lately."
11383,"Once upon a time, it was all toppings, toppings, toppings. You would barely even notice your server at Sweetgreen or Chop’t digging a gloved hand into a metal bin of romaine or kale or mixed green leaves, so invested you’d be in debating the relative merits of roasted butternut squash and pita chips."
11384,But what if that server harvested your greens just after you ordered them? And what if you didn’t even have to ask to have them chopped?
11385,"That’s part of the concept at Harvest2Order, a salad bar serving bowls of hydroponically grown microgreens at the new North 3rd Street Market in Williamsburg."
11386,So….what exactly is a microgreen?
11387,"“It’s the stage between sprouts and baby greens,” explains Harvest2Order co-founder Liz Vaknin, 29. No more than 14 days old, the veggie seedlings “retain all of the nutrients [of seeds] and don’t really need additional nutrients to grow.”"
11388,"Vaknin and other proponents say the tiny greens can pack a large amount of nutrients like vitamins C and E, and antioxidants like beta carotene, a claim bolstered by a 2012 study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry. And they require only a small percentage of the water their mature counterparts do, adds the former cold kitchen chef at Bouley and Le Cirque."
11389,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
11390,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
11391,"In the U.S., microgreens are most commonly served at fine dining establishments, where chefs use the leaves as fancy, colorful garnishes."
11392,"Vaknin and her business partner and longtime friend, Shelley Golan, argue Americans should be eating them all the time."
11393,"“Shelley and I come from backgrounds where salad is a big part of a culture” — both were born into Israeli-Moroccan families in the States and met while attending college in Israel — “and we just weren’t happy with what we were eating in New York,” says Vaknin of the duo who founded a sustainable food-focused PR and marketing firm in the city five years ago. “The greens are so flavorless… Everybody focuses on toppings, and then you have this huge bowl that’s mostly greens. It’s kind of an afterthought. We don’t know why.”"
11394,"Cost is one factor: Microgreens are more expensive than romaine. And they have less fiber, which makes them less filling."
11395,"Although Vaknin and Golan hope to eventually grow their own supply of microgreens in-house, Harvest2Order is currently sourcing them from a farm in Riverhead, Long Island; a middleman has been tasked with delivering new trays of three-to-five-inch seedlings every morning."
11396,"When customers order at the counter, they choose one of two mixes, both of which contain sunflower, carrot and pea microgreens and which are served as either a salad or toast base."
11397,"The next step? “Somebody will go to the ‘farm’ and harvest your microgreens for you, and that means they will hold the tip of the microgreens up and then cut at bottom with the scissors straight across,” Vaknin says. (“Farm” is code for LED-illuminated shelves.)"
11398,"Those who opt for a salad will have their pick of “basic” toppings, like pickled shallots, steamed rye berries and roasted pepitas, “premiums” (crumbled goat cheese, roasted red beets, etc.), proteins (roasted chicken, baked tofu), and dressings (blue poppy yogurt ranch, chickpea miso tahini)."
11399,"A basic salad bowl of microgreens and dressing is priced at $9, one with two basic toppings and premiums is $12, and one with an additional protein is $14. They come unmixed: “If you want to shake your salad up after you get it, that’s cool, but for us, it’s all about tasting the microgreens and understanding that you don’t necessarily have to eat them with dressing,” Vaknin says."
11400,"As for toast toppings, those include chicken salad, hummus or avocado. Prices for the sandwiches range between $10 and $12."
11401,Seating near the Harvest2Order counter is available at a communal wooden table that Vaknin describes as “industrial chic.”

11443,"“Our dream is to create a nation-wide supply chain that treats farmers right, treats the land right, treats animals right, and gives the consumer the best dang sausages they’ve ever tasted,” write Meat Hook owners Ben Turley and Brent Young, who founded their store in 2009 and kicked off the fundraising drive Friday."
11444,"The Meat Hook Sausage Co., which will expand the butchers’ physical footprint beyond their 1,000-square-foot store at 397 Graham Ave. to an off-site facility, will begin producing and shipping three varieties of sausage in May, Young said when reached by telephone Saturday."
11445,"Butchers, he said, will make the Tuscan-style, toasted fennel and garlic links, traditional German bratwursts and hot dogs with pork from pigs raised without antibiotics, growth hormones or confinement on Gibson Family Farms in Valley Falls, New York. A video on the Kickstarter page features an interview with the farm’s owner and footage of the pigs roaming freely outdoors."
11446,"Sausages, a signature item and a relatively easy one to scale up, are only the start of the Meat Hook expansion, Young added: “Hopefully, in a couple of years we’ll be able to sell bacon and other charcuterie and a whole bunch of other delicious meats from local farms, which right now is not the easiest thing to find.”"
11447,"Young and his business partner and longtime friend, Turley, hope to collect a total of $50,000 for their new venture through their monthlong fundraising effort. As of Saturday afternoon, 28 backers had already pledged more than $7,000."
11448,"Money raised will go toward building the Meat Hook Sausage Co.’s infrastructure, paying its processor and helping farmers raise more animals, the Kickstarter page says. “We’re going to start with buying a truck,” it explains, and “by personally making deliveries in the Tri-State area to retailers and restaurants.”"

11571,Local hot spots Harlem Shake and Harlem Burger Co. are clutching their spatulas and gearing up for a battle of the burgers: Shake Shack’s launch in the quickly gentrifying neighborhood is close.
11572,"A modest hot dog stand back in the early aughts, Shake Shack is now anything but, with an ever-increasing global footprint. This fall, it’s bringing its grills to Harlem’s 125th Street, a bustling boulevard of a neighborhood that’s rife with gentrification and demographic changes. Even with the chain’s plans to incorporate local businesses and tastes to its menu at the branch, the move leaves some Harlemites — residents and businesses alike — with a bad taste in their mouths."
11573,"Alper Uyanik, owner of Harlem Burger Co., is already anticipating hits to his business."
11574,"“Big corporations are going to be big corporations, and they’re going to expand as much as possible,” Uyanik said. “Who gets hurt at the end of the day are small businesses.” "
11575,"Shake Shack certainly is expanding. In the first quarter of 2018, the company opened nine new locations and hopes to grow even bigger, aiming for 32 to 35 more openings by year’s end. It currently claims 159 total stores."
11576,"Next stop, Harlem, a neighborhood known for its rich African-American history, vibrant music culture and now, gentrification. Harlem has gone through rapid changes recently, particularly in its demographics and real estate."
11577,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
11578,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
11579,"Formerly quite a homogeneous neighborhood of black Americans and some Hispanics, Harlem is now more diverse than ever, with noticeably more white Americans and Asian-Americans. Blacks, as of a 2016 American Community Survey from the U.S. Census Bureau, comprise 53 percent of residents of Central Harlem, where the new Shake Shack is opening; that’s a 10 percent drop from 2010, and more than a 24 point decline from 2000. (Central Harlem is bordered by, clockwise from the north, the Harlem River, Fifth Avenue, Central Park and Fordham Cliffs.)"
11580,"Census data shows increases, 2000 to 2016, for Hispanics (16.8 percent to 27 percent), whites (2 percent to 13 percent) and Asians (.9 percent to 5 percent), with margins of error of a minimum of 10 percent of the totals for each of the 2016 values."
11581,"The population of the neighborhood has grown overall, with 143,487 total Central Harlem residents in 2016 compared to 107,109 in 2000."
11582,"Businesses — luxury apartment buildings, the Whole Foods that opened last year — have reflected these changes, restaurants included. That scene has altered from largely soul food or African restaurants to a larger mix of cuisines, including French, Mexican and Thai, and even a Michelin-starred Japanese restaurant, Sushi Inoue."
11583,"And soon (no date has been announced) there will be that Shake Shack, another sign that the neighborhood is continuing to boom. "
11584,"As is customary with its openings, the company is partnering with a local bakery, Lady Lexis Sweets, for an item that will be available only at the Harlem branch: a Pie Oh My frozen custard with bits of Lady Lexis pies mixed in. Shake Shack will contribute 5 percent of proceeds from the custard’s sales to Harlem Grown, a nonprofit organization promoting healthy lifestyles."
11585,"“We’re excited to join the community and look forward to deepening our roots in Harlem,” said Kristyn Clark, Shake Shack’s senior manager for brand communications. Clark declined to comment further on the opening."
11586,"Some locals are also excited about the new option, and particularly about the partnership with Lady Lexis. Lili Wang, a Touro College medical school student living in Harlem, was glad to hear about Shake Shack’s plans."
11587,"“It’s always good to give back to the community, and it will make the store stand out amongst others when they partner up with a local bakery,” Wang said. “I’d go to Shake Shack more often knowing that.”"
11588,"Still, the newcomer may not be welcomed by everybody — particularly, the burger behemoth’s competitors."
11589,"A highly regarded local hot spot, Harlem Shake could take a harder hit given its proximity to Shake Shack. Located nearby, on West 124th Street, Harlem Shake has been around since 2013 and, like its soon-to-be neighbor, serves burgers, fries and milkshakes."
11590,"“When something new arrives everybody wants to try (it), so we may see a dip in sales. However, because of our niche and longtime customers, I feel confident we will be fine,” Harlem Shake founder Jelena Pasic said in an emailed statement."
11591,Loyal customers are also confident Harlem Shake will continue to flourish even after Shake Shack moves in.
11592,"For Osiris Stephen, who has lived in Harlem for 11 years, the difference is in the taste."
11593,"“I’ve had both, and I can tell you right now, I don’t remember how good Shake Shack was. This, I will remember,” he said, pointing to his Harlem Shake Hot Mess burger. “I’m about to go get another one.”"
11594,"The Hot Mess, dressed with cherry peppers, bacon relish and American cheese, is a popular item at Harlem Shake, where burgers start at $7. Frequently accompanying the patties are the restaurant’s varieties of fries, such as sweet potato, truffle and chili cheese, starting just over $3."
11595,"It also offers signature milkshakes, including an eponymous option that’s a rich red velvet milkshake with cake pieces (which may at first struggle traveling up the straw but eventually trudge through) for added texture. With milkshakes priced $5 and up, a full meal (of burger, fries and a shake) at Harlem Shake ranges from about $15 to $24 per person."
11596,"Harlem Shake’s competition with Shake Shack may be even fiercer given the similarities in their products. Compare the Hot Mess to Shake Shack favorite the SmokeShack, a cheeseburger with bacon, cherry peppers and its special ShackSauce. And Shake Shack’s milkshakes can often include cake or pie pieces."
11597,"What’s different is the cost. Shake Shack offers its products at a relatively lower price point: Its burgers start at $5, shakes and frozen custards from $4. Crinkle fries, at $3, are about the same. So a full Shake Shack meal’s range is $12 to $21.49. "
11598,"Several blocks away on Frederick Douglass Boulevard, Harlem Burger Co. has been serving burgers and shakes that are slightly pricier since 2016. It charges $8.50 for a classic hamburger, while fries are from $4.25 (served with truffle mayo). Shakes are a flat $6, with an additional charge to make it a malted. A complete meal here would range from $18.75 to $24.75."
11599,"Both of the Harlem burger spots also offer unexpected menu items, such as mac and cheese (with bacon and blue cheese) and a miso-marinated cod sandwich at Harlem Burger Co.; and Sonoran dogs (deep-fried, bacon-wrapped hot dogs) and mimosas (and beer and wine) at Harlem Shake."
11600,"Still, the higher prices at Harlem Shake and Harlem Burger Co. could make keeping up with the chain more difficult. Harlem Burger Co.’s owner Uyanik attested to the hardships in competing with the big guys, citing the daily struggles his “tiny, tiny establishment” endures."
11601,"“There’s nothing in the retail world that makes it conducive for small businesses to thrive,” he said. “Each day, month goes by, the challenges are mounting.”"
11602,"But because his store is a bit of a walk from Shake Shack, Uyanik is less worried about the incoming competitor."
11603,"“We’re somewhat away from that particular location,” he said. “I don’t foresee it having a big impact on our sales.”"
11604,"While many are concerned about Shake Shack’s impact on the neighborhood’s gentrification, others have a more positive outlook. Queens resident Ralph Simmons thinks Shake Shack will be a boon for the economy."
11605,"“It’ll bring more jobs to the neighborhood and hire more people from the community,” Simmons said."
11606,"A balance of chains with mom-and-pop stores benefits the neighborhood, Amy Wine, a Harlem resident and mother of two, said, adding that Harlem Burger Co.’s turkey burgers lure her into the local spot every two weeks."
11607,"On the flip side, outside chains in Harlem not only drive native Harlemites away but also “create a rift” within the community, Stephen, a business development specialist at Cannabis World Congress, said. Such establishments can behave differently in customer service, catering to those they believe are more affluent."
11608,"“You can tell with the body language, the communication they have with the community,” Stephen said. “The customer service starts to shift, and I’m very cognizant of that.”"
11609,"But for Uyanik, it’s better to think of the phenomenon as a “second Harlem renaissance,” rather than gentrification. Even with another chain restaurant coming, he has faith in his customer base."
11610,"“At the end of the day, when a business has a local community following, the community really tries their best to support it.” "

11628,"Beer may be most associated with St. Patrick’s Day. But on the food front, there are a few hearty, traditional Irish dishes that can be enjoyed during celebrations on March 17."
11629,"Shepherd’s pie is one dish in particular that is perfect for potlucks or parties, if you’re hosting or attending any this weekend."
11630,"Ali Rosen, a New York food writer and host of the show “Potluck with Ali,” includes a shepherd’s pie in “Bring It!” (out March 13, Running Press, $25). "
11631,"Her debut cookbook features more than 100 recipes, from appetizers to mains to desserts, that are ideal for potlucks and entertaining. "
11632,"Shepherd’s pie, traditionally made with lamb and topped with mashed potatoes, fits the bill for a few reasons. "
11633,"“Unlike the more familiar pot pie, shepherd’s pie has mashed potatoes on top, giving it a fluffy texture without the potential pitfalls of a fussy pastry crust,” Rosen writes. “Because of the forgiving nature of the ingredients it also makes it the perfect totable dish: Refrigerate or freeze it and then just pop it back into the oven to reheat. Whenever you need to bring comfort without a lot of fuss, this is the go-to recipe.”"
11634,"It can easily be baked in the vessel you plan to serve it in, like a cast-iron pot, too."

11637,Shepherd’s pie 
11638,Makes 4-6 servings 
11639, 
11640,For the topping 
11641,1 1⁄2 lb. russet potatoes (about 2 large potatoes) 
11642,3 tbsp. unsalted butter 
11643,1/4 cup milk 
11644,1 egg yolk 
11645,1 tsp. salt
11646, 
11647,For the filling 
11648,2 tbsp. unsalted butter 
11649,1 chopped large yellow onion 
11650,1 cup peeled and chopped carrot 
11651,"4 garlic cloves, minced "
11652,1 lb. ground lamb
11653,2 tbsp. all-purpose flour 
11654,1 cup beef broth 
11655,1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce 
11656,1⁄4 tsp. ground cloves 
11657,1 tsp. salt 
11658,1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper 
11659,3⁄4 cup peas (fresh or frozen work fine) 
11660,1⁄2 cup corn kernels (fresh or frozen work fine) 
11661,2 tbsp. chopped fresh parsley 
11662,2 tbsp. chopped fresh rosemary
11663, 
11664,"Peel the potatoes and cut them into chunks. Put the potatoes in a large  pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook for 10 to 15 minutes until the potatoes are completely tender. Drain the potatoes and then add them back into the empty pot with the butter, milk, egg yolk, and salt. Mash the potatoes until everything has combined but before it gets too smooth. It shouldn’t be as creamy as your typical mashed potatoes: the thickness and lumpy texture helps the pie brown nicely on top. Set the potatoes aside."
11665,Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
11666,"Meanwhile, for the filling, heat a large skillet or pot on medium heat and add the butter. (If you like to serve in vessels that you cook in, such as a cast-iron pot, you can use that in this step and just use it for baking.) Once the butter has melted, add the onion and carrot and cook them until they start to brown slightly, approximately 3 or 4 minutes. Add the garlic cloves and lamb and allow it to brown another 3 to 4 minutes without stirring too much. Add the flour, broth, Worcestershire sauce, cloves, salt, and pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to simmer, and cook for 10 more minutes, until the filling is thick. "
11667,"Turn the heat off and stir in the peas, corn, parsley, and rosemary. Taste to see if it needs more salt. Place the mixture in a baking dish and then spoon the mashed potatoes on top, spreading evenly. "
11668,"Place in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until you see the mashed potatoes start to brown on top. If your oven doesn’t tend to brown things evenly, you can turn the broiler on for the last minute to get a golden top. Remove from the oven and allow to cool at least 10 minutes before serving. "
11669, 
11670,How to bring it 
11671,"This recipe does fine in the refrigerator or even the freezer. Make sure you let it all cool to room temperature before covering (the trapped steam will keep cooking the dish). Cover tightly and store it in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer, well wrapped, for up to two months. To reheat, let the dish defrost in the fridge if frozen, and then cook for 20 minutes in a 350-degree oven. You can also cook straight from frozen if you prefer, but it will change the texture a little bit."

11682,"For answers, we turned to Michael Dietsch, author of the new book ""Shrubs: An Old-Fashioned Drink for Modern Times."""
11683,"A shrub, we learned from Dietsch's book, is actually an ancient beverage. The name is derived from the Arabic word sharab, which means to drink. Made of fruit, vinegar and sugar, the taste is complex and gives a mixed drink a lot of character."
11684,"""The American palate for cocktails is getting more sophisticated, slowly, as the craft cocktail has left the coast and moved into the center of the country,"" said Dietsch in a phone interview."

It's kind of a simplistic thought but keeping things uncomplicated is often the best path to reach your goals.""

11877,"If you craved a South Indian dosa in Brooklyn pre-2010, you were out of luck. 
Luckily, restauranteur Thiru Rajamani, of Brooklyn's Dino, was inspired by his heritage and a friend's yoga retreat to India to bring South Indian cuisine to his borough. 
Rajamani and his wife Heather opened the first Dosa Royale stall at the Fort Green Flea selling dosas and samosas, which were an immediate hit. In 2011, the couple joined Smorgasburg where the thin, crisp rice crepes stuffed with traditional and more contemporary fillings continued to rise in popularity. 
Early 2014 brought the opening of Dosa Royale's brick-and-mortar restaurant to Carroll Gardens, where the seasoned Smorgasburg vendors expanded their menu to offer more dosa flavors as well as thali tasting platters and a full cocktail menu.
""At a flea market you can only give a limited menu, but at a full restaurant I can give multiple versions of dosa and other South Indian food,"" said Thiru. ""I wanted to serve South Indian food that’s really authentic, but I always have fun with ingredients-- you’ll never see spinach and cheese dosa in India.""
While Dosa Royale is inspired by Indian culture and design, the brick-and-mortar space was made to look like a trendy Brooklyn hangout. 
At Smorgasburg this year, Dosa Royale will be selling new, popular restaurant dishes including a lamb samosa and a sweet potato masala dosa.

11886,"""This whole thing started because I wanted my partner to make me a meal I could eat with one hand,"" said Bruffin co-founder Michael Bagley. Sandwiches and pizza slices weren't conducive to a rushed and busy lifestyle and Bagely's partner  Medy Youcef, a Parisian baker, conceived a meal in a muffin. 
The first rendition of the Bruffin was a brioche batter (hence, the name) with cheddar cheese and bacon, which Bagley recalls as ""delicious but heavy."" He wanted something easy to eat while still being healthy. 
We lightened to dough to be more croissant-like and started adding fillings and flavor combinations based on different cuisines. Having worked for an international trading company, Bagley's travels inspired him as well as a tendency for consumers to ""buy with the eye"" -- so the Bruffin founders added flags to their product to attract hungry travelers.
After launching at LIC Flea & Food, The Bruffin was soon recruited for Smorgasburg, where international travelers discovered the baked treat. ""Someone from Spain would have the Spanish Bruffin and reaffirm our product,"" Bagley said. Those who didn't see flags from their native countries wanted to know why, inspiring more creativity and flavor combinations from The Bruffin. 
After Smorgasburg 2015, The Bruffin decided to go brick-and-mortar, opening The Bruffin Café in Gansevoort Market, which has a similar eclectic audience to Smorgasburg. 
At The Bruffin Café, the product has gone beyond regionally inspired pastries like Greek (spiced beef, feta, spinach and Kalamata olives) and Swedish (salmon, herbed goat cheese, capers and spinach) to Bruffin entrees, including a bruffin bowl filled with tortilla or French onion soup and a Bruffin BLT. A Bruffin benedict is in the works! 
 ""We were confident in our product, we didn't grow too quickly and our product had a sense of humor,"" said Bagley of The Bruffin's success. Seeing someone's eyes light up when biting into his or her first Bruffin continued to inspire the company, which is considering a new line of American Bruffins like Georgia peach and pecan or New Orleans Cajun.

11913,"With the New Year’s Eve release of her book “Sober Curious” (subtitle: “The Blissful Sleep, Greater Focus, Limitless Presence, and Deep Connection Awaiting Us All on the Other Side of Alcohol”), it’s no surprise that author Ruby Warrington thinks Dry January is a great way to reset and reassess your relationship with alcohol in the coming year."
11914,"amNewYork chatted with the Brooklynite, 42, who also is founder of the roving sober event series Club SÖDA NYC, about what it means to be “sober curious,” her relationship with alcohol and Dry January tips."
11915,How do you define being sober curious?
11916,"I see it as choosing to question and literally feel curious about your relationship with alcohol. It’s about considering every instinct, invitation and expectation to drink versus just mindlessly going along with the flow of the dominant drinking culture, which has become so pervasive in New York City — and other cities around the world."
11917,What were your drinking habits like before you became sober curious?
11918,"In the past, I would drink like most people in my social circle, around four or five nights per week. I’d have a couple glasses of wine during the week and binge drink on the weekends. Binge drinking is defined as having four drinks in two hours for women — and five for men. At the time, it seemed completely normal. With the sober curious movement, my goal is to make not drinking an option that’s available."
11919,Do you have any advice for someone considering doing Dry January?
11920,"Go into it expecting to enjoy yourself rather than thinking this is going to be really hard or worrying about what I call FOMA: fear of missing alcohol. Instead of thinking about what you’re denying yourself, focus on what you’re opening yourself up to. I also recommend writing down five reasons you’re doing this, so when it feels challenging you can remind yourself why you made this choice."

11923,What are some of the benefits of making these lifestyle changes?
11924,"I personally have experienced better sleep, more energy, more clarity and feeling more confident and optimistic. I feel more inspired in the mornings. When I look back now, I don’t know how I ever found so much time and space for alcohol in my life. I see it as the next logical step in the wellness revolution. It’s one more way you can be empowered to invest in your own well-being."
11925,Social pressure can be a big hurdle. Do you have any advice for dealing with it?
11926,"People asking why you’re not drinking is definitely tough — and only having soda water with lime can get boring. However, you’d be surprised by how many bartenders enjoy the challenge of being asked to make a mocktail. One of my go-to drinks is tonic with a splash of bitters — it’s what many bartenders drink — or a nonalcoholic beer. Just having a bottle in your hand can stop the questions."

11934,"From the outside, it doesn't look like much. But inside a generic warehouse in a strip of industrial businesses in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx is something out of the ordinary. Behind that metal garage door is the first brewery to make beer in the Bronx in more than 50 years."
11935,"Shiny silver fermentation tanks, a grain sifter and a ""hop-back"" are just some of the beer-brewing tools at Gun Hill Brewing Co., the latest in a line of breweries opening in New York City."
11936,"Craft brewing in the city has been growing steadily over the past five years, and in the past year alone, eight new breweries have opened, according to Jeremy Cowan, president of the New York City Brewers Guild, a nonprofit that works to promote this burgeoning industry. The guild counts 16 craft breweries among its members, and Cowan says that number includes all of the breweries operating commercially in the city. More are still in the planning stages."
11937,"These local breweries will be celebrated during New York City Beer Week, which runs through March 2. Events across the five boroughs range from tastings to happy hours, dinners, book signings, trivia events and more."
11938,Cowan says the interest in craft brewing in New York City is twofold. Both the complex flavor profile of small brews and the fact that the beers were made locally appeal to consumers here.
11939,"""The growth has been pretty astounding. ... All these amazing venues, restaurants, cafes, you can get good craft beer at,"" he said. ""We're selling an authentic experience."""
11940,"Gun Hill was an idea dreamed up by friends and baseball teammates Dave Lopez and Kieran Farrell. The two play semipro ball on the New York Thunderdogs, based in the Bronx. Both Lopez (centerfield) and Farrell (first base) have ties to the borough, and take pride in being the ones to bring beer back to the Bronx. (Rheingold brewed here until the '60s.)"

11943,"Lopez and Farrell admitted that the craft brewing boom is more often associated with Brooklyn and Manhattan, but that only made their desire to open in the Bronx stronger."
11944,"""That's exactly why. There really wasn't anything in the Bronx,"" Farrell said."
11945,"""We want to bring that revolution up here,"" Lopez said, adding that there has been a lot of interest from the local community."
11946,"Speaking of revolutions, this won't be the first in the neighborhood. Gun Hill is named after a nearby location where colonists stored ammunition during the Revolutionary War."
11947,There are other breweries based in the Bronx -- but they don't make their beer there. The brewmaster at Gun Hill is Chris Sheehan.
11948,"Gun Hill will be open every day beginning March 22 and will have four to five beers on tap daily. Most will be in the IPA style, though the beer on tap when amNewYork toured the facility was a lighter ale called Gun Hill Gold, which tasted like a more flavorful pilsner. Pints are $5 and plans are afoot to bring in a well-known Arthur Avenue restaurateur to prepare food to sell it at the brewery."

12004,Winter doesn’t have to mean making soup out of frozen or imported veggies.
12005,"“It’s true, you can’t get sweet-smelling corn or warm, sun-ripened berries at the farmer’s market in January, but the increase in greenhouse and hydroponic farms has been a boon to the fresh vegetable market,” says Nicole Chaszar, founder of Splendid Spoon, a Brooklyn-based company that provides weekly plant-based soup meal plans. “Tomatoes, sprouts and nearly every variety of lettuce are grown in greenhouses and can be found at markets throughout the city.”"
12006,"And a winter soup also doesn’t have to be flavored with heavy cream to be satisfying, either."
12007,"“Always the easier way to make something taste good is to add animal fat to it, but it’s really interesting how simple cooking techniques will bring out some nuance and flavor to pretty much any vegetable,” Chaszar says."
12008,"Chaszar likes adding dried mushrooms, like shiitake or porcini, to a vegetable base for a meaty flavor, using high-fat nuts instead of a dairy-based cream for richness and roasting vegetables for a “very nuanced, nutty flavor.”"
12009,"For her winter soup, specially created for amNewYork, she roasts acorn squash, traditionally available this time of year, and purées it with a vegetable-miso broth for a hearty bowl that’s a great source of vitamin A and potassium, Chaszar says. Sunflower seeds also pack some protein and sunflower sprouts add some fresh green."

	  Starbucks' new Bed-Stuy location is part of the company's nationwide initiative to invest in low- and middle-income communities, the company says.        Photo Credit: Starbucks     "
12084,The arrival of a neighborhood’s first Starbucks is often seen as a signal of imminent gentrification.
12085,"When news spread that the coffee giant would be planting its flag in Bedford-Stuyvesant, displacing part of the expansive discount department store Fat Albert, “there were mixed emotions,” said City Council member Robert Cornegy, who represents the 36th district. “The idea that they’ve been so closely associated with the negative tenets of gentrification sent a red flag up immediately in the community."
12086,"“When Starbucks shows up, it seems as if the trajectory of a community changes dramatically,” said Cornegy, who has seen the demographics of Bed-Stuy change significantly since 2001, when the 9/11 tragedy propelled a migration of lower Manhattan residents into Brooklyn housing along the J train. “I think people have that sentiment just seeing the brand.”"
12087,"What passers-by may not realize, the former chair of the council’s small business committee noted, is that the Starbucks that opened its doors at 774 Broadway earlier this month isn’t the coffeehouse chain’s typical store. It’s the latest addition to the corporation’s initiative to open 15 cafes in low- and medium-income communities across the U.S. and invest in the local economy by hiring staff from the neighborhood, partnering with area nonprofit organizations to provide free job-skills training for young adults, and working with women- and minority-owned contractors, suppliers and food vendors. The first launched in Jamaica, Queens, in early 2016, setting an example for five other outposts in Ferguson, Missouri, central Phoenix, Chicago’s Southside, East Baltimore and Long Beach, California."
12088,"According to Rodney Hines, the Starbucks executive leading the initiative, “What we look for is where is there an opportunity for Starbucks to join with civic leaders, nonprofit leaders, government and other businesses to really be a part of a desired state of economic development in support of social change in local communities? Where can we join with forces already underway?”"
12089,A neighborhood in transition
12090,"The stretch of Broadway between Williamsburg and Broadway on which the new Starbucks sits has been a retail street for decades, according to Jason Richter, CEO of the retail estate investment and advisory firm Capricorn Asset Management and a Brooklyn native. Long before the coffeehouse arrived, the area had “come a long way all on its own,” he says, “because the housing product in Williamsburg became so expensive and started to push the ‘hipster movement’ farther east. I don’t think having a Starbucks helps or hurts that.”"
12091,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
12092,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
12093,"While Richter expects local property owners will try to capitalize on the chain’s arrival amid down-market brand names like McDonalds and Little Caesars Pizza, to “spur a bit of a retail renaissance,” he doesn’t anticipate the full “Starbucks effect”: rising residential and commercial real estate values and a big retail expansion."
12094,"Like Jamaica, Bed-Stuy remains a predominantly lower-income neighborhood, despite the relative wealth that followed the Manhattan exodus and the return of college graduates. The community saw average rents rise more than 35 percent and average household incomes increase by about 21 percent from 1990 to 2014, according to a 2016 report from the Furman Center. The percent of Bed-Stuy’s adult population with a college degree grew from 11 percent in the ’90s to 25 percent in the next 14-year period, and a wave of new businesses have set up shop in once-vacant storefronts along commercial strips on Malcolm X, Classon and Lewis avenues."
12095,"Still, that rising prosperity hasn’t touched areas like NYCHA’s Sumner Houses blocks away from the new Starbucks, where census numbers show that unemployment rates were as high as 22 percent and where 61.3 percent of households were living below the poverty line in 2014."
12096,Job training or cheap labor?
12097,"“One of the main ideas of having the community store was to be able to bring jobs to the community,” said Louis Paredes, a 22-year-old shift manager and Bed-Stuy native who lives a 20-minute walk from the coffeehouse."
12098,"All but one of the store employees — or “partners” as Starbucks calls them, because the company offers even part-time workers equity — live in the neighborhood, Hines said."
12099,"“These partners represent the community,” said the director of social impact for Starbucks’ U.S. operations."
12100,"However, the majority, like Paredes, hired as a barista in Manhattan in 2015, were already working for the Seattle-based coffee giant before the Bed-Stuy location opened"
12101,"Store manager Juanita Vasquez, 27, started her Starbucks career as a shift supervisor for the Jamaica store, and her new role in Bed-Stuy signifies a return to the neighborhood where she bought her first scooter, where her family ordered weekend breakfasts and where her sister found her quinceanera dress."
12102,"“This is definitely my roots,” Vasquez said a few days before the cafe’s opening. Asked about the reception she expected from the community, she added: “We look like them, we talk like them . . . We’re genuine people, so it’s not going to be a problem. ”"
12103,"In June, a disgruntled blogger called the news of the shop’s arrival “a nail being hammered into a coffin for both Bed Stuy and Bushwick.”"
12104,"“To soften the blow, Starbucks is saying this location will be a ‘community store’ that will offer job training for 16- to 24-year-olds currently out of school,” says a “Make New York Grimey Again” post. “You’re only training young, poor teens and adults to work for businesses that will continue to steal their labor in return for cheap wages that are impossible to live on.”"
12105,But Hines and council member Cornegy see that training in a different light: They expect the same benefits from the curriculum that will be taught by instructors from the Brooklyn nonprofit the Hope Program in a glass-walled classroom still under construction at the store’s center.
12106,"“The aim is to teach them fundamental customer service skills that any employer will want,” Hines said of the training particularly geared toward preparing graduates for jobs in food service."
12107,"Those skills are transferable, Cornegy agreed, citing personal experience: “To make a career in retail is something that most people shouldn’t and don’t aspire to, but as an entry into the workforce, I think it still provides an excellent opportunity for young people.”"
12108,"Roughly 23 percent of Bed-Stuy residents ages 16 to 24 were not employed or in school in 2014, the U.S. Census found."
12109,"Most have lived in the neighborhood their whole lives, according to Lois Johnson, 69, a retired city employee and longtime Bed-Stuy resident. “My whole thing is that anything that helps build up the neighborhood is good,” said Johnson, who visited the store on a recent morning to find a seat and read, without necessarily making a purchase. “A lot of people may object to it but in my opinion, I love Starbucks coffee . . . Expensive, yes, but you can’t get anything for nothing.”"
12110,"When Paredes, the shift supervisor, was growing up, the go-to place for a morning cup of joe was the corner deli. (There are four within a three-block radius of the new Starbucks.) But his employer, he added, “is doing an amazing job to recreate that bodega feeling because when you walk into a bodega you know the clerk, you know the customers . . . You say hi, and you get your bagel and your coffee and you go and start your day.”"
12111,"Referring to the cafe’s plans to host community events, Hines cast the new store’s mission in poetic terms: “I imagine this to be a center of true human connection, and one that feels like a place that’s always been here in Bed-Stuy . . . Whatever tension, issues, celebrations, joy, discussions that are happening . . . comes to life in our store.”"
12112,"Cornegy’s view of the future is broader and more pragmatic: “My hope is that there’s a loud, resounding message that the cost of doing business in minority communities across the country should be that . . . you have to be an asset.”"

12162,"Black leaders who are advising Starbucks Corp on its anti-bias training program, which begins Tuesday, hope it will reinvigorate decades-old efforts to ensure minorities get equal treatment in restaurants and stores, setting an example for other corporations."
12163,Starbucks committed to the training after a Philadelphia cafe manager's call to police resulted in the arrests of two black men who were waiting for a friend. The arrests sparked protests and accusations of racial profiling at the coffee chain known for its liberal stances on social issues such as same-sex marriage.
12164,Anti-bias training is intended to get participants to recognize their own unconscious biases and avoid unintentional discrimination.
12165,"For several hours this afternoon, we will close stores and offices to discuss how to make Starbucks a place where all people feel welcome.Thank you for your patience and support as we renew our promise to make Starbucks an inclusive gathering place for all.See you tomorrow."
12166,"Starbucks is closing 8,000 company-owned U.S. stores at around 2 p.m. local time on Tuesday as a first step in training 175,000 employees on racial tolerance. Some 6,000 licensed Starbucks cafes will remain open in locations such as grocery stores and airports, and those employees will be trained at a later time."
12167,"As of 2017, there were a total of 317 Starbucks locations across the five boroughs, the majority in Manhattan, according to the annual ""State of the Chains"" report from the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future."
12168,"Starbucks' training could have a lasting impact on its employees' behavior and pave the way for other companies to finally tackle racism in their own eateries and shops, said Heather McGhee, president of public policy group Demos, which is headquartered in Manhattan."
12169,McGhee said one of her earliest memories as a black girl was being chased from a penny candy store by a white store manager.

12174,"The NAACP in the past sued Abercrombie & Fitch, Wet Seal and Denny's Corp for racial bias. Each of the companies reached multimillion dollar settlements and vowed to change their practices."
12175,"Starbucks in a preview of Tuesday's four-hour program said employees will watch videos featuring company leaders, hip-hop artist Common and experts from the Perception Institute as well as a short documentary on the history of racism in public spaces. They also will participate in discussion and problem-solving sessions on identifying and avoiding bias."
12176,"The company already has issued employee guidelines for addressing disruptive customer behavior, including sleeping, using abusive language or taking drugs. The guidelines encourage workers to ask if they would take the considered action with any customer, to verify the perceived situation with a co-worker and to dial 911 if the situation becomes unsafe."
12177,Starbucks did not comment on future training plans. It has said it intends to eventually share its training program with other companies.

12180,"""Most people want to think of themselves as being fair ... if you give them the tools to do that, their better angels take over,"" said Howard Ross, author of ""Everyday Bias"" and founding partner of Cook Ross, which offers training on unconscious bias and gave Starbucks input on its program."

At a “scoop bar,” customers can choose from 14 rotating coffees to take home to brew. At a Starbucks Reserve cold brew bar, they can get coffee to go in growlers."
12193,"And there’s an actual bar, the aperitivo-inspired Arriviamo. Starbucks partnered with famed mixologist Julia Momose for a menu of coffee- and tea-infused cocktails, like the Nocino Notte (cold brew coffee, gin and black truffle salt). The bar will also serve wine, beer and bites like cornetti sandwiches and pizza al taglio."
12194,"All of the food is from Princi, a Milan bakery that recently opened its first New York City location in midtown, with breads, pizza, cornetti, focaccia and more baked on-site in one of four cast-iron ovens."

12215,"Barca features a Mediterranean seafood-based menu, with crudo like fluke with sea beans and radishes ($17) and mains like branzino alla plancha ($34), while Surf offers wood-fired cooking."
12216,"Both of Rallo's restaurants are part of the Urby, a residential development that features several other food options ranging from pizza to tacos. David Barry, president and CEO of Urby, said sourcing quality dining was a priority for the complex. "
12217,"""Previously it was a very industrial site. One of the goals as we developed it into a community . . . was to give it a sense of neighborhood,"" he said. ""With Stapleton, it was a much more provincial food scene five years ago. I think there were some notable long-standing ethnic restaurants, [but] as we opened Urby . . .

12371,"What could make the holidays even sweeter? Doughnuts, of course.
Happily, there's a holiday coming up that calls for eating them. Hanukkah, the eight-day Festival of Lights, is also a Festival of Doughnuts. Sufganiyot (soof-gone-ee-OAT), to be exact -- round Israeli doughnuts that are filled with either jelly or custard.
For Yonatan Floman, CEO of Breads Bakery, it's a little taste of nostalgia.
""Sufganiyot is something that, ever since I grew up, I remember in the '80s eating sufganiyot every Hanukkah,"" Floman said.
Like its savory holiday companion, the latke, the sufganiyah is meant to commemorate the Hanukkah miracle of a small amount of oil lasting for eight nights to keep a menorah lit.
""Traditionally, you eat a lot of stuff that are fried -- so you have latke, you have sufganiyot,"" he explained.

But Breads is known for putting a little spin on the classics -- Nutella babka, anyone? -- so it's offering up other varieties, too. The bakery is frying these doughnuts up all day every day through Dec. 9, so that you can grab a fresh one at any time.

The first night of Hannukah may not arrive until Dec. 2, but Breads is getting a head start to meet demand, Floman said: ""There are certain holiday items like Hamentaschen and Sufganiyot that we love so much and the holiday isn’t long enough to satisfy that urge so we extend it.""

	  Make this mushroom cheese dip by Black Tree BK.       Photo Credit: Maxine Cher     "
12393,Make your Super Bowl Sunday super cheesy. We asked NYC chefs for their tips on making a winning cheese dip.
12394,Flavor profile
12395,"First thing’s first: Before you hit up a grocery store, deciding on a flavor and seasoning profile is necessary."
12396,"“I use a combination of heat with red peppers with garlic cloves, mushrooms, salt and pepper and olive oil and then roast everything together,” says Sandy Dee Hall, executive chef at the new Black Tree Brooklyn. “You can work that into anything you use for the cheese.”"
12397,Fresh is best
12398,"To make the best cheese dip, quality and fresh ingredients are key, says Giovanni Morales, chef at the Latin American wine bar Oovina. He recommends buying the cheese no more than three days in advance."
12399,"A mix of hard and soft cheeses is best, adds Hall, in addition to using sour cream. The consistency should be pretty wet when it’s cold, an indicator that it’s gooey and cheesy."
12400,"“If it’s not wet and gooey, always add more sour cream and it will loosen up the dip again,” Hall says."
12401,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
12402,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
12403,Test run
12404,"Prior to Super Bowl Sunday, Morales recommends preparing the dip ahead of time and doing a test run to ensure it’s tasty."
12405,"“This will allow you to make tweaks to get it just right,” he says."
12406,Chip selection
12407,"Homemade corn chips cut from tortillas are Morales’s go-to, while Hall’s favorite chips for dipping are crunchy hard kettle chips. But, if you’re feeling adventurous, Hall endorses the use of frozen egg roll skins, which can be found in a Chinese market."
12408,"“You cut them into strips and fry them, which takes about 5 minutes,” he says."
12409,These are great for parties because they’re a bit smaller in size and keep guests from scooping too much — conserving your dip for the lengthy game.
12410,Next-day dip
12411,"If leftovers exist, don’t throw anything out — the cheese dip can be saved for later snacking."
12412,"“You can store the dip for approximately two days,” says Morales. “Most of the ingredients are fresh so the flavors will keep better.”"
12413,Black Tree Brooklyn executive chef Sandy Dee Hall shares this recipe for a baked ricotta- and cheddar-cheese dip with mushrooms and hot peppers for extra flavor and spice. Makes 20 servings
12414, 
12415,Ingredients
12416,4 hot peppers
12417,"4 cups mushrooms, chopped"
12418,2 garlic cloves
12419,2 cups ricotta cheese
12420,2 cups cheddar cheese

12422,1 cup sour cream
12423,Salt and pepper to taste
12424,"Parmesan, cilantro and red pepper flakes for garnish"
12425,Wonton chips
12426, 
12427,Directions
12428,1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
12429,"2. Place hot peppers, mushrooms and garlic cloves on a sheet of aluminum foil on a baking tray and drizzle with olive oil."
12430,3. Slow-roast ingredients for 20 minutes until they’re soft and baked.
12431,"4. While ingredients are baking, take a separate bowl and mix the ricotta cheese, cheddar cheese, cream cheese and sour cream together."
12432,"5. When veggies are done, mix into cheese mixture."
12433,6. Place mixture in a 9x13 casserole dish and bake for another 40 minutes.
12434,"7. To garnish, grate Parmesan over finished dip for another layer of cheese. Add cilantro and red pepper flakes to taste."

12443,It’s not hard to track down Brooks Headley on any given day.
12444,"“I am always at the restaurant,” the chef and owner of Superiority Burger says recently on a call from, of course, his restaurant. “They have to force me to take days off, I don’t like it.”"
12445,"Headley lives a block away from his East Village spot, which enables this lifestyle."
12446,"“There are months at a time when I go nowhere except for the restaurant and my apartment to sleep in, and Union Square to go to the markets,” says Headley, 45."
12447,"This month, the James Beard Award-winning chef is stepping out of the kitchen to promote his latest cookbook. "
12448,"“Superiority Burger Cookbook,” out this week, is a document of the vegetarian restaurant, which in just three years has become a destination for meat and non-meat eaters alike for its inventive, flavorful fare."
12449,The restaurant’s bestseller is handily its namesake — a quinoa-chickpea patty whose fans range from David Chang to Cate Blanchett — and is the first recipe in the cookbook. 
12450,"“I think the key thing about the burger is, everything is made by hand,” Headley says. “We don’t even have a big mixer to mix the burger. Everything’s mixed by hand. Everything is hand-formed. This isn’t something that we’re buying frozen. It’s not getting packaged in a factory somewhere.”"
12451,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
12452,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
12453,The recipe took some testing before landing on which grains and beans to use and how to best bind them. (Eggs were replaced by a potato starch slurry to make it vegan.) 
12454,"“What I realized in opening up a vegetarian restaurant, what you’re actually doing is opening up a vegan restaurant,” Headley says. “You can’t open up a vegetarian restaurant and not have 100 percent vegan options for people.” "
12455,"About a month in, Headley ditched eggs in the burger as well as from the ice cream on the dessert menu, which helped in more ways than one."
12456,"“It’s actually kind of a relief not to use eggs because they’re hard to store and they take up a lot of space, which we don’t have,” he says."
12457,"With just 300 square feet to work with, Headley and his team have to be efficient about their use of equipment and ingredients. That includes no deep fryer for French fries. "
12458,"“I don’t have a beef with French fries — I love French fries — but we would probably mess them up so we don’t make fries,” he says. “A place like Balthazar does amazing fries, but we don’t have the space or manpower to do fries.”"
12459,"Instead, Superiority Burger offers different sides to pair with your burger, from warm and cold salads to a variety of crunchy potatoes. "
12460,"The more than 100 recipes in the cookbook have at some point been served in the restaurant, whether as a menu staple or a special. "
12461,"“Cookbooks don’t make any money — I was compelled by a higher force to document what we’re doing,” Headley says."
12462,"Superiority Burger doesn’t stop innovating; since wrapping up the manuscript a year and a half ago, Headley and his team have come up with another 100 recipes."
12463,"“Through the process of writing and figuring out the recipes, we usually write them on printer tape from the order machine — you’ll find them taped all over the walls and hanging off the ceiling,” he says. “We have crazy scraps of paper taped everywhere.” "
12464,“Superiority Burger Cookbook” is as much an ode to the restaurant as it is its regulars. 
12465,"“Superiority Burger is very much a community thing,” Headley says. “We have tons and tons of regulars who come almost every day, even though there’s only six places to sit.”"
12466,"Since opening, Superiority Burger has drawn a “psychotic devotion” from its regulars, the chef notes, which he attributes to the ever-evolving menu."
12467,"“We change things around a lot — there’s always something new on the menu,” he says, from specials to daily gelato and sorbet flavors. “We have people that come here all the time and show up to be able to try a new experiment.” "
12468,"In honor of the restaurant’s devotees, the cookbook devotes nearly as many photographs to its regulars as it does the recipes."
12469,"“All the human beings in the book are all regulars,” Headley says. “We didn’t do a photo shoot — we actually sent out an invite to all of our regulars to just show up at a couple different sessions. Our regulars are the ones who keep us going. They get credit just as much as anyone else.”"
12470,"Some of the recipes are even named after regulars; the Sloppy Dave, a meat-free take on a Sloppy Joe, is named after artist and Our/New York partner Dave Ortiz, who comes in several times a week."
12471,"“I was like their first customer,” says Ortiz, who lives around the corner from Superiority Burger. “The sandwich was originally called the Sloppy Joe. I complained — they couldn’t call it that because that was a meat sandwich. I told them to make it Sloppy Dave, and they did.”"
12472,Here’s the recipe for the sandwich:
12473,Sloppy Dave
12474,Serves 8
12475,"Roughly chop all the vegetables, including the cherry peppers, and process in batches in a food processor until finely chopped. Heat 3 tbsp. of the olive oil over medium heat in a big pot and add the processed vegetables. Salt. Cook until the veg is totally soft and takes on a little color, about 20 minutes. Add the tomato paste and spices and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring frequently. It is OK if it sticks to the bottom of the pot. Add the cider vinegar and scrape the bottom of the pot to get off all browned bits of vegetables and tomato paste."
12476,"Add the tomatoes, ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, 1 tbsp. of the amino acids, and the black pepper and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for as long as you can — 30 minutes will do. While the sauce is simmering, crumble the tofu. In a large skillet over medium heat, add the remaining 1 tbsp. oil and the tofu and brown. Once the tofu is mostly brown, pour in the remaining 2 tbsp. amino acids and let cook a bit longer, until the tofu absorbs all of the sauce and begins to caramelize. Remove from the heat and set aside."
12477,Roughly grind the tofu in the food processor. Add the tofu to the pot of sauce and continue to cook. Season with salt and black pepper. Serve on a toasted sesame seed bun. Top with frizzled onions.
12478,Frizzled onions
12479,For 8 Sloppy Daves
12480,"Peel and cut the onions in half. Use a mandoline to cut paper thin. Mix the Wondra and all-purpose flours and season with salt and pepper. Heat the grapeseed oil in a heavy deep pot to about 350 degrees. Put the onions into the seasoned flour, toss to coat, shake off the excess flour, and carefully drop into the hot oil. Do not add too many at once — the oil will overflow and ruin everything. Using a slotted spoon, agitate and stir the onions until they are golden brown. Drain on paper towels and season with more salt. Repeat the frying process."

12502,The cookbook stemmed from sold-out dinners Mayada Anjari held at an UWS church.

12504,"Since Mayada Anjari immigrated to the United States as a refugee from Homs, Syria, in 2016, she’s helped support her family by cooking sold-out community dinners at the Rutgers Presbyterian Church on the Upper West Side and other religious centers throughout the city. Now, she is bringing Syrian cuisine to American kitchens with the publication of a new cookbook, “The Bread and Salt Between Us” (out Friday)."
12505,"“At first I wasn’t sure about making a cookbook,” Anjari, 32, who speaks Arabic, said over email via a translator. “But the more I thought about it, I realized it would be good for me and my family.”"
12506,"Every Saturday for six months in 2017, cookbook author Jennifer Sit and translator Dalia El-Newehy traveled to Anjari’s house in Jersey City to cook with her. After a cup of coffee, the three would walk to the local C-Town to buy groceries. Then, they would return to the kitchen to cook before sitting down in the evening and eating the fruits of the day’s labor."
12507,"While Anjari cooked and El-Newehy translated, Sit converted Anjari’s actions into recipes. "
12508,"The most difficult part was defining quantities, such as how high the stovetop flame should be or how long something should cook, Sit said."
12509,"“One of the biggest things is that Mayada doesn’t really measure — she’s really good at eyeballing,” Sit, 32, said. “I would know that the ‘Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles’ coffee cup she would use would equal one and a quarter cups.”"
12510,"As Sit got to know Anjari and her four children, she compiled anecdotes to include in the book. The recipe for cheese fingers, for example, explains that the treats are a foolproof way for Anjari to soothe her two-year-old daughter, Jana, when she gets upset. Sit also fondly remembers tasting food for Anjari, who could not eat in the daytime during Ramadan, the month of fasting in Islam."

12513,"Everyone involved in the project, from the proofreader to the copy editor to the publicist, worked on a volunteer basis, Sit said. All proceeds will go to Anjari and the Rutgers Presbyterian Church’s New Americans Committee, which helps refugees, asylum-seekers and others find employment. "
12514,"Formerly the Refugee Task Force, the committee sponsored Anjari’s family through the Church World Service when they came to the U.S. When the group realized Anjari’s cooking skill, they started hosting the dinners as a way for Anjari to make money — and more. "
12515,"“It’s been a way to raise awareness about the plight of the refugee,” said Nancy Muirhead, a nonprofit lawyer who’s the chair of the New Americans Committee. “Breaking bread and speaking together about these issues is a great way to build understanding.”"
12516,"With the publication, Anjari is excited to bring her cooking to a larger audience."
12517,"“I hope many Americans will try my different recipes so that they can experience Syrian dishes,” she said."

12519,A dinner party staple
12520,"If Anjari was pressed to pick, the kibbeh — a popular Levantine specialty — might be her favorite recipe included in “The Bread and Salt Between Us.” Hers stands out for the use of chicken, instead of beef or lamb, for the dough. The labor-intensive dish makes for an ideal group activity, and is perfect for serving at a dinner party alongside tabbouleh."

12527, 
12528,"1. Make the dough: Place the bulgur in a large pot or bowl. Add enough hot water to cover. Stir together and let stand for 1 hour, until soft. If the bulgur feels dry, add more hot water and mix until soft; if all the water has not been absorbed, drain off the excess. The bulgur should stick together when pressed into a ball."
12529,"2. Add the chicken and onion to the bulgur. Process through a meat grinder with a fine plate two or three times, until very smooth. (You can also use a food processor: Start by chopping the onion. Then, working in batches, add the chicken and bulgur and pulse several times. Stir the mixture and pulse again several times, until a sticky dough begins to form. Do not try to pulse the dough completely smooth in the food processor; it will come out too sticky.)"
12530,"3. Transfer the mixture to a large bowl. Add the salt and cayenne and mix together with your hand, kneading it until thoroughly combined. Cover the bowl and refrigerate."
12531,"4. Make the filling: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium. Add the onion and season with salt and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until softened and translucent. Add the beef and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until browned and cooked through; frequently stir the beef and break it up with a wooden spoon to create a fine texture. Transfer to a bowl and let cool."
12532,"5. To assemble: Fill a small bowl with water to dip your hands in while you work, to prevent sticking. Roll a 2-inch ball of dough between your hands. Use your index finger to form a hole in the center of the ball. Keeping your finger there, roll the bulgur mixture around your finger to form a 3-inch-long hollow cone with very thin sides. (Try not to break the sides.) Wet your hands with water if the dough is sticky."
12533,"6. Use a spoon to fill the cone with the beef filling, leaving about 1⁄4 inch from the top of the cone. Pinch and roll the top of the cone closed. With wet hands, turn and shape the kibbeh between your hands to create a torpedo or a football shape, with pointed ends. Transfer to a platter and repeat with the remaining dough and filling."
12534,"7. Line a large plate with paper towels. Heat 3 inches of vegetable oil in a large pot on medium-high until hot. Working in batches, add the kibbeh and fry for 12 to 14 minutes, flipping halfway through, until dark brown. Transfer with a slotted spoon to the paper towel–lined plate to drain. Let cool slightly and serve."

12679,"On the Saturday before Thanksgiving, Patrick McMurray was holding court at the Grand Central Oyster Bar, trying to  persuade New Yorkers to add oysters to their Thanksgiving spread."
12680,"He knows it’s almost sacrilegious to suggest that we give up our holiday gobbler, the turkey that is the centerpiece of the holiday meal. And what would Thanksgiving be without jellied cranberry sauce, stuffing, mashed potatoes and gravy?"
12681,But McMurray — a Canadian who holds the Guinness World Record for the most oysters opened in one minute (39) – suggests that oysters are a wonderful addition to Thanksgiving or other holiday celebrations.  
12682,"“Well, oysters would have been on the original menu at the first Thanksgiving,” McMurray said at the recent tasting event."
12683,"Though there’s no record of the complete menu for that first feast, which lasted three days, ""It is certainly possible [oysters] were on the table for the 1621 harvest feast,"" said Kate Sheehan, associate director of media relations and marketing at Plimoth Plantation on Cape Cod."
12684,"“The waters here in Plymouth were full of shellfish, including oysters and clams, both of which native people ate,” she said. “Oysters were definitely consumed by the Wampanoag people in our region.”"
12685,But back to New York in 2018: McMurray brought three oysters from British Columbia to the iconic oyster house for New Yorkers to sample.

12689,"Linda Haus of Manhattan, who came for her usual Saturday lunch at the oyster bar, ordered a second round of the DD’s, which she called “sweet and amazing.”"
12690,"Wearing a glove made of chain mail, McMurray instructed visitors on safe techniques for holiday oyster shucking."
12691,"East Coast oysters, like Long Island’s Bluepoints, are the easiest to practice on, he advised, because they “have a good, consistent, even shell with a deep cup and a nice wide hinge.” Plus, ""Long Island oysters are fantastic,"" he added."
12692,"To avoid any injuries, it’s important to always protect your hand, said McMurray, whose new book, “The Oyster Companion: A Field Guide,” is all about safely enjoying the bivalves."
12693,"“I use a fancy glove, but a tea towel will work,” he said. “And use a good oyster knife."""
12694,"To get shucking, “go into the hinge, crack it, cut the top off, cut the bottom and make sure the oyster is loose,” he said."
12695,“The secret to opening an oyster is to always keep your eye on the oyster.”

12742,"Rossillo credits the sudden popularity to a combination of factors: The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on gay marriage; celebrity shout-outs, including one from Kim Kardashian’s friend and PR specialist Jonathan Cheban; and the colorful bagels trending on Instagram."

12870,"Fermented foods may sound exotic, but you've eaten them many times before. Fungal cultures and beneficial bacterias are present in everyday foods from beer to pickles to miso to yogurt. But Momofuku, the dining empire based in New York City, is taking fermentation to new levels."
12871,"About two years ago, Momofuku began experimenting with fermentation in their downtown culinary lab. The goal? To understand the science that makes their food possible, and to push boundaries."
12872,"""When you see soy sauce, vinegar, kimchi, these are staples of cooking that no one questions,"" said Dan Felder, head of Research and Development at Momofuku. ""We want to look at what we use everyday? And connect with the origin point of culinary staples."""
12873,"At Momofuku, those staples are kimchi, miso, vinegar and other ingredients or dishes common in Asian cuisine. Felder and two other chefs are currently working on creating new variations of miso. Instead of the traditional soybean, they are experimenting with pistachios, chickpeas and lentils, as well as altering the temperature of a sample and the ratio of ingredients."
12874,"While the culinary lab ""allows for innovation and making new flavors,"" Felder said the goal is not to rush new items onto menus, but rather to fully appreciate the scientific basis for how they are created. To that end, Momofuku is collaborating with Harvard University microbiologist Rachel Dutton."
12875,"Momofuku founder and chef David Chang said in a recent presentation about food and science at Harvard that microbial manipulations are ""the future of food."""
12876,"""Mold is something I never thought would be flavorful,"" he said."

12955,"Adults consume more food when it comes in bigger packages or is served on larger plates, a review of past research has found."
12956,"The study team analyzed 58 studies with a combined 6,600 participants that examined how the size of things like cereal bowls and snack bags influences the number of calories people take in."
12957,"Combined, these brief experiments suggest that smaller containers, dishes and cutlery might help adults consume up to 16 percent fewer calories in the U.K. and 29 percent less in the U.S."
12958,"""It provides the most conclusive evidence to date that people consistently consume more food and drink when offered larger-sized portions, packages, or tableware than when offered smaller-sized versions,"" said lead study author Dr. Gareth Hollands, a behavioral health researcher at the University of Cambridge in the U.K."
12959,"The results, published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, highlight the important role of environmental influences on food consumption and suggest that actions to limit exposure to larger serving sizes may be effective tools for getting people eat less, Hollands said by email."
12960,"Globally, 1.9 billion adults are overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. Obesity increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, joint disorders and certain cancers."
12961,"The effect of smaller sizes for dishes and packages didn't vary by gender and was similar for normal-weight, overweight and obese people, the researchers found. Only children appeared unaffected by size when deciding how much food or drink to consume."

12964,"Most of the studies reviewed didn't follow people for long periods and researchers lacked data to assess whether sustained changes in container and plate sizes over time might contribute to weight loss or maintaining a healthy weight, the authors acknowledge. They also note that they lacked data on the impact of bottle, can or glass size on alcohol consumption."
12965,"Still, when it comes to plate size, reducing the diameter by even an inch or two can make a difference in calorie consumption, said Dr. David Sharp, a nutrition researcher at Kent State University School of Health Sciences in Ohio."
12966,"Ideally, adults should use 9-inch or 10-inch plates, and children should have 7.5-inch plates, Sharp, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. But this isn't an easy message to convey in a culture with a ""supersize"" mentality, he said."
12967,"""Hunters try to kill the deer with the largest antlers, fishermen tell stories of their biggest catch, and we sensationalize even the act of dieting by hosting reality TV shows such as The Biggest Loser,"" Sharp said. ""When we are bombarded with the appeal of getting things bigger or larger, it creates a bit of dissonance that the message for our most intimate choices such as our meals, our plates and our bodies runs opposite to our culture of plenty when considering long-term health and wellness."""

13004,"The underground Tokyo Record Bar in Greenwich Village asks its diners to set the night’s vibe, with each evening's soundtrack chosen by the guests themselves."
13005,"On a recent visit, we encountered a DJ booth and shelves of records stacked in a crowded yet vibrant basement, downstairs from sister venue Airs Champagne bar. We were asked to select our playlist for the evening, with all guests in the 22-seat room choosing one song from a booklet labeled “Vinyl Jukebox.” The nearby DJ would play the crowd-curated playlist throughout the omakase meal that was enjoyed in an underground space adorned with Kyoto-inspired cherry blossom stems."
13006,"Over the next three hours, we enjoyed a number of inventive dishes, ranging from fresh Hamachi sashimi to perfectly cooked beef tenderloin. Perhaps most interestingly, each of the 10 or so courses was prepared in a kitchen that has not even so much as an oven to its name. Instead, Chefs Zach Fabian and Josh Resnick use tools right out of the average college dorm room, like hot plates and toasters. The gastronomic innovations were served to the tune of The Rolling Stones’ “Start Me Up,” Bob Segar’s “Night Moves,” and Solange’s “Cranes in the Sky,” and as some guests began to dance or sing along to the soundtrack, watching DJ Mandy Manders juggle her collection of LPs and delicately place the needle on each song proved entertainment enough."
13007,
13008,"Above all the delicious foods and catchy tunes, though, it was impossible not to notice the sheer symbiosis among Tokyo Record Bar’s staff. Perhaps with the exception of a few family-owned joints, it’s rare these days to find a New York restaurant where employees take on host, server, and even marketing jobs interchangeably and where everyone is there not because they have to be but because they actually want to be."
13009,"While the restaurant was inspired by and erected in the shadow of the vinyl bars ubiquitous to Japan, it interestingly ditches the traditionally minimal server-customer interaction found in the Asian country. Instead, the staff enjoy the experience as much as those paying $50 a head for it, chatting with customers, singing along to the music, and sharing their thoughts on a new dish. Unlike at many other restaurants, especially those that serve prix fixe, multicourse meals, the stresses of timing and curation, although both perfectly executed at the Greenwich Village spot, don’t seem to get to Tokyo Record Bar’s team. The staff’s laidback, cool attitudes and engaging exchanges with diners make patrons feel like they’re already a part of the gang, and the small but open kitchen, topped with ongoing dialogue with the chefs, break down the final barriers of conventional dining."

13013,"The restaurant officially opened its doors in August 2017, but the concept for Tokyo Record Bar was years in the making. A DJ-ed champagne omakase was a weekly occurrence at the restaurant’s predecessor, Riddling Widow, as an homage to Japanese record bars. When Riddling Widow closed in May 2017, Ariel Arce entertained various ideas for the space’s second life but kept coming back to the Tokyo Record Bar idea."
13014,"As Arce’s brainchild was further developed, she brought in chefs Fabian and Resnick, who “worked with their past experiences and then put their twists on Japanese classics,” she notes. The restaurant’s two sittings a night, by which all diners arrive at once, was a “last-minute idea.”"
13015,"“I wanted the experience to be participatory,” the owner says. She explains that when they would do the event at Riddling Widow, people always wanted to look at the records and make requests, “so I thought, how can we flip the narrative and make it where the entire experience is curated by the guests?” Arce says. She discovered that in order for each of the 22 people in the room to hear his or her requested song (each about three minutes long), the entire experience would need to be about an hour and a half. “That’s how we came up with our izakaya format. We could do seven courses in that time, and everyone would hear their requests!” Arce says."
13016,"Tokyo Record Bar began with only two people — one server and one DJ — working alongside the two chefs five nights a week. “It then grew as we met people we liked and then those people would recommend their friends,” says Arce. “We now haven’t hired anyone new in over a year,” perhaps explaining the staff’s familial vibes."
13017,"All appear to be friends both inside and outside the restaurant, as evidenced by the slew of photos posted on Tokyo Record Bar’s Instagram (yep, they do the restaurant’s social media, too), and Chef Fabian and Amanda, the cheery hostess-slash-waitress who welcomed us to the bar, are even engaged."
13018,"While Tokyo Record Bar’s scrumptious menu and impossible-not-to-sing-along-to set lists change with each and every seating, customers can always count on an unending stream of participation, banter and fun from the restaurant’s family (and a certain yummy final course) every single night."

13028,“Top Chef” runner-up Adrienne Cheatham is putting on her SundayBest in Harlem this weekend.
13029,"That’s a pop-up dinner series, to be clear — not the chef’s churchgoing attire."
13030,"The Le Bernadin and Red Rooster alum, who impressed the judges with her elevated Southern cuisine in the Bravo show’s final, neck-to-neck showdown Thursday night, may have lost the coveted “Top Chef” title and the $125,000 prize to competitor Joe Flamm, but she’s determined to put her best foot forward with a new project."
13031,"Since filming ended in June, the longtime Harlem resident has been planning a pop-up concept to showcase her food — sophisticated soul fare reinvented with global ingredients — much closer to home. SundayBest, kicking off this weekend, will serve five- to seven-course dinners in intimate Harlem settings once or twice a month, Cheatham says. Meals prepared for 12 to 20 diners will likely be priced at less than $100 a head, and ticket details will announced via Cheatham’s Instagram account."
13032,"On the menu, guests can expect to see at least one of the elaborate dishes the chef served as part of her last challenge: spoonbread (a cornmeal-based, savory pudding) topped with sea urchin, swimming in buttermilk dashi broth and hidden beneath a tuile wafer."
13033,"The refinement of the cuisine won’t, however, define the ambience: “I want it to be amazing food in an atmosphere that you feel comfortable, welcome and at home in,” says Cheatham, 36, who will be running the kitchen as a one-woman operation. SundayBest won’t take itself “too seriously,” she adds. “I don’t expect people to get dressed up, but I expect me to be putting my best foot forward. That’s what the term ‘Sunday Best’ means.”"
13034,"The term also refers to a mindset common among black communities in the segregated South, explains Cheatham, whose father is black and grew up in Mississippi: “Every time you left the house as a black person, your grandmother told you put on your best clothes because you don’t want people to think that you’re less than . . . because people are going to be looking at you and you always have to be presenting yourself in the best manner you can.”"
13035,"While the “Top Chef” contestant aspired to be the show’s first female winner of color, she also hoped to validate the merits of Southern cooking."

13037,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
13038,"“If I had won, it would have shown that it belongs on the table right along every other cuisine,” she says."
13039,"But Cheatham’s pop-up, which gives her the latitude to travel and spend time with her soon-to-be-husband while feeding her neighbors, could still achieve that."
13040,"We spoke to her at length about having confidence in your own food, what was going through her head during the last nail-biter of a challenge and what her signature gold sneakers mean to her:"
13041,"You came a long way over the course of the season, starting with polished technique, but flavors that weren’t quite bold enough, and ending on an incredibly strong note. What do you see as the turning point for you to — as you put it yourself — “get your s--t together”?"
13042,"It’s really having confidence in the food that you’re doing. It’s not like I was executing that cuisine on a regular basis, so it was kind of untested. I was kind of unsure of it. So in the beginning, it’s kind of like muscle memory: You go back to what you know, and what I mainly worked in for most of my career was a lot of subtle flavors and a lot of nuance, which, when you’re working for a group of chefs who want to be punched in the face with flavor, that doesn’t necessarily come across well."
13043,"I think it was the governor’s mansion challenge where I started cooking what my style of food is, and then I started to get more confident."
13044,"Your mom’s visit during the “Sunday Supper” episode helped, too, right?"
13045,"My mom was like, ‘You’ve cooked in everybody else’s kitchen, now you finally have a chance to cook your food and you’re not doing it. That’s pretty much what you come here for.’"
13046,"Mom always helps, trust me."
13047,"The final show was a nail-biter, but you kept everything so calm and controlled. What was going through your head while you were in the kitchen at the Aspen Mountain Club that day?"
13048,"No matter how much you want to freak out in a kitchen, I think it’s always best to just keep it together. I’ve worked for chefs my entire career who yell and scream and throw things, but then you’ll have one chef in the kitchen, be it the sous chef or the executive, who keep their calm when everything is going to s---t. It lets you know that everything will be ok."
13049,"I’ve definitely freaked out in my career, but as I’ve gotten older, I’ve realized the best thing to do is to keep your cool because you still have control of the situation, but if you lose control of yourself, then you’re done."
13050,"That’s kind of how Ripert was in the kitchen — he’d keep his cool, no matter how bad things were getting."
13051,"At the end of the episode you expressed confidence in the four-course meal you’d prepared and said you would have preferred to win, but had no regrets. Do you still feel that way?"
13052,"I was of full sh-- when I said that, I don’t know what I was thinking. Of course I would do things over. I would do a lot over. As a matter of fact, can I get a do-over? You don’t really have time to think everything through and plan it. You’re just going and going from the previous challenge into the next one. If I had time to really think about it, I probably could have planned it out a little better. But c’est la vie."
13053,Those gold sneakers you wore a lot this season — were those your lucky charm?
13054,"I love my gold Chucks, but at first, when I was on the bottom wearing them, I was like, ‘Oh my god, these are bad luck. That’s what I get for not wearing black clogs, Danskos, like I always wear in the kitchen. So I switched to my Adidas. And then it’s not like I was necessarily doing much better, so I was like, at least I can wear the shoes I want."
13055,"“Top Chef” filming wrapped up in June. Besides the pop-up, what have you been up to?"
13056,"On a personal note, I got engaged, [started] planning a wedding. My fiance and I bought a place [near Mount Morris Park] so we recently moved — recently as in this past week."
13057,"And that restaurant you talked about opening in New York City on the show — is that still in development, too?"
13058,"With everything going on right now, I’d rather not be tied to one solid brick-and-mortar location, so I’m doing the pop-up series so I can have a little more flexibility to travel and do more events. It’s easier to not be tied to an opening of a restaurant right now. I’ll still be doing it in the future."

It’s really a restaurant quality range in my house, which makes cooking easy and fun because I get to cook with the same power at home and don’t have to adjust much. I have a 36-inch RNB with a charbroiler option and got to customize it in my favorite color. It’s pretty amazing. If you’re a serious cook, definitely invest in some great equipment."

13098,Need to find a nearby happy hour or want to track your favorite food truck? There's an app for it.

13100,"In 2019, virtually everything a modern New Yorker might need can be found on that handy, little device in all of our pockets. Whether you’re trying to find the nearest Citi Bike docking station or need to schedule a fake call to get you out of a bad date, there’s an app for it. So, it should come as no surprise that there is an expansive list of apps centered on food — and we’re not even talking about the seemingly endless number of delivery services."
13101, Here are the top five apps that every New York foodie should have on their phone.
13102,"Why is it that in New York, we’re constantly inundated with restaurant recommendations and reviews, but when it comes down to actually finding a place to eat on a Saturday night, it feels like the hardest task in the world? Most of us have a slew of scribblings in the Notes section or Google Keep  on our phones and far too many screenshots of Instagram posts and Infatuation guides to count. Yet when a friend or family member asks that fateful question — “so where should we eat?” — the last thing we want to do is sort through this disorganized mess. That’s where SALT (iOS only, Android waiting list)  comes in."
13103,"The free mobile app, which helps users bookmark, organize and share their favorite eateries, bars and coffee shops, has been an open secret among gourmands since its 2016 launch. SALT has an easy-to-use interface and lets you create sub-lists (e.g. “Favorite Brooklyn Spots” or “Places to Take the Parents”) and add photos of a certain dish you loved or notes about what time to go to avoid a wait. The app also lets you view a restaurant’s menu, make a reservation through OpenTable when applicable, and even allows you to request an Uber to any of your saved locations. And if you want to upload the entries from your existing hit list but don’t want to spend hours manually searching for each, SALT has you covered. Import any list of spots you have saved on a notes app or in a spreadsheet, and SALT will automatically add them to your saved places."
13104,"Whether you find yourself lost in New York’s wide-ranging and intimidating dining scene, not knowing whose recommendations to trust or where to begin, or you’re simply tired of going to the same old places and on the hunt for something new, ChefsFeed (iOS) has you covered. The free app serves as a restaurant recommendation and discovery hub that strays from the traditional suggestion algorithms employed by OpenTable and the like but remains more personalized than a Grub Street or Goop guide."
13105,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
13106,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
13107,"In lieu of one-size-fits-all recommendations, ChefsFeed capitalizes on the credibility and clout of leading professional chefs to help New Yorkers discover new spots in a social media-type network. The app provides in-depth reviews (both in written and video form) and insights on cuisines, neighborhoods and food trends that allow users to get an idea of what industry experts think of a restaurant rather than combing through the anonymous comments that appear on other recommendation apps and websites. ChefsFeed boasts a slew of featured experts, guides for every major city on earth, an ever-growing list of long-form stories that highlight an individual chef, restaurant, or type of cuisine, and a map section that allows you to see the best restaurants and bars nearby. Basically, this app is your key to the inner workings of the minds of New York’s most accomplished foodies."
13108,"If SALT is the quintessential restaurant tracking app and ChefsFeed is the ultimate discovery app, Popcity is their love child. For the Popcity app, (iOS)which launched just a few months ago, it’s really all about the map. “Maps have a history of being a somewhat boring utility,” says Luiggi Pera, Popcity’s founder and CEO. “We wanted to change that perception.”"
13109,"The app allows users to map any food photos they find on social media outlets like Instagram or on the Popcity discovery channel. Using Instagram’s photo copy link feature, you can immediately import a post of JG Melon’s juicy burger or Beyond Sushi’s latest roll to your Popcity map and bypass the disorganized screenshotting or “Save to” processes. The new app also features a “Browse” section that, based on your liked tags, offers a Pinterest-type display of food photos and conveniently tells you how far away each is from your current location. Finally, Popcity will send you a notification any time you’re near one of your mapped restaurants, so even if it wasn’t in the day’s plan, you never miss an opportunity to try a spot you’ve been eyeballing."
13110,"“With Popcity, you are no longer asking the reactive question of ‘Where should we eat tonight?’,” Pera adds, “but instead proactively saying, ‘Let me check my Popcity Map for that awesome taco joint I found the other day.’ ”"
13111,"Just 20 years ago, the very idea of buying food out of a truck that wasn’t ice cream would have shocked the masses. But in 2019, alongside self-driving cars and phones that unlock via facial recognition, food trucks are  becoming commonplace. Indeed, some of the best meals in New York can be found through a truck window, yet tracking their whereabouts — which typically involves scouring the vehicle's social media for recent postings — remains tricky. That’s where Roaming Hunger comes in."
13112,"Launched in 2011, Roaming Hunger (iOS, Android) allows you to track specific food trucks, which users can save to “Favorites,” and discover others that are nearby. Roaming Hunger even offers a booking option, through which you can hire gourmet food trucks to cater your next event."
13113,"It’s nearing 5 o’clock, and you’re about to call it a day before meeting your closest friends for happy hour. Suddenly, your phone starts buzzing, as texts to your group chat pour in — “Where are we going?” “How about this place?” “Do they even do Happy Hour?” It’s questions like these that really do take the ‘happy’ right out of happy hour, and yet we’ve all either asked or received them."
13114,"Enter Happy Hour Monster,  (iOS, Android) an app that points you in the direction of your closest happy hours, trivia nights and boozy brunches. Using your current location, you will soon be met with long lists of nearby bars and restaurants that boast each offering. And if it’s not nearby that you’re searching for, simply use the map to look at spots across the city, saving your favorite options as you go. Happy Hour Monster will give you the rundown on each place, including its hours and menu, and the app will even let you request an Uber to your selected restaurant."

In recent years, it's welcomed casual gastropubs serving bar food a cut above, like The Lowery Bar & Kitchen and The Dog and Duck. Stop in at the latter for typical plates (mussels and fries, roasted chicken) or Irish-inspired plates and sides (including shepherd's pie and colcannon, a traditional mix of mashed potatoes and cabbage). Craft beers run the gamut from local to European. You can even order a bottle of Crabbie's, a Scottish alcoholic ginger beer, while you're there.

13125,"Sawdust-covered wooden floors, a fireplace and brick walls exude a no-frills vibe at this Gramercy Park pub. Opened in 1960, Molly's Shebeen dates back to 1895 when it started out as a grocery. Epicurean purists will delight in menu options like Irish lamb stew (with chunks of meat, veggies and potatoes) and corned beef and cabbage. And there's no question about it: a pint of Guinness, or ""the blonde in the black dress,"" is in order here. (287 Third Ave., Manhattan, 212-889-3361, mollyshebeen.com)"
13126,"The name of this Irish outpost with views of the George Washington Bridge comes from untranslatable Gaelic, roughly meaning ""together."" The Washington Heights area was once home to a large Irish community, the remnants of which are still alive and well at Le Chéile.

It's part-sports bar, part-Irish Epcot: the original Tír Na Nóg boasts 16 TVs for watching both kinds of football in the company of stained glass windows and a recreation of an ah fulacht fiadh, a cooking pit used by the ancient Irish. Coming with a large party? Book one of the spaces decorated like an Old World cottage or a church chapel, and order as many pitchers of draft beers and plates of ale-battered fish and chips as it takes to make you think you're on the other side of the Atlantic.

13129,"At the forefront of Clinton Hill's food scene renaissance stands this homey Irish café. The locally sourced menu is small and focused. Fare includes: Irish soda bread (a.k.a, the Irish scone) baked daily; small bites like local radishes with Irish butter and sea salt; heartier entrees like the grass-fed beef, roast vegetable and Guinness stew; and surprising sides (for example, red cabbage salad with golden beets, herbs and yogurt). To drink you have your pick of wine, craft beers on draft and cocktails. Stop in for live Irish music every Monday night at 8:30. (Hartley's, 14 Putnam Ave., 347-799-2877, hartleysnyc.com)"
13130,"Tuck yourself into this downtown hideaway -- literally. The first-floor taproom at Dead Rabbit is a cozy space nestled onto a small street just steps from the East River. Founded by two Irishmen who wanted to mix the time-tested Irish pub with contemporary charm, Dead Rabbit has received much buzz for its innovative cocktail offerings. (It was named the World's Best Bar in 2016.) Take your time perusing the drinks menu, presented in comic book format, and order a plate of beer-battered cod chips, complete with mushy peas and tartar sauce. Come on Sundays after 6 p.m., and you'll be treated to a traditional Irish jam session, or seisiún. (30 Water St., Manhattan, 646-422-7906, deadrabbitnyc.com)"

The wood and stained glass windows inside were actually shipped all the way from a monastery chapel in Cork, Ireland, dating back to the late 19th century. There's a whole grab-bag of cuisines represented on the menu, but our eyes are drawn to the four mac-and-cheese options (including Philly cheese steak and lobster). If you're looking for something more traditional, try the bangers (grilled Irish sausages) and mash (pictured) or the Guinness-braised short ribs.

Joyce's Tavern is a local Eltingville institution where neighbors gather to mingle, listen to live music and sip the signature drink. (That's an Irish coffee topped with housemade whipped cream and a drizzle of green creme de menthe.) On St. Paddy's Day proper, owners, the O'Toole family, are hosting a party with Irish music and a full Irish menu. That includes some unusual reuben egg rolls and the pub's famous corned beef platter. (3823 Richmond Ave., Staten Island, 718-948-0220, joycestavern.com)"

	  Eel will range from $29 to $39 at Unagi.       Photo Credit: Unagi     "
13246,"At the new Japanese restaurant Unagi, nearly everything has been imported from Japan, from the signage to the grill to the green tea to the eels."
13247,"To owner Samuel Pierce’s knowledge, the NoLIta restaurant is the first freshwater eel restaurant in the United States to source live eels from Japan (he checks customs)."
13248,"When Unagi — named after the grilled eel dish — opens Saturday, a 1,000-gallon eel tank will be the centerpiece. Customers will be able to watch the fish get prepared on a charcoal grill from the open kitchen, helmed by chef Hiroki Fukushima, who has trained in Japan and is a veteran of Gayjumaru."
13249,"Unagi is a very popular specialty in Japan — that’s where Pierce, a practicing lawyer, first had it on a business trip."
13250,"“When I first started traveling to Japan, I fell completely in love with eating eel,” the Upper East Side resident says. “We really want to introduce it to New Yorkers at large. It’s just the most delicious, healthy, satisfying food there is in the entire world. I’m convinced of that.”"
13251,"New York is on something of an unagi kick; Hachibei, another all-eel restaurant, opened last month in midtown."
13252,"amNewYork spoke to Pierce, 31, about unagi and his restaurant, located at 60 Kenmare St."
13253,"For people who aren’t familiar, what is unagi?"
13254,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
13255,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
13256,"Unagi is freshwater eel. In Japan, they never serve freshwater fish at sushi restaurants. Sushi restaurants are only marine fish. And freshwater fish, you generally don’t want to eat them raw. But when they’re cooked they’re great. The traditional way of preparing unagi is keeping them live in the restaurant, and then you actually cut their head off. The head keeps moving even after it’s been cut off from the body. So it’s really, really fresh in our restaurant. We take the eel fresh out of the tank for each customer, cut it up and then we grill it on top of ancient Japanese oak charcoal. Customers at our restaurant have a number of options for how they want their eel presented. We have a sweet soy sauce that we can put on the eel. They can just have it plain. We have some really nice rice that we also imported from Japan, and so you can have your eel on top of rice. We serve a couple other things on the side, like the liver. Some people find it very delicious. And pickles is another thing that’s traditional to have with eel, so we’ll serve that as well. You can put wasabi on it too, some people like to do that."
13257,Do you see anyone being squeamish about eating it?
13258,"I think when you see it on the plate, it’s not something that makes you squeamish; it doesn’t have a head on it or anything like that. The fact that the slaughter station and all that, some people might get a little squeamish over that. But I think most people will find it intriguing. There’s huge international interest in the eel business, like the ecology of the eels is completely mysterious. It has a really interesting life cycle. They live in rivers and when they breed, they take a trip down to the ocean, they lay their eggs and then they die. It’s a very mysterious life cycle, and there’s all kinds of protections in place worldwide so that fishermen don’t take the eels that are swimming down to breed so that the stocks can replenish themselves and we don’t wipe them out."
13259,"Overall, what kind of availability did you see here for getting this once you tried to seek it out more?"
13260,"Historically in America, a lot of Japanese restaurants have embraced the fusion concept. So they serve a lot of different things — some Western dishes, an amalgamation of Japanese dishes. A lot of restaurants serve eel on rice, or they serve unagi sushi, which in Japan is very nontraditional. But it’s completely different from what we’re doing. All those restaurants are importing frozen patties. I’m watching customs, all the imports of eel from Japan, we’re the only ones doing it. Or at least the only ones declaring it to customs.  "
13261,It seems in general that there’s a lot of interest in Japanese food and cocktails. Japan Village in Industry City recently opened.
13262,"The Japanese food scene is just so popular. The other thing that we’re trying to do is keep our prices really low. We don’t want to price anybody out of the market. We want to give everybody a chance to try it, no matter what your income is, at least on occasion. You can have a whole eel or we’ll split it up into half an eel. For half an eel we will charge $29, and for a whole eel we’ll charge $39. Even by standards in Japan that’s a really good price."
13263,"Do you see, given the concerns about depleting eel, and it seems like such a specialized thing to do here, do you see this being something that can scale or open more locations?"
13264,"Yeah, we definitely do. We will definitely look and see where else in New York City our customers are coming from and try and open more locations. And definitely going to look at maybe Las Vegas, which I also think will be a really nice fit for this because it’s a show, a spectacle a little bit. We’re definitely thinking expansion. As far as the availability of eels, we’re lucky in that we have a really great relationship with our wholesaler, they’re going to be able to supply us eels. On a more macro level, there’s a lot of research being done into the eel life cycle. For long-term sustainability, I do think that there’s going to need to be technological advances for the world as a whole to increase its consumption. But as far as our restaurant and a couple more locations for us, I don’t see supply constraints playing a major role. We hope that by opening this restaurant it’s really going to increase New Yorkers’ and Americans’ more generally, their understanding of eel and the environmental issues involved and hopefully that’s going to galvanize more support for investment in technology and improved methodologies for harvesting in a sustainable way. There’s tens of thousands of these restaurants in Japan, a couple of ours certainly are not going to be a major data point in the total world consumption of eel."

13375,"For Leah Koenig, Jewish holidays are all about the “showstoppers” on the table."
13376,"“There’s everyday Jewish food, and then there’s the holidays,” she says. “That’s the time we are having these symbolic, ritual, family-centered meals. They have a lot of memory and just good feelings attached to them.”"
13377,"And “Little Book of Jewish Feasts” — the second book in her Jewish food trilogy (her first, on appetizers, came out last year, and the third, on dessert, is due out next year) — is all about the showstoppers."
13378,"Like “Modern Jewish Cooking,” her first cookbook, they take a global approach. "
13379,"“These books are meant to be really highly curated tastes of different aspects of Jewish cuisine,” Koenig says."
13380,"A recipe from the “Feasts” cookbook that Koenig plans to make for Rosh Hashanah this year is the vegetable tagine, a Moroccan dish that has seven different vegetables that represent the Jewish calendar’s seventh month, during which the holiday falls. "
13381,"“Each of the vegetables in it has some kind of symbolic meaning,” says the Kensington resident, who’s a fan of nearby 24-hour produce markets like Three Guys from Brooklyn and Circus Fruits. “It’s pretty cool that you’re basically eating food symbols.”"
13382,"Flavor-wise, the spiced dish isn’t too powerful, but has a “wonderful mix of warming spices, like cinnamon and cumin,” says Koenig, who likes to load up on spices at Kalustyan’s in Kips Bay. “It has this complex palate of flavors.”"

13385,Golden raisins add sweetness — another symbolic holiday staple — and chickpeas some hearty protein.

13395,"2. Heat the oil in a medium saucepan set over medium-high heat. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened and lightly browned, 7-10 minutes. Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 3-5 minutes. Add the garlic, cinnamon, paprika, ginger, turmeric, cumin, coriander, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 1-2 minutes."
13396,"3. Add the chickpeas, zucchini, butternut squash, carrots, raisins, stock, 1 tsp. salt, and a generous amount of pepper and bring the mixture to a simmer. Turn the heat to low, cover the pot and cook until the squash and carrots are tender, about 20 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens slightly, about 10 minutes. It will still be somewhat liquidy, but should more closely resemble a stew than a soup. Taste and add more salt, if desired. Serve hot, sprinkled with parsley and almonds. Store leftovers, covered, in the fridge for up to 5 days."

13434,"There was once a time in the not so distant past when a meal out had to include steak, fish or spaghetti carbonara. Even ordering chicken at a restaurant was considered silly, with that little voice in your head saying, ""I can make this at home."" Even ""healthy"" eaters wouldn't consider a dish a meal unless it included animal protein or pasta swimming in cream sauce."
13435,But times are changing. Chickens are haute (chickens for two even more so) and vegetables have moved from obligatory side dish to main event.
13436,"Welcome to the era of the vegetable tasting menu. While Per Se has been doing one for years, at $310 per person it's an experience out of the realm of possibility for most. But now there are a number of more affordable but equally adventurous restaurants that are going all veg everything."
13437,"Chef Alfred Portale of Gotham Bar and Grill in Union Square has always placed an emphasis on vegetables at his restaurant. In fact, he was one of the first chefs to pioneer the farm-to-table movement by championing the farmers at the Union Square Greenmarket and serving their produce on his menus."
13438,"Portale has served his Greenmarket to Gotham vegetarian prix fixe lunch menu for years, but recently, after many requests, decided the time had come to offer something similar at dinner."
13439,"""It's the way I like to eat and how people nowadays like to eat,"" he said."
13440,"Like Portale, chefs across the city are also noticing the shift in diner preference. New vegetarian tasting menus are also available at ACME in the Village, Take Root in Carroll Gardens and Juni in Flatiron."
13441,"Take Root's vegetable tasting menu was first offered at the tiny 12-seat eatery just a few weeks ago. It was so popular that owners Elise Kornack and Anna Hieronimus planned another set of dinners to be offered next weekend, August 21 -23. They are also sold out."

13444,"Based on how popular the dinners are, Take Root is considering doing vegetable tastings monthly or bi-monthly with the eventual goal to be a vegetable tasting alongside the standard tasting menu that is normally offered."
13445,"Vegetables are both healthy and trendy, but why are chefs so excited to cook with them? According to Portale, there are two reasons: produce is varied and delicious and modern techniques - like sous vide (French cooking technique where food is sealed in airtight plastic bags and cooked in a water bath) and compression - are more widely available to chefs."
13446,"""The quality of the ingredients is much greater now, and that's more than half the battle,"" he said. ""Looking at the market, there's a huge amount of products to work with, endless combinations."""

13464,24 food trucks nominated for awards shared samplings from their menus with the sold-out crowd.

13468,Other awards went to reigning champion Calexico for the Masters Cup; Ice & Vice for Best Dessert; and maple-syrup themed Snowday for Rookie of the Year.

13547,Five finalists will compete to determine the city’s best street food vendor in the 14th annual Vendy Awards on Saturday at Governor’s Island. 
13548,"“I’m in awe of these competitors,” said Mohamed Attia, new co-director of the Street Vendor Project. “Their food is delicious, but let’s also think about their many years of service to the community.”"
13549,"Each vendor must prepare a menu and compete in a cook-off, where food fanatics and judges will sample foods from each. "
13550,The Vendy Cup winner will then be awarded by a cadre of food experts.
13551,These are the finalists:
13552,Burmese Bites
13553,"Myo Lin Thway introduced what’s believed to be the first Burmese food cart in New York City four years ago. One of his most popular dishes is palata, a flaky flatbread either served plain with chicken curry, or filled with ground meat. "

13558,Franky’s Souvlaki 
13559,"The Astoria-based family street food business began operating almost 50 years ago, and still stands strong on the same corner at 31st and Steinway avenues. "
13560,"“I was born into the business and continue the legacy,” said Franky Englezos. “My father started selling hot dogs in 1970 and became popular in the ’80s when we began serving the community souvlaki.”"
13561,"Aside from souvlaki, the cart also serves gyros and other Greek favorites. Customers have commented that “flavor is there, the tenderness is there — it’s real Greek souvlaki.”"
13562,Jiannetto’s Pizza & Catering
13563,"Native Staten Islander Joe Jiannetto grew up working in and out of pizzerias before opening his own pizza and catering truck in 1998. The truck is known for its Sicilian-style grandma slices, where cheese is melted into the crust before going into the oven. Customers have raved about the sauce being “unbelievable,” as well as the way the pizza is made, with sauce on top. "
13564,"“We have one of the best pizza trucks in New York,” said Jiannetto. “Not many can compete with us and none do a Sicilian pie like us.”"
13565,"New Yorkers can find the pizza and catering truck on 47th Street, between Park and Madison avenues, where they also serve a variety of rolls, pasta and calzones. "
13566,El Saboroso de Aracataca
13567,The push cart owned by Colombian immigrant Luis Alfonso Marin Valencia has been running for nearly 30 years in the Jackson Heights community. Its most notable item on the menu is arepas con queso. 
13568,"“People like the arepas with cheese and chocolo (sweet corn), but especially like the cheese,” said Valencia. "
13569,"The cart is located on Roosevelt Avenue and 80th Street, which only runs Friday to Sunday, beginning at 10 p.m."
13570,Royal Grill Halal Food
13571,"Royal Grill Halal Food is a husband and wife food cart, that has been operating for more than 10 years, seven days a week. The truck is known for its specialties such as chicken tikka masala and biryani, with a unique blend of spices, which MD Alam, owner of the cart, says is “prepared with love.”"
13572,"The cart is set up at 44th Street and Sixth Avenue, and often is seen with lines that stretch down Fifth Avenue, filled with new and longtime customers. "
13573,"Other categories in the Vendy Awards include Best Rookie Vendor for the best new cart or truck, Best Market Vendor, which recognizes the best from the city’s eclectic food markets, and Best Dessert Vendor. Best Breakfast Vendor is a new category this year."

13598,"It’s a well-established irony that a plentiful, local protein - venison, from North American white-tailed deer - is not a viable source of food. Regulations prevent hunted animals to be sold to consumers, either at restaurants or in stores, because there is no screening process to ensure standards and safety."
13599,"But venison is lean and flavorful and there is an alternative to meat from deer killed in the wild, one that is sustainable and growing in popularity: farm-raised deer."
13600,"In New York City, chefs are seeing increased interest in venison. Meat purveyors like D’Artagnan and DeBragga are filling more restaurant orders and supplying more grocery stores and markets with it. Consumers’ tastes are changing, they say."
13601,"At The Musket Room, Chef Matt Lambert’s restaurant that opened two years ago (and won a Michelin star after just four months of opening), venison is on the menu year-round. Lambert is not a surprising chef to have wholeheartedly embraced venison. He’s a native of New Zealand, which is where most venison sold in America is raised and slaughtered."
13602,"“[Venison] is not a commodity meat that everyone’s used to eating,” he said. “It’s not very common.”"
13603,"Still, the appetite for uncommon foods is growing in New York City, he said, and his “Red Deer with Flavors of Gin” has become so popular, it’s a signature dish."
13604,"At Gotham Bar & Grill, Chef Alfred Portale has been serving venison for 20 years, but has seen increased interest in the lean protein in recent years."
13605,"Editors' picks of our best stories, right to your inbox."
13606,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
13607,"“We’ve always had a lot of interest because we’re one of the few restaurants that offer it, but … there is an uptick in popularity,” he said. “I think the public is continually becoming more and more sophisticated in their dining choices.”"
13608,"Farm-raised venison is a lean, healthy protein without much fat but still features a lot of flavor, chef’s said. Farm-raised deer are generally the red deer variety, and differ slightly from the white-tailed variety typically seen in the North American wild. The flavor is less gamey than wild deer."
13609,"“It is much more approachable than other game meats, with a similar profile to beef,” said Lambert."
13610,"Chef Dave Santos of Louro is also a cheerleader for venison. He likes it so much he tries to put it on the menu year-round. Venison is considered a fall/winter item because that’s when American hunting season is, but New Zealand venison is raised year-round thanks to a temperate climate, and is thus available year-round."
13611,"“It’s an uphill battle to get people to eat it outside of that season,” said Santos. “In the summer I’ll do venison tartare or carpaccio, to break people’s mentality behind it.”"
13612,"Despite the tendency to only eat venison in a specific season, sales are up."
13613,"Ariane Daguin, CEO and co-founder of D’Artagnan, has been distributing venison since the company was founded 30 years ago. D’Artagnan sources venison from Cervena, a consortium of deer farmers in New Zealand. Once the farmers teamed up, she said, a consistent stream of quality product was available for distribution - and that was when sale of venison really picked up. A rack of Venison ribs is about $86.99 and 2 pounds of venison strip steak is about $60."
13614,"“In the restaurant industry sales have picked up in the past ten years and in the retail world it’s much more recent,” she said. “In the past two to three years we’ve been starting to sell successfully to more supermarkets and not just those very high-end gourmet grocers.”"
13615,"D’Artagnan expects a 25% increase in U.S.sales for this calendar year. In 2013, the company sold 105,000 pounds of venison: a 22% increase over 2012. The company projects they will sell 135,000-140,000 in 2014."
13616,"George Faison, partner and Chief Operating Officer of DeBragga meat purveyors (and co-founder of D'Artagnan with Daguin) also said venison sales were growing."
13617,"And in addition to venison from New Zealand, Faison is now sourcing domestic venison from a farm in Iowa called Bur Oaks. It is the first deer farm in the United States that is producing venison in high numbers that he can sell."
13618,All the racks from this year’s crop of 120 animals at Bur Oaks are going to Portale at Gotham Bar & Grill. But that’s it for the year.
13619,Faison says the taste is fresher than that of New Zealand Cervena venison.
13620,"“He [Portale] wanted something that was truly special,” he said. “It’s an opportunity. It costs more to produce because it’s a smaller herd and the processing costs are higher, but people who enjoy the flavor, they’ll see.”"
13621,"But while demand is growing, there are challenges to farming domestic deer. The herds need space and also facilities to slaughter and process the animals. Venison need about as much space as cattle on pasture, and require high fencing. At Bur Oaks, everything is done on site, but the number of animals is limited."
13622,"“New Zealand is the only source where you can have a constant supply in consistent quality,” said Daguin."
13623,"Faison says he hopes that will change, and with the increased demand, it seems, at the very least, to be a possibility."

13664,"Sean Berthiaume, a co-owner of Vinnie's, invented the Pizza Box Pizza on Wednesday, during a slow period at the shop. ""It was a little slow at work, and when it gets like that, I like to experiment with stuff and make new things,"" he said.  "
13665,"The inspiration: Customers who order a whole pie at Vinnie's, ask for a box, sit down, eat the entire pizza and ""just throw away the box."" "
13666,"In an effort to reduce waste, Berthiaume created a pizza box as delicious as the contents itself."
13667,"After two or three tries, he had developed the perfect Pizza Box Pizza. "
13668,"""The hardest part was the lid of the box, he said, ""That needs to be stiff to be able to open and it can’t have cheese or sauce on it or that will drip."" "

13671,The solution: The top layer is a stretched out square of dough coated in oil and garlic and baked until crispy -- perfect for dipping into pizza sauce. 
13672,"Rather than tasting his creation, Berthiaume decided to keep it to display in the store, but he assures that ""it tastes good . . . It’s just pizza, it’s got to be good!"" "
13673,"A photo of the Pizza Box Pizza was posted to Twitter Wednesday night and it became an overnight sensation, with plenty of people calling Vinnie's to order it. Berthiaume didn't realize it would be as popular until he woke up on Thursday morning."
13674,Due to its time-consuming nature -- it's basically three separate pizzas combined into one -- orders for the $40 Pizza Box Pizza should be placed a couple hours in advance. 
13675,"And nobody puts Pizza Box Pizza in a box. Berthiaume explained that those who want delivery will get the special order wrapped in foil, which keeps it hot and protects it from human hands, keeping it sanitary and delicious.  "

13706,"At the latest restaurant from the Emily team, you won’t find any of its signature white pizzas, Detroit-style square pies or Instagram-favorite Emmy Burger on the menu."
13707,"Violet, slated to open Thursday in the East Village, pays homage to Rhode Island, from the name (the state flower) to the menu’s grilled pizza and seafood."
13708,"“I kind of wanted to be slightly different than Emily and Emmy Squared,” says chef and owner Matthew Hyland, who is also behind the wood-fired pizzeria and Detroit-inspired pizza spot, respectively. “We’ll have a little more refined experience, but still the same style of food that we do — we like to have fun. It’s not going to be pretentious or anything.”"
13709,"The menu does include pizza, but of the grilled variety, inspired by the iconic Italian restaurant Al Forno in Providence, which Hyland frequented while attending Roger Williams University."
13710,"“Al Forno is my favorite pizza out there, I think it’s the best pizza there is,” Hyland says. “I kind of want to do an homage to that and not drive four hours to Providence every time I want it.”"
13711,"At Violet, that means thin, unevenly shaped pies that are grilled over a hybrid gas-wood grill and lightly topped with ingredients like grilled winter squash, broccoli and pistachio pesto, clams, roasted garlic pickle and tahini duxelles. Scissors are served for cutting slices, in a departure from the Al Forno experience."
13712,"“It’s definitely influenced by but not strictly adherent,” Hyland says. “The same way we do Detroit pizza — I’m not looking to do a restaurant that’s just Detroit food. I’m not trying to make a Rhode Island restaurant or a Detroit restaurant. These are the things that I like that are inspired by these dishes.”"
13713,"Those influences can be seen beyond the grilled pizza to the menu’s small plates, which is heavy on seafood, from the clam “stuffies” with linguiça, pretzel stuffing and uni to a play on fish and chips called Fish & Chicks. A homemade pasta section includes spaghetti and clams and, in another homage to Al Forno, a baked fusilli with vodka sauce."
13714,"More global influences can be seen throughout the menu, from the grilled shrimp with Calabrian Sichuan butter to the Portuguese malasadas for dessert."
13715,"“We’re not trying to get super hard-core nerdy Rhode Island,” Hyland says. “We’ll bring some ingredients in. But we’re just trying to have fun with it.”"
13716,"Beverages include cocktails, beer and wine, the latter curated by Pizza Loves Emily partner Emily Hyland. The 51-seat space features a four-seat chef’s counter at the open kitchen."
13717,"This is the sixth restaurant from the Pizza Loves Emily Group in five years. Since opening its Clinton Hill hot spot Emily in 2014, it has since added an outpost in the West Village. Its Detroit-style pizza spinoff Emmy Squared has locations in Williamsburg, the East Village and Nashville. This past fall, the team had another milestone, with the publication of its first cookbook, “Emily.”"

13760,"Chef Dan Barber’s March pop-up, WastED, converts his upscale downtown restaurant into a dining room serving small plates of food scraps. The concept may sound like something out of Portlandia, but the execution is far from fictional cable TV."
13761,"Reservations have been hard to come by in this month-long pop-up, each night featuring a different celebrity chef eager to plate a creation made from seemingly unusable snippets and oddments of food: lobster legs (Daniel Humm) and fluke trim (April Bloomfield). "
13762,"But if you can get in before the restaurant disappears on March 31st – add your name to the online waitlist or try for one of the coveted but not impossible to score walk-in seats, WastED offers a totally unique dinner experience that (hopefully) won’t leave you hung over."
13763,"The WastED menu is split up into five sections: salads, soups, grains, meats and desserts (with some flexibility in the categories), with each item priced at $15.  Servers recommend selecting one item per category per person, for a total of 5-6 dishes each, but unless you’re totally famished, you can probably get away with fewer dishes."
13764,"Every meal at WastED starts with a pouring of the candle, made from edible beef tallow, mixed with rosemary and a side of whipped lardo, into which diners can dip spent grain (previously used to brew beer) bread."
13765,"From there, the concoctions get more creative. A dumpster dive vegetable salad is made from bruised apples and pears and served with whipped chickpea water – yes, that’s the extra liquid that comes from a can of chickpeas.  "

13770,"While sustainability may ignite thoughts of vegetarianism or veganism from many, most of WastED’s menu items use animal products in a thoughtful way. ‘Dog Food’ uses dairy cows, not usually processed for human consumption in a flavorful meatloaf, served with delicately riced ‘unfit’ potatoes and gravy.  A juice pulp cheeseburger fits a patty of spicy leftover juice pulp between repurposed Balthazar buns and a side of bruised beet ketchup with pickle butts."

13795,There is perhaps nothing greater than a boozy brunch in New York City. You can indulge in your favorite sweet or savory dishes while drowning your ambitious New Year's resolutions in unlimited cocktails — all the while knowing that your DD (Uber) is just a click away.
13796,"Recently, Crown (24 E. 81st St.) began offering a ""Bubbly Jazz Brunch,"" which combines not just unlimited bellinis and mimosas with great food, but also with the soulful, funky beats of the Mimi Jones Band. As you sway to the music (a great excuse for alcohol-induced swaying), you can chow down on ricotta pancakes with Vermont maple syrup or soft scrambled eggs with smoked sable fish."
13797,"Live music in the form of old-school hip-hop sets the scene for brunch at Sons of Essex (133 Essex St.) in the Lower East Side. Paired with all-you-can-drink mimosas are breakfast standouts like eggs ""Benedictowitz"" atop a potato pancake and smoked salmon, and hearty lunch options like Manischeweitz-braised short ribs in a sandwich called ""Sloppy Judah."""
13798,"While Pig & Khao (68 Clinton St.) has become an excellent dinner staple, I suggest trying out their brunch. Bottomless mimosas are just $15 and they're served with such items as grilled pork jowl with watermelon and corned beef hash—a welcome Asian twist on typical brunch fare."
13799,"You can also visit Preserve 24 (177 E. Houston St.), where unlimited sangria is on the menu for $24. And to keep yourself afloat throughout the meal, savor fried chicken and biscuits, a traditional L.E.S. egg sandwich topped with a fried oyster or bacon waffles served with banana ice cream. Before you black car your way home, be sure to check out Preserve's interactive and sculptural art installations for a truly unique New York boozy brunch experience."

13809,"This year’s Super Bowl may not feature any hometown teams, but those attending the big game will still be able to get a taste of the Big Apple."
13810,More than a dozen MetLife Stadium concession items created specially for the game are inspired by the city’s diverse food scene.
13811,"“New York has so many flavors and textures,” said Eric Borgia, executive chef for Delaware North Sportservice, which manages the food at MetLife Stadium. “It was important for us from the beginning to make this stadium taste like New York.”"
13812,"That means concessions that reflect the flavors of the boroughs, such as a hot corned beef hoagie and Junior’s cheesecake for Brooklyn, a Tijuana-style rice bowl for Queens, a meatball hero for the Bronx, and an artichoke and spinach pizza for Manhattan. Not on the menu, however, are any dishes that take after Staten Island, while the Jersey Shore will be represented with items that include a cheese-steak."
13813,"Overall, Borgia tends to look to trends in New York street food and comfort food for his stadium menu."
13814,"“I love finding little mom-and-pop, greasy-spoon-type places, as well as street festivals,” said Borgia. “To me, that's where a lot of great food comes from.”Borgia is also inspired by his grandmother’s Italian home cooking, and several menu items that will be served on Super Bowl Sunday are based on her recipes, including Nonna Fusco’s meatballs and jumbo rice balls."
13815,"“Growing up in an Italian household, Sunday was always the biggest food day in my family,” said the chef. “Even then it revolved around football, too.”"

13828, 
13829,Leland Estes 
13830,Clinton Hall general manager
13831,"""During Oktoberfest, we pay homage to the oldest brewery on the planet. My personal favorite, Brauerei Weihenstephaner is a Bavarian State Brewery established in 1040 by an order of the Benedictine monks. To put that into perspective, that's pre-Great Crusades, or over 1,000 years old. I've stood amongst the ancient still operating lagering cellars and it is a humbling experience. This is the quintessential example of German Hefeweizen. Perfected notes of banana, clove and spiced coriander. You're quite literally tasting history."""

13836,Paulaner brew master
13837,"""During Oktoberfest season, drink unfiltered beers, like we brew at Paulaner, which means all the vitamins and minerals from the yeast are still in the beer. Also, all types of my Paulaner beers are brewed according to the German law of purity 'Reinheitsgebot.' It's the oldest food law around the world, established 1516, and according this law I can use only four ingredients to produce beer: malt, hops, yeast and water."""
13838, 
13839,Tobias Holler 
13840,Black Forest Brooklyn co-owner
13841,"""As far as seasonal specials is concerned, throughout Oktoberfest (Sept. 20-Oct. 4) we'll be fully stocked with Hofbräu Oktoberfest kegs, a rich full-bodied beer specially brewed for the occasion, that pairs perfectly with the Bavarian food specials that will be on offer, such as schweinshaxe [pork shank], schweinebraten [pork roast] and others."""

13848,"In an effort to improve accuracy as well as address the obesity epidemic in America, the Food and Drug Administration today proposed changes to the nutitional labels on grocery items. These changes are the first in 20 years, and will potentially have a big impact on the American diet. Here's what you need to know:"
13849,"On the new label, the first thing your eye will go to will be the number of calories in a serving, making sure you know right away what you're getting into. Clearly, the FDA wants to emphasize the importance of watching th amount of calories you consume. Serving sizes will also be more listed in larger font."
13850,"In what's seen as a major win for public health, a new category for ""added sugars"" was proposed. That means that sugars that were manufactured and not naturally occuring, like corn syrup and concentrated juice, as well as white and brown sugar, will now have to be listed in its own category. Natural sugar comes from fruits. Experts have argued that added sugars have greatly contributed to high levels of obesity."
13851,"As time has passed, so have the way Americans eat -- and how much they eat. Currently, a 20-ounce soda is considered to be 2.5 servings by the Federal Food and Drug Administration, but under the new proposals it will be listed as one serving. A pint of ice cream, like those from Ben & Jerry's, Häagen-Dazs and others, will be considered two servings under the changes. Currently it is labeled as containing four servings."

13996,Great things happen in Maine.
13997,"This week, not one but two super-rare white lobsters were caught in Vacationland. According to the Portland Press Herald, albino lobsters are the rarest of the species, clocking in at one per 100 million."
13998,"In other words, the chances of two being spotted in the same area - in this case, mid-coast Maine near Owl's Head - is nothing short of either a miracle or an extreme coincidence, depending on who's talking."
13999,"Lobsterman Bert Philbrick caught a white lobster off Owls Head on Thursday, less than a week after another lobsterman, Joe Bates caught one nearby."
14000,Whether these lobsters are truly albino or not is up for debate.
14001,"Bob Bayer, executive director of the University of Maine’s Lobster Institute, said a test would be to feed the lobsters food high in carotenoids, like crab and periwinkles, which would darken the shell if they're not albino."
14002,"Albinos would stay white if cooked, Bayer said."
14003,"But neither lobster will be sold for human consumption. One is headed for Maine State Aquarium in Boothbay Harbor and the other for Brooks Trap Mill, a Thomaston supply store with a ""tank full of marine life."""

14028,"Carolyn Brown, MS, RD, nutrition expert at Foodtrainers, a nutrition and fitness company on the Upper West Side, said there are several reasons to hop on the bandwagon."
14029,"First and foremost, local foods are packed with more nutrients. The term local means produce was picked when it was in season and ripe, said Brown, and was trucked at most a few hundred miles, ending up on your table within days if not hours of leaving the farm."
14030,"""Picked when ripe means that nutrients, antioxidants and - most important to your tastebuds - flavors, have had time to develop,"" she said.

Amy Blankstein, communications manager at the non-profit Just Food, agrees.
""Because they [farmers] are not shipping their produce over long distances, local farmers tend to be harvesting their produce at the peak of freshness, when nutritional quality is also at its peak,"" she said.
Local produce often means more variety, too, Blankstein said.
""Local farmers are typically growing a greater variety and diversity of crops, and the varieties that local farmers choose to grow are valued for their flavor profile, rather than shelf life,"" she said.

Yankee Stadium is packed with out-of-the-Cracker-Jack-box food options, from logo waffles and egg creams to bacon-stuffed grilled cheese sandwiches. Plus, there are plenty of new eats making their debut this season.
2019 highlights: a burrata-topped burger, vegan guacamole bites, a crispy maple chicken sandwich and more.
Matt Gibson, the senior executive chef for Yankee Stadium, knows that not all of the tens of thousands who attend ballgames throughout the spring and summer are going to be happy with just a hot dog.
""The days of a captive audience at a stadium are done,"" Gibson told reporters at Wednesday's tasting event at the stadium, ""and we truly embrace it.""
Variety is key for modern fans, and Gibson is confident those in the Bronx will appreciate the work he and his team have done to enhance the experience. Local vendors City Winery and Big Mozz, both of which debuted in the stadium last August, are back for their first Opening Day (March 28, when the Baltimore Orioles come to town).
Big Mozz is among the options available for vegetarian diets, and Gibson insists there's plenty available for all.
""If you're a normal ballpark fare-goer, we have that,"" Gibson said. ""We also have vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free [and] kosher. Our goal is for every fan to enjoy themselves.""

14168,PLOT The story of the deadly attack on the American embassy in Libya in 2012.
14169,"CAST John Krasinski, James Badge Dale, Pablo Schreiber"
14170,RATED R (extreme violence)
14171,LENGTH 2:17
14172,PLAYING AT Area theaters
14173,BOTTOM LINE Michael Bay’s militant action film is technically proficient and politically simplistic.
14174,"Depending on your political affiliation, the release of “13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” a dramatized version of the deadly 2012 attack that killed a U.S. ambassador in Libya, could be cause for concern or celebration. The attack became highly politicized and remains a sore spot for then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, now a Democratic presidential candidate. With November looming and a Congressional investigation into Benghazi underway, could “13 Hours” be the January surprise that damages the Clinton campaign?"
14175,"“13 Hours” is based on the book by Mitchell Zuckoff and directed by Michael Bay, whose big-budget, pro-military blockbusters (“Armageddon,” “Transformers”) are typically more pandering than political. It stars John Krasinski as an empathetic Jack Silva and James Badge Dale as grizzled veteran Tyrone “Rone” Woods, part of an ex-military security team hired to guard a CIA compound. These soldiers are pressed into action when well-armed militants — whose nature and origin remain controversial — attack the residence of U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens (Matt Letscher) and then, chillingly, the compound itself."
14176,"This murky and tragic affair seems an odd choice of subject matter for Bay, who normally stages human-versus-alien battles. Here, Bay’s action sequences are as riveting and technically beautiful as ever, but his reductive worldview is also on display. “13 Hours” doesn’t just lionize its American soldiers, it oozes disdain for everyone else. That includes puffed-up bureaucrats, prissy British guys, Yale-educated bozos in Washington and women who don’t know their place. “Put on your headscarf,” one American soldier yells, without irony, at a mouthy European played by Alexia Barlier. As for the Libyans, they’re mostly a bunch of blood bags who explode when shot."
14177,"Though “13 Hours” never names Clinton, it clearly believes that mistakes were made and that the attack — despite initial claims from the Obama administration — was premeditated and organized. The film’s main message, though, seems to be that Libya isn’t worth the rubble in its streets and that Americans died there for no reason. Pablo Schreiber, as exasperated soldier Kris Paronto, tells a local interpreter, “Your country’s gotta figure this out.” In this movie’s opinion, it’s that simple."

14197,Jessica Williams (former “The Daily Show” correspondent) and Phoebe Robinson (“You Can’t Touch My Hair” author) are bringing their hit comedy podcast “2 Dope Queens” to HBO with four hourlong specials.
14198,"The audio-to-video adaptation of the show is seamless, with the material as sharp, socially relevant and downright hilarious as ever. Like the podcast, the show includes a free flowing discussion between the two hosts, short stand-up sets from a diverse group of up-and-coming comics and interviews with special all-star guests."
14199,"Here's what you should know about the specials, the first of which premiered on HBO at 11:30 p.m. Friday:"
14200,1. ‘2 Dope Queens’ is quintessential New York
14201,"Not only do the hosts live and work in New York, and feature many local comics, but the city is a central component in every episode. Filmed at Brooklyn’s historic Kings Theatre, with a set that looks like a rooftop deck, the city is never far from the conversation. Whether they’re talking great pizza, subway perverts, or terrible first apartments — it’s all NYC."
14202,2. Don’t skip the beginning banter
14203,"Unlike some other stand-up showcases, the hosts are not just there to introduce the acts and fill up dead-air time. The dope queens, Robinson and Williams, are truly the main draw. The friends on and off the stage, are a tour de force as a comedy duo. They turn conversations about even the most mundane aspects of their lives into laugh-riots covering everything from their white boyfriends to their hair journeys."
14204,3. The director is also an impressive comedian

In addition to her groundbreaking Grammy-nominated special “Live,” which was recorded during a set she did right after she was diagnosed with cancer, Notaro also created and starred in the Amazon series “One Mississippi.”"
14208,4. Many of the featured stand-ups are local gems
14209,"If you see a comic on the show, or hear one on the podcast, that really speaks to your sense of humor, you’re in luck: many of the comedians live in New York and perform frequently in Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. Among the featured talent in the specials, Aparna Nancherla, Michelle Buteau, and Kevin Barnett can all be seen frequently in local venues like Union Hall, The Creek & the Cave, and Littlefield — often with ticket prices costing $10 or less."
14210,5. The special guests are top-notch
14211,"Williams and Robinson sure know how to pick their interview subjects. In the first two episodes you’ll be able to catch bona fide NYC celebrity royalty: Jon Stewart and Sarah Jessica Parker. During both segments the hosts aren’t afraid to put the stars n slightly awkward positions, but never so far as to lose the easy, charming conversation."

When we last saw Bauer, he had gone on a killing spree that achieved the rare feat of making him one of the most wanted men in both the U.S. and Russia.

Americans continue to have an affinity for the royal family and we expect to see the name Charlotte rise in popularity, as George did in 2013.”"
14347,"-- It has a history. The name Charlotte has a long royal heritage. England’s Queen Charlotte was the wife of George III. The couple also had a daughter they named Charlotte, according to BabyCenter."
14348,"-- It's meaningful. Charlotte is the feminine version of the name Charles, meaning “free man.”"
14349,-- It's noteworthy. Other famous namesakes of baby Charlotte include esteemed English writer Charlotte Bronte and Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church.

14372,"Hasidic women are taught to be modest, unable to touch men who aren’t family. But when they call Hatzolah, the Hasidic volunteer ambulance corps, a group of men arrive on the scene. Rachel “Ruchie” Freier, a Hasidic lawyer — and eventual judge — spearheaded Ezras Nashim because she wanted to give women the opportunity to be assisted by other women in emergencies, especially childbirths."
14373,"A new documentary, “93Queen,” which is now playing at IFC Center, follows Freier as she battles opposition from members of the community who believe that women should not work outside the home. Freier and a team of other Hasidic women built the organization themselves, ultimately earning recognition at the city and state levels."
14374,"“It struck me that this was a group of Hasidic women who were not taking no for an answer,” said filmmaker Paula Eiselt, who spent six years documenting the women after she noticed them mentioned in an online Orthodox news publication."
14375,"Eiselt — who will be joined by Freier for Q&As at select IFC Center screenings — wouldn’t take no for an answer, either. Many members of the community were wary of the media, she said, because portrayals of Hasidim are often negative."
14376,"“Let’s break the cycle, let’s engage,” Eiselt said she told Freier. “If you don’t agree with the way you’re being represented in the media, you gotta show the world something else, because how else can you expect to show the world a different perspective?”"
14377,"Eiselt pushed to gain access to the community, with success in part because she is an Orthodox Jew, “able to straddle both the secular world and the religious Jewish world,” she said. Eiselt filmed the documentary almost entirely alone, using a single inconspicuous camera. She built intimate relationships with the women she filmed and has become a frequent attendee of Hasidic weddings."

14389,"But the starry new Broadway revival of Albee’s 1966 drama “A Delicate Balance” is surprisingly flat and likely to disappoint both those unfamiliar with the three-act play, as well as those who still remember its much acclaimed revival from two decades ago with Elaine Stritch and Rosemary Harris."
14390,"Set in the suburban home of upper-middle-class couple Agnes and Tobias (Close and Lithgow), who reside with Agnes’ inebriated and jesting sister Claire (Duncan), their lives are upended by the arrivals of their daughter Julia (Plimpton), fresh from her latest breakup, and their friends Harry and Edna (Balaban and Higgins), who insist that they cannot return to their own house for an unknown and mysterious reason."
14391,"Much of the play is spent debating whether Harry and Edna have a “right” to find sanctuary with Agnes and Tobias. Julia, who is especially angered by their presence, demands that they leave her old bedroom, and goes so far as to pull out a gun. Meanwhile, Agnes, who has an air of regality and composure, and Tobias, who is generally passive, fail to do anything."
14392,"Despite the witty lines and a handful of exciting moments, the production is a three-hour, very static bore. Pam MacKinnon, who directed the 2012 Broadway revival of Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", never manages to combine these accomplished performers into a unified ensemble. Perhaps that balance will be reached as the run continues."

14414,"Williams plays Mitch Mitchler, a gruff jerk of a father and the patriarch of a messed up family, a clan which Joel McHale's Boyd wants to avoid at all cost."
14415,"Boyd blames his dad, a former alcoholic, for a crummy childhood and ruined Christmases -- which we see in flashback -- and has no intention of spending one yuletide minute with him, until his brother Nelson (Clark Duke) asks him to be the godfather for the baby left in his possession, with the baptism on Christmas Eve."
14416,"The cast here is pretty impressive: Lauren Graham plays Boyd's wife, Candice Bergan plays his mother, Wendi McLendon-Covey his sister and Oliver Platt shows up as a slovenly Santa."
14417,"Much of the film is Mitch, Boyd and Nelson driving back and forth to Boyd's home, where he accidentally left his son's presents. It's a contentious ride -- Boyd has asthma, which doesn't go well with Mitch's penchant for smoking cigars -- and all the most lazy father/son dynamics are addressed. The humor is pretty base, sometimes offensive and very rarely clever. Most of the cast is wasted, especially the females, who are left at home boozing."

14428,There’s no need to worry about protesters at this Shakespeare production.
14429,"The Public Theater, which provoked national controversy last month with a Shakespeare in the Park production of “Julius Caesar” in which the title character resembled President Donald Trump, is now presenting a bright and jubilant staging of the perennial romantic comedy “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” at the park."
14430,"One of Shakespeare’s most crowd-pleasing and well-constructed works, “Midsummer” observes the topsy-turvy chaos in and around the woods of Athens as two pairs of emotional young lovers and a group of well-meaning laborers/amateur actors come into contact with supernatural fairies who possess mind-bending and body-shaping powers."
14431,"The production is directed by Lear deBessonet, who founded the theater’s recently conceived Public Works series, in which massive musical pageants based on classic titles are performed at the park by professional actors alongside dozens of members of citywide community organizations."
14432,"“Midsummer” can be staged and interpreted in innumerable ways, with varying degrees of broad comedy, dark undertones, physical choreography and experimental tactics. For instance, Peter Brook’s game-changing 1970 production was set around an empty white box and suggested magic by incorporating circus acts."
14433,"Except for a few distinct touches — older actors playing the fairies, a tree house containing a live band and ad-libs directed to the audience, to name a few — deBessonet’s production is relatively straightforward, with a traditional, simple set design of large trees full of twinkling lights."

14444,"Seth MacFarlane is best known for peppering his material with naughty jokes and edgy asides, but at his heart he’s an old-fashioned genre aficionado. Just look at the abundance of musical numbers on “Family Guy” or the buddy comedy heart of “Ted.”"
14445,"From the big­, reddish-orange credits set against empty western vistas to the sweeping shots of sheep grazing and horses galloping, MacFarlane’s “A Million Days to Die in the West” reverently pays tribute to the classic western as it simultaneously sends it up with a bunch of innocuous poop jokes and the repeated observation that there sure were a lot of ways to die on the frontier."
14446,"MacFarlane is one of the few male comic creative talents to have honed a style that entirely stands against the Judd Apatow school of realism. He has a deep understanding of classical Hollywood tropes and is thereby well-equipped to fill the Mel Brooks parody role in the 21st century. We need him making movies like this one, in other words, even if it isn’t actually all that great."
14447,"The director/co-writer also stars here as Albert, an Arizona farmer in 1882 who really, really shouldn’t be an Arizona farmer in 1882. Whereas the Wild West demands men of fortitude and strength, men who would never shy away from a gunfight, Albert is a quick-witted coward. He’s more Woody Allen than John Wayne, in other words."
14448,"Clearly, he’s got to toughen up. Events are set in motion that will do just that when a beautiful gunslinger (Charlize Theron) arrives in town."
14449,"The movie offers decent escapist entertainment throughout and occasionally more than that. The central conceit lends itself to some humorous set-ups and the running gag, in which extras are killed in outlandish ways (a camera bursts into flames, a block of ice crushes a skull), is a pretty good one. MacFarlane never steps too far away from his pop cultural obsessions and the movie is sprinkled with cameos that range from the unlikely to the obvious. Also, Giovanni Ribisi stands out as Albert’s virginal best friend."
14450,"It’s just not as fresh or clever as it thinks it is. MacFarlane relies too heavily on his old standbys, including bodily function humor and a full-on musical number, to really get to the heart of this genre and its masculine ideals. The picture runs nearly two hours, far too long for an endeavor in which the story serves as little more than a conduit for broad slapstick. “A Million Ways to Die in the West” isn’t “Blazing Saddles,” in other words, and it’s not funny enough to be considered an unqualified success. But I’m sure glad it exists."

	  Look who's back: Joy Behar returns to 'The View' after a two-year absence.       Photo Credit: Bill Stankey     "
14499,"""The View's"" 19th season began Tuesday and....OK, enough with the small talk already: Joy Behar is back."
14500,"Gone two years now following a baby-out-with-the-bathwater overhaul that left this show floundering and flopping, today's return felt like old times...also loud times, and gaseous times, and opinionated times. Plus amusing times, infuriating times, silly times. But whether you are a fan of Behar or not, her return Tuesday was at least a demonstration of why ""The View"" without her wasn't really ""The View"" at all..."
14501," With a personality so outsized, opinions so brash, and a voice so New Yawk, she tended to define what this show was so often about.  And because she was there from the very beginning, 19 years ago, losing that style obviously meant losing something elemental to the enterprise as well. Sure, ""The View"" may be a boisterous exchange of political ideas or social observations that cater to a strictly female viewership -- but in actual point of fact, it's more often a sonic gale-force wind that tends to be informative only by accident, but undeniably entertaining when all the elements are working in tandem."
14502,"Chief among those elements over the years was Behar. With her back at the center of the table, she's also a reminder -- still a vivid one -- of what ""The View"" was like when it was actually relevant. "
14503,"This morning, she told the audience that she spent her summer in the Hamptons; had regrets getting up this morning while her husband was still sleeping; wondered along with Whoopi why the new season's ceremonial coffee cup doesn't have any faces of the new cast members: ""In case they have to get rid of any of us..."""
14504,"She battered heads, ever so gently with new cast members whose political opinions were at variance with her own still safely liberal ones; largely sided with Whoopi Goldberg on just about everything; got cozy with Jerry O'Connell; slipped a flirtatious hand behind the head of first guest Jason Sudeikis; and got serious with the other first guest, Elizabeth Warren. She behaved just like someone who had never even left."
14505,"""The View"" also took the opportunity to introduce the rest of the cast -- a big one, all of whom have already appeared -- including ""GMA"" anchor Paula Faris filling the obligatory role of ""Christian"" and ""conservative,"" also Raven-Symone, as Youthful Cultural Seer, who verged on incoherence at moments; (""Girl,"" a voice warned her, when she started to get lost in the weeds of some thought...)"

Behar, as much as anyone, understands that past because she was there. Maybe that's the right first step towards a return to relevance."

14517,Let's get one thing straight.
14518,"Liam Neeson plays a man with ""a particular set of skills"" in ""A Walk Among the Tombstones,"" but the movie finds the star a long way from his action hero archetype."
14519,This is a dour drama adapted from one of Lawrence Block's Matt Scudder novels in which the private investigator (played by Neeson) is hired to look into the murder of a drug dealer's (Dan Stevens) wife and winds up descending into the depraved world of her sadistic killers.
14520,"There's hardly any gun play and not much fun to be had in a movie that stresses atmospherics and character development above cartoonish pyrotechnics. It's set in Greenwood and other South Brooklyn neighborhoods that are transformed into a ghoulish urban nightmare, with the rain-swept and darkened streets mirroring the depths of the characters' damaged souls."
14521,"Neeson is far more vulnerable than usual when doing his tough-guy shtick; there's no aura of invincibility around his character. It's one of the better parts he's been given in a while, with the chance to play up the loneliness that comes with a profession practiced in the shadows."
14522,"The film ultimately is too serious-minded for its own good, though. The intense atmosphere clashes with the fundamentally convoluted plot (in which Scudder always has the answers, even if he's often unsure of himself), while the one-dimensional villains are so heinously evil that the movie's push toward realism is stifled."
14523,"""A Walk Among the Tombstones,"" at heart, is only a touch less goofy than ""Taken"" or ""Non-Stop."" And if it's got more integrity from a creative standpoint -- if its less of a craven lowest common denominator cash-in (although ""Taken"" is about as fun as action movies get) -- the picture's apparently deeply held belief in its significance ultimately serves as its undoing."
14524,"It's sharply made, with strong naturalistic inclinations, but if you think about it too long, the whole thing crumbles."

	  Etaf Rum's new novel ""A Woman Is No Man"" is out now.       Photo Credit: Angela Blankenship / Harper     "
14535,"When Etaf Rum was teaching a literature class at Nash Community College in North Carolina, she noticed more than ever before the lack of diverse stories on bookshelves. She made a concerted effort to include diverse authors on her curriculum — Jhumpa Lahiri, Amy Tan, Junot Díaz — but she saw a major void when it came to Arab and Arab-American authors, especially women."
14536,"“That made me think about our stories and why they aren’t represented,” Rum, 29, says. “And I wanted to fix that.”"
14537,"So she set to work on her first novel, “A Woman Is No Man,” a multigenerational family epic inspired by Rum’s experience growing up in a Palestinian-American family in Brooklyn."
14538,"amNewYork spoke with Rum, now based in North Carolina, about her inspiration for the novel, the complex themes her story addresses and the impact she hopes her book will have."
14539,How much of the story is influenced by your lived experience?
14540,"The plot and characters were influenced very heavily by my upbringing. I was born and raised in Brooklyn to Palestinian immigrants and my grandparents were all products of the Nakba in Palestine in 1948. They lived in refugee camps before relocating to America. Many of the themes that I deal with in this book are issues that I had to face growing up: displacement, straddl[ing], lack of identity as well as sexism, patriarchy, a domestic household."
14541,Did you prepare to look at these issues in fiction?
14542,"I wish I would have been able to do more research on the historical aspects of the 1948 exodus, because I haven’t lived through that, and most of the information in the book is retellings from my grandparents. Obviously I made sure that the numbers were accurate. The themes in the story are all based on my experiences, so I didn’t have to go outside and look for anything else."

14545,"How did growing up in Brooklyn influence your writing about Brooklyn, now looking back?"
14546,"I love that I set the book in Brooklyn, not just because I was born and raised there, but because Brooklyn is such a beautiful, culturally diverse place. And I wanted to emphasize that even though the characters lived in the melting pot of the world, they still felt alone and isolated and alienated in many ways. That’s something very ironic — it’s not like they were in Mississippi or somewhere, they were in Brooklyn and still felt like they didn’t belong. They still had a little world of their own that people didn’t know about in Bay Ridge, where there are so many different immigrants of every kind. It was very important to stress to the reader and bring a new awareness that at the heart of America there’s this family that is not seen on bookshelves, and they’re living a life that we’re not really aware of."
14547,What do you think the impact of bringing this type of visibility will be?
14548,"I’m hoping that Palestinian-Americans, especially women, will feel like their stories are being shared and told, and someone is speaking up on their behalf. I’m hoping that the book has a positive impact. On the other side, I can foresee that there may be a little bit of a controversy, [like] whenever an author is the first to speak on behalf of an entire community or culture. Personally, I felt that burden as I was writing. One of my biggest fears was to not stereotype or misrepresent the community, because I’m one of the first people to talk about issues like domestic violence, hypocrisy, tradition versus religion. And you have these characters and you want to paint them out to be as three-dimensional and human as you can, but some of those are very hard truths confirming stereotypes. I’m very interested to see how my community reacts to these truths I’m talking about. I tried very hard not to stereotype our culture and our community with a single story."
14549,Can you talk about the title?
14550,"I love the title! It was changed a few times, but it is a line from the novel. I felt like it would be a very powerful title, because growing up whenever I expressed any desire to go outside the prescribed path of marriage or motherhood, I was often told that I couldn’t. And when I asked why the response was almost always: “Because a woman is no man.” Growing up, that phrase had such a powerful hold on my life and controlled me even when I wasn’t aware that it was controlling or limiting me in my existence as a woman. I felt like I couldn't do things or wasn’t allowed to do things because I wasn’t a man. And only later, while I was writing the story and became a mother and was raising my own kids, I started to realize that a woman’s place in Arab society puts her on a much higher pedestal than men in terms of the responsibility she has. Not only is she educated and strives to take care of her own self and her own desires, but unlike men she also has the whole family responsibility on her shoulders. She’s also responsible for maintaining relationships between family members, raising her children, instilling values in them. I came to see that as a strength for our women, too. Not only is she seen as not a man in terms of traditional culture, but she’s also more powerful and has more impact on the family values."
14551,What do you want readers to take away from your novel?
14552,"I hope men realize that without the freedom of our women, our community and culture will never advance in society. We will only advance as far as we advance our women and allow our women their freedom and their rights. And without doing that, we will always teach our children that it’s OK to be oppressed, it’s OK to be abused, and it’s OK to live a life that is far from equal and far from just."

14560,"As much as New York City has changed in the last 40 years, one thing has remained constant: Robert Browning putting on world music concerts. In 1975, Browning co-founded the Alternative Center for International Arts on the Lower East Side, and in 1985 he and his wife founded the World Music Institute. Browning retired from the Institute in 2011 but has continued to periodically curate performances. His latest is a four-day festival at Brooklyn's Roulette called ""A World In Trance,"" featuring musicians from Guinea, Mauritania, Morocco, Pakistan, Tuva and the U.S. in styles that range from African blues to throat singing. amNewYork spoke with Browning."
14561, 
14562,"What was the impetus for ""A World in Trance""?"
14563,"Basically, a lot of music we present is kind of trance inducing or has a ritualistic aspect that is beyond just sitting in a concert hall. All these groups, I felt had something in common. Their music is transcendent. It embraces a different form of listening a lot of the time."
14564, 
14565,You retired from the World Music Institute in 2011 saying you were tired. What made you want to jump back into putting on concerts?
14566,"Things were getting too big. It was getting more and more difficult. We had just gone through a major financial crisis and there was no more money available. I was tired of doing all the fundraising. Then when I retired, I still had all these artists calling me, saying ""Hey, I'm coming over from India or I'm coming over from Mali, and I want to do a concert."" ... [Putting on concerts at Roulette] is like going back to what I was doing 25-30 years ago, that is, doing smaller concerts."

14571,The audience has aged. When I started off the average age of audience would have been somewhere around 28. ... Just recently I noticed there are younger people coming back. Most young people do not want to sit down at a concert. That is something that has changed dramatically. Our early concerts were much more informal. Maybe places like Roulette and other smaller clubs on the Lower East Side and Brooklyn are doing better because they're not trying to get everyone sitting in rows and quiet. We want to get them to participate.

14640,"Despite being best known for directing comedies like ""Anchorman,"" Adam McKay felt compelled to chronicle the financial collapse of 2008 after reading Michael Lewis' nonfiction book of the same name."
14641,"""I was so excited by it,"" McKay says. ""I read the book and just couldn't put it down."""
14642,"The film follows four guys -- played by Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt -- who foresaw the collapse of the economy and figured out a way to profit from it."
14643,"Actor Finn Wittrock, who plays investor Jamie Shipley, puts McKay's new dramatic side into perspective."
14644,"""Adam is finding this new part of this voice that's very exciting to be a part of. ... I could tell it was going to be an exciting movie whether or not it worked, and it does work. It also maintains his sense of humor."""
14645,"amNewYork spoke to McKay about the film, out Friday."
14646,Why do you think this is such an untapped story in film?
14647,"That's a real good question. I think one of the hard things is how do you translate financial [information] to film? I think that's daunting in some ways. People thought that you would have to do it in a documentary, and it would just be very pedantic. That's just my guess."

14650,You're primarily known for comedy. Did making a movie on such a serious topic like this feel daunting?
14651,"I knew there was an engine of excitement at the center of this movie. I just wanted to make sure that I was able to understand exactly what happened. I thought it was a good sign when I got it. I got to the point where I could explain this to my 10-year-old daughter, and then I knew I was in good shape."
14652,Especially when you have actresses like Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez breaking it down into laymen's terms.
14653,"Exactly. That was a sort of breakthrough for the movie. The idea that we could take this pop culture that we're inundated with every single day and to some degree, what we were paying attention to, instead of the banking crisis. Having that element of our culture explain parts of the movie was a pretty exciting breakthrough."
14654,Wouldn't it be great if pop culture figures promote important issues through their brand on social media?
14655,"Benedict Cumberbatch was doing a thing for a while where the paparazzi would take his picture, he would hold up a written statement that said, ""Shouldn't we be looking at the situation with the refugees in Syria right now?"" And I loved when he did that. It was so funny and on point."
14656,Is there a different rhythm when you write something like this? As opposed to writing a comedy with Will Ferrell?
14657,"Without a doubt. The big thing I noticed with this is that I was completely freed of a hard genre. Comedy is comedy, and getting laughs, and there's certain rules you have to hit. With this, every single scene could be whatever it needed to be. I just never had that freedom before."
14658,Your film was dropped smack dab in the middle of Oscar season. Was the marketing of your movie ever in your mind? Did you anticipate this buzz happening?
14659,"You know, I really didn't. We got into the editing room and we were expecting to come out next March or maybe April. What happened was unusual, where my brilliant editor showed me his editor's cut, and I thought, ""Holy crap some of this is already working."" He and I did a first cut and it was working quite well. I said I wanted to invite the studio in and everybody thought I was crazy. Given the up and down state of the economy, and given the presidential election, I thought the movie should come out during this time."
14660,There's a theory out there that a film could help or hurt a presidential election.
14661,"It's a curious theory. Certainly popular culture -- there's sketches that have been done on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and ""The Daily Show,"" and then you mix film with that, and occasionally music, with Eminem writing a track against George W. Bush at a point where his approval ratings really started to plummet. I think everything operates in harmony with itself. I don't think it's any accident that after George W. Bush left office, the next big hit comedy was called ""The Hangover."" Talk about the right time for that story."

14683, 
14684,What do you see as the legacy of the show?
14685,"The only legacy I see is that it maybe ... indicated that there are certain shows -- if they're done in a very fresh or innovative way -- that can have a longevity if you get the right people together. ... There are a few of those shows that we've had on television, and thank goodness that 'Batman' is among them. I'm very grateful that people love it."

14775,"There's an adage that youth is wasted on the young. While New York street photographer Ari Seth Cohen doesn't exactly admit to prescribing to this idea, his documentary, ""Advanced Style,"" lends to this philosophy."
14776,"""Advanced Style"" started as a blog featuring photos by Cohen of older women, usually 60 and up, wearing bright patterns and thrift store finds unabashedly."
14777,"Cohen, along with director Lina Plioplyte are the two driving voices behind profiling the vitality of women from all walks of life. These women have desires, setbacks, and a hunger to claim their youth through fashion -- all which are documented in this moving and often humorous film."
14778,amNewYork spoke with Ari Seth Cohen about the film.
14779, 
14780,"When did ""Advanced Style"" the blog explode for you?"
14781,"I was working at the New Museum, and I got offered a photo installation at Selfridges in London. At that point I had to quit my job. Shortly after that, The New York Times wrote an article about the blog, and that's when it started to take off."

14785,What pulls you toward a specific person? An outfit? Swagger?
14786,"It's all those things. It can be the way a woman is standing on a street corner, or a hairstyle, or an arm full of amazing accessories. Mainly it's their spirit that comes across. A lot of the times I'll be attracted to wildly eccentric women, because I feel like it's the total opposite of what we see in media, which is this pervasive attitude that older women should fade away. I'm trying to beat people down with the opposite image."
14787, 
14788,Were you surprised by anything they had to say?
14789,"I'm always surprised by what's going to come out of their mouths. I think they're unafraid of upsetting anyone, impressing anyone and they say what they want to say. But that's what's refreshing about them."
14790, 
14791,The concept that fashion can be a healing agent was new to me. What did you learn about people's relationships to fashion?
14792,"For them, they wouldn't feel like themselves if they didn't get dressed up in the morning. In a way, that is healing, and I totally agree with you, that it's not something I would have associated."

14803,Directed by James Kent
14804,"Starring  Keira Knightley, Jason Clarke, Alexander Skarsgård"
14805,Rated R
14806,"Here is one of life’s truths: If Keira Knightley is in the movie, it isn’t all bad. "
14807,"“The Aftermath” tests this theory. It is a ridiculous soap opera with precious little action and two leading men in a race to see who can be least interesting. The trailers promise postwar intrigue, the film itself is a muted meditation on grief. "
14808,"But at the center is Knightley. There she is at the piano bathed in pre-dawn light. There she is looking exquisite at a party as an English colonel’s wife. There she is, suddenly (albeit preposterously) overcome by lust right there on the kitchen table. She’s a Golden Age movie star that somehow ended up in our era, so we must take our victories where we find them. "
14809,"Directed by James Kent (whose last feature, “Testament of Youth,” starred the store-brand Keira Knightley, Alicia Vikander) and adapted from Rhidian Brook’s novel, “The Aftermath” is set directly after World War II, hence the surface interpretation of the title. Col. Morgan (Jason Clarke) is a high-ranking official tasked with rebuilding Hamburg, and quelling the dying embers of the “Werewolf” resistance. "
14810,"His wife Rachael (Knightley) joins him as they move into the large estate owned by a Herr Lubert (Alexander Skarsgård), a wealthy architect who doesn’t seem to have any definitive Nazi connections. The colonel feels bad about kicking Lubert and their preteen daughter out, so allows them to stay in the attic. "
14811,"Is it because the colonel is a good man brimming with forgiveness, or is it just because he can’t bear to be alone with his wife? The pair have never really dealt with the death of their son, killed during the Blitz bombing. The coldness felt in their marriage is contrasted with hot looks Rachael and Lubert start giving each another. (How could they not?! Have you seen what they look like?!) When Lubert shares that his wife was also killed in a bombing, they bond. "
14812,"Call it survivor’s guilt or nationalist remorse or maybe the pair just turn each other on. Either way, Knightley and Skarsgård quickly come together to experience the thrills of Lower Saxony. "
14813,"I kept expecting a twist in “The Aftermath.” That Lubert was really a Nazi, or the colonel had secret Teutonic titillations of his own. Even by “Masterpiece Theater” standards this is a letdown. It looks nice (the old piano! the gowns!), but this aftermath doesn’t add up to much."

14822,"""Godfathers of Hardcore"" chronicles a collective of musicians, who exist as the living embodiment of a movement — and a changed New York."
14823,"The film, available for streaming on Showtime, tells the story of Agnostic Front, which helped define the NYC hardcore scene in the '80s. But while the dilapidated Lower East Side the band called home may only exist as a memory, Agnostic Front is still a thriving recording and touring act."
14824,"By chronicling the history of the iconic group through the voices of its founders — vocalist Roger Miret, 54, and guitarist Vinnie Stigma, 63 — director Ian McFarland captures the influential nature of his personal punk rock heroes."
14825,"“I saw something there. I always knew there was a really interesting story of Roger and Vinnie and their dynamic,” McFarland says. “They were there when the New York hardcore scene was very, very, very small.”"
14826,"The five-piece hardcore band, which featured heavy guitars, shouted vocals and exuberant energy, spouted lyrics encompassing the crime, gang and drug scene of the early ’80s in the Lower East Side neighborhood that Miret and Stigma called home."
14827,"“We sound the way we sound because we are a product of New York,” Miret says in the film. “If we were from anywhere else … I don’t think we would’ve had that edge. The element of danger created something great.”"
14828,"After touring with Agnostic Front in the ’90s with his own band, McFarland knew he had to document the story of the iconic group."
14829,"“It is such an important story about mortality about following your heart, doing what you love … and just trying to do something with your life,” says McFarland, “and then not stopping at any cost.”"

14832,"McFarland and his crew flew to Miret’s home in Phoenix, Arizona, in February 2015 to capture the daily happenings of Miret family life from breakfast to bedtime. Throughout the course of 2015 and 2016, McFarland and his team filmed the lives of Miret and Stigma, who remains in his childhood apartment in Manhattan."
14833,"Stigma takes viewers through the LES he's seen drastically change within the past six decades. He wanders sidewalks where he'd play childhood games and sits on the roof of the apartment building where he used to take care of his grandfather's pigeon coop — which is gone now, he says, blaming former Mayor Rudy Giuliani."
14834,"""You used to be able to see all the way to Chinatown, now there's … trees in the way,"" he says. ""They all live here now. Patrick Stewart lives here, Moby lives over there,"" Stigma says, pointing from his rooftop. ""David Bowie live[d] over there, but I've lived right there all my life. They wanna live near me I guess. Eh, it's not a bad place to live now, good people, you know."""
14835,"After getting a promotional trailer of the project up on Kickstarter, McFarland followed the band for two and a half weeks on a European trip and a week and a half in the U.S. By the time the crew wrapped, the band members were used to wiring themselves up and even using the director’s clapboard."
14836,"However, filming wasn’t all fun and games for McFarland, who says he feared for Miret’s safety at times — especially during the band’s high intensity live shows — due to the vocalist’s underlying heart condition. The film documents doctors' visits, where it's revealed Miret received a pacemaker. "
14837,"“There was a reason why I was pushing so hard to get this film done. I was really worried that something was going to happen to him while we were filming,” says McFarland. “I can't tell you how many hours of sleep I lost, how many nights just pacing around my house trying to just speed up, [asking] what can I do to get this thing done faster.”"
14838,"The film wrapped without incident, going on to win festival awards, including best documentary feature at the Independent Film Festival of Boston, and being named the official film of 2018 Record Day. However, the praise hasn’t been limited to just the critics."
14839,"“There was a guy in Berlin the other night, and I was In the lobby,"" McFarland recalls. ""In the middle of the film, he wanted to corner me and he came up and he just was crying … he said the hardcore scene was very personal to him and a lot of things happened in his life that he just had to move on. He said, 'thank you so much for making me feel that I made the right decisions in my life about being part of this music.’”"

14848,"It is a loud, drunken, jubilant affair in the parking lot of a dilapidated motel, located along a stretch of highway in New Orleans. The motley crowd in attendance includes a stripper, a cross-dresser and a drug-addicted prostitute (played by no less than Tony winner Julie White)."

14852,"""Airline Highway"" presents a lively, detailed portrait of a lower class community in the South. But nice as it is to have a wide assortment of colorful characters, the focus too often drifts away from the central players of the plot. It ends with many of the conflicts unresolved."

14885,"Having already cast off his accidental status as a '90s slacker icon by releasing the sample-heavy ""Odelay,"" the Brazilian-tinged ""Mutations"" and the cartoonish sex-funk of ""Midnite Vultures"" in quick succession, Beck turned inward to produce 2002's ""Sea Change."" That sad, gorgeous album has stood as a high mark in a career that has produced some serious contenders."
14886,"Twelve years later, we arrive at ""Morning Phase,"" his 12th album, and one that has its seeds in ""Sea Change,"" but bears markedly different fruit. It shares the tonal structure of acoustic balladeer Beck, it dissects dark moments and even has similar album art of the artist, semi-obliterated by kaleidoscopic color."
14887,"But Beck has seemingly gained the perspective of time, not only the maturity of added years, but what time really is -- the connection of life's moments into a cohesive whole. Time and its acceptance are the throughline of ""Morning Phase,"" from the elegant vocals in ""Morning"" to the loping menace of ""Unforgiven,"" to standout ""Wave,"" an almost purely classical poem that ends with Beck repeatedly intoning the word ""isolation."" It sounds forbiddingly heavy, but Beck balances the scales when needed and handles life's thorniest challenges -- surrendering, saying goodbye, starting over -- with a wistful ease that makes them almost abstract, and renders comparison to his earlier work obsolete. ""Morning Phase"" couldn't have arrived any sooner, and we are all the better for its drawn-out dawn."

In private, moving with his wife and new baby and laughing as the paparazzi tries to stake out his old apartment? Nope, it’s in a 5,000-word rant in New York magazine that the actor says, “I probably have to move out of New York."""
14917,"""I just can’t live in New York anymore,"" Baldwin says. ""Everything I hated about L.A. I’m beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind in a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. But New York has changed. Manhattan is like Beverly Hills. And the soul of New York has moved to Brooklyn, where everything new and exciting seems to be … I want my newest child to have as normal and decent a life as I can provide. New York doesn’t seem the place for that anymore."""
14918,"Oh that’s not all though. Baldwin insists the representation of him as a homophobe is completely wrong. ""I’m sorry, I can’t let go of this,” he says about his alleged anti-gay remarks. “Do you honestly believe I would give someone like TMZ’s Harvey Levin, of all people, another club to beat me with?"""
14919,"Baldwin blames smartphones and the Internet for all this. Now everyone is a photographer, anyone can tweet a photo, and everyone does. ""It’s … unnatural."" As in, now everyone knows about your behavior?"
14920,"Baldwin explains how unfair MSNBC was to fire him—although he insists he didn’t even want the show in the first place. He calls Rachel Maddow ""ultimate wonk/dweeb"" and a ""phony,"" but ""talented;"" Joe Scarborough is ""neither eloquent nor funny;"" Mika Brzezinski is the ""Margaret Dumont of cable news"" (tip: nobody under 50 gets that reference, Alec); and Baldwin likes Lawrence O’Donnell but ""he’s too smart to be doing that show."" “The problem with everybody on MSNBC is none of them are funny, although that doesn’t prevent them from trying to be,” Baldwin writes.

He’s expected to win, but if he doesn’t, expect a gloating told ya so tweet from someone out there. But what’s especially interesting about last night is that Baldwin -- especially busy filming “Boss Baby 2,” “M: 1 6: Mission Impossible,” and prepping for the live production of “A Few Good Men” (did I mention that book with Kurt Andersen yet? I just did? Good.) -- presumably won’t have much time left over for Trump.

14964,"'Alice By Heart' runs through April 7 at the Robert W. Wilson MCC Theater Space. 511 W. 52nd St., mcctheater.org."
14965,"“Alice By Heart,” a new folk-pop musical inspired by “Alice in Wonderland” and written by the “Spring Awakening” team of composer Duncan Sheik and lyricist-writer Steven Sater, raises serious questions about the purpose of art in hard times, escapism and grief. But one question that really stuck with me (and that I am still debating) is whether “Alice by Heart” was more difficult to sit through than “Wonderland,” Frank Wildhorn’s overblown and flashy “Alice in Wonderland” musical, which flopped on Broadway in 2011."
14966,"Directed by Jessie Nelson, “Alice By Heart”  juxtaposes the fanciful world of “Alice in Wonderland” with teens who are taking shelter in an underground train station and suffering from psychological and physical trauma during the London bombing blitz of 1941. Edward Pierce's set design is sleek and menacing."
14967,"Alice Spencer (Molly Gordon, assertive and desperate) arrives at the shelter after her home has been reduced to rubble, accompanied only by her treasured copy of “Alice in Wonderland.” She then spots her friend Alfred (Colton Ryan), who is dying of tuberculosis. Alice -- who knows “Alice in Wonderland” by heart, hence the title — attempts to bring Alfred back to health by re-enacting with him episodes from the book and role playing (Alice as Alice, Alfred as the White Rabbit), just as they would do as children."
14968,"The other youths and medical staff take on familiar characters, including the Mad Hatter, Caterpillar, Cheshire Cat and Queen of Hearts and use found objects as props, such as gas masks and rifles. The concept is not unlike “Man of La Mancha,” in which Cervantes enacts the story of Don Quixote with fellow prisoners in a dungeon."
14969,"Rather than being a feel-good exercise, Alice now finds Wonderland to be a dark and creepy place, where the characters question her motivations and actions. Although sincerely intended and full of creative touches, “Alice by Heart” is a disjointed, depressing and bewildering mess. It would be near impossible to follow it without a working knowledge of the source material."
14970,"Sheik and Sater’s songs are mellow and hazy and have little integration with plot, lacking the vitality that supercharged the best moments in “Spring Awakening.” Interestingly, Sater again uses lyrics that evoke nature, but here it’s autumn and winter instead of spring and summer."
14971,"Considering that “Alice in Wonderland” is a classic novel in the public domain, virtually anyone can write a musical based on it. Perhaps a good one will turn up someday."

14979,"""Through the act of asking,"" musician and artist Amanda Palmer writes in her book, ""The Art of Asking,"" ""we created that community."""
14980,"She is referring to an artists residence and commune in Boston, but that tribute to asking as easily applies to her career and her fanbase. Asking allows her to crash on couches of fans while touring, brings her loaner musical instruments, and helped Palmer raise almost $1.2 million for a new album on Kickstarter."

14983,"What is the biggest factor, in your experience, that stops people from asking for what they want?"
14984,"It's fear, basically. The thing that prevents people from asking the most is fear of something. What I've noticed is that it's either the fear of being judged or the fear of being unloved. And sometimes those two things are wrapped up next to each other."
14985,"As your stature and fame has grown, have you noticed a difference in the ask-receive dynamic? Has being famous changed how some react to you asking for help?"
14986,"Unfortunately, it has. Things used to be so much more simple. It was just me and my community. There was nobody from the outside world watching. I never thought twice about asking my fans for this or that. It was an easy relationship. Now, because people have this perception of me as this rich and powerful person, I find myself constantly judged. But it's also been my life's work to make sure that it doesn't change my composition. ? I'd rather allow someone to feel useful for being able to bring a guitar to a gig and have that human interaction with them rather than open up the Yellow Pages and rent it.

I think the solution is much more diverse and subtle and has more to do with artists and audiences who don't take painting or sound and sculpture for granted, as if it magically appears without somebody making it. These entities are going to have to consult each other, because the middlemen are scattered, and progress will come from an understanding between artists and the people who want their art."

14997,“Forever” comes from the writers behind “30 Rock” and “Parks and Recreation.”

	  Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen star in the Amazon series, ""Forever,"" now streaming.       Photo Credit: Colleen Hayes     "
14999,Warning: Minor “Forever” spoilers below.
15000,The creators of Amazon’s “Forever” are keeping incredibly tight-lipped on the plot of their new comedy series.
15001,"Other than a bare-bones synopsis describing its leads as a married pair who live a “comfortable but predictable life” and suddenly find themselves “in completely unfamiliar territory,” not much has leaked about the series. Its writers even went as far to pen a personal letter to the media requesting a mile-long list of spoiler points (including crucial events that happen in episodes one, two, three, etc.) be kept out of reviews. And that’s only a slight exaggeration. "
15002,"So, why should you watch it? If you don’t want to throw your trust blindly in reviewers who may claim the comedy is worth the eight-hour binge, the big names attached to it will put your inquiring mind at ease. "
15003,"That married couple you know little about is June and Oscar, played by “Saturday Night Live” alums Maya Rudolph and Fred Armisen, respectively. If you’re not yet totally sold, perhaps this will hook you: “Forever” comes from the minds of Emmy-winning writers Alan Yang and Matt Hubbard, aka the guys who brought you “Parks and Recreation,” “30 Rock” and “Master of None.” "
15004,"“We wanted people to come into the show not knowing anything about what it’s going to be about except that Maya and Fred are in it, which is hopefully a huge draw,” Hubbard says, insisting that coming into the series with a completely clean slate is the best way to experience it. "
15005,"He adds: “I think in a world of many, many thousands of TV shows, it feels like now, that element of surprise is so difficult. The show took some interesting turns and went someplace you didn’t expect, so it can be gratifying as a viewer if you don’t see those coming.” "
15006,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
15007,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
15008,"Below, Hubbard reveals, well, not much about the comedy that we can say deals with relationship issues anyone who’s anyone can relate to. “Forever” is now available for streaming on Amazon. "
15009,You don’t have much to draw fans in here other than the projects you’ve worked on in the past. How do you feel “Forever” compares to “Parks and Rec” and “30 Rock”? 
15010,"Well, one huge difference is that “Parks and Rec” and “30 Rock” are both built for distance. Those are network comedies where they want you to get 100 episodes out so the people who created those shows were smart in terms of making them low concept plots so you could be in Pawnee for 100 episodes, be with Liz Lemon and you don’t get tired of it. One thing that’s very gratifying about this Amazon show is we can know what the end is before we start. It’s a huge thing that’s hard to do when you’re doing 22 episodes a season. We were able to work backward from the ending and put in little Easter eggs. And you can have people swear, which is nice."
15011,How did you and Alan come up with the premise for a show that primarily focuses on only two characters portrayed by Maya and Fred? 
15012,Alan had breakfast with Maya and Fred who obviously worked together for many years. They wanted to do a show together. He called me and we just started working on ideas. All they knew is that they were going to be in a show together. 
15013,"We sent them a bunch of ideas, one of which was the very silly premise of, Maya and Fred are ghosts that don’t haunt people. One line. We sort of all laughed at it and asked what other emotional pours could drive a show. We started talking about marriage and other ideas, like what would happen if you were stuck in a long-term relationship, literally forever. What if nothing was ever going to change? Are people meant to be together for the rest of their lives? We had those questions at the core of this show. "
15014,"You’re pulling at relatable feelings in the series: isolation; fear of commitment, fear of being stuck in a routine. "
15015,"We’re trying to portray both sides of a marriage, which is you do sometimes feel alone and bored but also the next day you feel you’re with someone you want to stay with the rest of your life. An opening montage that opens the series portrays that these are two people who, No. 1, love each other, but have been through ups and downs like anyone who’s been together for 15 years has. There’s a time when you’re happy when you’re bored. For us, ultimately we believe Oscar and June are right for each other and should be together. That’s the discovery they go through over the course of the season."
15016,"The show goes through moments that can be pretty heavy, but the humor is hidden within. What went into the decision to make this darker than your previous comedies? "
15017,"There’s no reason to be afraid of a little bit of drama. Good comedy has emotions at the heart of it. We wanted this to feel as real as possible . . . Given some of the themes here, this show doesn’t lend itself to a straight-line joke pace. We wanted to slow things down and we wanted emotions to feel real. I call it almost reaching for a joke, you really bend the language so someone said something funny. That’s hard to do but hopefully we got there. "
15018,"Did you shoot “Forever” with the vision that it would stand alone, or is there room to expand upon and explain this series in a second season? "
15019,"We are more than open to future seasons. For us, this show is ultimately about a relationship in a marriage between two people who are trying to figure themselves out . . . we’ve got a bunch of ideas for interesting things for them to go through as they find themselves in this new world. "
15020,"For those who’ve actually seen the series, how would you decode the open-ended finale? "
15021,"In my mind, what’s happening there is they see something; they’re in a new place and see something they haven’t seen before. What that is, we don’t want to say yet. But, I think we also want you to think they’re in a good place with each other and hopefully what this thing is that they’re seeing will continue to push them in other ways. "

15092,And the winner of the 15th and last season of “American Idol” is: Trent Harmon.
15093,"You won’t be reading those words ever again. Hopefully, you’ll be reading again about the winner. Harmon seems good. But “Idol” is done. A little bit of cultural history and a lot of TV history is done too."
15094,"Harmon was a surprise — or probably wasn’t. Perhaps it doesn’t even matter: Viewers have long since moved past surprises on “American Idol,” because many have long since moved past “American Idol.” Nevertheless, some of us can admit that after 14 years, there still was something sad, sweet, emotional, and above all nostalgic about this final episode. "
15095,"“Idol” did not go quietly into this cool April night at the Dolby Theatre, but characteristically went noisily, gaudily, with the help of smoke, strobes, glitter, former contestants and — yes — President Barack Obama, too, who opened with a taped message that sounded suspiciously like a suggestion to lean Democrat: The show “motivated young Americans to vote, often with enthusiasm. Voting is the most fundamental and sacred right of our democracy.”"
15096,"Did I mention first-year co-host Brian Dunkleman? “No one knows the pain of life without ‘Idol’ more than me,” he quipped. "
15097,"“Idol” history passed before our eyes. Carrie Underwood performed a duet with Keith Urban. Former contestants Katherine McPhee — her tresses long and blond — and Casey James (his surprisingly brown) did as well. Clay Aiken went solo. Scotty McCreery joined a crowd. Ruben Studdard and Amber Holcomb were a duo, Taylor Hicks and LaToya London too. Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia and London were a trio. Chris Daughtry seemed to be everywhere and with everyone. Five former winners performed a tribute to David Bowie."
15098,But Jennifer Lopez almost stole the whole show — with the help of a lot of feathered blue boas — and she was just a judge.

15114,"The 28-year-old Brooklyn resident, who used to hop subway cars daily with friends while performing a variety of reggae medleys, impressed the judges during Monday night’s episode of “Idol.” Nabbing herself a pass through to the next round of the reality series, Watty just might become one of the season’s competitors to watch."
15115,"“Oh my gosh, I was a big ball of emotion. It was a nerve-wracking moment to be in that room,” she says, gushing about her experience. Though she’s tried out for “Idol” in the past, this marks the first time she’s made it past the show’s first round of judging."
15116,"Watty chose to perform her own rendition of Bob Dylan’s “Make You Feel My Love” during the audition. Viewers saw judge Lionel Richie take a particular linking to Watty’s performance as the two bonded over their Afros and genre of preference. Her sound gives off a Macy Gray vibe — or, as she puts it, a Passenger-meets-Pharrell Williams-meets-Corinne Bailey Rae vibe."
15117,"“They all thought my tone was very different, very interesting,” she recalls. “I just tried to be me 100 percent and I got it.”"
15118,"As a longtime “American Idol” fan, Watty says hitting this high point in her music career has been “surreal.” Just three years ago she was hopping the cars on L, 5 or S trains with friends to gain performance exposure."
15119,"“We had a short medley prepared and every time the train stopped we’d hop on the next car during nonpeak hours,” she recalls. “I’ve been gigging around the city for a couple of years.”"
15120,"Originally from Anguilla in the Caribbean, Watty, a professional dancer, moved to New York City six years ago and slowly began to find her footing in the entertainment industry. She’s performed regularly at The Bitter End in Greenwich Village, The Blue Note near Washington Square Park and Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side. She’s performed at the U.S. Open since 2016 and, for the first time last year, participated in the Afropunk Battle of the Bands competition in Brooklyn."

15126,"The performer already has two original tracks on Spotify, “Needing You” and “Some One to Know Me.” Her official YouTube page boasts live performances and an original music video for her track “Cry Sometimes,” which she recorded three years ago."

15185,"Definitely. What's great about New York is the diversity of the city. You can do anything or meet anyone at any given time in New York City. For someone who came from a suburb of Cincinnati, it was a big shock.

	  ""At Home with Amy Sedaris"" features a number of guest stars, including Paul Giamatti.        Photo Credit: truTV / Alison Cohen Rosa     "
15199,"Stepping into the set of “At Home With Amy Sedaris” is like entering a dream house that’s one part Martha Stewart, one part Pee-Wee Herman’s playhouse, and all Amy Sedaris. Though the studio is, in reality, located in a rather boring, industrial corner of Manhattan, every detail of the soundstage — from the lampshade covered with hair samples to the walls hand-painted with flowers and the cheese ball with alien googly eyes — was utilized to appear like a homemade fantasy abode for the comedian and DIY queen. "
15200,"“I like a visual show,” Sedaris explains. “There’s just so much to look at, so if you get bored of the dialogue you can just look behind you and maybe it’ll trigger an idea for your house. I wanted everything to be an idea, I wanted everything to be crafted and hand made. Nothing is more impressive than to see all the work that was put into that set.”"
15201,"The set, which was loosely inspired by her own New York City apartment, is Sedaris’ zany take on the homemaking television genre. After previously writing two hilarious (and strangely informative) books on crafting, cooking and hosting — “Simple Times: Crafts for Poor People” and “I Like You: Hospitality Under the Influence” — the “Strangers With Candy” star is channeling Dinah Shore, Julia Child and even Mister Rogers in the new scripted comedy series, which debuts Oct 24. "
15202,"Each of the crafts Sedaris suggests making, and each recipe she demonstrates, she actually has done herself, even if it is a bit absurd. “I like simple crafts and I like practical crafts, like I’ll take a pot holder any day — anything that’s useful,” she says. “I don’t like crafts that just sit on the shelves and collect dust.”"
15203,"Still, make no mistake that this is a comedy show. While Sedaris insists that “there’s some real stuff mixed in with some silly stuff,” each week’s theme takes a strange turn. A classic “cooking for one” episode is derailed by obsessions about a possible date, while the great outdoors episode includes some (literally) out-of-this-world guests. Look closely at the week’s “expert” (think fishmonger) and you might spot an esteemed actor like Paul Giamatti or Michael Shannon. "
15204,"Though Sedaris has lived in New York for decades, her home in the show is in a make believe land, with everything self-contained and entirely Sedaris. “I want that effect that’s almost like the bottle in ‘I Dream of Jeannie,’ ” Sedaris explains. “Where it was hot pink and I always loved that feeling like she was in her own environment, like you went into her world when she was in that bottle.”"
15205,"If you jump inside this bottle, you’ll likely leave with quite a few laughs and a couple interior decorating ideas. "

15213,It's almost like the term tall tale was created when describing the legendary life of professional wrestler Andre the Giant.
15214,"We're talking amazing, hard to believe stories, like ones about his epic drinking ability -- it's said that he once drank more than 100 beers in a night."
15215,"Cartoonist Box Brown, a lifelong wrestling fan, has taken up the challenge of chronicling the life of the seven-foot-four wrestler in his new book, ""Andre the Giant: Life and Legend."" He'll be chatting about the book this Friday at Bergen Street Comics in Park Slope."
15216,amNewYork spoke with Brown.
15217, 
15218,How did you come to doing a book about Andre the Giant?
15219,"I am a lifelong wrestling fan but had kind of fallen off the map for most of the 2000s. At some point, probably around 2011, I found myself getting back into wrestling and found that all my favorites were now giving interviews about their lives as pro-wrestlers. I found these to be really fascinating. Sooner or later I found myself looking up stories about Andre and stumbled across the story about him getting a ride to school from Samuel Beckett. I thought: this has to be a comic."
15220,"Grantland's wrestling writer David Shoemaker said to me in an interview that ""Everything that anyone knows about Andre the Giant is a myth. His entire life story is inflated to fit the mythology of the real world monster and I would rather it be that way than the truth."" What is your take about that and how did you go about assembling his life story?"
15221,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
15222,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
15223,I think Mr. Shoemaker is spot on. ... The truth in pro-wrestling is hazy at best and nonexistent at worst. Add to that the fact that any actual story about Andre is naturally unbelievable due to massive size. How often do you see a guy sit down and drink a few cases of beer like they were six packs? The research was certainly difficult to navigate. I just used my best judgment.
15224, 
15225,"Were you a big wrestling fan, and where does Andre stack up in terms of your favorite wrestler?"
15226,"Now I'd have to say that yes he is my favorite, but it wasn't like that when I was growing up. He was a heel when I was a kid. He ripped Hulk Hogan's shirt and crucifix off! As a kid I liked the babyfaces and hated the heels, which is actually how it should be. So my favorites were Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior. Now I appreciate all of the roles that are played."
15227, 
15228,Do you have a favorite moment from Andre's life?
15229,"There are so many. I would say probably WrestleMania III where he fought Hulk Hogan. Andre was in a lot of pain but I think he put his all into that match and they really turned out a gem. And, I think Andre was in his glory."
15230, 
15231,What was the most amazing thing you learned about Andre while doing this book?
15232,"I think there were so many things that were unbelievable. His ability to consumed food and beverage, his amazing strength, etc. But, I think what a learned most about him was how difficult it was for him to navigate this world that's all set up for people of our size. I think that was much more difficult for him that people expect. He was so big and seemed so strong that I'm not sure the average person was as sympathetic to that part of his life."
15233, 
15234,What do you see as the legacy of Andre the Giant?
15235,Andre's legacy in many ways is all that we see before us. There may be an argument to make that says that Hulk Hogan would never have been as big as he was without Andre and the current history of pro-wrestling stems from Hulk Hogan. I think he should be celebrated as the legend that he was.

15246,What if one of those wild nights in Brooklyn in your early 20s ended with a mysterious death?
15247,"In Andrea Bartz’s debut novel, “The Lost Night,” out Tuesday, such is the case for her protagonist, Lindsay, and her crew of friends in 2009. Ten years later, Lindsay reunites with an estranged friend who found the body of her former best friend, raising questions of what actually happened the night all of their lives changed forever."
15248,"Bartz, 32, shared with amNewYork her writing inspiration, why North Brooklyn in its prime is a perfect mystery setting and her current favorite place for writing (and maybe also day drinking)."
15249,Where did you get the idea for “The Lost Night”?
15250,"I started working on this novel about five years ago. I knew I wanted to write a murder mystery because that’s what I love reading. I was looking for a cool setting where there may be some sort of mysterious death. So I thought back to moving to New York at 23: I was working, but my main hobby was going out with my friends, and we spent a lot of time partying in North Brooklyn. It was a crazy time, with warehouse parties and concerts and DIY venues. There was a specific club-culture feeling, like they ruled the world."
15251,The mysterious death takes place at Bushwick’s Calhoun Lofts; how is that location like the infamous McKibbin Lofts?
15252,"The McKibbin Lofts were a dormlike former factory and epicenter for this scene. You could walk in without any plans and find a poetry reading and two different concerts and an EDM dance party. It was an adventure you could have without any idea of where the night would take you. You’d lose your friends and find each other and compare notes. So I thought, what if one of those nights, after all the debauchery, there was a dead body?"

I was looking back at things that happened, little vignettes I wrote, similar to my narrator, Lindsay. When I started writing this book five years ago, it didn't feel that far in the past, so it’s a happy coincidence that it will be published in 2019 — the era now feels special and we can look back nostalgically."
15257,Where in New York do you like to write?
15258,"I do a fair amount of writing at home in Williamsburg. I also really like writing in bars, I’m a night owl. It works for me to go to a place that opens at 2 or 3 [p.m.] and have it to myself for a few hours. Tuffet has great daytime drinking deals and a beautiful patio. I’ll have work dates with friends at Norman in Greenpoint, which has the feeling of a co-working space."
15259,Where do you like to get books?
15260,"I love Word in Greenpoint. And Books are Magic has such an actually magic air, you feel like everyone in there really loves books. I like going to McNally Jackson in the city. I prefer the indie stores, of course, but just being in the Barnes & Noble in Union Square, when I have time to kill in the area, gives me hope about the state of books; it’s always packed. That makes me happy."
15261,What are you reading now?
15262,"“The Winter Sister” by Megan Collins [which] straddles the line between thriller and family drama. It’s beautifully written and eerie and atmospheric. I just started reading “The Age of Light” by Whitney Scharer. What everyone says is true — it’s just incandescent writing, very transportive. And I just went to a book party for a YA book called “Stolen Time” by Danielle Rollins. It’s a time-traveling heist I’m looking forward to reading."
15263,And what are you planning on writing next?
15264,"I’m hard at work revising my second novel, “The Herd,” coming out winter 2020. It also delves deep into female friendships and takes place in New York City. It’s twisty and dark and hopefully funny, and really examines the question of what happens when high-achieving women’s perfect veneers begin to crack."

15321,It's changed in the course of writing this book. My schedule is different and suddenly people want to take 'selfies' with me.
15322,Is 'Real Housewives' the new soap opera?

15348,"Angelina Jolie and her husband, Brad Pitt, aren't afraid to discuss the preventive mastectomy she underwent. Sunday morning, the couple will appear in a joint interview on the ""Today"" show, where they will answer questions about her health, Pitt's support during the situation and their upcoming film, ""By the Sea,"" which Jolie also directed."
15349,"In excerpts from the interview, Jolie says, ""I knew through the surgeries that he was on my side and that this wasn't something where I was gonna feel less of a woman, because my husband wasn't gonna let that happen."""
15350,"Jolie underwent a double mastectomy in 2013 after being diagnosed with a gene that gave her an 87 percent risk of getting breast cancer, a disease that had claimed the lives of her mother and an aunt. Earlier this year, the actress also had her ovaries removed."
15351,"When asked by interviewer Tom Brokaw about his ""role"" during Jolie's ordeal, Pitt responds: ""Whatever's got to be done to keep the family together, and keep the family together as long as possible, is gonna be done. This was her charge, no question. . . . It's a scary decision. There's many things that can go wrong and go many different directions."""
15352,"Brokaw also asks the stars if they think it's a risk to play an unhappily married couple in ""By the Sea,"" which opens Nov. 13. ""I'm counting on the audience to know that if it was close to us at all, we could never make this film,"" Jolie says. ""It's because we're actually very, very stable, and these aren't our issues."""

Joseph McCarthy during the 1950s Red Scare, represented and mentored Trump starting in the early 1970s."
15364,"Cohn (who never admitted being gay before dying of complications from AIDS in 1986) is a central character in “Angels in America,” Tony Kushner’s marathon magnum opus of contemporary American drama, which is now receiving a splashy, sleek and stunning Broadway revival (25 years since its New York premiere) with an outstanding cast led by Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield."
15365,"The production (which originated at London’s National Theatre) is directed by Marianne Elliott (“The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,” “War Horse”)."
15366,"“Angels in America” is comprised of two separate four-hour parts (“Millennium Approaches,” “Perestroika”) that combine realistic drama with trippy hallucinations, ghosts and monologues. The show, which is subtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,” dramatizes the early days of the AIDS crisis in 1980s New York while also analyzing the public and private institutions that fundamentally affect American life."
15367,"“Millennium Approaches,” generally considered the better-written part, contains one of the most striking scenes of all time: a giant winged angel crashes through the bedroom ceiling of Prior Walter, a sensitive and stylish young man suffering from AIDS. “Very Steven Spielberg,” Prior comments. And the angel declares “Greetings Prophet. The Great Work begins. The Messenger has arrived.” End of scene."
15368,"In addition to Cohn (Lane) and Prior (Garfield), key characters include Prior’s hyperactive and high-strung ex-boyfriend Louis (James McArdle), the vulnerable Mormon law clerk Joe (Lee Pace), Joe’s desperate, Valium-addicted wife Harper (Denise Gough) and the tough but compassionate African-American nurse Belize (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett)."

15402,"On rare occasions, a piece of theater can become even more relevant than its creators expected it to be due to recent events in the world -- to the point of being downright eerie."
15403,"For example, just a few days after the president's announcement that two civilian hostages were accidentally killed in a drone strike targeting terrorists, George Brant's engrossing one-woman drama about a military drone pilot engaged in anti-terrorist operations -- starring Anne Hathaway and directed by Julie Taymor -- has opened at the Public Theater."
15404,"At the start, Hathaway, wearing an Air Force uniform, is like a female version of Tom Cruise's Maverick in ""Top Gun"" -- a cocky fighter pilot who loves her job, being one of the guys and the sensation of being up in the sky. But soon enough, she meets a nice guy in a bar and finds herself pregnant. After her daughter is born, she is reassigned to operating a remote-controlled drone aircraft from a military base outside Las Vegas."
15405,"Although she initially chides ""Chair Force"" work as beneath her, these long shifts of sitting in a chair, operating a joystick, and obsessively watching images of moving targets take hold of her mentally and emotionally. When she finally receives clearance to strike a suspected terrorist, a young civilian unexpectedly gets in the way."
15406,"Rather than debate the success or legality of drone warfare, ""Grounded"" is intended to dramatically and psychologically explore an individual engaged in it -- and it is undoubtedly successful at that."
15407,"Hathaway delivers a highly committed and aggressive performance throughout. Taymor, whose visual effects-loaded productions have included ""The Lion King"" and ""Spider-Man,"" creates a thrilling stream of video images around a bare stage, bringing the audience even deeper into the character journey."

In addition to the thundering ovations that showered its final performance on Sunday, numerous industry figures paid tribute to the show on Facebook. “Even in the coldblooded Darwinian commercial universe of today’s Great White Way, this show deserved a better fate,” actor Nick Wyman wrote. “A very sad testament to the current state of Broadway that this exquisite show will not be seen by more people,” music producer Kurt Deutsch wrote."

15513,"“These two worlds work great together,” he says, explaining that he uses music in his office to help ease that common fear of visiting the dentist. “I’ve been told my singing helps them focus on something else and is a nice surprise.”"

15536,"The movie is funny and truthful, equipped with a keen evocation of the very specific urban pressures that put Shirin in a rather desperate place. ""Appropriate Behavior"" is a true multicultural comedy, equally at home in its hipster Brooklyn and Iranian immigrant settings, taking a loving and scornful look at both."
15537,"It's no easy feat to carve something original out of such clichéd territory; Akhavan manages it, blending the two worlds with a vision that is centered on a strong sense of the ways disparate, clashing worlds so often shape who we are and who we want to be."

It was the band's DIY approach, however, aided in large part by careful use of the Internet, that helped propel the band to early success. The Arctic Monkeys utilized their website by letting fans download tracks for free. By the time they signed with Domino records, the fan base was already deeply entrenched in their music, allowing for a seamless transition to No. 1 upon the album's release. (2006)"

15597,"Back when PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were as new as PS4 and Xbox One, the first ""Assassin's Creed"" hit the market and created a fascinating new franchise. A sequel released two years later has stood as the best iteration in the franchise ever since. That's not for lack of trying on the part of publisher Ubisoft, which has put forth yearly entries ever since, most of which have been good but not great."
15598,"If anything is to be learned from this anecdote -- and from playing the newest PS4 and Xbox One iteration ""Assassin's Creed: Unity"" -- it would be that the franchise should take a year off and polish the game to create the best experience possible."
15599,"""Unity,"" which released on Nov. 11, is the low point for the franchise despite a bevy of very likable inclusions."
15600,"Players take control of Arno Dorian, a young man coming of age as the French Revolution comes to a boil. As is the series' custom when playing as a new character, Arno joins the Brotherhood of Assassins and takes up arms against the Templar Order while seeking revenge for the man who raised him."
15601,The story itself doesn't stand out -- and it's conclusion is very unsatisfying -- and it's characters aren't the most interesting in the series. Arno's love interest Elise often is along for the ride. She's an uncommonly strong female supporting character -- for a video game -- which is worth noting.
15602,"Oh, and everyone in France speaks with an English accent, a strange and off-putting choice given that developer Ubisoft Montreal makes its home in French Canada. Would French accents been so hard to integrate? At least Ezio Auditore da Firenze, the hero of the Italian Renaissance series iterations of a few years ago, sounded vaguely Italian when he spoke."
15603,"If ""Unity's"" story isn't the most interesting, at least the missions are. Stealth is more of a focus than ever, which is a welcome addition. Assassinations, which often close out chapters, play out in a mini-sandbox that offer multiple approaches to taking out a target, often with satisfying results."
15604,"That's provided the game's controls hold up, which isn't always the case. Long-standing issues with the way your character uses cover and climbs objects in the environment often lead to frustration and mission failure. An added ability to intuitively descend from high buildings safely and quickly works, but it's easy to get stuck simply running through areas that have railings or other protrusions from the ground."

Multiple attempts to play both with friends and random online partners glitched in various ways, including no prompt for the next objective or simply aborting back to single-player mode. It's a shame, as this mode has so much potential to be great if it's sorted out."
15608,"Bear in mind that all these troublesome issues and glitches continue to crop up after a day-one patch and a second patch a few days later. A third patch is pending, according to Ubisoft, but that won't soothe hurt feelings among the early adopters."
15609,"At least the backdrop is gorgeous. The graphics easily are the greatest achievement in ""Unity,"" and Paris looks and feels like a next-gen setting. From the abundant crowds in rebellion to the beautiful landmarks, it's all delicious eye candy."
15610,"With any luck, the next major ""Assassin's Creed"" will come two years from now and gamers will be treated to a game that feels like a fresh start that takes what worked in ""Unity"" and fixes what didn't. Maybe that release will top ""Assassin's Creed 2."" This one sure didn't."

15668,"Bunn, 42, an assistant professor of dramatic and screen writing at Cornell University, also co-wrote the screenplay for the 2013 movie, ""Kill Your Darlings"" starring Daniel Radcliffe, and lives with his partner, the film producer Bob Hazen, in Astoria."
15669,"Bunn will be reading from and discussing his new anthology at Book Culture, 450 Columbus Ave. at 7 p.m. Tuesday (Sept. 22), with essayist Leslie Jamison."
15670,"There is also an HBO television show called ""The Brink"": Coincidence?"
15671,"The book and television show have nothing to do with each other! The real mystery to me is why no one used this title before. The show is about geopolitical brinkmanship and my book is more, well, one reviewer called it ""pre-apocalyptic""- what happens before the massive explosion. I'll take it!"
15672,Some of your stories involve gay characters or touch on themes of same sex love or attraction but they are not remotely reverential and often hilarious. Is it a sign of progress that gay writers no longer need to be earnest about same sex attraction and love?
15673,"Yes! For sure! Great books were written in the periods when being gay was illegal and prosecutable, but younger people have an appetite for different kinds of stories. HIV and AIDS required people to be honest and bold about intimacy and what it meant. Front and center now is being more irreverent. There is a lot more acceptance now but the next frontier is internalized homophobia: making peace with ourselves and who we really are. The best gay writers have always had a freedom to explore all aspects of sexuality: For us, it's a place of emancipation and political energy."
15674,"Did you ever go to one of those earnest gay kumbaya retreats as described in ""Curious Father,"" where ""men go outside to get inside""?"

15677,"No, but I had a boyfriend who did: Every gay person goes through that process of working it out, and he had no one in his world who was supportive. The most autobiographical story in the collection is ""How to Win an Unwinnable War."" My father did a lot of things -- he was a teacher, a limo driver, a security guard and a house painter. When my parents got divorced I took one of those classes in nuclear warfare for gifted children. The point, of course, was that there was no way to win a nuclear war. And we had a kid in that class with cystic fibrosis who was kind of a jerk: I wanted to make a story out of that situation and show how every character is flawed, but also has strengths."
15678,"So many of your stories -- a father finding his daughter's dead baby in the basement, a honeymooning couple discovering that the supposedly idyllic island they're on is a target of terrorism, a couple in a cult deciding whether to commit suicide -- seem inspired by real life events. What is the role of the news in your fiction?"
15679,"""The Worst You Can Imagine Is Where This Starts"" was inspired by a story I read in West Michigan about a father who found a dead baby in his basement and reported it. His daughter, though, was eventually jailed for infanticide. I was an intern for Newsweek and worked at the Village Voice in the late 1990s and wrote for other places. I love journalism and I love the real world. Journalism is very good at inhabiting all the facts, but doesn't permit the psychology of the 'why' as fiction can. Some magazine published pictures of all the people who died in the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. They were all these forty-something people -- but two of them were young. I just started wondering: What if these two people were involved and their affection for each other was at war with the tenets of the cult? That became (the story) ""The End of the Age is Upon Us."" But like any good journalist, I love research. A story like this writes itself if you do the research! All those sermons of (cult leader) Marshall Applewhite are still on line. The facts and what happened there are more crazy and delightfully weird than anything I could have invented."
15680,The Internet has made research easy but is also thought to have eroded our appetite for reading books.
15681,"Most people prefer to pick up their phone to reading a book. But there is a lot of reading going on in the Internet in memoirs and blogs, for example. One of the advantages of the short stories in my book is they're very fast reads, and hopefully entertaining: I'm hoping they might lure people who might not pick up a big, heavy book into reading. It's a paperback -- Harper Perennial only does paperbacks -- so it's light. We really need to be ambassadors to literature; introduce people to the right books to get them hooked."
15682,Is it possible to make a living writing short stories?
15683,"Were it to be so! Short stories especially are really a sort of nonprofit hobby I find myself unable to give up. The people I know who are just prose or poetry writers all have teaching jobs. Some writers can live off their novels. The authors who wrote the Divergent and The Hunger Games books can do so -- their novels were actually doing really well even before the movies -- but the number of those people is equivalent to the number of people who win the lottery. That's OK with me, though, because writing alone is not a rich enough life. I'm now coproducing a short film, ""In the Hollow,"" a kind of documentary hybrid, about this notorious shooting of two women (in a hate crime that left one woman dead and her partner severely injured) in 1988. It's making the film festival circuit right now. You don't make a lot of money, but you win a prize!"
15684,"You write films, too."
15685,"Fiction is for presenting an inner life, but film is not good for that: Film has more to do with action and spectacle. I like both -- I'm a moving target that way. Lots of creative people are drawn to more than one form."
15686,"Your stories are imbued with a lack of orthodoxy, yet manage to contain believable surprise and ""aha"" payoffs. ""When You Are the Final Girl"" seems to be horror story about a girl who will be raped and possibly killed; then you flip the script and take us some place far more poignant, surprising and sad than where we thought we were going."
15687,"I'm very, very touched. That is exactly what I was hoping readers would experience. It's two plots. Horror stories always have these dual plots: One is: The monster is going to kill the girl! The other is: What made the monster? This is what about what made that scar. Ethan Canin taught a class I had in grad school and talked about dilating time. I just kept dilating the moment before the (protagonist's auto) accident to get to his motivation."
15688,Do you have a theory on what a story should deliver?
15689,"One of the things that obsesses me is range: How much can one writer reflect? I never wanted to be the kind of writer who tills the same ground over and over. My mother is a language teacher and I'm fascinated by voice. I like range, voices, topicality and American life: Covering all the ways people make their lives work. A good story for me has to do with a person encountering a crisis and making a choice. It involves transformation: the choice to be a different kind of person or not. But that is one of the hardest things! How many moments of absolute change are there in life? Stories should move us. So there needs to be a climactic decision about something important."

15699, What are you reading now?
15700,"“The Mars Room,” which is Rachel Kushner’s most recent novel. I was persuaded to read it by [Dwight Garner’s] rave review in The New York Times. I’m also reading “The Saturdays,” an old children’s book, with both of my kids. It’s charming and lovely: It’s about a family with four kids who live uptown in 1930s New York and they have these amazing adventures. We’re all really enjoying it. "
15701," Where do you like to buy, or borrow, your books? "
15702,"I am the worst, I buy so many books. My kids patronize the Brooklyn Public Library, but I do have a rule that books are the one thing I let them buy whenever they ask. But I am not a library user because I am someone who loves to own my books. I have a local bookstore, a branch of Greenlight Bookstore, I’ve spent a fortune there. I also spend a lot of time and money at Books Are Magic, my friend Emma Straub’s store in Cobble Hill. They do amazing events. I go at least once a month and I feel like I always leave with a couple of books."

15706,"Until I started my new job, I was writing mostly at home. There’s a coffee shop in my neighborhood, Starliner, where I’d work on revisions for the novel that’s about to come out. It always turned into a very expensive proposition though because I feel a moral obligation to buy something every hour or so. Another one of my favorite things to do is going to an unpopular restaurant — I like kind of bad restaurants — and sitting down and having a really early dinner and a drink and just work. It’s a great way to get away from my desk and my house, because then I can’t distract myself with doing the dishes or making the bed or whatever. "
15707, What do you bring with you when you go out to write?
15708,"A lot of my process, which is not very environmentally friendly, is to print draft after draft after draft and scribble all over it and read it aloud. Sometimes I just read out loud like a crazy person. That’s one of the great things about living in New York; no one is fazed when you behave that way. "
15709, What are you writing now? 
15710,"I am working on what will be my third book, someday. It’s still very early. I feel like I’m in a holding pattern and I’m doing a lot more reading. I go through these periods when I get really interested in binge reading. I tend to do that when I’m gearing up to write, like a bear eating a lot before hibernating. "

15740,"""Age of Ultron"" has all the things you want out of a summer blockbuster: familiarity, fluid action and comedy. The globe-trotting plot takes the Avengers from threat to threat battling Ultron (motion-captured and voiced by a brilliant James Spader) and his mechanized militia."
15741,"The movie starts out in Eastern Europe, where the Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), a Hydra operative, is experimenting with Loki's scepter -- the big MacGuffin everyone is after here -- to give people powers. The Avengers attack to get the scepter and face off with two of his successes: The Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who has hypnosis and telekinesis powers, and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who is super fast."
15742,"After the Avengers successfully acquire the scepter, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) secretly use the magic gem inside it to create an artificial intelligence as part of a global defense program.

15743,"The creation of Ultron eventually leads to the creation of The Vision (Paul Bettany), an ethereal, powerful android that matches up nicely against Ultron. Cue the big fight."
15744,"Spader's Ultron is the real marvel of this movie. Not unlike Spader's ""Boston Legal"" lawyer character Alan Shore, the pensive monster holds court with an entrancing vocal delivery. The performance is amped up with an inhuman, stilted gait. Should the Academy ever be willing to acknowledge or consider a CGI role for an Oscar, Spader's performance is certainly deserving of a Best Supporting Role nomination."
15745,"There's a lot going on in the jam-packed 141-minute run time, but writer/director Joss Whedon knows how to tell a story and balances the fisticuffs with some tender and funny moments. All the characters in the overloaded cast get their moments. And some of the best scenes in the film are the quieter ones that take place at a remote country house.

Since 2003, it has journeyed from Off-Broadway’s Vineyard Theatre to Broadway’s Golden Theatre and then Off-Broadway’s New World Stages. This week, its producers announced that “Avenue Q” will close for good on April 28, 2019. “The show gave audiences the opportunity to laugh, escape from the outside world for two hours and have tons of fun,” the producers said in a statement, adding “sometimes it takes a puppet to make us realize how remarkable, complicated and messy it is to be human.”"

This marks the first major staging of ""Oklahoma!"" to play New York since the 2002 Broadway revival. Daniel Fish (who is known for experimental work that combines elements of theater, film and opera) has set the musical in a large, wooden communal hall.

Except this one has Ansari, and his specific style, and observational ken."
15813,"It also has his writing: Some of these lines or riffs almost certainly began life in some Ansari standup routine, except this time he has props to work off of -- an entire borough, and its denizens, familiar Brooklyn archetypes that almost seem to be begging for an Ansari workover.

15823,"Legendary guitarist B.B. King, the recipient of more than a dozen Grammy Awards and an inductee of both the blues and the rock and roll halls of fame, was hospitalized over the weekend, according to a report."
15824,A representative for the 89-year-old King of the Blues told TMZ.com on Monday that King remained hospitalized at a medical center near his home in Las Vegas.
15825,"Although the rep did not state the cause, King was diagnosed in 1990 with type 2 diabetes, and has been a spokesman for the LifeScan OneTouch Ultra blood glucose meter. He performed more than 70 concerts during a tour last year, but was forced to cancel an Oct. 3 show at Chicago's House of Blues and the tour's eight remaining shows when he felt ill and was diagnosed with dehydration and exhaustion."

15827,"King, whose countless awards include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, is the namesake behind the line of B.B. King Blues Club & Grill, which began in Memphis in 1991. Its Times Square club, the third, opened in 2000."
15828,"Last April, King was heckled at a concert at St. Louis' Peabody Opera House after he rambled, sometimes inaudibly, onstage, played a shaky song 45 minutes into the set, and continued to behave oddly through the show."
15829,"Days later, he apologized and his representative issued a statement saying that the diabetic King had ""mistakenly missed a dose of his prescribed medication on the show day. The combination of the rigors of the very long drive [to the venue] and high blood sugar due to his medication error resulted in a performance that did not match Mr. King's usual standard of excellence."""

15858,"The best horror movies aspire to more than just scaring the audience. No other genre is more ideally suited to reflect the deepest and darkest sides of existence, the terrible feelings and impulses that we spend our lives submerging, in an exploration of what the film theorist Robin Wood deemed ""the actual dramatization of the dual concept of the repressed/the Other in the figure of the Monster."""
15859,"They just don't get better than ""The Babadook,"" a new film from Australian writer-director Jennifer Kent that finds this inherently cinematic genre in peak form."

15861,"It will one day be ranked in the pantheon of horror classics alongside ""The Shining,"" ""The Exorcist"" and others. It's that great."
15862,"Essie Davis plays single mom Amelia, struggling to care for her troubled son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) who must grapple with an ominous supernatural force in their house."
15863,What sounds like a conventional horror setup is in fact merely the blueprint for a story that unfolds between the lines of the plot.
15864,"It's a film about the anxiety of a mother who can't bring herself to feel the way she should about her son, for complicated and tragic reasons. The picture is built around that notion, in darkened and shadowy rooms, with increasingly ominous images and discordant sounds reflecting a tortured state of mind."
15865,"The movie is extraordinarily evocative, with Kent in total command as she illustrates the instability and isolation that are the essence of this narrative. The Babadook, the terror tormenting this mother and son, is heard in a creaking voice and seen only in quick bursts. The movie isn't showy: There's a consistent focus on these characters, their backstory and the ways they are affected by this dangerous situation."

15881, 
15882,"Mike Scardino spent his college summers working on an ambulance in New York City, where he encountered scenes too gruesome to forget. He recounts them in morbid detail in his debut memoir, “Bad Call,” out this week. The Queens native spoke with amNewYork."
15883, The book takes place from 1967 to 1970. How did you remember the stories so well?
15884,"Most of them were pretty unforgettable, and I’ve been telling them to my friends and family for years. I also have a lot of letters that I wrote my wife, and a lot of the stories that are in there are almost identical to the way I wrote them in the book. When I finally found the letters, I found out they lined up pretty much exactly with what my memories of the calls were."
15885, Why did you decide to write it after all these years?
15886,"I had been trying for quite a while, and it was one of these things — “Well, I need a new computer. Well, I don’t like that keyboard.” So one night I was watching this movie called “Wings of Desire” that “City of Angels” is based on, a German movie, and it had all kinds of techniques — stream of consciousness, omniscient observer and everything. Nothing in the movie specifically helped me, but I said, “You know, I can write this any way I want.” So I decided to do a first-person narrative as if I were going through each call, as if I were talking to a roommate in college or my wife or one of my family members and telling them what had happened. And the more I kind of visually took myself through each call, the more I actually remembered."
15887, Which was your favorite chapter to write?
15888,"My favorite chapter is Spare Change. I was very much disturbed by a call we had where a woman had just been thrown out on the street by her family, and it just struck me that, what the hell is this person gonna do? You see homeless people all the time. You never really see them at the moment that they become homeless. Even Robinson Crusoe, when he washed up on shore, he looked back and said, “Oh, there’s the ship with all the stuff I need. I can go out and get that.” But this woman had absolutely nothing. She wouldn’t say where she lived, she wouldn’t say who threw her out. You would come into these people’s lives at these critical moments as it was with this woman, and as soon as you go, it’s like, what the heck is gonna happen to this person? And you know, it bothers you."

15892,"Now they can do EKGs, they can transmit information to the hospital, they can give meds now. We couldn’t give anybody anything. Absolutely nothing. So a lot of it depended on speed. We could do things like try to stop hemorrhaging and things like that, but basically the key there was getting people back as soon as possible. I had no idea I would see so many dead people as I did. That was always kind of a shock, the enormous numbers of people every week that would die."
15893, Who are your biggest literary inspirations?
15894,"I loved 18th-century prose, poetry and drama because it was a really humanist era and people just kind of looked at life with a very cold eye. I loved “Tom Jones,” for example. I love Shakespeare. I wish I could be a poet. I do quote William Faulkner in the book saying that a novelist is a failed poet, and when I read poetry and I see how concisely they can put an image on paper, I think, “Gee, I wish I could do that.” In lieu of that, I just try and write it normally."

	  Bambara's live sound is different experience to that produced in the studio, says drummer Blaze Bateh.        Photo Credit: Kelsey Wagner     "
15947,"Athens-born and Brooklyn-based doom rock trio Bambara built their last album, “Swarm,” around a broken city landscape, creating the sound of an urban apocalypse. It only makes sense, then, that its follow-up, ""Shadow on Everythng,"" would be a loose concept album about a western town, one that conjures thoughts of Sam Peckinpah rather than John Wayne. But the album’s formation was maybe closer to David Byrne’s “True Stories,” a compilation of tabloid stories moved to one Texas town. "
15948,"“My brother [Reid Bateh, the band’s main lyricist] developed it just from hearing stories from people about a specific town out west, and he adapted them and made his own world,” says drummer Blaze Bateh. "
15949,"amNewYork caught up with the latter Bateh to chat about dark turns, dark moods and translating all of it live. "
15950,"When writing an album that’s conceived around a “western” theme, does that idea spread into the music subconsciously? "
15951,"Even in our previous album, we kind of established a little bit of a western twang. But it’s hard to say. It definitely could have led to us using more of that, to help build this world in the desert. But it’s definitely not something that we plan to abandon for the next record if the lyrics don’t pertain to that atmosphere. I think it’s worked its way into being a huge part of our sound at this point. "
15952,"There’s a lot of different instrumentation on this record for a three-piece, independent band. "
15953,"One of our goals for the album was that, if we had an idea, we wanted to let go of the limitations of a three-piece band. Let’s just see it through the recording, and we’ll figure it out later. Live now we play as a five-piece, but we’re still a three-piece in the studio. On songs like “Wild Fires” or “Backyard,” where the horns are pretty heavy, it’s a challenge to transpose those into the guitar or use noise collages to fill it in. It’s not the exact sounds you hear on the record, but it still has the effect and the punch. We like to think of our live show as a totally different experience anyway — it’s visceral and intense. "

15991,"A series about a hit man that doesn’t skimp on the gore can’t be humorous, can it? HBO’s newest half-hour script “Barry,” by “Saturday Night Live” alum Bill Hader and “Silicon Valley’s” Alec Berg, aims to hit that dramedy mash-up genre. "
15992,"“I think it’s going to surprise audiences how dark it does go. The humor sort of trickles in and catches you off guard,” says actress Sarah Goldberg, who plays one of the show’s theater buffs, Sally Reed. "
15993,"The series finds a Marine-turned-hit man tied in with the sketchiest of members of the Chechen mob. Barry, played by Hader, follows a mark to a Los Angeles acting class (led by Henry Winkler) where he suddenly decides to try his hand at theater because, well, why not? "
15994,"Realizing his career path has left him feeling rather empty, Barry runs into trouble when he tries to ditch the mob bosses to chase stardom. "
15995,Hader says the idea for the script came to him from his personal struggle with anxiety while performing on “Saturday Night Live.” The 39-year-old comedian left his post on the sketch comedy show in 2013 after eight years. 
15996,"“The longer I was on the show, the better I was getting at doing it but that anxiety didn’t go away. It was actually getting worse,” Hader explains. “So, ‘Barry’ takes the idea that the thing you’re good at is destroying you, in some ways.” "
15997,"Barry decides to hang around with a theater class in between stints as a trained assassin because acting provides the “healing” ability to drop one perception of yourself and pick up another, Hader explains. "

16000,"“It’s also the polar opposite of being a hit man,” he notes. “Acting encourages you to explore your emotions, to feel them to their fullest extent, all the things Barry’s been avoiding for years.” "
16001,"When we first meet Barry, his emotional range is seriously lacking … and for good reason. He finds friendship with a group of acting hopefuls who can go from hysterics to laughter at the snap of a finger while a look of apparent indifference remains plastered on his face. The hit man’s new theater pal and possible love interest Sally adds a vibrant personality to the monotone Barry that balances out the script. "
16002,"“Sally gets all the goods. She’s suddenly got somebody there who’s worshipping her. She’s looking for a someone who’s looking to be the wallpaper while she shines,” Goldberg says. "
16003,"Barry serves as the perfect sidekick for a self-involved actress with a big heart. When Barry first meets Sally, she’s is a bit too busy chasing her own dreams to dig into his violent past or even notice what danger may be lurking in the shadows. "
16004,"“She’s got these two very polarizing sides and one is the really confident self-assured star of the class, and one is the girl lost in the world who’s floundering and being exploited,” Goldberg says. “We get to see her in public and private and see what sides of her come out in those episodes.” "
16005,"Hader adds: “Barry’s never really hung out with actors before, and he thinks Sally is the greatest actress he’s ever seen. For Barry, he gets to hang around with Sally, and for Sally, Barry gives her the audience and the adulation she needs to help fight her own insecurities.” "
16006,"That’s nice and all, but Barry’s Chechen mob ties are bound to catch up with his new pal eventually … right? "
16007,“Barry” airs Sundays at 10:30 p.m. on HBO.

16026,Directed by: Mimi Leder
16027,"Starring: Felicity Jones, Armie Hammer, Justin Theroux"
16028,Rated: PG-13
16029,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg is having quite the pop cultural moment, as the subject of documentaries, merchandise and ""Saturday Night Live"" sketches, with millions keeping the sort of close watch on her health normally reserved for a loved one."
16030,"""On the Basis of Sex,"" starring Felicity Jones as the Supreme Court justice at the beginning of her activist lawyer career, doesn't necessarily add anything new to the conversation. But as directed by Mimi Leder, it hits its dramatic and emotional marks with aplomb."
16031,"It's an old-fashioned crowd-pleaser in the best possible sense: let's be honest, if you're going to make a traditional Hollywood movie about an underdog fighting an unjust system, it'd be tough to find a more appropriate subject."
16032,"Felicity Jones plays Ginsburg as the screenplay by Daniel Stiepelman traces her life from her first year at Harvard Law School through the frustrating experience of trying to find a job as a woman and a lawyer in 1960s New York City, her arrival at Rutgers University and, finally, a deep dive into the transformative Moritz v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service case challenging gender discrimination precedent that made her name."
16033,"The filmmakers take a straightforward approach to this story, with the events unfolding in a linear fashion, but sometimes that's all you need. The odds facing Ginsburg are enhanced by visual flourishes, such as images in which she's awash in a sea of besuited men. Her relationship with husband Marty (Armie Hammer) is affectingly presented here as a partnership of equals and the actors share quiet, vulnerable moments that are genuinely moving."
16034,"Most importantly, the keys to the success of ""On the Basis of Sex"" can be found in the way it distills complicated legal theories into palatable, commercial chunks and in how it presents its trailblazing protagonist as a real-life superhero. This might not be the most complex or nuanced way of telling this story, but it is legitimately thrilling to watch Jones' passionate, studious Ginsburg smartly and shrewdly annihilate the patriarchal obstacles standing in her way."

16046,"“Be More Chill” had a brief run at a regional NJ theater four years ago, but the sci-fi high school musical didn’t disappear thanks to ravenous fans on social. Their influence helped resurrect the play, which appeared Off-Broadway in 2018. Now on The Great White Way, it’s already set a house record at the Lyceum Theatre — and implanted SQUIPs (Super Quantum Unit Intel Processors) into the brains of thousands of fans."
16047,"Drawing upon interviews — with creator Joe Iconis, director Stephen Brackett and actor Jason Tam (Squip) — and viewings of both the Off-Broadway and Broadway versions, Matt and Meghan want your questions — including on what to expect from the enhanced, newest rendition."

16057,There's a universal feeling of striving to find your best self that’s strung throughout a handful of high school musicals currently thriving on Broadway.
16058,"The latest, “Be More Chill,” isn’t just centered around introspective teenage characters: It’s found new life through theatergoers far younger than the Broadway average. And if it weren’t for those fans, the musical — which premiered and closed after a short, local run four years ago — may have never seen that larger stage."
16059,"""Be More Chill,"" with music and lyrics by Joe Iconis and book by Joe Tracz, is reaping the benefits of a relatively new period where the average ticket holder — a middle-class white woman in her 40s — isn’t the norm in every audience. Following a sold-out Off-Broadway run, the musical moves to the big stage, where it’s being embraced as a cult favorite by high school- and college-aged theatergoers."
16060,"""We watched this fandom build. I wish I could say there was some mastermind behind all of this, but it was really, truly organic."" "
16061,"In its first week in previews on the Great White Way, the show broke a house ticket sales record, tracked a 98-percent nightly sell-out and had to relocate its stage-door entrance to contain fan mobs."
16062,"“It’s been so surreal and gratifying to see actual young people relate to the show,” Iconis says. “I spent so long saying to people, ‘if young people would ever be tricked into coming to the theater, I think they’d really like this.’"""
16063,"The production joins several others encapsulating the high school experience onstage — “Mean Girls,"" “Dear Evan Hansen"" and ""The Prom” included — all of which debuted while Broadway experiences a demographic shift."
16064,"The 2017-2018 season saw the highest number of teenage ticket holders ever: 2.1 million, compared to 1.6 million the season prior. According to data collected by The Broadway League, Broadway is literally becoming more chill."
16065,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
16066,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
16067,"“Our audience has consistently been getting younger, and 25 percent of our audience is under the age of 25,” says Charlotte St. Martin, president of The Broadway League, which tracks ticket sales data and leads programs to boost Broadway's exposure. "
16068,"Tom Melcher, who runs Manhattan-based theater review site Show Score, echoes her sentiment, saying we’re experiencing a “clear renaissance or reemergence of passion for musical theater among younger people.”"
16069,"But “Be More Chill” is not solely attracting younger crowds. Instead, it’s managing to diversify and balance the average theater audience, bringing together fans young and old."
16070,"“Even though it’s technically about young people, the deeper meaning of what’s going on is something that’s not exclusive to them,” says Iconis, a Long Island native. “I’ve always thought of it as a show about anxiety and depression and pressure and all of these huge issues disguised as a teenage sci-fi musical comedy.”"
16071,Social ‘Chill’ down
16072,"On a Saturday afternoon, the “Be More Chill” audience ranges from grade schoolers to senior citizens — all bobbing their heads along to catchy tunes and laughing in agreement at embarrassing teen moments. It’s a 180-degree shift from the play's mediocre premiere run in New Jersey four years ago."
16073,"It received an adequate review in The New York Times, but closed after a four-week run in Red Bank."
16074,"Then, social media took over."
16075,"First, it was Tumblr posts, then Instagram fan art, Reddit discussions, Spotify streams and YouTube covers. Before long, teens across the country were singing George Salazar’s “Michael in the Bathroom” without having seen the show."
16076,"“I think the gateway drug for ‘Be More Chill’ has been ‘Michael in the Bathroom,’” Iconis says of the song about a teen experiencing anxiety at a house party. “That’s a song that kids gravitate toward because they relate to what’s going on under the lyrics.”"
16077,"Lauren Ealy, 19, who runs a “Be More Chill” Facebook fan group, traveled from Vancouver, Canada, to see the musical during its Off-Broadway run in September, after originally “falling in love” with the show on Tumblr in 2017."
16078,"""We watched this fandom build,"" director Stephen Brackett says. ""I wish I could say there was some mastermind behind all of this, but it was really, truly organic."""
16079,Marketing angst
16080,"Broadway shifted into the social sphere in the early 2000s, with major networks bringing series like “Glee” and “Smash” to younger viewers’ living rooms. Then there were live theater TV specials (""Sound of Music,"" ""Hairspray""), and productions like “Hamilton,” which saw the major impact the internet has on the stage through use of ticket lotteries, hashtags and influencer marketing."
16081,"Nick Sala, who serves as the company manager for Inside Broadway, an educational nonprofit that teams up with schools (including Bronx Theatre High School and Manhattan East) to bring students to productions, says many kids already know the shows well before they arrive."

"
16083,"“And they didn’t learn about it from us,” he says. “They know it from the marketing teams, who get the word out on social media. Kids are watching, they’re sharing and responding to it.”"
16084,"With a direct line to a “chiller” audience, Broadway struck gold. “Be More Chill” hit $300,000 ticket sales on the first day of its Off-Broadway run with zero marketing costs."
16085,"Following an organic start, “Be More Chill” and other teen-centric productions have made more conscious efforts to target and engage with younger audiences online. They’ve even offered ways to combat the obvious financial gap between teen and adult fans."
16086,"“Chill” offered discounted tickets to those under the age of 30, accepted YouTube video submissions to an online karaoke contest, and released a cast album before opening on Broadway. Other youth-targeted productions, like “Mean Girls,"" have employed similar strategies by offering digital lotteries targeted toward the tech-savvy and giving fans direct access to their favorite stars through Instagram takeovers."
16087,"""Age is not a predictor of taste."""
16088,Minding the age gap
16089,"Still, director Stephen Brackett credits the “outpouring of love” for “Chill” and other youth-oriented musicals to groups of teens looking for more theater content they can identify with. While differing in plot, all of the high school musicals currently on Broadway mimic an identifiable structure: the nerds versus the mean girls."
16090,"With lessons about parenting, drug addiction, mental health and sexuality strung throughout the subtext, the production and its high school counterparts are an ideal fit for the city’s educational programs that bring teens to Broadway."
16091,"The Broadway League has tagged 19 shows this season — “Be More Chill,"" ""Dear Evan Hansen""  included — as appropriate for sophomores and above. These productions team up with the New York City Department of Education to participate in educational programs like Inside Broadway’s “Create the Magic” and the League’s “Broadway Bridges,” both of which help expose students to live theater."
16092,"“Our goal is to get where all 70,000 sophomores see a Broadway show before they graduate each year,” the League’s director St. Martin says."
16093,"While “Be More Chill” found its teenage niche, it's important to remember ""age is not a predictor of taste,"" Show Score's Melcher says, encouraging older crowds to give the show a chance. "
16094,"“We're seeing more shows attract teens, but age, gender and ethnicity, is not a predictor of who likes what. We’ve found this again and again, that it can’t always be predicted. I’m 55 years old, so does that mean I shouldn’t go to ‘Be More Chill?’ The answer is always no."""

16104,Jason Tam’s Squip calls the shots in the sci-fi high school musical “Be More Chill.”
16105,"In the production, opening Sunday at the Lyceum Theatre, Tam brings to Broadway a rare villainous character that receives an equally enthusiastic raucous reaction from the crowd for his high-tech entrance as he does for his demise."
16106,"“People love to cheer for the Squip because everybody kind of wants one in their lives even though they know they shouldn’t,” Tam, 36, says."
16107,"For those who haven’t yet swallowed a Squip (Super Quantum Unit Intel Processor), it’s a gray, oblong druglike pill that travels through your blood, implants itself in your brain and tells you what to do to avoid awkward situations. In short: “It’s from Japan!”"
16108,"The technology comes to life onstage by way of Tam, an NYU alum, who reprises his role as an Intel processor from the 2018 Off-Broadway production. “But the Squip is not a robot,” he says. It’s a physical extension of a character who exists only in the mind of teen Jeremy Heere (Will Roland)."
16109,"The New Jersey high schooler swallows the pill to impress the dreamy Christine (Stephanie Hsu). Oh, and because he’s sick of being a “loser, a geek or whatever.”"
16110,"The Squip’s sole function is to guide Jeremy through social interactions, making decisions for him that ultimately strip away what makes him unique."

16113,"“By coaching Jeremy, he teaches him how to be more chill and have more confidence in a leading by example kind of way,” Tam explains."
16114,Tam's Squip easily stands out as the “cool kid” in a sea of anxious teenagers with doodles on their backpacks hoping to get an invite to the hottest party of the year.
16115,"“There’s a point where the artificial intelligence overlaps the boundaries it’s been programmed for and decides to do what it thinks is best, which is Squipping everyone, whether they want one or not,” he says."
16116,"Sharing much of his stage time lurking near and mimicking Jeremy’s physical movements, Tam manages to create a seamless connection between the two. Their connection only grows stronger the longer Jeremy is controlled by the pill."
16117,"“It’s an interesting concept because I think it’s very current and that makes it appealing to a younger generation,” Tam says. “I think the overarching message is very universal, it’s people dealing with self-doubt and how to navigate it in a healthy way without harming yourself or those around you.”"
16118,"The musical, with music and lyrics by Joe Iconis and book by Joe Tracz, is already appealing to younger fans in a way that’s “thrilling” Tam, who made his Broadway debut in “A Chorus Line” in 2006 and later appeared in “Jesus Christ Superstar Live.”"
16119,"It first ran at a regional New Jersey theater in 2015, where it was met my mediocre reviews and closed after just four weeks. An outpouring of love from high school- and college-aged theatergoers on social media helped bring the show to New York in 2018, and, ultimately, to The Great White Way months later."
16120,"“I never experienced anything like this before,” Tam says. “It’s this incredible wave of energy to ride. It’s thrilling to be a part of and I don’t think this show would be happening on Broadway without the fans who fell in love with it and told their friends.”"
16121,"Tam’s character is one who gets a serious upgrade in the production's move to the big stage, with “bonkers, over-the-top costume” changes that help define his shift from “chill” to “evil.” He has an intricate new costume in the finale number that he says took nearly 200 hours to make."
16122,"And be sure to watch out for the Squip’s flying sequence, added into the production for the first time as a way to accentuate just how strong his powers become."

16132,"Whether or not it ultimately proves to be a hit, “Be More Chill,” a sublimely silly, exciting sci-fi teen musical comedy deserves a place in Broadway history as an unlikely comeback story powered by a passionate fan following on social media. "
16133,"Resembling a mishmash of “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Little Shop of Horrors,” “Be More Chill” is based on a 2004 young adult novel by Ned Vizzini about a struggling high school student who attempts to win popularity by following the instructions of a “Squip” (a Japanese microcomputer installed into his brain). The show premiered in 2015 at New Jersey’s Two River Theater (with much of the Broadway cast) and promptly disappeared — until a cast album, preserving a pop-rock score by Joe Iconis that is both addictively catchy and a master class in post-Sondheim dramatic integration, revived interest in it. "
16134,"Following a sold-out Off-Broadway run over the summer, “Be More Chill” has transferred to Broadway’s Lyceum Theatre, where it brings fresh air and youthful vitality into a season of new musicals that has primarily consisted of forgettable adaptations of movies and jukebox catalogs. "
16135,"Directed by Stephen Brackett and choreographed by Chase Brock, the show’s weakest link is Joe Tracz’s book, which occasionally sputters and resorts to pandering, random twists and jokes that do not land. But on the whole, the production is both a supercharged piece of popular entertainment and a sincerely-felt portrait of vulnerable teens in an overwhelming environment of confusion and rejection. "
16136,"The diverse, big-voiced cast is superb: Will Roland forcefully emphasizes the cluelessness of protagonist Jeremy, while Stephanie Hsu is adorably overpassionate as Jeremy’s love interest Christine. George Salazar stops the show cold as Jeremy’s pal Michael in a showstopping second act solo and Jason “SweetTooth” Williams ably handles multiple adult roles, including Jeremy’s pants-less father. And Jason Tam’s personification of the computerized Squip resembles a version of Keanu Reeves pulled equally from “The Matrix” and “Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure.” "
16137,"If you are on the fence about the show, I suggest listening to a few tracks of the cast album online. At the very least, you will instantly understand how “Be More Chill” earned the momentum that has brought it to Broadway four years after dying out in New Jersey."

16681,What has the response been from children regarding the book?
16682,"I'm getting a lot of positive feedback! And touring for the book gives me the opportunity to talk to readers, both young and old, directly. I'm seeing more and more Zita costumes at every event."
16683,You’re involved in the New York Public Library summer reading program. Can you elaborate on that?
16684,"Yes! On June 4th I will be opening the summer reading program at the library by talking about the books I read growing up that inspired me to start telling stories. I'll probably also be doing some live drawing and maybe, just maybe, they will let me do a backflip in the library again. I will ask permission."
16685,"Being on a reading list for young people, does that add any sense of responsibility to your work?"
16686,"I tend to feel a sense of responsibility simply from having the books published – because it uses so much paper and ink and shipping space, not to mention people’s time! I think just knowing that so many copies of my books are being printed makes me feel that I need to tell the best possible story that I can. And the time readers spend in the worlds I'm creating—I try to fill every moment of that time with wonder."
16687,Do you have anything specific planned for the signing at Books of Wonder?
16688,"Books of Wonder should be fun. I'm planning to give a little sneak peek into some of the projects that I've got coming up, including a reading of my picture book – “Julia’s House for Lost Creatures” – that will be out in the fall."
16689,What's next?
16690,"Well, as I mentioned, there’s “Julia's House” releasing on Sept. 2nd. It’s my first picture book and I’m really looking forward to sharing it. I’m also in the middle of writing and drawing a new graphic novel about a little girl and a robot and a very special friendship that lasts a summer. It’s one of the most enjoyable books I’ve ever worked on. Every page I’ve drawn of this one has been a joy (and I think it shows)."

	  A strip from ""Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay""  by Ben Katchor       Photo Credit: Ben Katchor/Drawn and Quarterly     "
16699,New York cartoonist Ben Katchor is one of those unique characters who can only exist in New York City.
16700,"He’s a winner of the MacArthur “genius” grant and has worked on critically acclaimed comic strips such as “Julius Knipl, Real Estate Photographer” and “The Cardboard Valise”; he’s written musicals and he’s a professor at Parsons School of Design."
16701,"“Knipl,” perhaps his seminal work, began in 1988 as a weekly cartoon strip in The Jewish Daily Forward, and other alternative weeklies. It follows the title character as he chronicles small business in a city that is a dreamlike riff on NYC."
16702,"“I tried to invent this city where in every corner you’d stumble upon this revelation, an incredible invention someone came up with,” Katchor says. “Designing a coffee shop in a way it had never been designed before.”"
16703,"The strip was collected in the book “Cheap Novelties: The Pleasures of Urban Decay” in 1991, and that book is now getting a snazzy new hardcover edition, which Katchor, 64, will be signing at 192 Books on Oct. 6."
16704,"The cartoonist says that he wants people who read the book to ponder the potential for a unique, wondrous city — instead of the homogenized strip mall that New York too often resembles these days."
16705,"“It’s a kind of speculative fiction, and the purpose of that is for people to put the book down and say, ‘Why isn’t it like this?’” Katchor says. “It’s all a dream, somebody had these dreams to make gigantic chains of indistinguishable coffee shops. That was somebody’s life goal. So you can come up with other goals. That’s what I’d like them to come away with.”"
16706,"The book is filled with poetic cartoons about hot dog joints and odd little storefronts advertising, “Joke Headlines Printed While-U-Wait.”"
16707,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
16708,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
16709,The author has no interest in chain stores on every corner.
16710,"“This large scale chain operation tends to reflects this incredible poverty of the imagination,” Katchor says. “It’s like they figured it out once, and now they just want to replicate it all over the world. That makes it boring to walk around the city.”"
16711,"Katchor has a fascinating thought process that inspires his work. He wonders whether today’s youth will have a “desperate search,” as he calls it, for the “tremendous variety in every Starbucks.”"
16712,"That mentality makes the comics collected in “Cheap Novelties” timeless and intriguing. Even if you never experienced the dearly-departed New York City that inspired the strips, Katchor’s vision transport you there."
16713,"“Back when I started ‘Knipl,’ I wanted to talk about this kind of dream city that was really in this perfect state of equilibrium,” he says. “All of these things, these crackpot things, could go on, a newspaper about the dreamlife of the city. Every other corner would be this big, all-night cafeteria — everybody’s dream could be manifest in a storefront and that kind of a city would be really interesting.”"

16724,It was the first time Stiller had tweeted since Meara's death on Saturday. The cause of her death was not released.

16738,"Actor Ben Whishaw is no stranger to taking roles in some very British properties. He’s the tech guru Q in the latest iterations of the James Bond movies, he provides the voice of Paddington in the bear’s two films and now he steps into the role of Michael in the sequel to “Mary Poppins.”"
16739,"In “Mary Poppins Returns,” set nearly 30 years after the original, Whishaw plays the grown-up Banks boy, now with a family of his own. When financial trouble hits, everyone’s favorite umbrella-wielding nanny floats in to save the day."
16740,It’s a character that meant a lot to the 38-year-old Brit.
16741,"“It was a film that I was completely obsessed with as a child — I’m sure like many children,” he says. “It may not have been the very first film I ever saw, but it was the first I remember seeing for the first time. I guess in a way it kind of ignited the acting instinct in me really, because I started to dress up as her and I learned all the songs and I knew every word and I acted the whole thing out for anybody who would sit and watch."
16742,"“It went very deep into my child imagination,” he continues. “I couldn’t really believe it when I got this email saying, ‘Do you want to meet Rob Marshall to be in the sequel?’ It hardly seemed possible.”"
16743,"amNewYork spoke to Whishaw about the film, out Wednesday."
16744,Do you relate to Michael?
16745,"Yes, I do. I remember many things that struck me as a child. I remember there’s a line that I think Mary Poppins says to the children because they’re struggling to understand their father. And I remember this line that she says about some people can’t see past the end of their own nose. And I was so intrigued by that concept and I didn’t really understand it, but on another level I must have. … I suppose it tapped into something of my own bafflement about the adult world. Adults seem often so confusing to children and yet we also love our parents. It’s such a fraught and complex relationship and I really remember relating to that."

16748,"You’ve been in a lot of films with these beloved British characters, like Paddington, James Bond and now Mary Poppins. Do you have a sense of responsibility with these films?"
16749,"There is responsibility, but I think, with all of the ones you mentioned, you also have to make them your own and you have to make them speak to the present moment and you have to be respectful, but not too respectful. And I guess maybe because I’ve come from theater, where it’s very normal to take on roles that have been interpreted for decades or even centuries and find something fresh in them, it feels very natural to me to take on a role that other people have played or a story that other people have done and investigate it anew. "
16750,What was your reaction when you saw Emily as Mary Poppins?
16751,I just remember feeling incredibly excited and [incredible] fear or trepidation or concern that this wouldn’t live up to the first film. [That] sort of very quickly evaporated because she was so charismatically taking this role by the scruff of the neck and making it her own. And I think she’s so funny and so natural.
16752,What was it like working with Lin-Manuel Miranda?
16753,"Well, Lin is just, Lin’s just irrepressible, which I so deeply admire. He genuinely is childlike in the best possible sense of that. … He’s incredibly creative in an open and tireless and kind and engaged [way]. I feel like … next to him, a terrible old curmudgeon really because I’m such a pessimist by comparison. But I so admire his energy really."
16754,"As someone who is such a fan of the original, what was it like to work with Dick Van Dyke?"
16755,"That was a probably the most special day. … He was the only actor who — understandably — didn’t come rehearsed. We had a very long rehearsal period. But Dick wasn’t there for the rehearsal, so he just literally arrived on set in the costume. I don’t think we even rehearsed on the day of the shoot. I think we just turned over the cameras and he performed. And it was all prepared by him and he did it immediately and he did it all in a couple of takes without any stumbling or any need for correction or anything. It was quite remarkable. It would have been remarkable in someone half his age. But it was jaw-dropping in someone who was 91 at the time. And just inspirational to see someone so in a way more alive than any of the rest of us. So intensely living and intensely taking pleasure in what they do. Wonderful to see."
16756,You were in the “Crucible” on Broadway in 2016. Do you have any plans on coming back to the NYC stage?
16757,"I’m doing a play here next year, which is kind of a monologue actually. It’s not really a play. But it’s not on Broadway. It’s a new venue that they’re currently constructing called The Shed. And I’ll be there sometime in the spring, I think. So I’m really looking forward to coming back here and performing here. I had such a fantastic time."
16758,So you have a pretty great mustache in this movie. Did you consider keeping it?
16759,"No. I don’t like it myself. I liked it for the character. … I like a beard, but I don’t like a mustache."
16760,Is there anything you can tell about if there will be another “Paddington” movie?
16761,"I really don’t know whether there will be another of those films. You know, I had such an interesting experience because we had no idea when we were making it that it would be as successful or as good as it turned out to be. I got called in very late in the day and I didn’t really want to do it. I didn’t think I was going to be able to do it. I thought I was going to be bad at doing that kind of voice work. I resisted it and resisted it. But I feel very proud of those films now. As to whether there will be another one, I really don’t know. I think it depends on whether Paul King, who is the writer and director, whether he can be persuaded to."

16816,"In a year marked with theatrical film adaptations and jukebox musicals, these Broadway front-runners paved the way. Below, the five best productions we saw this year (to date), which all received perfect four-star ratings from our critic, Matt Windman. "
16817,Read our list of the worst of Broadway in 2018 at amny.com/entertainment.
16818,"Coming to New York City from London’s National Theatre with an all-star cast led by Nathan Lane and Andrew Garfield, “Angels in America” was already gunning for the Tonys before it even opened. “Angels in America” closed at the Neil Simon Theatre in July, but not before winning best revival of a play and sweeping the critics’ circle. The drama, subtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes,” told its story of the 1980s AIDS crisis in New York in two separate four-hour parts. “Taking in the play is not easy. In addition to its length, many sequences are bizarre, didactic and choppy,” Windman wrote. “But there is no denying its theatrical brilliance, literary ambition and cultural relevance.”"
16819,"“The Ferryman” was easily the best production to open during the fall theater rush, with an unmatched plot riddled with excitement. The Sam Mendes-directed masterpiece has it all: family traditions, tension, passion, politics and betrayal. “In lesser hands, “The Ferryman” may have come off as pure hokum, but Mendes makes it absolutely entrancing, bringing out many intense, full-bodied performances, particularly from Donnelly, who brilliantly conveys Caitlin’s raw vitality, vulnerability and stifled rage,” Windman wrote. The production is playing an extended run at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre, with dates through July 7."

16822,"How can one follow a critically acclaimed 1956 opening starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison? Director Bartlett Sher manages just fine. A perfectly cast leading duo helps support a refreshed take on “My Fair Lady,” with Lauren Ambrose (“Six Feet Under”) as “a radiant” Eliza and Harry Hadden-Paton (“Downton Abbey”) as Higgins. “The revival has been staged in Sher’s familiar style of making a classic feel fresh and dynamic without totally disregarding the original script and score, incorporating superb production values (including a two-story revolving set for Higgins’ home) and bringing out layered performances from great actors,” our critic wrote in his review. The production opened in April and still has dates stretching through June at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center Theater."
16823,"Broadway was gifted with “The Boys in the Band” in celebration of the 50th anniversary of Mart Crowley’s 1968 drama. But then, we wanted more. This revival of sorts starred Jim Parsons, Zachary Quinto, Matt Bomer and Andrew Rannells, and narrowly missed the cut for the 2018 Tony Awards. In just a short stint, the production set in an Upper East Side apartment proved “to be not just a historic artifact, but a witty, gripping and surprising drama that is just as enjoyable as it is menacing,” Windman wrote. "
16824,"""The Broadway adaptation of the 1976 satirical film (starring Bryan Cranston as the unhinged veteran television newsman Howard Beale and built upon a busy and buzzing staging by international director Ivo van Hove) is freewheeling, fast and furious and absolutely mesmerizing,"" Windman writes. "

16831,"From Don Johnson's return to network TV in the primetime soap ""Blood and Oil,"" to a new ""Heroes Reborn"" miniseries and a whole new ""Muppet"" show, the 2015 fall television lineups are filled with comebacks. Take a look at some of the must-watch shows coming this fall."
16832,"CBS' well-done new medical drama stars Marcia Gay Harden as a residency director in charge of newbies in a busy, intense ER. ""Code Black"" is not for the squeamish, but its strong cast, sharp directing and uncluttered story make it unlike other shows of its kind."
16833,"The major draw of this show about FBI recruits (considered by some as ABC's most promising new series) is Priyanka Chopra, a Bollywood superstar with enough screen wattage to stop the thumb of even the most inveterate channel changer. "
16834,"Star Morris Chestnut is the reason to watch this straight-ahead procedural. As the season goes on, he and the rest of the cast (which includes Lorraine Toussaint, Vee from ""Orange Is the New Black"") jell as a unit. Pleasing visuals help, too."
16835,"CBS' new single-camera comedy certainly is in pieces (vignette ""slices of life"" crammed into a frantic half-hour), but its instant-impact actors, including James Brolin and Colin Hanks, are just enough reason to keep tuning in."
16836,"The real Stephen Colbert has revealed himself to be smart and easy to listen to, since his ""Late Show"" debut on Sept. 8. With guests including George Clooney (on the premiere), Donald Trump (Sept. 22) and Nobel Prize Laureate Malala Yousafzai (Sept. 25), Colbert promises to continue to keep it interesting."
16837,"Neil Patrick Harris wants to revive/reinvent the variety genre. As did Rosie O'Donnell. As did The Osbournes. But this longtime TV star, Broadway fave and generally beloved celeb may have the bona fides to pull it off. (NBC, Sept. 15) "
16838,"An amnesiac woman (Jaimie Alexander) is found in Times Square with ""clue"" tattoos all over her body (""Prison Break""), including the name of a key FBI agent (""The Blacklist""), whose efforts she is mysteriously able to assist (she speaks rare Chinese dialects). Throw in some ""Person of Interest,"" ""Die Hard"" and ""The Bourne Identity"" to cook an action stew that is nevertheless surprisingly tasty. Weekly payoffs aid the requisite overarching conspiracy. (NBC, Sept. 21)"
16839,"From what I've seen of this latest whack at the Philip K. Dick classic, it looks very intriguing. Or maybe I was just bedazzled by the special effects. (Fox, Sept. 21)"
16840,"Williams arrives at MSNBC (as breaking news anchor) on Sept. 22 in a bid to restore that which has gone missing -- notably his reputation and this network's audience. A gamble, but one worth taking, and watching."
16841,"A ""contemporary,"" ""personal,"" ""docu-style"" comedy a la ""Modern Family""? Surely you jest, ABC. Oh, you do not jest? Very well, then. I'll be watching when it premieres Sept. 22."
16842," ""Scream Queens,"" with Ariana Grande, from left, Emma Roberts, Abigail Breslin and Billie Lourd, was created by Murphy and co-created with frequent collaborators Ian Brennan (""Glee"") and Ryan Falchuk (""American Horror Story,"" ""Nip/Tuck"")...which means...hit? Or at the very least, must-watch-the-pilot. I didn't love this -- mean-spirited and a wildly uneven opener. (Sept. 22, Fox)"
16843,"Based on the 2011 movie of the same title starring Bradley Cooper, CBS' adaptation features Jake McDorman as a man who discovers the super drug from the movie and uses it to solve crimes for the FBI. Cooper will reprise his film role in a recurring guest spot. (McDorman appeared alongside Cooper in last year's Oscar-nominated ""American Sniper."") Another one of those high-concept shows that look appealing, but unclear whether potential is limitless or limited. Nice looking opener, though! (Sept. 22, CBS)"
16844,"The only surprise left for this smash hit's second season (Sept. 23) is in who won't be making a cameo. Half of Hollywood, or at least half of the music industry, is lined up -- conga style -- to share a scene with Cookie. Good luck with that: She has a way of devouring that scenery."
16845,"Hopefully my interest will also be reborn. (NBC, Sept. 24) Hopefully your's too. It has been five long years, after all, and the TV superhero world (See: The CW and just about every network and streaming service too) has undergone a true explosion in interest, or possibly it's just over-saturated right now.  Creator Tim Kring said at the recent press tour,  ""because we didn?t get to have that fifth season, I did always have that in my mind, that there was an unfinished nature to all of this.""
Cast includes: Jack Coleman (H.R.G.), Masi Oka (Hiro), Sendhil Ramamurthy (Mohinder), Jimmy Jean-Louis (the Haitian) and Christine Rose (Angela Petrelli). And a quick glance at this list confirms an obvious concern: Hayden Panettiere, Greg Grunberg, Ali Larter, Zachary Quinto and Adrian Pasdar are not in the cast. So it appears that some business will remain unfinished.   "
16846,"Come on! After all these years (15), and all those murders, and all those cadavers, and all those times Capt. Jim Brass (the always terrific Paul Guilfoyle) looks wearily, bleakly, at a lying perp as if to say ""You gotta be kidding me?"" After all that do you really think I'm gonna miss the Sept. 27 finale, which promises the return of William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger?"
16847,"""Miami Vice"" star Don Johnson makes his return to network TV with this prime-time soap set on the North Dakota oil patch. With Amber Valletta (""Revenge"") and Chace Crawford (""Gossip Girl""). Odd thing about the pilot -- it's supposed to be set in North Dakota but (I believe) was shot in Utah. Otherwise, audiences just might be looking for another primetime oil patch soap -- even one set in the mountains. I liked what I saw of this. (Sept. 27, ABC) "
16848,Finally gonna get into this Fox series (which returns Sept. 27) because everyone tells me I should.
16849,"You can't go home again, and you can't re-create that which was so indelible at ""The Daily Show"" -- Jon Stewart's long run. So Noah's attempt will, out of necessity, be something entirely different. The outstanding question before the Sept. 28 launch is, will it be watchable?"
16850,"Following the buzz-magnet backstage ""Full House"" movie is more '90s TV nostalgia. On Oct. 10 comes ""The Unauthorized Melrose Place Story.""  (Lifetime, Oct. 3)"
16851,"Lady Gaga gets evil in the latest single-season creepfest, also with Matt Bomer, Finn Wittrock, Evan Peters, Chloë Sevigny, Sarah Paulson, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. Expect serial murders, blood drinking -- the usual. (FX, Oct. 7)"
16852,"Please, who wouldn't want to see a BBC America eight-part period drama on King Alfred the Great? (Oct. 10)"
16853,"""Fargo"" ended Dec. 14 on a positive note. But what did it all mean? Lou (Patrick Wilson) and Hank (Ted Danson) ponder life's meaning. Death's too. "
16854,"The white Rockville Centre-raised standup hits the legendary theater of black Harlem, directed by Chris Rock. (HBO, Oct. 17)"
16855,"Based on the DC Comics character Kara Zor-El (Superman's cousin), this new action-adventure stars Melissa Benoist (""Glee"") as a girl who decides to finally embrace her superhuman abilities after 12 years of keeping her powers a secret on Earth. Opener's charming, so is Benoist, but some of the violence is not -- she may be super but also a woman, and it's jarring to see her get roughed up by a big brawny bad guy. (Oct. 26, CBS) "
16856,"Darned right I'm looking forward to Starz's continuation of the story of Ashley ""Ash"" Williams (Bruce Campbell), last seen in a pair of Sam Raimi splatterpaloozas from the early '80s. (Oct. 31)"
16857,"""Parks & Recreation's"" Aziz Ansari gets his own series, as Dev, a struggling 30-year-old actor in New York City. Mike Schur of ""Parks and Rec"" is an executive producer. (Netflix, Nov. 6)"
16858,"And yet another Dick adaptation arrives this fall, this time on Amazon Prime. It's based on his 1962 ""alternative history"" that supposes the Allies lost World War II. (Nov. 20)"
16859,"OK, admittedly I'm into adaptations this fall, especially SyFy's attempt to finally conquer that which is unconquerable: Arthur C. Clarke's ambitious, complicated, philosophical 1953 novel about a ""peaceful"" alien invasion of planet Earth. This miniseries arrives Dec. 14. (Another newbie, ""The Expanse,"" in which humans colonize the solar system, should also be worth watching.)"

16866,"Lists? Had enough of them yet? If not, then here's my list of the best TV series of the year 2015..."
16867,"I struggled. This was a good year, a fine one in fact. ""Mad Men"" ensured that it was also a watershed year, for this was when one of the finest series in TV history came to an end. (Watershed? Or waterworks?)"
16868,"Meanwhile, The Emmys -- now under new rules -- finally recognized what everyone else already knew (""Game of Thrones,"" the best drama of the year). Asiz Ansari and Ellie Kemper had career-defining series. ""Fargo"" got better (just as ""True Detective"" got worse; can't win 'em all). "
16869,And Bruce Campbell returned. Enough said.
16870," A very good year indeed. You won't see other excellent series on this list -- ""The Americans,"" ""Rectify,"" ""The Affair,"" ""The Leftovers"" -- simply because choices had to be made. Also, lists tend to be a reflection of the heart of the person who makes them. There's nothing truly ""objective"" here. But it is truly passionate. "
16871,"And ""passion,"" after all, is what this is all about."
16872,"1. GAME OF THRONES. Over a three-month span and 10 episodes, from “The Wars to Come” (April 12) to “Mother’s Mercy’ (June 14), “Game of Thrones” waged a war of independence — from critics, fan expectations and even the mother country itself, George R.R. Martin’s “A Song of Ice and Fire.” Always adventurous, “GoT” instead became outrageous — and courted outrage — during the fifth season, from the rape of Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) to the death of Jon Snow (Kit Harington). But beyond those divisive twists (the latter in the books, the first not), the TV show’s own lofty ambitions emerged. This is a classic that now demands to be taken on its own terms . . . demands a close and intelligent viewing . . . and demands respect. In 2015, those demands were routinely and resoundingly met."
16873,"2. MAD MEN, AMC. The final roundup, and a magnificent one, fulfilling a bargain with fans -- that intelligence, passion and sheer quality will prevail until the closing seconds, no matter what. It did. Don's Coke ad may have taught the world to sing; Matthew Weiner's masterpiece taught the TV world how to make rich, allusive drama over seven seasons, while never once -- once! -- calling it in.  "
16874,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
16875,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
16876,"3. WOLF HALL, PBS. From my review: ""A considerable reputation precedes [lead Mark] Rylance, as one of the world's great stage actors who has mostly eschewed the temptations of Hollywood. That means he's a relative unknown to most viewers here, and heaven knows what they'll make of this performance. It is in fact magnificent, and a master class in control, subtlety, intelligence and interpretation."""
16877,"4. THE JINX: THE LIFE AND DEATHS OF ROBERT DURST, HBO. HBO made TV history and a remarkable work of nonfiction that reopened the coldest of cases that had been in the deep freeze for years. Producers Andrew Jarecki and Marc Smerling got what appeared to be a confession, profoundly incriminating evidence, and compulsively watchable TV, from start to shocking finish."
16878,"5. UNBREAKABLE KIMMY SCHMIDT, Netflix. Ellie Kemper's coming out party, establishing her as one of TV's finest comic actresses, plus an added (and equal) bonus -- Tituss Burgess, as one of the funniest people on TV."
16879,"6. HOMELAND, Showtime. The best -- that's right, the best -- season of ""Homeland"" so far. I came thisclose -- if you'll excuse the ""thisclose"" cliche -- to naming ""Homeland"" the best drama of the year, but then, there was Rylance, ""Mad Men"" and that little thing on HBO called ""Game of Thrones."" Nevertheless, heart-pounding all season, no doubt heart-busting this Sunday too, when the finale airs. "
16880,"7. BETTER CALL SAUL, AMC. A remarkable case study of a man thought to be a clown -- also Walter White's punching bag -- who is, or was, instead a man with a complex, subtle mind and a moral compass. The question, a compelling one, now becomes: How did Jimmy become Saul?   "
16881,"8. FARGO, FX. In some ways superior to the first season (OK, and in some ways not), as creator Noah Hawley managed to yoke an homage to the Coen film, ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" to something entirely fresh and original.  Another remarkable cast -- Jean Smart, Jeffrey Donovan, Kirsten Dunst, Jesse Plemons, Patrick Wilson, Ted Danson, Kristin Milioti and...howabout Bokeem Woodbine and Zahn McClarnon?(!) "
16882,"9. MASTER OF NONE, Netflix. Asiz Ansari proves here that he's absolutely not Tom Haverford -- or Jerry Seinfeld or Louis CK either, for that matter. He's an original voice, and an original comic, who brings a sharply human perspective to assimilation, cultural or otherwise. "
16883,"10. ASH VS. EVIL DEAD, Starz. That's right!  Bruce Campbell is one of the treasures of modern culture. There. I've said it. No apologies forthcoming. And he's glorious here -- as an older, wiser, vastly more ruthless ""deadite"" slayer Ashley J. Williams. This is a small comic-horror masterpiece, and also Starz' best series to date. "

16890,"This year was pretty great for theater in New York. Although one show in particular won the lion’s share of acclaim and commercial success, there were plenty of other noteworthy plays and musicals. There were also a few disasters, including one that just opened and stars one of the world’s most admired actors."
16891,Below is a list of the year’s 10 best and five worst shows. The new Broadway revival of “Fiddler on the Roof” could not be considered since it does not open until Sunday night.
16892,"1. ‘Hamilton’ Simply put, this was the year of “Hamilton.” Lin-Manuel Miranda’s dynamic hip-hop musical biography of founding father Alexander Hamilton premiered at the Public Theater and went on to take Broadway by storm. It is also breaking into pop culture consciousness."
16893,"2. ‘Fun Home’ Jeanine Tesori and Lisa Kron’s Tony-winning musical about a lesbian cartoonist looking back on her troubled relationship with her father is just as innovative as it is emotionally piercing. Like “Hamilton,” it came from the Public Theater."
16894,3. ‘Spring Awakening’ This inspired revival made the 2005 adolescent rock musical fresh all over again by using American Sign Language and a cast made up of hearing and non-hearing actors.
16895,"4. ‘Once Upon a Mattress’ The current Off-Broadway staging of the 1959 fairy tale musical is a joyfully offbeat piece of burlesque, with a cast led by comic Jackie Hoffman and drag artist John Epperson."
16896,5. ‘Sylvia’ Tony winner Annaleigh Ashford gives an unforgettable performance as a young female dog in A.R. Gurney’s heartwarming man-and-pet comedy.
16897,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
16898,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
16899,"6. ‘The Color Purple’ With a cast led by Jennifer Hudson, Danielle Brooks and Cynthia Erivo, John Doyle’s stripped-down revival of the 2005 musical is far more powerful than the original production."
16900,"7. ‘Hand to God’ This raunchy, irreverent comedy about a teenage boy whose hand becomes possessed by a foul-mouthed, violent puppet is hilarious and seriously disturbing. The puppet sex sequence is unforgettable."
16901,8. ‘The Flick’ Annie Baker’s Pulitzer-winning comedic drama about the underpaid workers of a run-down movie theater made a much-welcome return after its 2013 debut.
16902,"9. ‘The Christians’ In Lucas Hnath’s provocative and polarizing drama, a well-meaning pastor alienates his congregation and family with a sudden change of faith. Like “The Flick,” it came out of Playwrights Horizons."
16903,"10. ‘Incident at Vichy’ It may not be Arthur Miller’s finest play, but the Signature Theatre’s revival of his one-act Holocaust drama is incredibly well-acted and compelling."
16904,"Honorable mention: The excellent City Center Encores! concert productions of “Paint Your Wagon,” “A New Brain,” “Lady, Be Good!” and “Little Shop of Horrors.”"
16905,"1. ‘China Doll’ Al Pacino and David Mamet crash and burn in this rambling, incoherent two-man drama about a billionaire businessman with a new airplane and tax problems."
16906,2. ‘Gigi’ Whose idea was it to bring back the bland stage version of the 1958 MGM movie musical and to turn it into a star vehicle for Vanessa Hudgens?
16907,3. ‘Iphigenia in Aulis’ A powerful Greek tragedy was reduced to rubble in this puzzling and off-putting Off-Broadway production at Classic Stage.
16908,4. ‘It Shoulda Been You’ David Hyde Pierce made his Broadway directing debut with this painfully dated and unfunny musical about a wedding gone wrong.
16909,5. ‘The Way We Get By’ Provocateur-playwright Neil LaBute’s 90-minute play about the aftermath of a one-night fling was the equivalent of 90 empty calories.
16910,"Matt Windman is the theater critic at amNewYork, which means he sees a show virtually every night of his life. They tend to vary in quality. He is also a lawyer."

16987,"Before her special appearance in Coldplay’s Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show, she dropped a surprise new single and video ""Formation"" (Parkwood/Columbia). It’s not clear, though, whether it will be part of the halftime show."
16988,"“Formation” is a stunning bit of esteem-building, set to a memorable, space-age beat crafted by producer Mike Will Made It."
16989,"“I dream it. I work hard. I grind ‘til I own it,” she sings, following it with yet another catchphrase. “I twirl all my haters.”"
16990,"You can add that to “I got hot sauce in my bag,” becoming “the black Bill Gates,” and the bit about a post-sex reward at Red Lobster."
16991,"The video is even more extreme, with its references to rebuilding and triumph in response to Hurricane Katrina and a young dancer winning over a line of police, before a long shot of graffiti that reads “Stop shooting us.”"
16992,Is “Formation” a one-off single for the Super Bowl? Is it the announcement of another surprise album like her industry-changing 2013 release “Beyonce”?

17006,"It's never easy to break into Hollywood, but British beauty Gugu Mbatha-Raw is on the verge of doing just that, thanks to a new film in which she plays a pop star on a meteoric rise to fame."
17007,"While ""Beyond the Lights,"" opening Friday, may be Mbatha-Raw's big breakout, the actress is refreshingly free of preoccupations with the kind of fame she portrays on the big screen."

Hounded by paparazzi, driven to the brink by her mom/manager (Minnie Driver), and saddled with paint-by-numbers songs, Noni attempts suicide, only to be saved by a handsome cop (Nate Parker)."

17025,"""The characters were appealing and entertaining, and it felt like something we could do something with, and its relatively obscure nature actually helped us because it gave us more free range to reinvent it."" Hall says."

17033,"At the university, Hall met Chris Atkeson, who introduced him to the idea of soft robotics."
17034,"""He showed me a very crude robotic arm made of vinyl and inflatable,"" Hall says. ""Then Chris started going off on how ? in movies he hates it when robots are always the bad guys and when is someone going to make the robot the hero, and why can't robots be good guys and this and that, and finally I stopped him and was like, 'Dude, you had me at inflatable'."""
17035,"""I felt the technology was so interesting and would make such a new, unique robot,"" Hall continues. ""And not only that, the whole health care persona from Baymax came from that because soft robotics will be used for health care robots in the future."""

17046,amNewYork spoke with Adsit about the film.
17047, 
17048,Had you heard of 'Big Hero 6' before taking on this film?
17049,"No, it was a comic I had never read. I don't remember actually ever seeing it. ? It's a pretty obscure comic, with no disrespect to the creators."

17053,What drew you to the role?
17054,"Well, the Disney name, certainly [laughs]. What drew me to it, like I was going to refuse it. I was invited to audition. They had seen me on stage in L.A. doing something one night and invited me to come audition. That was all I wanted. I felt like I had gotten something exciting, just to be allowed to come into the Walt Disney Animation Studios and wander the halls and look at the artwork and see stuff that no one's supposed to see for another two years was like a dream come true. Then I got to go into the booth and audition and it was unlike any audition I ever had. It was very relaxed and collaborative and it lasted an hour or something. We just worked on the character together. That was exciting, and that was enough for me. I could have gone home and been very happy that I had that experience. That would have been enough for me. Then I got the call that I got the part. ... So far, it's too good to be true, but it seems to be true."
17055, 
17056,How did you build the voice of Baymax?
17057,"We all agreed that Baymax should never tip the idea that he's anything but a robot. And so I approached it like an automated phone system, when you call and they tell you the wait is 5 minutes, but the 5 minutes is a little separated from the rest of the sentence because it's kind of a fill in the blank. They access the 5 minutes from another part of the program. That's where I started and so you'll hear Baymax say, 'You have a contusion on your ? arm,' and it sounds a little separate, like he had to access the word arm. And that was the basis, and the subtleties came in as we went."
17058, 
17059,Did your improv skills come into play here?
17060,"It did a bit. Baymax, unlike a lot of the other characters, has a limited scope as far as what he can say because he's been programed and there's only so many things that Tadashi, the creator, thought to put in there. And all of them sort of relate to user-friendly medical care. Eventually, he does have the capability to learn though, so he might pick up new terminology here and there, and new applications for new ideas. And so, in the booth, they would let me play within those parameters. I think the other cast members were doing a lot of improv -- I'm sure they were, because they're all very gifted. My improv was more medical."
17061, 
17062,Were you a big Disney animation fan?
17063,"Well, yeah. I, as every did, grew up on Disney. I think 'Pinocchio' was my first movie, in a re-release year. And that, of course, was fascinating and scary and wonderful. And I stuck with all of it, 'The Rescuers,' 'The Black Cauldron,' 'The Sword in the Stone,' even less touted ones -- I just ate them up and would sit and draw them at home and try to do the voices. And then, I think, in the '80s, I was becoming a young man and it kind of fell away until 'The Little Mermaid,' and then I just was ravenous for all of it. That new era that started with 'The Little Mermaid,' I haven't missed one movie, I've seen everything at least three times."
17064, 
17065,Is there a lot of pressure knowing that young fans are watching you now?
17066,"I just hope I don't screw it up. I hope they connect to it the way I did when I was a kid. I have run into a few kids after some events where we show clips. I've had kids come up to me with their parents and the kids are shy. The parents tell them, 'This is the guy who does the voice of Baymax.' And they know it's not Baymax, but they still are shy and they know there's an element of Baymax right in front of them and there's a shy exuberance that I can't explain and a very simple connection. There was a little girl, the first girl I met after the Comic Con screening, maybe 3 years old, and she said simply, 'I like Baymax because he helps people.' She said it with such earnestness and such truth that it really touched my heart. It was lovely and that was a great experience for me."
17067, 
17068,Is this your first action figure?
17069,"It is, hopefully the first of many. But my girlfriend says that Baymax does look just like me. She thought maybe they based it on me. He's a lovely looking thing, but I don't think he looks like me. But yeah, I went and bought all the action figures. I know that they might be giving me stuff, but I ran out and bought it because I love action figures already and now they talk with my voice."
17070, 
17071,Is that disturbing?
17072,No. I'm sure it's disturbing for people around me on the subway who hear me talking to someone who's talking back to me in my voice all day.
17073, 
17074,Are we going to see a sequel?
17075,"I've not been told anything, but having seen it, I want to see more and I certainly want to be a part of that. I think they plan these things with the hope of franchising it and making it into something bigger, but it's a mystery to me. They've told me nothing."

17083,"When Bilal first burst onto the scene in 1999, he was quickly lumped in with the turn of the century’s neo-soul movement."
17084,"But that label was always too limiting for someone who grew up visiting jazz clubs with his father, can sing opera in multiple languages and cites the prog-rock of Peter Gabriel-era Genesis as an influence on his latest album, “In Another Life.” Bilal’s ability to shape-shift has made him a valued collaborator for artists including Kendrick Lamar, Beyoncé and Robert Glasper."
17085,amNewYork spoke with him as he prepared for a two-concert winter residency at City Winery.
17086,"You appeared to be on a path to stardom early in your career, yet it seems like you gained more fans by trying to lower your profile rather than appealing to the masses."
17087,"I look at it as a plus because I’m in a place where I can make music that I want. ... I really come more out of a jazz background, as far as improvisation is concerned. ... It doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with style or swing but it’s the concept and way I approach my music. I see it more like soul music. If you listen to any soul singer that you like — let’s take Marvin Gaye. Marvin Gaye has so many inflections in his voice. You can hear a jazz inflection, you can hear gospel, the blues. Every soul singer you love, that’s what you hear. That’s pretty much what I do. ... With the way I approach my music, sometimes it’s not always marketable. But I’ve been fortunate enough to stay afloat somehow."
17088,What are you planning for City Winery?
17089,This gig is not a band I normally play with. This band is all just musicians I respect that are in New York. I love their approach; it’s a new approach to jazz music. ... The way I write my music is in real book style. It can be interpreted in any type of way. I’m always proud when I see another jazz musician play my song and have their own take on it. This gave me the idea to just hire jazz musicians and hear their approach.

17176,What inspired you to write a children’s book about Bill Cunningham?
17177,"I was inspired to think more about Bill after he died, and his work and the hole that was left. I thought it would lend itself to a picture book for children because of the positive spirit of his work. I’m attracted to people who love their jobs, and he worked constantly, and you could tell that he had a passion for what he did. He was very open to life. He was open to fun. He admired originality, creativity and self-expression, and I thought that was all so important in terms of take-aways for children."
17178,Masha D’yans illustrated the book. What was your relationship with her like?
17179,"When you finish your manuscript, they send it to the illustrator, so you really work very independently. It’s like having a child and then giving it to someone to raise. I just thought she did magic with the subject. It’s whimsical, it’s colorful, it’s fun to look at. I’m thrilled with what she did with the book. "
17180,You mention in the author’s note that you met Bill Cunningham twice. What were those experiences like?
17181,"They were very brief because he was zooming around taking pictures. My husband [Ralph Blumenthal] spent his career at The New York Times so he knew Bill, and the first time we ran into him was at Lincoln Center. We chatted for maybe 30 seconds and he went off and was taking photographs."
17182,"The second time was at the New-York Historical Society for a party for my husband’s book “Stork Club” and Bill came to take pictures. So again, a very brief meeting. But he was working all the time. He wasn’t interested in stopping to chat. He was constantly looking for the perfect shot."
17183,Are you a fashion fan yourself?
17184,"I wouldn’t say I’m a fan of fashion. I admire originality and interesting fashion. I’m a pretty conservative dresser, so he would certainly never take my picture. That’s OK. He just had such a passion for what he did. I think people like that are so fortunate that they don’t think of work as work, they think of it as fun and play and they can’t wait to get out there."
17185,Is that how you feel about writing children’s books?

Traditionally, the TKTS booth in Times Square (as well as its sister locations at lower Manhattan, Lincoln Center and Downtown Brooklyn) have listed on electronic boards the names of the musicals and plays for which tickets are available each day and their individual percentage discounts. But as an experiment, the TKTS booth at Lincoln Center has begun instead listing the discounted ticket price (instead of the discount percent) for each show, leaving open the possibility that all TKTS locations will follow suit.

17298,"Billy Joel's final show at the original Nassau Coliseum was one for the ages, a three-hour marathon thrill-ride that touched on nearly every part of his career, as well as the arena's 43-year history."
17299,"Joel craftily inserted the Beatles' ""A Hard Day's Night"" into his ""River of Dreams,"" and Led Zeppelin's ""Rock and Roll"" into a roaring ""You May Be Right"" -- nods to Paul McCartney, who played the Coliseum several times, as well as Zeppelin, who was one of the arena's first big rock concerts. But the true skill came in the way the Hicksville native built the show specifically for a Long Island crowd -- whether he was talking about fights he had in a Northport restaurant or his first gig at Holy Family Church in Hicksville or his decision to play ""Captain Jack,"" a song normally reserved for his Philadelphia concerts, because it enable Joel to sing about taking you to ""your special island."""
17300,"The unpredictability of the setlist made it feel like an intimate club show where the performer knows pretty much everyone in the club rather than a massive arena concert. Only at the Coliseum would an early combination of the jazzy ""Zanzibar"" and the soaring ""Summer, Highland Falls"" make sense -- a way for Joel to telegraph within the first five songs that this was going to be a unique evening."
17301,"This was a show by (mostly) Long Islanders for Long Islanders to celebrate the area -- and, apparently, to get fans to cheer ""Let's go Islanders!"" a lot."
17302,"Joel even called his special guest Paul Simon ""a fellow Long Islander,"" a distinction Long Islanders understand about the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer from Queens. Their connection was delightfully deep, born out of a long-term friendship rather than music collaboration, which Simon pointed out did not exist outside a jokey version of ""Silver Bells"" they did with Steve Martin for ""Saturday Night Live"" one year. It was tender during ""Homeward Bound,"" but truly came to life during ""Late in the Evening,"" where Joel had a great piano solo and his band, especially the horn section of Mark Rivera, Carl Fischer and Crystal Taliefero, got to stretch and show off a bit."
17303,"After Simon and ""King of Queens"" star Kevin James made their appearances, Joel got the chance to relax a bit and show off some as well. He gave an emotional performance of ""Goodnight Saigon,"" punctuated by military personnel filling the stage to sing the chorus with him as the crowd chanted ""U.S.A.! U.S.A.!"" He offered a nice bit of misdirection starting off ""My Life"" with a bit of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic."" And before leading the sing-along of ""Piano Man,"" Joel seemed to shake off a bit of nerves and kid around by playing a bit of Stephen Foster's ""Old Folks at Home."""
17304,"""Home"" was a big topic Tuesday night. Yes, Joel gave the ""Hard Day's Night"" line, ""When I'm home, everything seems to be right"" a little extra zing. But it went deeper than that. Throughout his career, Joel has chronicled his home -- whether it's the Brenda & Eddies he grew up with in Hicksville in ""Scenes from an Italian Restaurant"" or the baymen of the East End in ""The Downeaster 'Alexa'."""
17305,"Joel could tell that the capacity crowd at the Coliseum Tuesday night was on edge. (All the booing for Gov. Andrew Cuomo was probably a good hint.) They were angry about losing the Islanders and the Coliseum, about losing part of their home."

It will, no doubt, be better, but it won't be the same. It won't be The Barn. It won't be home."
17309,"Joel's show offered concertgoers one more memory at The Barn. He offered them plenty of moments to hang on to -- from his flouncy, hands-on-hips delivery of ""Uptown Girl"" to the surprising release of his inner Robert Plant during ""Rock and Roll"" matched nicely by guitarist Tommy Byrnes unleashing his inner Jimmy Page. Joel offered them consolation in a time of upsetting change. He left them feeling alright."

17317,"Like the Empire State Building, the Yankees and pastrami on rye from the Carnegie Deli, Billy Joel is a New York City institution."
17318,"He'll cement his status as the preeminent Big Apple rock star starting Monday as he begins his residency at Madison Square Garden, performing a concert every month until ? well, there is no until at the moment, but considering that most of the shows through August are either sold out or nearly so, he could be here quite a while."
17319,"But the piano-playing singer-songwriter's connections to the New York City area stretch far beyond his residency, dipping deep into his life and music."
17320,Here are some Billy Joel NYC factoids:
17321, 
17322,"Joel was born in the Bronx on May 9, 1949, and was raised in the Long Island suburb of Hicksville."
17323, 
17324,"His first album, ""Cold Spring Harbor,"" was named after a town on the Island."

17327, 
17328,"He performed his first video special, ""Live From Long Island,"" at Nassau Coliseum on Dec. 30, 1982. The special would be aired on HBO and released on VHS (remember VHS?)"
17329, 
17330,"He is the only musician to have played at Yankee Stadium, Shea Stadium, Giants Stadium, Madison Square Garden and Nassau Coliseum. You can add Barclays Center to that now, after he played a New Year's Eve show there last month."
17331, 
17332,"He's performed at a number of benefit shows, including the Concert for New York City at MSG on Oct. 20, 2001, where he sang ""Miami (I've Seen the Lights Go out on Broadway)"" and ""New York State of Mind,"" as well as ""Your Song"" in duet with Elton John. On Dec. 12, 2012, he performed a re-worked ""Miami 2017 (I've seen the Lights Go Out on Broadway)"" at ""12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief,"" also at MSG."
17333, 
17334,"On a tour in 2006, he played 12 sold-out shows at MSG over a few months period, and was the first non-athlete to have his number retired there -- No. 12, of course."
17335, 
17336,"He lived in an apartment on Central Park South through much of the 1980s and '90s with his then wife Christie Brinkley, selling it in 1998 for $1.675 million. It was sold again this past year for $11.4 million."
17337, 
17338,"Joel's catalog was the inspiration for the jukebox musical ""Movin' Out,"" which premiered on Broadway on Oct. 24, 2002, and ran for 1,303 performances and 28 previews. It would also play on London's West End and tour nationally. It was nominated for eight Tonys and won two, for Best Orchestrations and Best Choreography. It also was nominated for six Drama Desk Awards and won one for Outstanding Choreography."

17362,'Scenes From an Italian Restaurant'
17363,"The Italian restaurant in the title was inspired by the now closed Fontana di Trevi at 151 W. 57th St., across from Carnegie Hall. The line ""Or was more than a hit at the Parkway Diner"" refers to a restaurant in Hicksville where Joel grew up."
17364,

17390,"Billy Joel will play the final concert at Nassau Coliseum, closing down the Uniondale arena with an appearance on Aug. 4."
17391,"The show marks Joel’s 32nd appearance at the venue, where a banner with his name still hangs from the rafters commemorating his record-setting run of nine sold-out shows there in 1998 during the Hicksville native’s tour to support his “Greatest Hits, Vol. 3” album."
17392,"Tickets are $49.50, $99.50 and $119.50 and go on sale at 10 a.m. on May 1 through Ticketmaster. American Express cardholders can buy a limited number of pre-sale tickets starting at 10 a.m. Monday."
17393,Joel’s concert will be the first show at the Coliseum handled by Forest City Ratner executive chairman Bruce Ratner and the final event before it closes for renovations. The arena is set to reopen in December 2016.
17394,"Nassau Events Center, a Forest City affiliate created to manage the Coliseum project, is spending $260 million to renovate and downsize the arena to 13,000 seats and build an adjacent retail and entertainment complex."
17395,"Brett Yormark, chief executive of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, who will oversee the Coliseum project, said there was never any doubt which musician would close out the 43-year-old arena."
17396,"“Billy Joel is Long Island,” Yormark said. “He was the only artist we looked at.”"
17397,Yormark said the concert will serve as a way for Long Islanders to say goodbye to the old arena while giving residents a preview of things to come.

17399,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
17400," “We look at this as closing one chapter and then establishing a new one,” he said."
17401,The Aug. 4 show will be the first time Joel has performed at the Coliseum since 2002. His only other Long Island concert since then was in 2013 when his rehearsals at The Paramount in Huntington turned into a surprise show.
17402,"Joel showed his skill at handling historic moments when he performed the final concerts at Shea Stadium in 2008, star-studded events that ended with Paul McCartney, who performed the first song at the stadium with The Beatles, leading the final song at Shea with Joel and his band. Those shows became the basis of the well-received documentary “Last Play at Shea.”"
17403,"Ratner first hinted at Joel handling the Coliseum’s farewell in June 2013, as he pitched his Coliseum renovation proposal to the Long Island Real Estate Group. Ratner said at the time that he had polled Long Islanders about who they wanted to see play at the renovated arena and that Joel was the overwhelming favorite."
17404,"Around that time, Joel said he would be interested in playing the Coliseum one final time, but was unsure whether the scheduling could be worked out. Since then, Joel launched a monthly residency at Madison Square Garden that has already been extended through the end of 2015 and is also touring stadiums this summer, including Fenway Park in Boston and Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. He will also headline the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in June. However, he found the time for the final Coliseum show."
17405,"Some details of the concert remain uncertain, Yormark said, including the identity of an opening act."
17406,"Yormark said it’s also unclear who will staff the concert. More than 2,500 full and part-time Coliseum employees received notification from the state Department of Labor last week that they would be laid off by July 31, when Pennsylvania-based Spectator Management Group’s lease with Nassau County to run the arena expires."
17407,"“Billy Joel represents the years of joy the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum has brought to residents and serves as an exciting reminder of the decades of entertainment our residents will enjoy in the soon to be renovated coliseum,” Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano said in a statement."

17441,The shocking “Blacklist” revelation that Raymond Reddington is in fact an impostor who’s assumed the deceased Red's identity for years may not be so groundbreaking to those closest to him.
17442,"Harlem-born actor Hisham Tawfiq, who plays Reddington’s bodyguard/right-hand man, is convinced his Dembe Zuma knows all."
17443,"“It’s pretty clear through the five seasons that Dembe — and our writers may turn around and make me eat these words — but Dembe, I think, knows everything,” Tawfiq, 48, says."
17444,"But fans are torn. How could Dembe, the loyal light of hope in the darkness that is the city-set “Blacklist” know the truth behind who the criminal mastermind, played by James Spader, really is?"
17445,"“If you look back at all of the seasons, Dembe has always said just tell the truth, which adds to the belief that he knows and if Red would just do that then it would take a lot of relief and stress off his shoulders but he refuses to do that,” he explains, admitting that the actors still don’t know the answers to all of fans’ cliffhanger questions."
17446,"Entering season 6, the man who fans believed to be Liz Keen’s (Megan Boone) father is incarcerated — his laundry list of transgressions catching up to him. This new prison backdrop will without fail alter the landscape of the NBC series, giving other characters the chance to step in where Red’s limitations now lie."
17447,"“Red usually operates being able to do and go wherever he wants at any time,” he says. “With him being locked up, it puts myself and other people in the task force in a position to do things they normally wouldn’t do.”"

17451,"“What Dembe and Red do together, I think we’ve done it all ... But there is actually one thing [this season] that is kind of shocking, there is,” he teases, without slipping any details."
17452,"Excited about the prospect of taking on new (albeit illegal) experiences in “The Blacklist” world, Tawfiq recalls that it wasn’t long ago his character was expected to fade out of the script."
17453,"Dembe, the former freedom fighter from South Sudan, started as a series extra, not yet written in the script. Tawfiq was cast in the series, his breakout role, in 2013 with not one line to his name."
17454,"“It’s huge,” he says of his progression to supporting actor and eventually series regular, and now keeper of Red's deepest secret. “I think every actor, a lot of people are preparing for a moment that’ll change their career and the way it worked with me. It all just snowballed."""
17455,"Tawfiq went to casting auditions in New York City as a “side passion,” while corrections officer, Marine, and firefighter padded out his resume. It wasn’t until 20 years with the New York Fire Department — two years into his gig on “The Blacklist” — that the New Yorker retired to pursue acting full time."
17456,"“Originally born in Harlem, oldest of five brothers, I never really looked at the arts as a career path that would sustain me financially,” he reflects. “But I never lost sight of my passion and my dream.”"
17457,"He continues: “Mine started out as an improv and for one episode and it just continued to snowball until I turn around season 3 or 4 and I’m like, ‘wow, look how this rolled out.’ But it’s something I don’t take for granted. When I look back, it was a lesson learned about how every opportunity can be a big one.”"
17458,“The Blacklist” returns with a two-part premiere on Jan. 3 at 10 p.m. and Jan. 4 at 9 p.m. on NBC.

17478,"The film starts with a terrible blind date at a Hooters with Barrymore's Lauren and Sandler's Jim, where they couldn't be more wrong for each other. Standard movie circumstance leads them to run into each other a few more times, further fueling their mutual dislike, but allowing the narrative to divulge that each is a single parent -- Lauren has two boys, Jim with three girls -- and a common connection. Lauren's business partner Jen (Wendi McLendon-Covey, hilarious) is dating Jim's boss."
17479,"All this is buildup to what you've all seen in the trailers -- these two families stuck with each other at a fancy resort in Africa, which is hosting a special event for blended families. I'm sure you've all seen enough romantic comedies to know what happens from here."
17480,"It doesn't sound like a recipe for a winning film, but there is legitimate magic when Barrymore and Sandler are on screen together. Their dance from enemies to friends to more is infectious fun, and the supporting cast deviates enough from Sandler's usual cohorts to keep the film afloat. Joel McHale is spot on as Lauren's sleazy ex-husband, and ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine"" superstar Terry Crews acts almost as a Greek Chorus with his band of singers reflecting on Lauren and Jim's burgeoning relationship. There's also a cohort of child actors who are each funny and touching in their own way."
17481,"Swap out Barrymore for another female lead and ""Blended"" might have gone the way of ""Grown Ups"" or ""Just Go With It."" Instead, we get another fun rom-com from these two likable leads."

17529,"Patrick Stewart belongs at the helm of a television comedy. If there's anything truism to be taken away from his recent years as a social media superstar and unflagging commitment to self-deprecation, it's that."
17530,"Seth MacFarlane, who cast Stewart as the narrator of his ""Ted"" comedies, is nothing if not attuned to the pop cultural winds. So, he approached Jonathan Ames (""Bored to Death"") about putting together a vehicle for the man who is so much more than just Capt. Picard and the result is ""Blunt Talk,"" premiering on Starz Saturday."
17531,But why this show in particular? Why cast Stewart as a comic blowhard newsman? amNewYork spoke with Ames and Stewart himself to find out more.
17532,"Jonathan, what led you from Patrick Stewart to Walter Blunt?"
17533,"Jonathan Ames: I got an email from my agent saying that Seth MacFarlane was looking for a writer. And he said, ""Do you want to get on the phone with Seth MacFarlane?"" And I said, ""Sure, what's it about?"" And he said, in an email, ""He needs an idea for a comedy for Patrick Stewart."" I was like, ""OK, that's interesting."" So then that night, the night before the phone call, I happened to be channel surfing and I passed CNN. I saw Piers Morgan looming in front of an electric set, his head looked kind of enormous, and I thought, ""Patrick Stewart would look so formidable on a cable news set, his head looming like something out of George Orwell."""
17534,"Patrick, what were your initial thoughts of the idea?"
17535,"Patrick Stewart: The basic idea immediately appealed to me. I've been a news junkie all my life, so the idea of playing a character who was at the very heart of cable news, like Walter, and who was captivating, opinionated, very controversial in the type of journalism he was interested in, his objectives are very, very excellent objectives, he wants to make a better world and tell the truth to his audiences. The initial concept was very, very attractive to me."

We got into the habit of meeting for coffee down on Fifth Avenue in the morning and talking for several hours, often most of the morning. Our conversation was not so much, what should ""Blunt Talk"" be, but we talked about our lives, personal interests, anecdotes about the past and so forth. And out of that, gradually began to emerge the character who was Walter. The great leap forward was sitting alongside Jonathan."
17540,The news media is well-trod satirical territory. What was your sense of the terrain?
17541,"JA: The main interest, the news is a great building to house all these characters, in a sense, a stage for them all. I think in many ways the primary focus was family and the relationships with the characters and the job as a workplace that brings out issues or stresses. But we did try to connect the news stories with what was going on with the family, the staff, of ""Blunt Talk."" ... In terms of the news, the thing I wanted to do in our own way amidst the comedy, was bring up important issues nevertheless."
17542,"Patrick, when did you know you had become a social media phenomenon?"
17543,"PS: My wife and I moved into a new apartment in Brooklyn and we were having problems with Time Warner. If you live on the East Coast, you'll know that's nothing new. And so, after two days the poor woman was so frustrated with the service we'd been getting. I came home and found her at her wit's end after another day of Time Warner problems. So I sent a Tweet: ""All we want is Internet and television access, but after two days of dealing with Time Warner, I've lost the will to live."" That was what showed me, in the massive and instantaneous reaction to that tweet, the power of the Internet. Not just to make complaints or statements about the world, but also to have fun."

17563,"Thanks to his indelible music and his ""voice of a generation"" status, people will parse anything Bob Dylan does for meaning. One researcher famously went through his garbage. Of course, some things beyond the music are worth paying attention to. Fans are eagerly awaiting the sequel to Dylan's 2004 book ""Chronicles: Volume One."""

17569,"There is absolutely no correlation between the music and the artwork. None. Moreover, we are showcasing a totally new interpretation of drawings from that period that have been completely rethought, reworked and reinvigorated."

17574,Can you tell us about some of the paintings on display?
17575,Bob Dylan feels that each of his paintings is to be interpreted by the viewer. He has never given any specific descriptions for his images and wants each one to have separate and distinct meaning for each viewer.
17576,"""Train Tracks"" is the iconic image symbolizing Bob Dylan's journey both personally and professionally. He is still on the road well over 100 days per year. Other images are to be taken as elements of his travels to destinations around the globe. The ""Man on the Bridge"" piece is a personal favorite that has neither a beginning nor an end.

17756,"You’ll have to see the show to learn what body part “Bootycandy,” the peculiar, slang-style title of Robert O’Hara’s satirical and offbeat five-actor play, is a codeword for. It’s actually a surprise."
17757,"However, I can tell you that the show, which serves as the season opener for Off-Broadway’s Playwrights Horizons, is an uneven, messy but often hilarious ride throughout the imagination and memories of a gay African-American male."
17758,"Imagine a graduate school seminar in gender and racial studies and deconstructionist theory, as told through the skit-like structure and over-the-top tone of “Saturday Night Live.”"

17774,"His subtlety is on display one final time in ""Boulevard,"" which features his final big screen performance and is a movie that garners the entirety of its dramatic power from the moments of stifling quiet and the dramatic things left unsaid between the star's Nolan Mack and his long-suffering wife Joy (Kathy Baker)."
17775,"The marriage between Nolan, a 60-year-old bank employee, and Joy, a part-time ESL teacher, is utterly passionless, though there is a strong platonic love between them. Years of repression and inner conflict come to a head when Nolan, who has hidden his homosexuality from the world, drives aimlessly one night, happens upon a young male prostitute named Leo (Roberto Aguire) and decides that he needs saving."
17776,"That sounds like fodder for a bad Lifetime movie, or some other cheap piece of exploitation. "
17777,"But director Dito Montiel (""A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints"") handles it with the utmost sensitivity and Williams and Baker elevate things to the point where you feel the pangs of loss and regret that permeate the picture from beginning to end."

17786, It wasn't even a contest.
17787,"""Furious 7"" roared to the top of the box office chart for the second weekend in a row, picking up $60.6 million and driving its stateside total to a massive $252.5 million. That's a slender 59% drop from the Universal Pictures release's record-breaking $147.2 million debut and puts ""Furious 7"" on track to be the highest-grossing film in the history of the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise."
17788,"""People feel like they're living through the summer movie season right now even though it's not summer,"" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Rentrak. ""It's the essence of a popcorn movie."""
17789,"It's also the essence of perfect timing. By debuting in April, ""Furious 7"" avoided being cannibalized by other major summer tentpole films. The next heavyweight to enter the multiplexes is ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" which doesn't hit screens until May 1."
17790,"""Studios are not afraid to place a strong movie in unconventional times and it's paying off quite well,"" said Phil Contrino, vice president and chief analyst at BoxOffice.com. ""There's no need to open everything in June, July or May when you'll get creamed by whatever opens the next week."""
17791,"Records continue to be left in the rear view mirror. ""Furious 7"" is now the fastest Universal release to cross $200 million, jetting by that barrier in only eight days. It took ""Despicable Me 2,"" the studio's previous high-water mark, 11 days to reach that milestone. ""Furious 7"" is also one of only a dozen movies to do more than $60 million in its second weekend."
17792,"Fan interest in seeing how ""Furious 7"" would handle the death of star Paul Walker is helping to drive ticket buyers to the sequel. Walker was killed in a car accident in 2013 at the age of 40 before filming was completed on the picture."
17793,"""It's getting the best reviews of the franchise and people are talking about the poignancy of the footage of Paul Walker,"" said Dergarabedian. ""The fans are basically in charge of marketing it right now and they're creating great word-of-mouth."""

The Fox release was on the low end of debuts for a film based on aNicholas Sparks' literary property, failing to match ""Safe Haven's"" $21.4 million bow or the $22.5 million kick-off for ""The Lucky One."" It did do significantly better than ""The Best of Me,"" the most recent sudser from Sparks, which opened to a dispiriting $10 million last October."
17798,"Critics were savage, as they usually are with Sparks' work, but audiences seemed to enjoy the romantic drama, handing it an A CinemaScore rating. ""The Longest Ride"" got its strongest response from the middle of the country, the so-called heartland, and attracted an audience that was 73% female and 54% under the age of 25."
17799,"""Word will get out,"" said Chris Aronson, Fox's domestic distribution chief. ""I remember sitting in focus groups for the film and, to a person, everyone said this is the best Nicholas Sparks movie they'd ever seen and that includes 'The Notebook.' So that's the word that will permeate."""
17800,"""The Longest Ride"" centers on a former rodeo star who falls for a college student with dreams of life in the Big Apple. It cost $34 million to produce and features emerging stars Scott Eastwood (son of Clint) and Britt Robertson (soon to make waves in ""Tomorrowland"")."
17801,"Prison comedy ""Get Hard"" picked up $8.6 million in its third weekend of release to nab fourth place. The Warner Bros. film has earned $71.2 million since debuting in March. ""Cinderella"" completed the top five, earning $7.2 million and pushing its domestic total to $180.8 million."
17802,"In limited release, ""Ex Machina"" did impressive business, snagging $249,956 from just four screens. The science-fiction thriller was buoyed by sterling reviews."
17803,"Noah Baumbach's ""While We're Young"" performed well after expanding from 34 to 246 screens, earning $1.4 million. The comic look at a documentarian in the throes of a mid-life crisis has earned $2.4 million since debuting three weeks ago."
17804,"The Weinstein Company's ""Woman in Gold"" also had a big expansion, moving from 258 to 1,504 locations and earning $5.8 million in the process. The drama about a fight to recover art stolen by the Nazis has made north of $9 million in two weeks."
17805,"Backstage drama ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" opened to $69,729 on three screens, for a $23,243 per screen average."

17827,"The new sci-fi thriller film “400 Days” might seem like a reunion of sorts for actors Brandon Routh, Caity Lotz and Tom Cavanagh, who all star in several DC Comics series on The CW. "
17828,"Routh and Lotz play Ray Palmer (The Atom) and Sara Lance (White Canary), respectively, on “Arrow,” and starting Jan. 21 both will star in “Legends of Tomorrow.” Cavanagh plays Harrison Wells on “The Flash,” where Routh guest starred."
17829,But the film was actually well into production before Routh knew he would be working with Lotz and Cavanagh on the small screen.
17830,"“Actually, [‘400 Days’] was all prior to my role as Ray Palmer, oddly enough,” Routh says. “It was during the last week of filming that I found out that I was going to have a meeting to talk to the producers about a featured role as Ray Palmer. It worked backward.”"
17831,"In “400 Days,” Routh plays Theo, one of four astronauts (with Dane Cook, Ben Feldman and Lotz) who are on a simulated space mission, kept underground, to explore the effects of being isolated for a long period of time. As you can imagine, things don’t go as planned, building into a tense, psychological showdown."

17836,What drew you to “400 Days”?
17837,"I had never really done a sci-fi thriller or a thriller of any sort, and I was kind of intrigued by the process. I’m not a huge fan of scary movies, horror movies, but I do like thrillers. I also like the whole idea, the concept of space simulation. And I’d never done astronaut stuff either."
17838, 
17839,How would you do if you had to be sequestered away?
17840,"I’d like to think that I’d do OK. Now, with a 3-year-old son, maybe not so well, just because I’d be very worried about him not seeing me. ... That would definitely make a journey like that much more challenging. But prior to having a kid, I’d like to think that I had the mental fortitude to do it, and I like those challenges. I don’t know — a lot of it would depend on the people that you’re with, too. It would make a big difference about how your time goes, the people that you’re trapped with."
17841, 
17842,This is writer/director Matt Osterman’s second film. How was it working with him?
17843,"Matt is great, very passionate about his projects. He’s the writer/director, he came up with this concept and he really has a lot of passion he brought to the set, always coming up with new ideas. [He] was very collaborative working with all of us, because there are a lot of what might be red herrings in the movie and he had to explain all them to us sometimes because it’s such a head trip. There are things happening that I didn’t even realize. ... And sometimes you don’t get it until you see the finished product. The film looks great and he had a great ability to communicate with the all cast and crew. And we’re both from the Midwest. He’s from Minnesota, I’m from Iowa. It was awesome to have a Midwest teamup."
17844, 
17845,You co-star with Dane Cook. How do you think he did in a more dramatic role?
17846,"It was the first time I’d met Dane and didn’t know what to expect. He’s a very nice guy, very down to earth. His stage presence is definitely more of a persona he puts on. He’s certainly funny in person, but maybe because he doesn’t want to be the guy cracking jokes all the time. But, he certainly is very witty and very collaborative. He’s a producer on the film, and he helped to make the world the way that it is, very welcoming to me and we had a good time. And I think he did really great job, had a nice, grounded performance. We have a couple heated moments in the movie where our characters get upset with each other, and it was great. He did a fantastic job. I think he has great ability and will continue to do more, I hope."

17854,"Brandon Routh has the unique perspective of playing multiple superheroes. He’s suiting up as Ray Palmer, aka The Atom, in “DC’s Legends of Tomorrow,” debuting Thursday on The CW, and he played perhaps the biggest hero of them all — Kal El, aka Clark Kent, aka Superman — in the 2006 film “Superman Returns.”"
17855,One is a brilliant scientist with the ability to shrink down thanks to a suit he built; the other is a flying alien with numerous powers including super-strength and heat vision.
17856,"But for Routh, the biggest difference between playing the characters doesn’t have to do with any kind of powers."
17857,"“There are a lot of differences, there are some similarities,” Routh says. “The biggest difference is that Ray is a human being ... and the fact that Ray is not superhuman — he has interesting abilities, but certainly not superhuman. It makes him more like playing a real person. He is a real person. Superman is like playing an ethereal being in some ways.”"
17858,"Beyond The Atom, there is a slew of other DC Comics characters showing up in “Legends of Tomorrow.” And with superheroes and villains come some cool costumes."
17859,"“Mine is pretty awesome,” Routh says. “It looks pretty cool. Who do I like? All the other suits are pretty sweet. What I think is the coolest other one on camera, when you see it, is Firestorm. The CG quality for his fire is pretty awesome. And it’s pretty cool also to see Hawkman and Hawkgirl.

Here are some shows soon to shutter:"

17938,"1.5 STARS: The disco-bio-jukebox musical, which opened last spring to negative reviews, features all of Summer’s crowd-pleasing hits (“Love to Love You Baby,” “Hot Stuff,” “Last Dance”). Three performers portray Summer at different stages of her life — which also happens to be the organizing concept for “The Cher Show.” At the end, the theater transforms into Studio 54, complete with giant mirror balls and glitter.

17939,'Head Over Heels'
17940,"1.5 STARS: Another jukebox musical that opened to less-than-enthusiastic reviews, “Head Over Heels” inserts the hit songs of the all-female 1980s pop-punk band The Go-Go’s (“We Got the Beat,” “Vacation,” “Heaven Is a Place On Earth”) into a baffling, free-spirited, Elizabethan-era pastiche containing court masque-style painted scenery, dialogue in iambic pentameter, drag performance, colored lights, and an ostentatious dress code. Closes Jan. 6 at the Hudson Theatre, 141 W. 44th St."
17941,'Once on This Island'
17942,"4 STARS: Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty’s Caribbean-flavored fairy-tale musical has been performed by numerous schools and amateur groups since 1990, but there has probably never been a production quite like Michael Arden’s stunning, in-the-round production, which managed to snag the Tony for Best Musical Revival over “My Fair Lady.” Arden brings an unexpected dose of gritty realism while also honoring the musical’s gorgeous score, open spirituality and joyful theatricality.

Closes on Jan. 6 at the Lyceum Theatre, 149 W. 45th St."

17948,"3 STARS: The Broadway revival of Harvey Fierstein’s comedic drama (previously known as “Torch Song Trilogy”) ran 1,222 performances at the same theater where it is now playing. However, this production (which premiered Off-Broadway last year and stars Michael Urie as the sensitive drag performer Arnold Beckoff and Mercedes Ruehl as his domineering mother) will only manage to accrue 77 regular performances. A national tour with Urie will launch in the fall. Closes Jan. 6 at the Hayes Theater, 240 W. 44th St."
17949,'School of Rock'
17950,"3.5 STARS: Andrew Lloyd Webber returned to his rock roots and enjoyed his biggest hit in decades with this family-friendly musical adaptation of the 2003 Jack Black film. It has launched the careers of numerous young performers (who played their own instruments) in addition to original lead actor Alex Brightman, who will be returning to the same theater in the spring to play the title role in “Beetlejuice.” Closes Jan. 20 at the Winter Garden Theatre, 1634 Broadway."

17971,"Investments in Broadway shows and other live entertainment will soon get the same tax break that has long been on the books for TV and movie productions -- a move that will make it easier to attract financing, producers say."
17972,The legislation sponsored by Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and passed by Congress last week will make the investments eligible or tax deductions the same year they are made.
17973,"The change, which takes full effect next year, will be up for renewal every two years -- like its film industry counterparts."
17974,"“Nobody works harder than the people on Broadway and nobody deserves this bill better than the people on Broadway to stimulate theater,” Broadway producer Harvey Weinstein said, speaking at Sardi’s surrounded by several Broadway stars, including Matthew Morrison of “Finding Neverland.”"
17975,"Schumer said he hopes the legislation, part of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, makes investing in new shows a bit less of a risk. It will allow those who put their money up for a show the ability to take is a deduction immediately, regardless of if a show is turning a profit yet."
17976,"“In a sense, this is our insurance policy in a bad year,” Schumer said. “So it makes a great deal of sense.”"
17977,"Robert Wankel, the chairman of The Broadway League, said convincing investors to hand over their money is difficult enough, and the old tax code put the industry at an even greater disadvantage by having to tell investors they may have to pay taxes on that investment before turning a profit."

17988,"Reversing its earlier decision, The Broadway League decided to dim the lights on Broadway on Tuesday in honor of Joan Rivers after receiving an avalanche of objections."
17989,"""Joan Rivers loved Broadway and we loved her. Due to the outpouring of love and respect for Joan Rivers from our community and from her friends and fans worldwide, the marquees of Broadway theatres in New York will be dimmed in her memory, at exactly 6:45 pm for one minute,"" Executive Director Charlotte St. Martin said in a statement."
17990,"""This is why I love being an American: We saw an injustice, and because we're allowed to in this country, we spoke up and righted the wrong,"" said Tom D'Angora, the producer of ""NEWSical: The Musical"" and ""Naked Boys Singing."""
17991,"D'Angora started an online petition Monday night demanding the lights be dimmed for Rivers, who was nominated for a 1994 Best Actress Tony for ""Sally Marr ... And Her Escorts,"" and appeared on Broadway in three productions. While D'Angora did not begrudge lights being turned down for people such as writer/composer Mary Rodgers Guettel and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner after their deaths, he insisted that Rivers, a ""great champion of our community"" deserved similar respect."
17992,Rivers died last week at the age of 81.
17993,"More than 5,000 people signed the Care2 petition in less than 20 hours, many with comments sniping at the League's seemingly arbitrary criteria and noting Rivers' devotion as not just a performer, but a patron. ""Ridiculous this is even a question,"" wrote Gregory Piccoli."
17994,"""I am madly in love with my community right now: I want to make out with every single member of the Broadway community,"" D'Angora said of his victory, before heading out the door of his Hell's Kitchen apartment to cast his vote in the state primaries."

18005,"After years of covering the entertainment industry as a reporter, Elizabeth Durand Streisand decided to jump into the mix."
18006,"Streisand started the online platform Broadway Roulette in 2016 to help theatregoers battle what she called “decision fatigue.” By turning expiring ticket inventory into a surprise cultural experience, she hoped to change the decision-making process into something much simpler."
18007,"The startup recently raised close to $2 million of seed money to help expand the company. Broadway Roulette is also part of Morgan Stanley’s Multicultural Innovation Lab, which focuses on startups led by women and multicultural entrepreneurs."
18008,"Streisand lives on the Upper West Side with her husband, 2-year-old son and 11-year-old maltipoo. Via email, she discussed with amNewYork the challenges of starting a new business and how she plans to expand."
18009,You started out as an entertainment journalist — what made you change careers and create Broadway Roulette?
18010,"I hosted many guests over the years in New York City and “see a Broadway show” was on everyone’s to-do list, but once they realized how difficult and expensive it would be to get tickets to one of the few they had heard of, most people ended up skipping this experience entirely. One day, a friend asked me to get her a ticket to “anything that wasn’t 'Phantom' [because she had seen it], that was under $100” and it was one of those light bulb moments. I loved being a journalist and changing careers in my 30s at the same time I had a baby wasn’t an easy decision, but I knew that in 20 years I would regret it more if I hadn’t tried."

18015,How does Broadway Roulette work and why should someone try it?
18016,"Broadway Roulette is the fun and easy way to see a Broadway show (or many!) all for a low, flat price. The twist? The show is a surprise! You pick a date, number of tickets, and eliminate up to six shows that you’ve already seen or don’t want to see — then we “spin the wheel” and match you with a show that fits, all at flat rates that are below the list price of the tickets. On the morning of your selected day, you receive a text and email telling you what show you’ve won and all necessary details. Our customers get a great deal without the pain points (lines, lotteries, hunting for discounts) usually involved — but more than that, they really enjoy the element of surprise. Yes, we provide a discount, but more than that, we provide the chance to discover something new — both on stage and potentially about the world or even yourself. Also, you can play again and again because we never send you to the same show twice."
18017,What did you learn since starting Broadway Roulette that you could share with other entrepreneurs?
18018,"Listen more than you talk. What other people say (and don’t) is the most valuable input you will get when building a new way of doing things. It’s tempting to tell potential clients/partners everything you can in the time you have about how you’re going to revolutionize your industry, but it’s more beneficial to hear what they have to say."
18019,How do you see this business expanding and what are some plans for the future?
18020,"We are soon to launch “Beyond Broadway,” a curated Roulette of top quality shows all around the city. It’s a great way to discover the next ""Hamilton"" before it’s ""Hamilton,"" see world-famous shows that aren’t in the Theater District, and experience performances that are better suited to more intimate spaces."
18021,"It will work in a similar way to Broadway Roulette, but with more specific show groupings such as “parents coming to town” or “recovering from a breakup.” "

18128,"The 2009 announcement that the lead singer of indie-pop band The Shins and the producer behind the landmark Jay Z/Beatles mash-up project ""The Grey Album"" were collaborating on a record made many people presume that it would be a one-off release."
18129,"After all, producer Danger Mouse had become very in-demand, especially after the success of his work with Gnarls Barkley, while James Mercer's band, The Shins, is one of the most celebrated of 2000s indie pop."
18130,"But from within the duo, Broken Bells was never seen as a one-and-done pairing."
18131,"""I didn't know at the time what the future of The Shins was going to be so I wasn't looking at this as a side project,"" Mercer said. ""I just went in 100% with [Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse] to do this."""

18154,"When Bronx native Noëlle Santos decided to open an independent bookstore in her home borough, she had never set foot in one herself."
18155,"When The Lit. Bar opens in the Bronx this summer, it will be the borough’s first bookstore since the Baychester Barnes & Noble closed in 2016."
18156,"“I wasn’t educated on the power and magic of independent bookstores, because I never was exposed to one,” the 31-year-old entrepreneur says. “I’m disgusted that we’re not offering this intellectual visibility in our community.”"
18157,"This idea for The Lit. Bar started in October 2014, when Santos was “wasting time on Facebook” and came across a petition to stop the Bronx’s Barnes & Noble from shutting its doors. "
18158,"“I lived at that Barnes & Noble, so I was devastated,” Santos says."
18159,"At the time, she was working a six-figure job in human relations for an IT firm in lower Manhattan. She was “ashamed” to realize that the borough she grew up in, home to more than 1.4 million New Yorkers, didn’t have another bookstore."
18160,"At the time she was urging friends to sign the petition and save Barnes & Noble, Santos had plans to move in with her longtime boyfriend in Long Island City. But within two days of seeing the Barnes & Noble petition, Santos already had the concept and name for The Lit. Bar picked out and her life totally changed."

18163,"“I was very comfortable, moving up the corporate ladder, and I thought that was life what was,” Santos says. “But I canceled my life. . . . I was tired of running away. I felt like a coward leaving the borough in the same condition I found it in.”"
18164,Leaving no longer felt right to Santos.
18165,"“A lot of people like me get our educations, get out of the hood and measure our success on how far we can get from the Bronx,” Santos says. “We’ve been complaining about the investment in education and the arts forever, and our solution was just to leave and we take our greatest resources, which is ourselves and our education, with us.” "
18166,"With the Barnes & Noble in jeopardy, Santos immediately started saving money to start her own bookstore, looking to the city’s independent bookstores for inspiration, guidance and practical skill building. She worked at Housing Works taking out the garbage, carrying boxes of wine to set up for events and learning the point-of-sale system. She worked shifts on the register at Word Up Community Bookshop in Washington Heights."
18167,"“I did whatever I could do to get hands on training,” says Santos, who had never worked retail before she dreamed up The Lit. Bar."
18168,"In 2016, Santos headed to the Amelia Islands in Florida to take a weeklong course on running a bookstore. While there, she met a Harlemite also interested in opening up a local store, who encouraged her to enter a small business competition run by the New York Public Library and Citi Foundation. Santos came in second place, and buzz surrounding the bookstore began to grow."
18169,"Though Santos initially thought crowdfunding for a for-profit business was “so tacky,” she launched an Indiegogo campaign, exceeding her initial goal of $100,000 in just five weeks."
18170,"Now, with a space in a new building in Mott Haven, Santos is getting ready to finally launch The Lit. Bar."
18171,"When it opens, there will be a floor-to-ceiling sliding ladder across bookshelves, so Santos can live out her “Beauty and the Beast” Belle fantasies, murals and graffiti by local artists adorning the walls, and, pending approval, the bar part of bookstore’s name."
18172,"The inventory will be reflective of the community The Lit. Bar intends to serve, says Santos, who aims to sell books by authors of color and featuring protagonists of color, as well as people from different marginalized groups."
18173,"“When I was young, I thought all authors were dead people,” Santos, a lifelong bookworm, says. “I didn’t realize they were living, breathing people I could connect to. I didn’t know being an author or bookseller was a career option.”"
18174,"Unlike the old Barnes & Noble, The Lit. Bar is easily accessible by subway, though Santos wants to prioritize serving both existing and new residents in South Bronx so they “can become real neighbors.” Recent tensions over gentrification have made Santos more than ever want to create a “safe space for people to actually connect.”"

18182,"The third season of the TLC reality drama “Long Lost Family” opened with the uncanny story of two sisters who were separated for decades, but grew up just blocks apart in the Bronx."
18183,"“I always thought I was just another foster child and no one was looking for me,” Christina Hernandez says. “I was afraid I’d die and not know where I came from.”"
18184,"Hernandez, who was born with the name Claribel, was separated from her family before the age of two. Her younger sister Engris Lopez remembers being 7 years old, holding her grandmother’s hand in a New York City courtroom and locking eyes with Claribel. It was the first and last time she’d see her biological sister for more than 30 years."
18185,"Lopez, now 39 years old, reunited with her long-lost sibling who slipped away from her family’s custody that day on the TLC series’ premiere Sunday. "
18186,"The Bronx native, who was adopted by her grandmother at just 4 months old, lead the episodic search for the sister who she knew only as Claribel. She and her sibling were both removed from their mother’s custody due to her battle with a drug and alcohol addiction, the sisters said."
18187,Claribel was entered into the foster care system instead of being placed in her grandmother’s care due to reasons that remained unclear to the siblings for years.
18188,"“Growing up, I always in the back of my head kept replaying that same scenario. I knew I had a sister . . . I remember her eyes,” Lopez said in the season opener, adding that she never stopped looking for her, but searches came up short."
18189,"Claribel, who now goes by her adoptive name Christina Hernandez, says a switch in the names on her birth certificate caused a confusion that kept the sisters apart."

18192,"“My sister was searching for Lopez, she was born Lopez, which was supposed to be my original last name, and that right there is what messed up everything,” Hernandez says."
18193,"About a year ago Lopez decided to turn to Chris Jacobs, the host of the TLC series, for help."
18194,"“Growing up in New York, I was told at an early age that I was adopted,” Hernandez recalls. “I was always curious to find out one day if I have a sister or if my mother or birth father were around. But I was super young, so it wasn’t a priority.” "
18195,The 33-year-old found the family she thought she’d never know on national television thanks to an ancestry DNA test she submitted months before Lopez’s search with Jacobs began.
18196,Their story came with a few uncanny twists — like the two sisters realizing they’d walked the same sidewalks on Southern Boulevard for years and the fact that they both currently reside in Florida. 
18197,"“I lived, I want to say, four or five New York blocks away from her,” Hernandez says. “I would pass there, but who knows we probably bumped into each other without even knowing.” "
18198,Hernandez said her adoptive parents didn’t look into reconnecting the sisters simply due to a lack of information and a misunderstanding. Her parents thought Lopez wasn’t a full relative and Lopez’s grandmother said a language barrier in court prevented her from properly explaining. 
18199,"“Finding out I had a grandmother was actually a plus to all this. I didn’t even know Engris had contact with her,” Hernandez says, adding that she had searched for her family through social media for nearly a decade with no luck. "
18200,"The sisters officially met about 10 months ago when the episode filmed, during an emotional, tear-filled reunion. Since then, they’ve been trying to fill in the gaps. "
18201,““You cannot separate us!” Hernandez cries. “We’ve celebrated Halloween and Christmas together so far. We’re inseparable.” 
18202,"“Long Lost Family” features hosts Jacobs and Lisa Joyner, both adoptees, who reunite families from across the country who have been separated for years. New episodes air on Sundays at 10 p.m."

18253,"New Yorkers weary of cold concrete and slow subways will envy the young couple in Ben Dolnick’s new novel, “The Ghost Notebooks.” Dreaming of gardens and birding and hiking and hammocks, Hannah and Nick flee the city for an upstate adventure. She’s the new caretaker at the Wright Historic House; he will finally get back to writing music and their relationship will certainly blossom anew. Then Hannah disappears."
18254,The Brooklyn author’s fourth novel is an insightful look at our visions and revisions as we grapple with love and grief. Nick’s search for answers leads to questions about mental health — his own and Hannah’s — and the supernatural. You’ll also likely laugh. A lot.
18255,amNewYork spoke with Dolnick about his inspirations for the book.
18256, 
18257,Do you believe in ghosts?
18258,"I don’t think that I do. I am willing to believe that we are massively wrong about a number of very important things, and possibly the afterlife is one of them, but in my heart I’m not quite there yet."

18262,Did anything specific inspire the novel?
18263,"My wife used to work at a historic house in Prospect Park, called the Lefferts [Historic] House, so I spent a lot of time standing around historic houses sort of daydreaming stories, which is kind of what I do in free time. And she and I used to drive past the Lefferts House all the time, and one of the drives I said to her, ‘I don’t know why, but whenever we drive past at night I can really picture coming upon the house on fire, like [it’s] very easy to imagine flames shooting out of it.’ And she said, ‘That’s really weird. I do that too.’ . . . Often my novels work like that for me, that I get one image and then the novel is just sort of a process of like, figuring out, ‘OK, so why is the house on fire? Who set it on fire? Who lives there?’ and so on."
18264, 
18265,You write very movingly about loss and grief. What event did you draw on for that?
18266,"Well, I have known people who have died. Luckily no one as close to me as Nick is to Hanna, but I think to the extent that it drew on anything, there are those times . . . where a classmate or something, even somebody you don’t know very well, sort of shockingly dies. And for a few days, or sometimes longer, there’s kind of this, like a Band Aid has been pulled off. . . . You just feel how awful and random and permanent and devastating it is in a way that I don’t think you could quite bear to always feel it. And so I think I sort of tried, for the book, to squirrel my way back into those few days of shock that you always feel when someone you know even distantly has died."
18267, 
18268,"There is some real laugh-out-loud humor in this book. Was that conscious to lighten very emotional material, or are you just a funny guy?"
18269,"I did think it was important that the book be funny. I knew that it was going to have hopefully sad and spooky elements, and so I thought humor would be an important thing to have in the mix, just so the reader doesn’t have a totally gray experience. But I think it’s also the case in general, that just humor is incredibly important to me. All of my good friends are really funny, my wife is really funny, the books I love are really funny. Just if I know nothing else about a person, if I know that they’re funny, chances are I’m going to like them."
18270, 
18271,Did you ever live in a small town?
18272,"My wife and I do have a little falling-apart-y kind of house upstate. We actually bought it part way through the writing of this book, so it was sort of an accidentally very useful research tool. So to the extent that I have any experience with small-town life, that is it. But no, I’ve been in the city for, 18 years I guess."
18273, 
18274,It seems that one of the themes is maybe the shortcomings of the mental health services in the U.S. Is that an issue that’s dear to your heart?
18275,"I am very interested in mental health. I’ve seen therapists, I have experienced anxiety, depression, all the sort of normal stew of human stuff. I’ve never been hospitalized or anything, but I am very interested in and sort of, I guess you could say, disappointed about the extent to which it feels like we don’t really know what we’re doing with a lot of psychiatric treatment. For this book, I spent a day or two at Bellevue, on the East Side. It was just kind of depressing, obviously being around so many people who are incredibly depressed, but also it just didn’t feel very state-of-the-art, or something. . . . I don’t know exactly what kind of treatment I’m imagining, but the way that we do treat people who are mentally ill in such a different category than the people who are physically ill, I find kind of unfair and sad."

18398,"For one weekend every spring, phenomenal folk musicians from across the city and around the world gather in Kings County for a celebration of the genre. Now in its 10th year, the Brooklyn Folk Festival is an internationally renowned three-day occasion to check out talented acts that span various styles and cultural traditions."
18399,"“There’s about 40 different bands [performing at the festival] and I love them all equally,” said founder and producer of the festival, Eli Smith. “It’s such an interesting and diverse genre.”"
18400,"A decade ago Smith began the festival in collaboration with the Jalopy Theater & School of Music, the city’s premiere folk music venue and education center where Smith works. It sold out quickly in its first year, outgrowing the intimate 100-seat Brooklyn theater and moved to bigger and bigger venues. Though the Jalopy Theater continues to present the festival, for the past few years, the festivities have been filling the much larger St. Ann’s Church. "
18401,"For Smith, a banjo player and guitarist who grew up in Greenwich Village as a fan of Woody Guthrie, Mississippi John Hurt and New Lost City Ramblers, starting a folk festival in New York seemed like a no-brainer. "
18402,"“I was surprised that there wasn’t a Brooklyn folk festival at that time already,” Smith said. “Because there was such a rich community and scene in the city as a whole for folk music — meaning from the United States as well as from immigrant communities representing all different parts of the world. It was such a rich community of musicians that it really needed a festival to express the richness of the art form.” "
18403,"Representing American folk music this year are string bands, blues musicians, jug bands and singer-songwriters. Among the highlights are contemporary folk groups Hurray for the Riff Raff (fronted by Bronx-native Alynda Segarra) and the Brooklyn-based Spirit Family Reunion, as well as returning favorite blues and jazz vocalist and multi-instrumentalist sensation Jerron “Blind Boy” Paxton. Acclaimed children’s music star Elizabeth Mitchell will also be performing a set for the whole family, while notable cartoonist R. Crumb will show off his other talent for playing the mandolin with country-blues duo East River String Band. "
18404,"Though Smith describes the event as a “New York City-centered” festival, many of the acts come from all over the world. A few buzz-worthy acts to check out include Radio Jarocho performing the lively, often melodic Jarocho music of Veracruz, Mexico; Women’s Raja Massive, a collection of women musicians who perform classical Indian music; Argentine poet and prolific songwriter Suni Paz; and Innov Gnawa, a Grammy-nominated Moroccan “gnawa” musical collective. There will also be flamenco music, Irish ballads, Afro-Dominican music and other international acts."
18405,"The festival not only includes a fair amount of banjo playing, but also the annual Banjo Toss Competition. Each year a banjo is tied to a rope as participants take turns throwing it into the Gowanus Canal to see who can hurl the instrument the farthest. It’s as ridiculous — and oddly satisfying — as it sounds. "

18441,Not since the end of “Armageddon” has Bruce Willis been burned this hard.
18442,"Comedy Central announced that the action movie icon will be the featured roastee of the network’s semiannual night of barbs and insults. The “Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis” is set to tape this summer in Los Angeles, with an airdate to be announced soon afterward."
18443,"“This ain’t the first time I’ll be tied to a chair and held hostage by a group of humorless a------- for a couple hours,” Willis said in a statement."
18444,"Willis joins an eclectic lineup of past roastees that includes Justin Bieber, William Shatner, James Franco, and the current president of the United States, Donald Trump. The last go-round, it was actor Rob Lowe in the hot seat enduring insults from the assembled comedians (and Ann Coulter, for some reason). "
18445,"Willis is best known for his every-man action hero John McClane from the “Die Hard” franchise, as well as acting as the centerpiece of cinema’s greatest plot twist in M.

18455,"Bryan Cranston is in the peculiar and challenging stage of any deeply successful actor's career, coming off a long run playing his most iconic role and facing the proverbial question: What's next?"
18456,"The answer for the ""Breaking Bad"" star appears in part to have been to turn toward the past."
18457,"The 59-year-old performed a Tony-winning run as Lyndon B. Johnson in ""All the Way"" on Broadway (and reprised the role for an upcoming HBO feature), and now stars as the blacklisted screenwriter Dalton Trumbo in the biopic ""Trumbo,"" out in theaters Friday."
18458,"amNewYork spoke with Cranston about playing the writer of ""Roman Holiday"" and ""Spartacus,"" who won two Oscars under pseudonyms during the blacklist, and about the future of Walter White."
18459,"It's funny, because now I'm able to look at it more objectively. When you're approaching a character you don't want to do that. I don't want to have that overview from the outside. And now I'm just starting it. Getting to know the kind of person he was, he would not have considered himself a hero. Are you a hero if you defend your personal freedoms? No, you're just defending your own. If you defend others, well I think some people would say that. Yes, by his actions he was able to accomplish a great deal and contribute mightily to the fall of the blacklist. ... At the time, it wasn't a hypothetical to him."
18460,"I think the story itself will demand if the people will want to see it. You have Steve Jobs, you have all these things. I think it's just timing. The origins of this movie, John MacNamara started eight years ago. ... Even ""Argo"" took seven years to do and George Clooney was attached as the producer. George Clooney!

18463,"There's an advantage to this because Trumbo's daughters and his daughters-in-law are still alive and well. And they were extremely helpful getting me to an essence of that father, from their perspective. They all had different points-of-view because they were different ages. You take that in and you have to distill it in your own sensibility to the Dalton Trumbo character that's within me. And then it comes out."
18464,"Before I would have said ""Spartacus"" and I still might, because I think it's ironic that was the movie that Dalton Trumbo first saw his name on-screen again after 13 years. And the subject of that movie, about oppression and how a simple man was loved by many, I think there was something about Dalton that he saw himself in Spartacus, not just him but it represented every simple man."
18465,"I think you should. You should do it, yeah. I would do it. I honestly don't know if that's ever going to happen but because of the construct of it that I could show up, I think they would try to figure out how they can logically and justifiably make sense of it. Knowing Vince Gilligan as I do, and Peter Gould, they're executive producers on it, they won't do it as a shock, stunt cast thing. There has to be some point that's like, ""Oh my God, that's perfect. Of course. Yes. That's perfect."""

18486,"And while classic cocktails will be available, special drinks will be tropical and rum-based, like a “Jamaica vacation drink,” Bunton said. But don’t worry, you’ll still be able to just grab a beer."
18487,"“I don’t want to have a stuffy cocktail list,” he said. “I want to keep the price point down. I’d like to offer a $10 to $12 cocktail but also crack open a beer and lay a shot out at you and you’re on your way.”"
18488,Bunton said he was involved in “cocktail culture” for a couple of years and he doesn’t “enjoy the attitude.”
18489,"“I want you to get your drink quickly and have a smile on your face and share a joke with us,” he said. “I don’t want to lecture you on spirits.”"
18490,"He plans to have $5 happy hour specials, too, because of his desire to include everyone, especially from the neighborhood, he said. It’s just about a five-minute walk from community favorites like Birdy’s and Lonewolf, he said."
18491,"Bushwick was perfect for the new space because it’s young, it’s growing and rents are still cheap, and it “still feels like how New York used to feel in the late 1980s and early 90s . . . for better or worse,” he said."
18492,"The venue will be “on the fancier side for Bushwick,” but he says he’s taking pains to make it welcoming to everyone."
18493,"“Why I fell in love with nightlife and stayed in New York City is because you couldn’t tell a gay bar, Asian, Dominican, stockbroker, hip-hop, fashion or music bar apart because everybody was hanging out,” he said. “Money wasn’t a factor and there was no class issue involved. Bars weren’t so compartmentalized 20 years ago. I want everybody up there dancing and losing their minds.”"

Somebody said to me right when she was first born, “When you are the mother of daughters, just be aware of how you talk about other women and always remember to speak with respect.” I also try to talk to my girls about doing activities that make them feel empowered. We don’t really talk about the importance of appearance and looks."
18512, 
18513,This film made me think back to being an impressionable kid and digesting all of these unrealistic beauty standards back in the day.
18514,"Yeah, I think culturally we’re shifting a bit. I think people are trying to be more body inclusive in terms of ad campaigns in magazines. I find that that’s been a thing in the last five to 10 years. I hope this movie sends a positive and empowering message to girls young and old that, truly, confidence comes from within and if you can dream it you can be it and you can’t have anyone tell you differently."
18515, 
18516,What would you have said to your younger self going through the tumultuous times of adolescence?
18517,"It’s all worked out fine for me, so I feel like I made it through. My mom was incredibly supportive of me. She was always really such a strong role model so I feel like even at my lowest points in adolescence and teen years, I always had a strong woman in my life that I looked up to and I hope my girls will have the same thing."
18518, 
18519,"We all curate our life on social media, but your Instagram stories are filled with real moments. Is there a line you won’t cross?"
18520,"Of course, I have certain rules with my kids. I don’t post anything where they would be embarrassed looking back at it. Any time I post something about Birdie, I ask her permission and I also show her the captions. There are certain things that feel like common sense to me. I think it’s fine to show the trials and tribulations of being a real-life mom but at the same time I’m not going to post if my kid has a meltdown."
18521, 
18522,"You were recently at The Wing, a space specifically made to empower women. How was that experience?"
18523,I hosted a screening of the movie and then I did a Q&A; it was amazing. There were 300 women there! The SoHo space is incredible and it was really inspiring.

[and] the people were just great,"" Jenner, 65, told the magazine in an online Q&A. Calling the photo shoot ""two of the best days of my life,"" the 1976 Olympics gold medalist said, ""The pictures came out over-the-top  great. . . . I was always worried -- you never wanted to look like a guy in drag, you never wanted to look like a guy in a dress, OK. If you're going to do that, come out, you really have to look the part. You have to look very feminine. . . . What I call my presentation is extremely important because it puts people at ease."""
18545,"She said that during the shoot, ""I had this rocking black outfit on, formal outfit, and I . . . looked in the mirror and I felt, 'Oh, my God.' That's the first time I'd ever really seen an image of me, of who I am. I mean over-the-top better than I thought it would ever be, especially at my age. You know, you think it's kind of over with at that age. And seeing that image was powerful to me, you know, powerful. And I kind of looked at it and said, 'You know what, this is going to work, we're going to be OK with this. . . . I am so excited about the future."""
18546,"In a separate, online story, Jenner described choosing her new name. To get ideas, she told Vanity Fair, she watched the Miss America pageant and gravitated toward the names Heather and Cathy. After the name Caitlyn struck her in particular, Jenner said, she decided on it when her assistant independently suggested it."
18547,Jenner also revealed to Vanity Fair that her family is starting to prefer Caitlyn over Bruce.
18548,"Of her mother, 89-year-old Esther Jenner, the Olympian said: ""We had a conversation the other day, we were talking about a lot of things, and, you know, she goes, 'You know what, I think I can have a better relationship with Caitlyn than I can with Bruce,' because we've always had a little tension in our relationship throughout the years."""

18561,"The writer-director of films including ""Say Anything"" (1989), ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996) and ""Almost Famous"" (2000) explained that, ""As far back as 2007, [Air Force] Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one. A half-Chinese father was meant to show the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent in Hawaii. Extremely proud of her unlikely heritage, she feels personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets. The character was based on a real-life, red-headed local who did just that."""
18562,"On May 28, Media Action Network for Asian Americans, an advocacy group monitoring media depictions, said it was ""calling out Sony Pictures for its white-washed [sic] film 'Aloha.' . . . "" The group's president, Guy Aoki, said in a statement, ""Caucasians only make up 30 percent of the population, but from watching this film, you'd think they made up 90 percent.

18584,"But, among the many upsides of being cast in the pre-eminent blockbusters of the century, is the power and opportunity to do the sort of artistic work you've always wanted."

18586,"amNewYork spoke with Evans about the film, now in theaters and on demand."
18587,"The leap to directing is tough. Why now, and why on this film?"
18588,"To be completely candid, it's not easy being a first-time director, finding a project where the producers are willing to trust you. The moons have to align. You have to find a project that is available, that you connect to, and a project that is owned by someone willing to give you a chance."
18589,"Naturally, you must have thought you could bring something to this your average filmmaker couldn't. What was that?"
18590,"I like movies that take place in a finite amount of time. I think it's always interesting to watch the characters grow virtually in real time as opposed to these broad sweeping epics that take place over decades. And I like films that read like theater. ... This piece almost read like Neil LaBute. It was very conversational, which I enjoy."

New York, at night, you're going to have a lot of beautiful background lights and the more we can make that light soft and buzz a little bit, the more romantic I feel that the shot becomes."
18595,To what extent has Captain America opened things up for you in terms of opportunities?
18596,"If I hadn't done Captain America, this is just a simple fact, this movie would not have happened. Doing the Marvel films, gives overseas awareness, and given the fact that the majority of films that are made for less than $10 or $5 million dollars, are probably going to be made on this foreign pre-sale model, you need to plug certain actors into your project that get these movies funded."
18597,You've been handed significant power thanks to your Marvel work. What do you intend to do with it?
18598,"I would agree wholeheartedly and I was almost the [expletive] that didn't do it. I almost walked away from these Marvel movies. God. ... No, it's been the best decision of my life. As a result, I'm going to try ... to continue directing regardless of what happens with this movie. I had a great experience, and I learned a lot, I'm trying to do it again next year. I have Marvel to thank for that."

18609,"Starring Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Lashana Lynch, Jude Law"
18610,Rated PG-13
18611,"It’s been a long time coming for Marvel to launch a film with a female lead, and the mighty Captain Marvel is certainly a hero fans can get behind, even if the movie starring here comes up short."
18612,"Really, one has to wonder what took the company so long, especially with Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow stealing scenes and kicking butt beginning all the way back in 2010 with “Iron Man 2.”"
18613,"Effectively a prologue for the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe that hit the big screen beginning in 2008 with the first “Iron Man,"" “Captain Marvel” takes place at some point in the mid-'90s, featuring a digitally rejuvenated Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg, who has continued playing the character on ABC’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”) in their nascent days at the agency."
18614,"Captain Marvel was first referenced in an end credits scene at the end of “Avengers: Infinity War,” when a soon-to-dissipate Nick Fury clicks a widget with her logo on it, calling her in to help save to day. "
18615,"But all that’s secondary to the new galactic space hero, multiple alien races and copious amounts of back story."
18616,"The eponymous lead, aka Carol Danvers (or Vers), played by Oscar winner Brie Larson, is on Hala, the home world of the Kree. She’s training with her mentor Yon-Rogg (Jude Law), who is trying to help her harness her fiery powers."

And prepare to fall in love with an orange cat named Goose."
18622,"The 1990s setting is played for laughs — what kooky people we were back then, with our grunge clothing, pagers and Blockbusters, waiting minutes and minutes for files to load on our computers. And the soundtrack plays like a ""Now That's What I Call Music"" compilation that you would find at the Sam Goody at the mall."
18623,"The film does not really elevate beyond the space hero tropes it is built on — it's a standard hero's origin story. That’s not to say it isn’t well executed, but we’re living in a post-“Black Panther” world, and the superhero movie has been forever transformed. ""Captain Marvel"" offers some fun surprises and twists, but it unfolds in a predictable way."
18624,"Larson is a joy to watch on screen, funny and tough, and the supporting cast is rock solid. But the surrounding world doesn’t feel as developed, especially when you consider the potential in the alien world being depicted. Wakanda, this is not."

18738,"‘Carousel’ plays an open run at the Imperial Theatre, 249 W. 45th St., carouselbroadway.com"
18739,"“Carousel” is widely considered not only the most complex, daring and emotional work in the midcentury Rodgers & Hammerstein canon, but one of the greatest musicals of all time."
18740,"I certainly subscribe to that opinion, although I also recognize the difficulties of presenting “Carousel” for a modern audience due to instances of physical abuse and a female character who suggests that such behavior can be endured through the strength of love, among other things."
18741,"With that in mind, I went into the new Broadway revival of “Carousel” expecting at least a few changes. But director Jack O’Brien’s extensive and brutal edits go far beyond that. Entire scenes and songs have been reconceived or removed. In one heavy-handed move, the “Starkeeper” (a mysterious heavenly figure) is now tasked with silently observing and standing over several scenes before his official entrance."
18742,"By comparison, Lincoln Center Theater’s 1994 Broadway revival of “Carousel” was a smart, sexy and absolutely stunning rethinking of the musical that did not completely disregard the original text."
18743,Despite a few interesting touches — like creating the carousel in the opening scene primarily through movement — Justin Peck’s new choreography pales in comparison to the brilliant original work of Agnes de Mille.
18744,"Perhaps most problematic of all are the lead performances. As the maladjusted, stubborn and insecure carousel barker Billy Bigelow, Joshua Henry (“The Scottsboro Boys”) sings beautifully and gives a fully realized performance, but he comes off as completely contemporary in a show set in late 19th century New England."
18745,"Henry seems disconnected from everyone else, including co-star Jessie Mueller (“Beautiful”), who is so muted as the enigmatic Julie Jordan that her character gets completely overshadowed and overpowered. This is the opposite of what one would hope for in a “Carousel” revival."
18746,"Both Mueller and Lindsay Mendez (who is far too strident and silly as Julie’s naive gal-pal Carrie Pipperidge) are vocally ill-suited for their roles, which results in uncomfortably strained singing."

"
18760,There’s a sense of exclusivity that comes with knowing you’re having a disco trivia party in a taxi while the rest of the city is in the middle of the workday.
18761,"It starts out with the realization that you’ve just entered a cab ride that might leave you richer. Then come the glares, stares and pointed fingers as your fellow New Yorkers begin to recognize the face behind the driver’s seat and spot the rainbow lights flickering through the van’s tinted windows."
18762,"“They do that often,” Ben Bailey, host of “Cash Cab,” says after driving past a string of frustrated faces and briefcase-carrying commuters with their arms stuck out high in traffic. “People see a cab and feel like it’s theirs.” "
18763,"Bailey was cruising around the Upper East Side along Second Avenue in the signature “Cash Cab” taxi this month to promote the second season of the rebooted Discovery game show, out Friday. The series films at various locations throughout the city, though midtown can often be spotted as the backdrop through the cab’s windshield."
18764,"“It’s funny, people think that there’s different people in different neighborhoods. They’re New Yorkers everywhere,” Bailey says behind the wheel. “So they’re like, ‘oh, if we get stuck (on a question), we’re not gonna ask people in this neighborhood for help, these people won’t know, but the contestant didn’t know either!”"
18765,"After eight seasons as a comedian-turned-cab driver, Bailey is relaxed behind the wheel as he navigates Manhattan traffic swiftly alongside fellow cabbies — even with the five-year break. “Cash Cab” aired its original seven seasons from 2006 to 2012 and its first revived season last December."
18766,Bailey is a licensed cabdriver who received his certification for the series. The car itself is a real cab that just so happens to double as a TV set prop.

18768,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
18769,"The major difference between Bailey’s ride and a real cab — aside from a rainbow headliner, enthusiastic driver and free fare — is the van’s lack of spaciousness due to sound and lighting equipment. It is a mobile television set, after all. "
18770,"“I pick up whoever, but if they have luggage, a suitcase and stuff I won’t pick them up because I know they won’t be able to play, they have a plane or a train to catch,” Bailey says. Storage space is most likely also an issue."
18771,"Naturally, Bailey has encountered just about anything and everything you can imagine — and more — when it comes to taking New Yorkers where they need to go."
18772,"“We’ve had a lot of weird passengers. I mean it’s New York City,” he laughs. “We had a guy in a rabbit suit. This huge guy came in wearing a rabbit suit from head to toe. Refused to play, kept calling me baby and eventually he just got out.”"
18773,"The host can rattle off a number of questionable, hilarious and rude experiences with NYC passengers over the years, but says his comedic background helps him brush off the negative."
18774,"“A thick skin helps. I’ve been doing stand-up comedy for 20 years and if anything gives you a thick skin, that does so that helps,” he explains. “I can kind of roll with it when people are not very nice ... or just weird.”"
18775,"At this point, Bailey is used to sitting behind the wheel and maneuvering traffic while reading out trivia questions (fed to him through an audio piece for safety). And while New Yorkers may scout out the famous cab, many passengers and street shout-out helpers still shy away from the chance to win big bucks."
18776,"“Just because they know it’s the show, doesn’t mean they’re going to come and help,” he says. “I think they’re afraid of looking stupid.”"
18777,A fear of looking stupid is understandable. There’s a heat like you’ve never felt before sitting in Bailey’s hot seat.

18815,"“When I’m sitting on a train and I hear ‘delayed due to traffic’ or ‘signal problems,’ I don’t know what that means and I would love to know why that keeps happening and why no one’s fixing it,” Kate Downey, the 29-year-old creative director and co-founder of Caveat, said."

18817,"That frustration led her “down the rabbit hole” of information about the transit system’s history and inspired the series, which began on May 23. The next show is Thursday at 6:30 p.m."
18818,"The shows are hosted by two comedians with very different levels of experience with the subways: Meg Pierson, 31, has only lived in the city for one and a half years and considers herself still “optimistic” about the transit system, while Justin Williams, 34, has been doing stand-up in the city for the past 10 years and has been on trains “everywhere from Coney Island all the way up to Gun Hill Road.”"
18819,"The two delve into the problems of public transportation dating as far back as the early 1800s (when horse-drawn streetcars led to way too much poop on the streets), which they have help dissecting from someone “on the inside,” an anonymous source with knowledge of the city’s transit history. What they’ve learned is that the problems New Yorkers face now are often a result of that history."

19825, 
19826,What informs your choices when you pick a role? 
19827,"I think that for the most part, my career has been dictated by the directors that I’ve worked with. And being a big fan of Andrew’s, when I heard that there was a script and a possible part, I said “You know, I’d probably do it no matter what it is, just to get part of his oeuvre, and work with somebody as talented.” He’s such a clear voice and so different from everybody else is, and I just love the way he sits with characters in his movies, and entering his world, and how good he is at immersing you in that; not making judgments for you, and letting you take it in your own time."

I’d never really been around horses in my life, and they’re such large, intimidating creatures, and they’re very sensitive, and so you have to have confidence. So I just mimicked whatever the trainers around me were doing, and faked it till I made it with the horses."

19834,You notably lived in East Village for years — which neighborhood is home now? 
19835,"I’m renovating an apartment in, I guess it’s West SoHo. Something like that. I’ve never lived west of Broadway, so it’s like a new Manhattan for me. I like that it’s kind of pre-gentrified. It feels a little “adult” over there. It feels semi-residential, like around TriBeCa and like west of Soho, and West Village. . . . I have a view. It’s only the second time in my life that I’ve had a view, and I am ready to embrace that."

19838,"Renovating is fun, a little stressful. Asbestos is always a very stressful word to hear. Anytime anybody could be in danger, it’s terrifying. But I think it’s going to be good. Hopefully my third and final attempt at making a real home in New York. You never know. I had a misfire in Park Slope."
19839, 
19840,What happened? 
19841,"I really wanted it, it was the most beautiful apartment you’ve ever seen, but it was just too far, and I missed the proximity to my friends."
19842, 
19843,You’ve solidly maintained style icon status since the ’90s. Where do you like to shop these days? 
19844,"I’m trying not to shop, I keep trying to purge, but I like all of the designer consignment stores, like the INAs and Tokio 7 and Beacon. I try to mostly buy secondhand; still the same places, I still have my little routes along the East Village, on Ninth Street there’s like all those little ones by Veselka. They still have the same places I go to over and over."

I feel so protective over the East Village, and when that vibe is around me I get so frustrated. I feel like at least in the new neighborhood I won’t be able to claim anything."

He was admitted to the Southampton Hospital emergency room, where doctors diagnosed him with alcohol poisoning, the site said. "

It’s just great advice. It’s a kind of way in which to live, and I want to be like him. I want to be like that. I want to put one foot in front of the other.”"

20900,"The actress recalled her historic Oscar for 2001’s “Monster’s Ball,” saying, “Honestly, that win almost 15 years ago was iconic, it was important to me, but I had the knowing in the moment that it was bigger than me. I believed that in that moment, that when I said, ‘The door tonight has been opened,’ I believed that with every bone in my body that this was going to incite change because this door, this barrier, had been broken.”"
20901,"But, she went on, “To sit here almost 15 years later, and knowing that another woman of color has not walked through that door, is heartbreaking. It’s heartbreaking, because I thought that moment was bigger than me. It’s heartbreaking to start to think maybe it wasn’t bigger than me. Maybe it wasn’t. And I so desperately felt like it was.”"
20902,"Berry was one of nearly 50 speakers at the conference by the women’s leadership organization Makers. Others included Caitlyn Jenner, America Ferrera, AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, author and pioneering feminist Gloria Steinem, Olympic gold medalist Abby Wambach, journalist Katie Couric, photographer Annie Leibovitz, several female business leaders and an FDNY firefighter, Regina Wilson."

	  Rihanna is out with a new album, ""Anti,"" and a tour that stops at Barclays Center March 27 and 30.       Photo Credit: Invision / Rich Fury     "
20953,"Like most unlikely stories involving Rihanna, the legend surrounding her signing to Def Jam Records turns out to be true."
20954,"She was only 16 in 2004 when she met with Jay Z, then president of Def Jam, at the company’s midtown headquarters, according to John Seabrook’s recent book, “The Song Machine.” After hearing her sing a ballad and what would become her first hit, “Pon de Replay,” Jay Z offered her a contract on the spot and then refused to let her leave the building until the details were settled and she signed to the label."
20955,"“There’s only two ways out,” Jay Z told Rihanna, according to Seabrook. “Out the door or through this window.” She said she was flattered and signed the contract in the middle of the night. She chose the door."
20956,"In the following years, Rihanna, with Def Jam’s help, grew into one of the world’s biggest stars, selling more than 54 million albums worldwide, as she rolled out one hit album after another, almost yearly."
20957,"For her new album, “Anti,” however, Rihanna has turned everything upside down."
20958,"She left Def Jam, starting her own label, Westbury Road Entertainment, distributed through Jay Z’s Roc Nation. She also took control of her career, making all the decisions on the rollout of “Anti,” which, by nearly all accounts, did not go smoothly."
20959,"Marked by numerous delays and several surprising changes in direction, “Anti” was accidentally leaked on Tidal before its scheduled release, leading Rihanna to make it available for free for a limited amount of time."
20960,"Her 2015 singles “FourFiveSeconds,” with Paul McCartney and Kanye West, and the critically acclaimed “Bitch Better Have My Money” didn’t even appear on the album."
20961,"Eat it. Drink it. Do it. Tackle the city, with our help. "
20962,"By clicking Sign up, you agree to our privacy policy."
20963,"“If this happened with a new artist, it would have been a disaster,” says Jem Aswad, a senior editor at music industry trade magazine Billboard. “For her, the irony is that none of it really hurt her or the album all that much. . . . It’s just a brilliant case of making lemonade out of lemons.”"
20964,"Despite all the struggles surrounding “Anti,” it still managed to debut at No. 1 and has already been certified platinum, thanks, in part, to a reported $25 million marketing deal with Samsung. The first single, “Work,” has also hit No. 1, marking Rihanna’s 14th chart-topper — more than any other artist except The Beatles and Mariah Carey. And the “Anti” tour, which stops in Brooklyn Sunday, March 27, and Wednesday, March 30, with two shows at the Barclays Center, is basically a sold-out success already."
20965,"“It is already largely forgotten,” Aswad says. “It’s a testament to the strength of her personal brand, of which music is only a small part. . . . She really reaches all cultures. She has a huge Instagram presence, a large male audience, an audience that is culturally more diverse. . . . Her demographic is all over the map, aside from maybe the very old and the very young, and those groups aren’t much of a consuming audience.”"
20966,"According to Port Washington-based NPD Group, a market research company, Rihanna is the most marketable of all big-name celebrities, including famous athletes, actors and other musicians. The company’s recent survey also showed that Rihanna’s strong connection to her fans made her 3.7 times more likely than an average celebrity to create a successful brand endorsement campaign — edging out Beyoncé, Usher and Ne-Yo."
20967,So it should be no surprise that Rihanna can also sell her fans on her new approach to music and business.
20968,"Rihanna recently told Vogue that she had grown bored of the pop formula that had made her such a success. “I just gravitated toward the songs that were honest to where I’m at right now,” she says. “It might not be some automatic record that will be Top 40. But I felt like I earned the right to do that now.”"
20969,"The risk-taking also seems to be extending to her concerts. Reports from the early stops on the tour suggest that she is combining old and new material in new ways, with video backdrops and a dance troupe with Cirque du Soleil-like moves to enhance the experience."
20970,And there is no longer any doubt who is in control.
20971,"“Women feel empowered when they can do the things that are supposed to be only for men, you know?” Rihanna told Vogue. “It breaks boundaries, it’s liberating, and it’s empowering when you feel like, ‘Well, I can do that, too.’ ”"
20972,"At a recent concert in Miami, Rihanna kicked the show off telling fans the two-hour concert would be filled with surprises: “Brand-new tour, brand-new era, brand-new album.”"
20973,"And brand-new Rihanna legends, no doubt."

21089,“Girls” actress Jemima Kirke channeled her inner Jessa and held an IRL stoop sale outside of her Brooklyn home last weekend. 
21090,"Kirke, who played the free-spirited Jessa on six seasons of the Lena Dunham-created show, was photographed selling her items in the neighborhood on Sunday, with nearly a dozen local shoppers perusing items perched on the stoop. The actress, a 32-year-old mother of two, appeared to be ridding her apartment of boxes of children’s toys, purses and a blue and red bicycle."
21091,"The scene gave off major “Girls” vibes, sending us back to the second season when Jessa opened the “Maiden’s Milk Vintage Boutique,” which was actually just an excuse for her to trade her old clothes and shoes for some extra cash. "
21092,"We can only dream she was dishing out Jessa-style advice like this with each sale: “Enjoy the blouse — you know, one of Tom Petty’s Heartbreakers gave me a lovely compliment on it once. They don’t construct a sleeve like that anymore.”"
21093,"On Sunday, Kirke was reportedly also selling unopened “Girls” DVDs, according to Page Six, and accepting payments via Venmo. Still, an endearing photo shows her accepting cash from a child. "
21094,"Kirke listed her Carroll Gardens townhouse for $4.5 million at the end of January, about a year after splitting from husband Michael Mosberg. The four-bedroom home — complete with a walk-in closet, private spa, roof terrace and studio space, is still on the market through real estate company Brown Harris Stevens."
21095,"One day after wrapping up the sale, Kirke was spotted at the Tribeca Film Festival while promoting her latest film project, “Untogether.” She stars as writer Andrea who can’t shake a one-night stand with a doctor (Jamie Dornan) in the Los Angeles-set movie released April 23. "
