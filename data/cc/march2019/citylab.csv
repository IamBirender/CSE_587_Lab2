4707," With Y2K looming and an area code split threatening to make city services even more difficult for callers to navigate, Chicago launches the first comprehensive 311 system in the nation, offering “one-stop shopping” for all constituent services. "
4708," In Baltimore, then-Mayor Martin O’Malley expands 311 to cover all city services—everything from bulk trash collection to graffiti removal to noise complaints. Meanwhile, Chicago institutes a web-based 311 system. "
4709," Baltimore, the 311 pioneer, cuts back on overnight 311 call center service, reducing staff and reserving the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for “urgent requests for service.” The service had become too popular and too expensive—citizens often use it to access information that is available from other sources, especially online. The city still accepts requests for service submitted on the web 24 hours a day. The change is projected to save $500,000 a year. Cash-strapped cities around the country take note. "
4710," San Francisco, which launched its 311 system in 2007, becomes the first city in the nation to enable its citizens to report problems and make requests via Twitter. Some cities, including Boston and Pittsburgh, start launching 311 mobile apps. "
4711," L.A. launches an official 311 app, the first to include bill-paying capability. "
4712," Government should be accessible and accountable to its citizens, right? You won’t find many who will argue with that sentiment. How to deliver on the ideal is another question altogether, one that municipalities have not always navigated well. But over the past couple of decades, a growing number of cities have been changing their approach, casting themselves as service providers and taking advantage of new technologies to offer increasingly innovative and seamless ways for citizens to get what they need. By Sarah Goodyear "
4713," Police departments across the United States are overwhelmed by 911 calls for non-emergency queries. With the help of a $300,000 federal grant, the city of Baltimore addresses this problem by launching an experiment: the nation’s first dedicated three-digit number for non-emergency police services. Users are encouraged to call 311 for complaints such as illegal dumping, double-parked cars, or anything else that requires police attention but not an immediate response. The service proves popular. "
4714," In light of the Baltimore experience, the Federal Communications Commission makes the 311 number available to any police department in the U.S. that wants to use it, with the idea that “use of this code could improve the effectiveness of 911 emergency services by alleviating congestion on 911 circuits.” "
4715," With Y2K looming and an area code split threatening to make city services even more difficult for callers to navigate, Chicago launches the first comprehensive 311 system in the nation, offering “one-stop shopping” for all constituent services. "
4716," In Baltimore, then-Mayor Martin O’Malley expands 311 to cover all city services—everything from bulk trash collection to graffiti removal to noise complaints. Meanwhile, Chicago institutes a web-based 311 system. "
4717," Los Angeles becomes the latest major U.S. city to adopt 311, making some 1,400 municipal services accessible to callers. "
4718," New York launches the nation’s largest and most comprehensive 311 service. Today, it operates in 180 languages 24 hours a day, fielding about 50,000 calls per day. "
4719," SeeClickFix launches in New Haven. Its first iteration is a website where residents can post problems they see in their communities, generating an email notification to local officials. "
4720," Over time, the city of New Haven realizes it is getting more service requests through SeeClickFix than it is through its own portal. As the service develops, adding a mobile app, it will eventually become the official 311-style online reporting system for New Haven and many more cities. "
4721," Baltimore, the 311 pioneer, cuts back on overnight 311 call center service, reducing staff and reserving the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. for “urgent requests for service.” The service had become too popular and too expensive—citizens often use it to access information that is available from other sources, especially online. The city still accepts requests for service submitted on the web 24 hours a day. The change is projected to save $500,000 a year. Cash-strapped cities around the country take note. "
4722," San Francisco, which launched its 311 system in 2007, becomes the first city in the nation to enable its citizens to report problems and make requests via Twitter. Some cities, including Boston and Pittsburgh, start launching 311 mobile apps. "
4723," Toronto, which initiated a phone- and email-based 311 service in 2009, makes a web-based 311 option available to its citizens. Toronto’s 311 system is the largest in Canada and the second-largest in North America, after New York. "
4724," Washington, D.C., and San Francisco pioneer the Open 311 approach, in which the city’s API is open to the public, standardizing protocols, allowing independent developers to create their own apps, and enabling more transparent interaction with government when it comes to reporting non-emergencies. The White House supports the move as part of the Obama Administration’s Open Government initiative. The approach is similar to that used by private-sector companies such as SeeClickFix. "
4725," Detroit, a year away from filing for bankruptcy, discontinues its 311 service for lack of funds. "
4726," L.A. launches an official 311 app, the first to include bill-paying capability. "
4727," Detroit, enabled by SeeClickFix, launches the Improve Detroit app, giving the city a 311-style capability for the first time since its traditional service was discontinued. "
4728," New York logs its 200 millionth 311 call. More than 200 cities around the United States now have traditional 311 services. In addition, about 220 mostly smaller municipalities are paying to integrate SeeClickFix, with many more relying on the free version of the tool. The cities with the most sophisticated systems now use 311 data not just to deploy services but also to measure their own performance and make crucial budget and policy decisions. "

4734," It took 30 years for another major city to attempt a large-scale public bike program. Copenhagen’s Bycyklen, or City Bikes, allowed users to access sturdy, shared bicycles at specific locations throughout the city via a coin-operated system. Despite clear improvements over Amsterdam’s White Bikes, thefts and vandalism still plagued the program. "
4735," Bikeabout, a small bike-share system limited to students at Portsmouth University in the U.K., is the first to come up with a solution to the theft problem—users had to swipe an individualized magnetic-stripe card to borrow a bike, which allowed them to be tracked when they weren’t returned. "
4736," Another advertising company, JCDecaux, partners with the city of Lyon, France, to launch Vélo’v, a similarly “smart” bike-share system only this time at a new scale—1,500 bikes. "
4737," Washington, D.C., launches SmartBike DC, a 10-station, 120-bike pilot program that is the first modern bike-share system in the U.S. Like Barcelona’s, it uses the same Clear Channel technology developed for Rennes’s Vélo à la Carte. "
4738," In Montréal, a government-owned company known as Bixi pilots its own system with innovative, robust bicycles and a modular docking system. "
4739," And Hangzhou, China, launches its bike-share system with 2,800 bicycles. Today it is one of the world’s largest, with more than 78,000 bicycles. "
4740," Washington, D.C., launches Capital Bikeshare, replacing its earlier system with Bixi’s technology. "
4741," Minneapolis follows with Nice Ride, as does Denver with B-cycle, representing the second of the two major suppliers of bike-share technology. "
4742," Bike-share systems are now launching all over the world. Guangzhou inaugurates a program that’s integrated with its Bus-Rapid Transit system, designed to solve the “last mile” problem. Mexico City launches its Ecobici. Buenos Aires starts with a small system, one of the first in South America. And London launches a 6,000-bike scheme partially paid for by corporate sponsors and popularly known as Boris Bikes, after Mayor Boris Johnson. "
4743," Melbourne and Brisbane also start bike-share programs, the first in Australia. Critics will say that strict Australian helmet laws hamper adoption of the systems. "
4744," Globally, the number of bike-share bicycles hits an estimated 1,000,000. China is far and away the leader in the sheer number of bicycles; three out of four of the world’s bike-share bikes are in that nation. "
4745," Does it feel like suddenly, bike-share programs are everywhere? The seemingly simple concept has indeed swept across the globe in a matter of just a few years. This is the story of just how quickly a great idea can spread when combined with the right technology—and a few fateful bumps along the way. By Sarah Goodyear "
4746," In Amsterdam, a group of activists introduce the Witte Fietsen, or White Bikes—dozens of regular bicycles that were painted white and left unlocked for anyone to use and leave behind for the next person. After many of the bikes are stolen or damaged, the program is quickly shut down—and considered a massive failure. "
4747," It took 30 years for another major city to attempt a large-scale public bike program. Copenhagen’s Bycyklen, or City Bikes, allowed users to access sturdy, shared bicycles at specific locations throughout the city via a coin-operated system. Despite clear improvements over Amsterdam’s White Bikes, thefts and vandalism still plagued the program. "

"
4749," Vélo à la Carte in Rennes, France, is the first city-scale bike-share program to use magnetic-stripe cards and RFID technology. It is a partnership between the city of Rennes and Clear Channel, the advertising company, which developed and operated the new “Smart Bike” technology. The program is offered by the city free of charge and launches with 200 bikes at 25 stations. "
4750," Another advertising company, JCDecaux, partners with the city of Lyon, France, to launch Vélo’v, a similarly “smart” bike-share system only this time at a new scale—1,500 bikes. "
4751," Inspired by its smaller neighbors, Paris launches the 6,000-bike Vélib’ system and the worldwide movement toward bike-share is off and running. By 2015, Paris will have a total of 18,000 bikes. "
4752," In Spain, Barcelona’s Bicing is the first entry in what quickly becomes a nationwide boom in that country. By 2013, 132 Spanish cities will have bike-share, making Spain a global leader in the phenomenon. "
4753," Washington, D.C., launches SmartBike DC, a 10-station, 120-bike pilot program that is the first modern bike-share system in the U.S. Like Barcelona’s, it uses the same Clear Channel technology developed for Rennes’s Vélo à la Carte. "

4755," And Hangzhou, China, launches its bike-share system with 2,800 bicycles. Today it is one of the world’s largest, with more than 78,000 bicycles. "
4756," Bixi launches full-scale in Montréal. The company will go on to provide bicycles and docking systems to cities in North America, Australia, and London, but its financial situation will prove to be precarious. "
4757," Washington, D.C., launches Capital Bikeshare, replacing its earlier system with Bixi’s technology. "
4758," Minneapolis follows with Nice Ride, as does Denver with B-cycle, representing the second of the two major suppliers of bike-share technology. "

4760," Melbourne and Brisbane also start bike-share programs, the first in Australia. Critics will say that strict Australian helmet laws hamper adoption of the systems. "
4761," New York’s bike-share system launches with 6,000 bikes and a first-of-its-kind funding model that uses no public dollars, fully paid for by corporate sponsorships. "
4762," Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area also launch bike-share programs this year. Globally, 2013 saw a 60 percent increase in the number of programs, with 65 new bike-share launches in China alone. The number of bike-share bikes worldwide hits 700,000. "
4763," After years of financial woes, Montréal’s pioneering Bixi manufacturing company declares bankruptcy and is taken over by a new owner. Systems using Bixi technology all vow to go on, finding other suppliers if necessary. "
4764," Globally, the number of bike-share bicycles hits an estimated 1,000,000. China is far and away the leader in the sheer number of bicycles; three out of four of the world’s bike-share bikes are in that nation. "
4765," With nearly 900 bike-share systems now in operation worldwide, research and data on their performance and usage patterns is becoming more widely available. For additional reading on how the bike-share boom is playing out across the globe, we recommend MetroBike LLC’s excellent Bike-Sharing Blog and Bike-Sharing World Map. "
4766," This timeline has been updated since it was first published to correct the following errors: While Denver, Minneapolis, and Washington, D.C. all debuted full-scale bike-share systems in 2010, D.C.’s did not launch first. Also, while Buenos Aires was among the earliest adopters of bike-share in South America, it was not the first. That honor belongs to Rio de Janeiro. "
