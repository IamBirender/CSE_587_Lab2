"
141, Photographer William Beecher Jr.
142,The 10 o’clock news says one more day of blue skies before the weather turns to crud. That clinches it: photographer William Beecher Jr. packs his camera bag with a body and two essential Sigma lenses: the 24-105mm F4 Art and the 100-400mm F5-6.3 Contemporary.
143,"“Sigma has produced two winning lenses that have revolutionized and simplified my bag,” says Beecher. “These are my staple, go-to action lenses. I don’t like wasting opportunity or being stuck with the wrong equipment.” Both feature durable, solid construction and optical stabilization for sharp photographs even under the most difficult conditions."
144,Lens: Sigma 100-400mm F5.6-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary at 302mm; Shutter: 1/640 sec;   Aperture: f/13;   ISO: 400
145,"The Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary telephoto lens is compact and lightweight, and provides the reach and sharpness usually found in larger, heavier lenses. According to Beecher, “This lens will get you where you want to be, with great depth and clarity.”"
146,"The Sigma 100-400mm 5-6.3 DG HSM OS Contemporary is a state-of-the-art telephoto zoom that brings a new level of portability and quality to the super telephoto market. Touting Sigma’s Optical Stabilizer (OS), the Sigma 100-400mm 5-6.3 Contemporary is highly compact and lightweight compared to similar products on the market. A push/pull zooming function and a new Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM) allow for a more responsive approach to photography while a 1:3.8 macro feature can be utilized from up close or from a further distance. Like each and every Global Vision Lens, the Sigma 100-400mm Contemporary is handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigma’s facility."
147,"Lens: Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art at 57mm; Shutter: 1/800 sec;   Aperture: f/10;   ISO: 400
"
148,"The Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art is a high-performance zoom lens designed for high-resolution digital cameras. “This is my everyday, always-on-my-body wide-angle to medium telephoto lens,” Beecher says. “It’s a must-have for every serious railfan photographer.”"
149,"“The morning shines bright, and the trains are running, putting the 1-2 punch to my advantage. In just a couple hours, I have these great images of an exciting short line, and I’m extremely pleased with the results. Sigma has made this outing a memorable one!”"
150,"The Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art lens is a premium lens designed for full frame cameras and will also work with APS-C sensors with an effective increase in focal length. The 24-105mm F4 is a highly versatile focal range and staple everyday lens. With the increasing resolution power of new sensors, it is designed to bring out the true potential of evolving camera technology. Sigma’s 24-105mm f4 includes proprietary Sigma technology including our Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM) which ensures fast, quiet and accurate autofocusing as well as our Optical Stabilizer (OS) which compensates for camera shake. A 9 blade rounded diaphragm creates beautiful background blur, while FLD and SLD glass elements compensate for various aberrations, distortion and curvature. The use of Thermally Composite Material (TSC) reduces size and weight and as part of the new Global Vision design, it is compatible with the Sigma USB dock for further customization and the new Mount Conversion Service."
151,Lens: Sigma 100-400mm F5.6-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary at 191mm; Shutter: 1/1000 sec; Aperture: f/9; ISO: 800
152,"The Sigma 24-105 F4 Art lens is available in Sigma, Canon, Sony-A and Nikon mounts. The Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 Contemporary lens is available in Sigma, Canon and Nikon mounts. Sigma lenses are covered under the Sigma Corp. of America 4-year limited warranty when purchased through a Sigma authorized dealer."
153,"Since 1961, Sigma has developed technologies that enable photographers to capture perfect images. Today, Sigma is a top choice for railfans worldwide. Sigma lenses are handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan."

"
812, Photographer William Beecher Jr.
813,The 10 o’clock news says one more day of blue skies before the weather turns to crud. That clinches it: photographer William Beecher Jr. packs his camera bag with a body and two essential Sigma lenses: the 24-105mm F4 Art and the 100-400mm F5-6.3 Contemporary.
814,"“Sigma has produced two winning lenses that have revolutionized and simplified my bag,” says Beecher. “These are my staple, go-to action lenses. I don’t like wasting opportunity or being stuck with the wrong equipment.” Both feature durable, solid construction and optical stabilization for sharp photographs even under the most difficult conditions."
815,Lens: Sigma 100-400mm F5.6-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary at 302mm; Shutter: 1/640 sec;   Aperture: f/13;   ISO: 400
816,"The Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary telephoto lens is compact and lightweight, and provides the reach and sharpness usually found in larger, heavier lenses. According to Beecher, “This lens will get you where you want to be, with great depth and clarity.”"
817,"The Sigma 100-400mm 5-6.3 DG HSM OS Contemporary is a state-of-the-art telephoto zoom that brings a new level of portability and quality to the super telephoto market. Touting Sigma’s Optical Stabilizer (OS), the Sigma 100-400mm 5-6.3 Contemporary is highly compact and lightweight compared to similar products on the market. A push/pull zooming function and a new Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM) allow for a more responsive approach to photography while a 1:3.8 macro feature can be utilized from up close or from a further distance. Like each and every Global Vision Lens, the Sigma 100-400mm Contemporary is handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigma’s facility."
818,"Lens: Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art at 57mm; Shutter: 1/800 sec;   Aperture: f/10;   ISO: 400
"
819,"The Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art is a high-performance zoom lens designed for high-resolution digital cameras. “This is my everyday, always-on-my-body wide-angle to medium telephoto lens,” Beecher says. “It’s a must-have for every serious railfan photographer.”"
820,"“The morning shines bright, and the trains are running, putting the 1-2 punch to my advantage. In just a couple hours, I have these great images of an exciting short line, and I’m extremely pleased with the results. Sigma has made this outing a memorable one!”"
821,"The Sigma 24-105mm F4 DG OS HSM Art lens is a premium lens designed for full frame cameras and will also work with APS-C sensors with an effective increase in focal length. The 24-105mm F4 is a highly versatile focal range and staple everyday lens. With the increasing resolution power of new sensors, it is designed to bring out the true potential of evolving camera technology. Sigma’s 24-105mm f4 includes proprietary Sigma technology including our Hyper Sonic Motor (HSM) which ensures fast, quiet and accurate autofocusing as well as our Optical Stabilizer (OS) which compensates for camera shake. A 9 blade rounded diaphragm creates beautiful background blur, while FLD and SLD glass elements compensate for various aberrations, distortion and curvature. The use of Thermally Composite Material (TSC) reduces size and weight and as part of the new Global Vision design, it is compatible with the Sigma USB dock for further customization and the new Mount Conversion Service."
822,Lens: Sigma 100-400mm F5.6-6.3 DG OS HSM Contemporary at 191mm; Shutter: 1/1000 sec; Aperture: f/9; ISO: 800
823,"The Sigma 24-105 F4 Art lens is available in Sigma, Canon, Sony-A and Nikon mounts. The Sigma 100-400mm F5-6.3 Contemporary lens is available in Sigma, Canon and Nikon mounts. Sigma lenses are covered under the Sigma Corp. of America 4-year limited warranty when purchased through a Sigma authorized dealer."
824,"Since 1961, Sigma has developed technologies that enable photographers to capture perfect images. Today, Sigma is a top choice for railfans worldwide. Sigma lenses are handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan."

1717,"Jim Wrinn has been editor of Trains since Oct. 27, 2004. A native of Franklin, N.C., he graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a degree in journalism and political science. He worked at newspapers in Durham, Gastonia, and Fayetteville before joining The Charlotte Observer in 1986. He was a staff writer and editor, and worked for every section of the newspaper he could -- whether it be general news, business, religion, sports, and even the humor column. 

"
1718,"Jim grew up watching the Southern Railway in his father's hometown, Westminster, S.C., and in Asheville, N.C., and riding the nearby Shay-powered Graham County Railroad at Robbinsville. He began reading Trains at age 6 in 1967 and had a subscription the following spring. The gift of a 35mm camera in 1977 started him taking black and white negatives and color slides. He has been an editor or writer at various times for ""Rails South,"" a regional publication; Norfolk Southern's ""Focus"" magazine; the Piedmont Carolinas Chapter, National Railway Historical Society's ""Flyer"" newsletter; Southern Railway Historical Association's ""Green Light"" and later ""Ties;"" and N.C. Transportation Museum's ""Shop Talk."" Solely or in collaboration, he has written books about the Aberdeen & Rockfish short line, ""The Road of Personal Service,"" 1992; ""Spencer Shops, 1896-1996,"" 1996; ""Pictorial History of North American Railroading,"" also 1996; and the Southern Railway and later Norfolk Southern steam program in ""Steam's Camelot,"" 2001. He is preparing a book on the Graham County now.

1742,"Press Release: 

A rare 2-4-4-2 steam locomotive called Skookum will headline a special photographer’s train on the Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad next March, and tickets are now on sale for 42 lucky customers, sponsor Trains Magazine announced Thursday.

Skookum is in the final phase of a 15-year overhaul at the railroad on the former Southern Pacific Tillamook Branch. The 1909 locomotive has an amazing story that starts with its rejection by a Tennessee logging railroad, its acceptance in the Pacific Northwest, and its tragic derailment that left it abandoned in the woods. Enthusiasts saved the locomotive and over more than 60 years moved it to safety and eventual restoration. Completion is set for this summer, and following the Trains event, the engine will be relocated to California.

The photographer’s train will be March 14 and 15, which are the two days following the annual Winterail multi-media show in Corvallis, Ore. A special guest locomotive, Polson 2-8-2 No. 2, is expected to operate as well. Both locomotives will be featured on log and mixed trains. A night photo session will be part of the event, as well. The $895 per person fare covers two days of operations, two trains with two steam locomotives, and box lunches each day. 

“Skookum’s stint in Oregon will be brief, but we want to celebrate its return to steam and its Pacific Northwest logging railroad heritage before it goes,” said Trains Magazine Editor Jim Wrinn. “We think this will be a magnificent event for the steam enthusiast, the railroad photographer, and anyone who appreciates these fine old machines.” 

Tickets are available only by phone at 503-842-7972."

2236,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — E. Hunter Harrison was named the CEO of CSX Transportation today, less than seven weeks after stepping down early from the top job at Canadian Pacific."
2237,"Harrison, 72 — widely regarded as the industry’s best operations CEO — will begin immediately, CSX said today. He transformed Illinois Central, Canadian National, and CP into ultra-efficient and highly profitable railroads over the past three decades."
2238,"""I am proud to join the dedicated and talented railroaders at CSX,” Harrison says. “Together, we will implement precision scheduled railroading — a model proven to improve safety, create better service for customers, produce a proud and winning culture for employees, and generate exceptional, lasting value for shareholders.”"
2239,"The deal with CSX was a coup for Harrison and his activist investor partner, Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal. Harrison on Jan. 18 announced his departure as CP CEO — five months earlier than planned — so he and Hilal could pursue a management shakeup at CSX."
2240,"Hilal and Harrison will gain seats on the CSX board, with Hilal becoming its vice chairman. In addition, CSX appointed three other directors as part of a deal with Mantle Ridge, which owns just under 5 percent of CSX’s stock. "
2241,"CSX said that at the annual shareholder meeting, typically held in May, investors will vote on two elements of Harrison’s compensation package. These include reimbursing Mantle Ridge for the $84 million in compensation and benefits Harrison left on the table at CP by retiring early, as well as tax liabilities that could reach $23 million."
2242,"Under the deal with Mantle Ridge, Harrison can resign after the shareholder meeting if shareholders reject these items. CSX scrapped plans for a special shareholder meeting to consider Mantle Ridge’s proposals."
2243,"“I thank every CSX director, including those leaving the board, for their constructive and skillful engagement that enabled this terrific outcome for CSX,” Hilal says. “The board is united behind a shared goal – creating value for shareholders and all stakeholders by implementing the precision scheduled railroading model at CSX. Together, we have created the conditions for success. Now the real work begins.”"
2244,"Hilal helped lead Pershing Square’s successful 2012 proxy battle that ousted CP management and installed Harrison as CEO. Harrison quickly implemented his precision railroading system at CP, slashing costs and raising revenue. CP’s operating ratio fell more than 20 points in less than three years. And its stock price doubled during Harrison’s tenure."
2245,"Word that Harrison was eyeing CSX sent the company’s stock soaring 30 percent, boosting its overall value by $10.4 billion. This put pressure on CSX’s board to respond."
2246,"By reaching a friendly deal with Harrison and Mantle Ridge, CSX avoids a costly and potentially nasty proxy battle. A decade ago, CSX fought — and lost — a proxy contest launched by The Children’s Investment Fund and 3G Capital Partners. The railroad spent $22 million in the effort, but four of the activist investor’s five candidates were elected to its board."
2247,"Harrison replaces Michael Ward, who has led CSX since 2003. CSX on Feb. 21 announced Ward would retire, effective May 31. Ward will now stay on as a consultant, although CSX did not say for how long."
2248,"Three CSX board members will retire at or before the conclusion of the annual shareholders meeting, CSX said. The board’s current presiding director, Edward Kelly III, will become chairman of the 13-member board."
2249,"The new directors include Dennis Reilley, the retired CEO of Praxair; Linda Riefler, a 25-year veteran of investment bank Morgan Stanley; and John Zillmer, the former CEO of Univar."
