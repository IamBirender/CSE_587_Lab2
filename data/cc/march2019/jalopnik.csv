	Big redesign, big stats, big money. You already know this about the 2015 Ford F-150 so we'll cut straight to beating the crap out of Ford's finest work; a $60,470 EcoBoost Platinum SuperCrew. We found out what consumers actually get out of Ford's mega redesign."
236,"The 2015 Ford F-150&aposs maximum towing capacity has been announced at a massive 12,200 pounds,…"
237,"
	The new F-150 brochure reads like a damn yearbook SUPERLATIVES page, and from where I'm standing it looks like the company's priority is top-end luxury trucks. Of course they'll call me as soon as they read that and say ""don't forget these are luxury trucks that also deliver 
	bestbestbest!"""
238,"
	Don't worry, we're getting to that."
239,Advertisement
240,
241,"
	On performance, both EcoBoost F-150s really are standouts. The mighty 3.5-liter V6 comes through town with the force of a ten-ton pendulum on a skyscraper-sized grandfather clock. Even the new 2.7-liter is surprisingly ambitious under open throttle."
242,"
	Stepping up to the 3.5 turbo (best) engine isn't 
	terribly expensive; a $2,295 option from the base XL-trim truck and cheaper as you move up in models. It's down to just $400 over the V8 in the Platinum. But zooming to the speed limit or towing your project truck around on the whooshing wind of EcoBoost, you're gonna see fuel economy plummet to Ram Power Wagon territory*, a truck in roughly the same weight class as an aircraft carrier."
243,"
	*Power Wagon 
	hypermiling, at least."
244,"
	""What about the aluminum,"" you ask? ""Does you feel 700 pounds sleeker or what?"""
245,Advertisement
246,
247,"
	Acceleration and braking feel great in an empty 2015 F-150 EcoBoost. You won't forget you're driving a full-sized truck, but there aren't the constant reminders you're used to in most trucks in this class. I won't insult your intelligence by using the word ""nimble"" but is undoubtedly smooth."
248,"
	Anyway, the main reason this truck is made of aluminum isn't fuel economy or 0 to 60 times, it's so that Ford can certify higher carrying capacities. And it worked; the weakest 2015 F-150 is payload-rated (capacity for weight in the bed) to 1,600 pounds and a Heavy Duty Payload Package plus 18"" rims takes the max all the way up to 
	3,300 pounds. That absurd figure can only be achieved in a rear-drive single-cab long-box V8 weighing just 4,550 pounds itself, which is almost ant-like strength."
249,"
Exterior"
250,Advertisement
251,
252,"
	Truckly. Manish. To me the new F-150 looks like an old F-250 with just the right accents in all the right places, in a ""
	hey she took her glasses off now she's hot!"" kinda way. But it's instantly recognizable as a Ford truck and to most fans that's all that really matters."
253,"
Interior"
254,Advertisement
255,
256,"
	The Platinum trim is swathed in soft leather and pretty lights, which is really let down by an icky plasticy steering wheel that feels like it was pulled off one of those playground pirate ships. If I was dropping sixty grand on a new truck I'd be on my way to a GMC dealer as soon as I could get my hands off the F-150's helm."
257,"
	Materials in general are all good, but lack the richness and refinement I've noticed in the comparably-priced luxotrucks from GM and Ram. Those trucks have a cohesion of design that makes them feel like they were designed as luxury vehicles from the beginning. And more importantly, have beautifully crafted and girthy steering wheels that are at once welcomingly soft yet weighty enough to warrant 
	respect."
258,"
	Ford's new panoramic sunroof scores 
	major points for innovation and interior excellence; you can never have too much natural light in a cockpit. But the top-spec F-150 I drove felt more like a utility vehicle with really nice interior panels than a gentleman's carriage, and maybe you prefer that."
259,Advertisement
260,
261,"
	Otherwise the Ford's interior is ergonomically excellent with abundant storage slots, a massive center console, plenty of power outlets, and the most comfortable rear seat I've ever experienced in a pickup. That rear seat is 
	still the best even when it's folded away, revealing a completely flat-floored interior cargo space big enough for your kids to set up a playhouse in."
262,"
Toys And Technology"
263,"
	The new F-150 is bristling with gadgets. Some great, 
	some gimmicky... but you know you're gonna spend more time playing with these than hitting your tow-max."
264,Advertisement
265,
266,The 2015 Ford F-150 is obviously blazing some new territory in the truck market with it&aposs…
267,"
	Ford's been doing the best cool, if frivolous, toys in their consoles for awhile now. The tilt-and-pitch ""off-road"" screen is a lot of fun and so is the power-allocation display. You can't do much with that information, but it makes me smile and perplexed that other automakers don't bother with such simple features that make every drive feel like an adventure."
268,"
	More cameras than a high-security prison provide a top-down 360º view for technical maneuvering, that can switch to a front-and-down perspective to help see over the truck's massive hood on steep off-road climbs."
269,Advertisement
270,
271,"
	Blind-spot warnings you've seen before (highly valuable in a large truck), the massaging seat option makes you feel like Sly Stallone in the 
	Demolition Man sex scene (make it stop), and as I mentioned earlier the panoramic sunroof could be the the best $1,300 box you can tick at the Ford store."
272,"
	Before you laugh off ""glass roof in a truck"" let me tell you, bathing an automotive interior in natural light makes it a much more pleasant place to be, or spend your workday as somebody with a truck like this presumably might."
273,Advertisement
274,
275,"
	LED worklights mounted all over the place are useful, and why this isn't a more common aftermarket upgrade? You could wire a set up easily and we truck buyers are supposed to be handyfolk, ain't we?"
276,"
	Speaking of truck-work, you might be thinking this is one hell of a loadout for a utility vehicle. Don't worry, you can't have any of those gadgets on the worker XL and XLT trims."
277,Advertisement
278,
279,"
	To configure an F-150 online with the blind-spot sensors you're going to have to start with the $38,685 Lariat and order the $1,500 501A equipment kit."
280,"
	To get 360º cameras you're stepping up to at least a 
	a $48,500 King Ranch, immediately adding the 601A Equipment Group for another $3,700, and at that point you'd be crazy not to go for the camera rig and lane-keeping assist bundle for another $900."
281,"
Performance"
282,Advertisement
283,
284,"
	You can pull up stats if you want, but I'll promise you the 3.5 EcoBoost 
	feels faster than anything else in trucks this size. It's a downright screamer, and the baby-brother 2.7 EcoBoost only feels a few puffs of turbo lag behind."
285,"
	I haven't driven the 5.0 V8, but we've heard on good authority that it only exists to keep fanboys from freaking out over 
	too many changes with this model year. I bet it's gone with the next redesign, or perhaps even as soon as the second coming of the Raptor."

	As for the new base naturally-aspirated 3.5 V6... it still claims 25 MPG and a towing max of 7,600 pounds (not at the same time obviously). Frankly, I have a feeling this is a better buy than the boosted engine for most people. How much of a hurry are you really in, anyway?"

The Veyron has been at Specialty for about four days now and listed nearly as long, though Craigslist isn't the only place it's being advertised. According to our sales associate, hopes are high the car will move within the next few days as the offers have been rolling in, but none to their liking.

After all, what's more important the the ability to toast the success of stomping on citizens for exercising their freedom of speech?"
467,Here's the press release:
468,"Stuttgart/Sankt Augustin – At the end of November the German federal police force took charge of the prototype of the ""Water Cannon 10000"" for the very first time. The official handover of the keys for the special vehicle, which is worth almost one million euros, was made by Julian Wagner, chairman of the board of Rosenbauer International AG, at a small ceremony attended by ministerial director Christoph Verenkotte, Head of the Federal Police Department at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, and Jürgen Schubert, Inspector of the Federal State Riot Police. The handover marks the beginning of what is expected to be a ten-year period of ongoing procurement, whereby the entire fleet of water cannons used by both the federal and state police forces in Germany is planned to be replaced."
469,"The initial impressions of the vehicle are striking – there has never been a vehicle like this before. Even the external appearance is significantly different from the police water cannons used previously in Germany. ""As far as we are aware this is the most modern vehicle of its kind in the world"", confirms Achim Friedl, Divisional Head at the Federal Ministry of the Interior for Federal Police and State Riot Police Technology and Logistics. As an experienced specialist, Friedl was responsible for gathering information on designs and current procurement processes in a number of federal states, and also played a significant role in the implementation of the scheme as overall project manager. At the handover, ministerial director Verenkotte highlighted the fact that the prototype, which is the result of a significant development effort, has been completed on schedule – a complement appreciated by the attending represen­tatives of the general contractor, Rosenbauer, the Austrian company which successfully secured the contract following an international tender process. As the basis for the new Water Cannon 10000 – so named after its 10,000-litre capacity water tank – the company opted for the Mercedes-Benz Actros 3341 featuring all-wheel drive and a technically permissible gross vehicle weight of 33 tonnes. Even when fully kitted out and manned, however, the new ""WaWe 10"", as it is known, does not quite reach this weight level, since its actual operational weight is around 31 tonnes. In addition to technical features and a reasonable price, the tender assessment process took into account reliability and the exper­tise of the participating tenderers, and also considered such factors as the lowest possible operating costs over what is expected to be a useful life spanning many years."
470,"Almost ten metres long and 3.70 metres high, the special vehicle is driven by an environmentally friendly Euro 5 version of a V6 turbodiesel engine, producing 300 kW/408 hp and featuring BlueTec SCR diesel technology. The fact that the outline of the WaWe 10 bears such little resemblance to the familiar look of the Mercedes-Benz Actros, production numbers of which have now already exceeded half a million, is down to Rosenbauer having completely rebuilt the cab for the five-man crew. Just like the special-purpose body, it has been adapted for the specific functionality of this special deployment vehicle . The driver benefits from a convenient MercedesPowerschift automated transmission, while a Telligent braking system helps to ensure safe deceleration. The crew, comprising driver, commander, observer, and cannon operators, are accommodated in ergonomically designed working areas in the spacious cab, which also tilts on the chassis for maintenance purposes. Auxiliary heating and climate control help to maintain a pleasant interior temperature, even in the event of sustained deployment, and there is also a refrigerated compartment for storing refreshments."
471,"The 10,000-litre water tank is housed in the centre of the aluminium body of the vehicle. To the left and right of this is the necessary additional equipment, mainly used for water intake from hydrants or open bodies of water, housed in lockable toolboxes. The pumping equipment - a Rosenbauer N 35 centrifugal pump with a rated output of 3500 litres per minute at 10 bar - is accommodated in the rear of vehicle. It is driven by a separate diesel engine, thus ensuring that the three pumps - two on the front corners of the cab, each with a flow rate of 1200 l/min, and one on the rear of the vehicle with a flow rate of 900 l/min - can be operated totally independently of actually driving the vehicle. Floor spray nozzles beneath the vehicle are designed to protect the chassis against fire, while the cab and body roofs are also fitted with an automatic protection system. In addition to its main use, namely police deployment in the event of violent riots breaking out at demonstrations and large events, the WaWe 10 can also be used to back up the emergency services at disasters, for example for fire fighting or even for transporting drinking water."
472,Green light for production
473,"The new WaWe 10 will gradually replace its predecessor, the WaWe 9, which is also entirely based on the Mercedes-Benz three-axle all-wheel drive chassis, and which in some cases is now already more than 20 years old. A total of 78 identical vehicles are expected to be brought into service by 2019 as part of a total order volume worth 75 million euros. Delivery of the first three series-produced vehicles is scheduled for 2010 following assessment of the prototype trial. Distribution of the new water cannon to federal and also state police authorities shall then be determined on a case by case basis according to the age and technical status of the vehicles awaiting withdrawal from service."

She was believed to be the seventh known U.S. death related to these airbags. A lawsuit has been filed. That has now been confirmed by Honda, via that same Detroit News article: "
482,"On April 5, Kylan Langlinais was traveling in Lafayette, Louisiana, when the car hit a utility pole. The suit says the air bag “violently exploded and sent metal shards, shrapnel and/or other foreign material into the passenger compartment ... Langlinais sustained a penetrating injury to the right side of her neck, causing an immediate and profuse loss of blood.” She died four days later."
483,"NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said in a statement Friday that the most recent death is “likely” because of a faulty Takata inflator. NHTSA reviewed the police report, medical records and inspected the vehicle. It held talks with Honda as well."
484,"“This tragedy underscores the necessity of the actions NHTSA is taking to ensure that every vehicle on America’s roads has a safe air bag,” Rosekind said."

502,"Audi, the best-selling luxury brand in China, saw sales decline 1.6 percent from a year earlier, the first drop since February 2013. BMW and Mini sales fell 4 percent in May, the first decrease in a decade."
503,"The sales declines mirror the slowing of the broader vehicle market, which saw deliveries fall for a second month in May, according to China Association of Automobile Manufacturers data. A slowing economy and a stock-market boom have combined to draw money away from auto purchases."

520,"Now, while we're assuming such trivial matters as slight variations in price due to currency fluctuations makes very little difference to a mega rich customer's wallet, this does significantly alter the bragging rights attached to these cars. Let's face it, these customers aren't buying cars like this to drive (if they were every tycoon in the world would own a Caterham 7) they're buying them to get into a pissing contest with their fellow robber barons. Buying a One-77 now means not having the most expensive car at the international arms/yacht fair, something that likely means a lot to its potential customers.

524,Aston Martin Reveals Spectacular One-77 Technical Showcase
525,"Gaydon, Warwickshire – Tuesday 3 March - Aston Martin will present a One-77 technical showcase at the Geneva Auto Salon on 3 March 2009. Chassis no.1 will be on display as an exposé throughout the show detailing the quintessence of Aston Martin engineering and design expertise."
526,"The One-77 is Aston Martin's definitive sports car, one that epitomises everything Aston Martin from technology, the hand-craftsmanship of the hand rolled aluminium panels to the attention to detail. A culmination of all the marque's know-how, the One-77 delivers effortless beauty guaranteed to stir the senses with performance potential eclipsing any previous Aston Martin."
527,"With the performance and durability phase of the One-77's intensive development programme soon to commence, the 79th Geneva Auto Salon provides the perfect stage on which to reveal the remarkable engineering, advanced technology and exotic materials that lie beneath the One-77's extraordinary exterior."
528,"For Aston Martin's Chief Executive, Dr Ulrich Bez, revealing the One-77's secrets is a proud moment: ""Right from the very beginning of the project the vision for One-77 was very simple: It had to combine high-technology with hand-built craftsmanship, and demonstrate the unique capabilities and passion of our designers, engineers and
technical partners."
529,"""Quite simply it had to be the ultimate expression of Aston Martin. As you can now see, we have achieved that goal in magnificent style."""
530,"Chris Porritt, One-77 Programme Manager continued: ""We wanted to create something that wows you as much when you see what's under the skin as the exterior styling itself. We started by identifying the most technologically exciting front-engined, rear-wheel drive cars in the world: those from the DTM race series. We then applied the principles and technology that feature heavily in their design and translated it to a road car application."""
531,"Consequently the One-77's structural core is a lightweight and immensely rigid carbon fibre monocoque. Conceived and designed at Aston Martin's Gaydon HQ, the monocoque, or 'tub', has been built in partnership with Multimatic (MTC). As world leaders in carbon composite technology, advanced vehicle analysis and dynamic
simulation, MTC brings unrivalled specialist capabilities to the exacting challenge of the One-77 programme."
532,"Employing the classic formula of double wishbones at each corner, the One-77 features inboard suspension front and rear, with pushrods employed to transfer vertical suspension movements to the horizontally mounted spring/damper units. A practice taken directly from racing car design, the main advantages of inboard suspension are a reduction in unsprung weight and the ability to package the suspension components more effectively."
533,"The dampers are fully adjustable and feature advanced Dynamic Suspension Spool Valve (DSSV) technology; a world-first for a road car application. These special valves are state-of-the-art even at the highest levels of motorsport, and use high-precision machined components to enable the shock-absorbing characteristics of the damper to be changed without having to remove them from the car, as is the norm."
534,"Underlining the truly bespoke nature of the One-77, once delivered to its owner, the car's suspension characteristics will be precisely set-up by Aston Martin engineers to suit their exact requirements, from settings suitable for the ultimate long-distance GT, to a machine capable of conquering the Nürburgring Nordschleife."
535,"While functionality and efficiency are paramount in the design and construction of the One-77', so too is aesthetic beauty. To this end every single component has been crafted from the finest materials with absolute attention to detail. From the mesmerising weave of the glossy carbon fibre tub and the abstract, sculptural beauty of the dry
sump's oil reservoir, to the unerring precision of the billet machined aluminium suspension mounts, the One-77's rolling chassis is an automotive masterpiece."
536,"Of course the irony is that the vast majority of these exquisite components will be hidden from view in the finished car, yet each and every piece is a work of art in its own right. It's this extraordinary workmanship and money-no-object commitment to quality that makes the One-77 unique."
537,"Naturally, such a spectacular chassis demands – and gets - an equally exceptional drivetrain. It comes in the form of an immensely potent 7.3-litre, naturally aspirated V12 engine. Thanks to the adoption of a dry-sump oil system the engine is mounted 100mm lower than in any previous V12-engined Aston Martin road car, which helps keep the One-77's centre-of-gravity as low as possible. To further aid agility and endow the One-77 with progressive handling and stable, predictable on-limit behaviour, the engine is also mounted 257mm aft relative to the front wheel centreline. In so doing the front-midengined layout shared by all of Aston Martin's current road car range has been taken to a new level."
538,"The One-77's magnificent power unit is an extreme evolution of the 6.0-litre V12 engines fitted to the DBS, DB9 and new V12 Vantage models. Like the collaboration with MTC for the build of the chassis, Aston Martin has chosen a world-leading partner with which to develop the motor: legendary engine builders, Cosworth. It has proved to be the perfect collaboration, as Chris Porritt explains."
539,"""Our brief to the engine team was for them to take the 6.0-litre V12 as far as it could go,both in terms of output and weight reduction. The targets were a power output of no less than 700bhp with a 10 per cent reduction in engine mass. Incredibly, the Aston Martin and Cosworth engineers achieved a mass reduction of some 25 per cent, and although we've yet to complete the final engine calibration work, I'm confident we'll see in excess of 700bhp. It's an awesome accomplishment, but one that's typical of the One-77 project, for it has consistently brought out the very best in everyone involved."""
540,"Wearing Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres (255/35 ZR20 front, 335/30 ZR20 rear) developed specifically for the One-77, all 700+bhp is transmitted to the road through the rear wheels via a new six-speed gearbox. Controlled via column-mounted paddles behind the steering wheel, this robotised sequential manual is a new generation of Aston Martin's familiar transmission. Though it is made specifically for the One-77 and features specially strengthened internals to cope with the tremendous power and torque, the lessons learned in its development will ultimately find their way into the company's series production models."
541,"It's a mark of the inherent capabilities of Aston Martin's acclaimed lightweight Carbon Ceramic Matrix brake technology that it has been used as the basis for the One-77's braking system. The internals of the calipers have been re-engineered to transmit less heat from the brake pads into the brake fluid, while the discs themselves have been developed to ensure the maximum possible contact area between the face of the disc and the brake pads for improved stopping power. Due to the One-77's increased performance, special attention has also been paid to brake cooling, as the brakes have less time to cool between bursts of acceleration."
542,"With a projected weight of 1,500kg the One-77 will occupy the very highest echelons of road car performance. Top speed is confidently predicted to be in excess of 200mph, with a 0-60mph time in approximately 3.5sec. Perhaps more importantly, thanks to the purity of a front-engined, rear-drive layout, the responsiveness and immense tractability of a naturally aspirated V12 and the low mass, high-rigidity properties of a carbon fibre chassis, the One-77 promises a driving experience of unrivalled intensity and excitement while representing the world's most desirable automotive art form."

664,Advertisement
665,
666,These kinds of shady deals are all referred to as Curbstone deals. I have personally spoken with many people who have been taken in by deals like this. They usually are being done by people who are dealers pretending to not be dealers or by people who are not dealers but ought to be because they sell too many cars. 
667,"In Michigan, if you sell five or more cars in a year, you are required to get a dealer’s license from the state. Similar laws exist in other states. But, many people don’t bother to get licensed. Background checks can be hard to pass because of a felonious past, or maybe they don’t want to pay the small-business-crushing $75 fee. The problem is that the state rarely - if ever - enforces this rule. As a result, non-dealers sell cars all day long from the curbside, the local parking lot, or wherever else they can park a car. Often, they “skip” the title by not recording their own name in the chain - signing the title from the person they bought the car from over to you directly. The upshot of this is it looks as if you bought the car from their seller and the curbstoner manages to stay off the radar."
668,"Some might wonder why an actual dealer would try and sell a car from in front of a house rather from the comfort of their own cramped lot on Eight Mile. Most people feel a little better about a prospective car purchase if they believe they are talking to an actual owner of the car who has spent time living with it rather than just a salesman trying to sell a car he knows nothing about. Many people would come haggle in a front yard long before they’d willingly step inside the twelve square-foot salesroom of “Bob’s A-1 Car Shack.” All else being equal, most people would consider the regular-owner car to be worth more than the curbstoned dealer car."
669,Advertisement
670,
671,"Strangely enough, curbstoning in Michigan is not illegal in and of itself when done by a licensed dealer. The law says that a dealer must conduct “a large share” of its business at its location - implying that it is allowed to conduct a lesser share of its business elsewhere. Where the transaction gets murky is whether the dealer-seller is truthful and so on about the reason the business is taking place in front of a residence in Ferndale, rather than at the dealership on the other side of Eight Mile in Detroit. Again, laws vary from state to state but this appears to be how it is in many states: the few laws that cover this are rarely enforced."
672,"And because of the large amount of gray in the various areas of the transaction, it is simply better if you avoid the transaction altogether. When you find out that Craigslist has led you down a bad path, walk away. I know, it shatters your world view to believe that a total stranger might try to mislead you for profit on the internet. It’s time you found out the hard way: the internet can be that way."

Instead the road became a perfectly paved 22-mile symbol of the global recession, a dream for fast drivers, and a safe haven from a brutal surveillance state — all to the tune of just $80 million."
818,"The money might not have been exactly well spent, but it’s apparent in the construction of the road itself. You will not find more perfect stretch of tarmac anywhere in the world, let alone in the UAE mountains. The whole thing looks completely alien to its surroundings.

823,"This all hangs on how the UAE is set up. The UAE consists of states just like the U.S. Each state has its own sort of economy. Abu Dhabi has so much oil that it can print money in perpetuity. Dubai has less oil, so they invested in air travel and tourism and finance, hence displays of opulence like the Burj Khalifa, the tallest manmade structure in the world."

827,"The UAE had a bit of a campaign in the late 2000s to bring tourism to Ras Al Khaimah. Quite a bit of development was planned for the state. It was going to host the America’s Cup yacht race there and the state was going to build a big resort on the top of the highest mountain in the UAE. Skiing was planned at the top with the help of some artificial snow, as well as a hotel, a cable car, a paragliding launch ramp (naturally), and a golf course."
828,"If you are thinking to yourself that it doesn’t make sense to put a golf course and a ski resort in the middle of the desert, congratulations, you have a firmer grasp on reality than the state planners in the UAE."

831,"When the worldwide economy imploded half a decade ago, all of these tourism plans fell through. Or rather, the funding all disappeared, except for the money allocated to the road the state had planned to link up all of these tourism destinations."
832,"And that’s this road, built with 300 million dirhams, or about $80 million U.S. dollars. It climbs to the top of Jebel Al Jais (that’s the name of the mountain, the road is named Jebel Jais). At 1,910 meters it’s the tallest mountain in the UAE, and it’s where all of the ski resort hotel paragliding stuff was planned."

You understand the gravity of that statement to moment you land in the emirates, just as I did a few months ago. At the time I was the only American journalist on a press junket to drive the car that won the last Dakar Rally."

841,"A representative from the airport met me in a hallway leading off from the plane and guided me through customs. We walked through a gymnasium-sized room, stretched completely full with lines of people, almost all South Asian families and a scattered handful of dismayed British tourists. Past that we entered another hall just as big, again as full with people, and quickly strutted past everyone to a small line in an under-construction corner."
842,"We paused a bit, just long enough for me to worry if there was truth to those rumors about the government making things “difficult” for people with an Israel stamp on their passports like me. I was quickly pushed up to the front. A gruff man had me stare into a camera, peered right into my soul, and welcomed me into the country with a disapproving frown. As I was guided out of the airport, I passed a man with a falcon on his shoulder."

844,
845,"At the end of my first full day in Dubai, I met an expat colleague of a friend of mine in the shadow of the Burj. He explained to me which gulf state was more conservative than the next, and which ones served as a kind of low-key getaway for their stricter neighbors. He explained what it’s like to live and work in Dubai, and he tried to describe the very authoritarian, technocratic, and almost comically Hollywood-esque methods the police use to enforce order in the country."
846,"He told me two stories: first he recounted the American woman stabbed to death in a mall, along with how the state publicized they put out video of a massive SWAT team hunting down and capturing the disturbed killer. Then he told me another story I have had a hard time verifying. The details were lost in the shisha smoke, but it’s simple enough to retell."
847,"It goes like this: apparently, a Russian mobster threw his girlfriend out of his hotel window. No, this is not the time that the other guy threw a prostitute out of a window and the prostitute was sentenced to three months in jail. In the story recounted to me, the mobster threw his girlfriend from a window, she died, and he fled."
848,Advertisement
849,
850,"The police, however, quickly heard reports of the killing, checked surveillance footage, figured out what room he had been in, figured out who he was based on what hotel room he was in, and figured out what flight he had booked to flee the country."
851,"They did not chase the killer, they did not make any attempt to run him down. When he arrived at his gate, police were simply waiting for him there and informed him he was under arrest."
852,"That’s how Dubai conducts its policing. Cops don’t watch traffic, they let traffic cameras placed every few blocks do that work for them. It is as much a surveillance state as anywhere in the world, and its human rights record is downright appalling. The government’s watchful eye is omnipresent from the moment you get your passport stamped to the moment you leave."
853,Advertisement
854,
855,"Except things are different out on Jebel Jais. There are no speed cameras. And with no cops watching for traffic, there’s no real policing at all. The closest there is to any hand of the government are the construction crews finishing the next stage of the road."
856,"This has a very unsurprising effect on the car enthusiasts of the UAE. To them, Jebel Jais is basically a free-to-enter hillclimb racetrack with no enforced speed limits and more turns than you can count. It’s not hard to find videos of people running the road at any speed they can manage, drifting the hairpins, whatever they want. There were thick black lines when I drove Jebel Jais from when a bunch of trucks came to do burnouts across the middle of the road."

911,"Jebel Jais was supposed to lead to the boom of the new, growing, oil-rich and tourist-friendly United Arab Emirates. Instead the road became a perfectly paved 22-mile symbol of the global recession, a dream for fast drivers, and a safe haven from a brutal surveillance state — all to the tune of just $80 million."
912,"The money might not have been exactly well spent, but it’s apparent in the construction of the road itself. You will not find more perfect stretch of tarmac anywhere in the world, let alone in the UAE mountains. The whole thing looks completely alien to its surroundings. Every other road in the area is potholed and cracked and rutted, if it’s even paved at all."

916,"A lot of strange and complicated factors have to come together to result in an $80 million road to nowhere, but they all start to seem natural when you get familiar with the boom-bust technocratic petrostate that is the UAE."
917,"This all hangs on how the UAE is set up. The UAE consists of states just like the U.S. Each state has its own sort of economy. Abu Dhabi has so much oil that it can print money in perpetuity. Dubai has less oil, so they invested in air travel and tourism and finance, hence displays of opulence like the Burj Khalifa, the tallest manmade structure in the world."

919,
920,"Ras Al Khaimah, the mountainous state in the north that is home to Jebel Jais, has none of these things."
921,"The UAE had a bit of a campaign in the late 2000s to bring tourism to Ras Al Khaimah. Quite a bit of development was planned for the state. It was going to host the America’s Cup yacht race there and the state was going to build a big resort on the top of the highest mountain in the UAE. Skiing was planned at the top with the help of some artificial snow, as well as a hotel, a cable car, a paragliding launch ramp (naturally), and a golf course."
922,"If you are thinking to yourself that it doesn’t make sense to put a golf course and a ski resort in the middle of the desert, congratulations, you have a firmer grasp on reality than the state planners in the UAE."

924,
925,"When the worldwide economy imploded half a decade ago, all of these tourism plans fell through. Or rather, the funding all disappeared, except for the money allocated to the road the state had planned to link up all of these tourism destinations."
926,"And that’s this road, built with 300 million dirhams, or about $80 million U.S. dollars. It climbs to the top of Jebel Al Jais (that’s the name of the mountain, the road is named Jebel Jais). At 1,910 meters it’s the tallest mountain in the UAE, and it’s where all of the ski resort hotel paragliding stuff was planned."

930,"But while the physical construction of the road might symbolize the power of the state, I saw no evidence that the watchful eye of the UAE’s police control ever made it onto Jebel Jais. You understand the gravity of that statement to moment you land in the emirates, just as I did a few months ago. At the time I was the only American journalist on a press junket to drive the car that won the last Dakar Rally."

935,"A representative from the airport met me in a hallway leading off from the plane and guided me through customs. We walked through a gymnasium-sized room, stretched completely full with lines of people, almost all South Asian families and a scattered handful of dismayed British tourists. Past that we entered another hall just as big, again as full with people, and quickly strutted past everyone to a small line in an under-construction corner."
936,"We paused a bit, just long enough for me to worry if there was truth to those rumors about the government making things “difficult” for people with an Israel stamp on their passports like me. I was quickly pushed up to the front. A gruff man had me stare into a camera, peered right into my soul, and welcomed me into the country with a disapproving frown. As I was guided out of the airport, I passed a man with a falcon on his shoulder."

939,"At the end of my first full day in Dubai, I met an expat colleague of a friend of mine in the shadow of the Burj. He explained to me which gulf state was more conservative than the next, and which ones served as a kind of low-key getaway for their stricter neighbors. He explained what it’s like to live and work in Dubai, and he tried to describe the very authoritarian, technocratic, and almost comically Hollywood-esque methods the police use to enforce order in the country."
940,"He told me two stories: first he recounted the American woman stabbed to death in a mall, along with how the state publicized they put out video of a massive SWAT team hunting down and capturing the disturbed killer. Then he told me another story I have had a hard time verifying. The details were lost in the shisha smoke, but it’s simple enough to retell."
941,"It goes like this: apparently, a Russian mobster threw his girlfriend out of his hotel window. No, this is not the time that the other guy threw a prostitute out of a window and the prostitute was sentenced to three months in jail. In the story recounted to me, the mobster threw his girlfriend from a window, she died, and he fled."
942,Advertisement
943,
944,"The police, however, quickly heard reports of the killing, checked surveillance footage, figured out what room he had been in, figured out who he was based on what hotel room he was in, and figured out what flight he had booked to flee the country."
945,"They did not chase the killer, they did not make any attempt to run him down. When he arrived at his gate, police were simply waiting for him there and informed him he was under arrest."
946,"That’s how Dubai conducts its policing. Cops don’t watch traffic, they let traffic cameras placed every few blocks do that work for them. It is as much a surveillance state as anywhere in the world, and its human rights record is downright appalling. The government’s watchful eye is omnipresent from the moment you get your passport stamped to the moment you leave."

948,
949,"Except things are different out on Jebel Jais. There are no speed cameras. And with no cops watching for traffic, there’s no real policing at all. The closest there is to any hand of the government are the construction crews finishing the next stage of the road."
950,"This has a very unsurprising effect on the car enthusiasts of the UAE. To them, Jebel Jais is basically a free-to-enter hillclimb racetrack with no enforced speed limits and more turns than you can count. It’s not hard to find videos of people running the road at any speed they can manage, drifting the hairpins, whatever they want. There were thick black lines when I drove Jebel Jais from when a bunch of trucks came to do burnouts across the middle of the road."

By figuring out that light weight and low drag equal high mileage Axon has found a way to forego all the State-of-the-Union-sexiness and just make a car that's not only actually capable of achieving 100mpg, but stands some chance of actually seeing production."

1025,"
If you're good at math you immediately see the problem here. For the first sixty miles the Raser Hummer runs in all EV mode and from there it will run on a constantly operating generator, resulting in an asymptotic decline in average fuel economy. It does get the dramatic 100 MPG fuel economy the company claims — as long as you don't go further than 60 miles in a day. The actual, long-range economy is a less headline-grabbing 33 MPG. Much better than a standard H3 for sure, but Raser has not quite yet managed to defy the laws of physics."

A stand-alone four-cylinder gasoline engine replaces the previous V6 or V8 and drives a generator making electricity after about 40 miles of driving when the lithium ion batteries are spent."

Where exactly you put the fuel, we don't know. All of this sounds pretty much like the Volt, doesn't it? The tall claims will have to be backed by road tests but we'll just have to wait and see if Raser Tech can out-do the General on this one.

After that, it's shipped to Wackersdorf (teehee), where it's stacked in layers before landing in Leipzig to be formed using high-pressure resin injection and cut into shape. "

1078,"Now before you scream about hyper-expensive repairs, here's the other trick bit nobody's talking about. BMW has marked and scored the passenger cell in strategic places to allow for repairs. Stuff a Lambo bad enough, and you have to replace the tub, likely at a total loss. Stuff an i8 (or i3) and BMW claims it can cut out the damaged section, insert a new piece, do it in less time than it takes to bang out a fender, and still maintain structural rigidity and safety. That might not be at the top of your sports car shopping list when plunking down $135-large, but it's the kind of material science and manufacturing tech that's sitting atop the mountain just waiting to trickle down."

1081,"This relentless, starlet-obsessive attention to tonnage even made it to the windows, which are thinner and chemically hardened, just like the Gorilla Glass screen of your smartphone. That's another first."
1082,"All in, the i8 tips the scales at 3,274 pounds, or about 200 pounds heavier than a bone-stock Carrera, all while carrying a 400-pound, 5.2-kWh battery pack spanning the center tunnel, ala Chevy Volt. Weight distribution is 49:51 front-to-rear, and that extra one percent out back could be thanks to the turbo."

1084,
1085,"It's positively huge compared to the 1.5-liter, Mini-derived three cylinder it's fused to. But big turbo lag isn't an issue when an electric motor has your back. The 228-hp three-pot's torque curve gradually increases from about 221 lb-ft at 1,800 rpm before peaking 2,000 rpm later at 236 lb-ft. But as soon as you mat the throttle, all 184 lb-ft from the electric motor is being shuttled through a two-speed gearbox before twisting the front wheels to deliver 0-60 in around 4 seconds. The torque curves of both motors line up perfectly, by design. Just as twist begins to bleed off from the electric motor at 3,800 rpm, the blown three-banger is huffing and puffing all the way to its 6,500 rpm redline. This is the performance symbiosis we've been promised. And it sounds phenomenal to boot. "

1088,"Yes, BMW is yet again employing ""enhanced"" engine sounds filtered through the i8's speakers. Get over it. Modern cars have been meticulously honed to keep exterior sounds out — not just with more sound deadening material, but with acoustic simulators — and one of the casualties is engine noise. It's what (most) people want. When whisking along in all electric mode (BMW claims around 20 miles, I only saw 14) there's no aural intrusion. But once the engine fires up, toggling from EV to Sport mode, well, as any biker will tell you, three-pots rock, and come complete with belches and burbles on up- and downshifts. It's something I did countlessly and unnecessarily while heading into the Malibu canyons. "
1089,And that's where the i8 experience begins to fall apart.

1092,"It's quick and nimble and corners flatter than anything I've driven in recent memory. But as sharp as the steering is, there is absolutely no feel. Chalk it up to electric steering and ultra-thin 195/50 non-runflat tires up front, but even in Sport mode with the dampers tightened, communication is nonexistent. Despite that, there's an air of confidence I've rarely found in a mid-engine car. The nose tucks in quickly and consistently, but understeer is the order du jour, and anyone telling you they got the rear end to step out (even with DCT totally defeated) is either on a runway, the Stig, or lying."
1093,"Thanks to regen, the brakes are bit grabby and the throttle calibration is hit-and-miss, perfect around town and generally constant through the bends, but seems to get tripped up when braking late into a corner when understeer rears its head. There's a pause (again, even in Sport mode) before the computers sort things out and slingshot you through the bend with all-wheel grip. Sort things out ahead of time, and the i8 sticks for days, but even the BMW engineers I spoke with admitted that calibration was the hardest part."
1094,Advertisement
1095,
1096,"Here's an example: I'm mid-bend and let off the throttle to tighten the line before getting back on the long pedal. In that split second the six-speed auto and engine have to keep the revs up to avoid dipping too far below the torque sweet spot, the electric motor (and it's 7 hp cousin mounted out back) have to recognize, react, and match that state, all while the computer sorts out the front-to-rear torque split to keep things steady. What few braincells I have left are oozing out of my ears just thinking about it."
1097,"And that may be the problem. BMW's engineers spent so much time getting all these systems to play nice together that something was lost. The very first word in my driving notes was ""cold."" The i8 has a clinical, antiseptic feel, in direct contrast to the dramatic exterior and high-tech hardware. And that's the biggest hurdle for automakers to overcome with electrically augmented powertrains, at least in a car that's not priced north of $1m. With all this technology to control, engineers need to bring back — to program in — the warmth. "

1102,"Loverman: How did the 24 Hours of LeMons start?
Jay Lamm: Basically, with way too much beer and chinese food. We'd been doing this road-rally thing called the Double 500, a 500-kilometer road rally for $500 cars, for years. I came up with the general idea for the Double 500 one day after the California MIlle, while I was taunting Martin Swig that it was too easy for the Mille guys to just solve all their mechanical problems with a check wrench. I was pretty much just busting his chops, but Martin isn't one to take that lying down. He called my bluff, and actually wound up organizing and hosting the Double 500 as a street rally. Anyway, a few years later, a bunch of us SF car guys were sitting around at our regular Saturday lunch one day, and we all kind of agreed that the Double 500 had gotten too easy..."
1103,"There were really great $500 cars everywhere, and just about any of them could make it 500 kilometers. So I just figured a 24-hour race on a track was the next level of difficulty.

In retrospect, adding the racetrack and the 24-hour duration was my way of guaranteeing that you'd have more of those panicky, hilarious mechanical crises that make vintage rallies and vintage racing so much fun. (You know, fun for the other people who are watching you suffer....)"

Jay Lamm: It just seemed like the right number, really. Martin was originally lobbying for $1000 before the first Double 500, but I really felt that would be way too easy, which it basically turned out to be. And I kept thinking back to my $500 Porsche 928S, which was the greatest $500 car of all time. (If I still had that thing I would've RULED Thunderhill.)"

If you care that much, you're definitely in the wrong race. It's actually $3000 in nickels, since first place wins $1500, People's Choice gets a grand, and Organizer's Choice gets $500.

In general, as I've learned how to express and enforce my desire for clean racing, the races themselves have gotten better. The last Altamont event was an exception, though—there was way, way more bumping and shortcutting than I wanted to see—so Dan Radowicz, whose LeMons' chief steward, and I went back to the drawing board and developed some new rules, new penalties, and a new drill for the driver's meeting to combat that. I think it worked really well at Thunderhill, so I'd say the positive trend is really back in force now."

Those seemed like two really big challenges going in, and the fact that it all came together made me totally smug at the end—even though it was really the ARCA guys working at Flat Rock Speedway who made it all come together. I would've ended up flat on my butt without them—they were really, really good. Which, now that I think of it, is probably another big reason I liked that one so much."

This time out, the engine was ripped out of the Mazdasaurus and destroyed. Why the discrepancy?
Jay Lamm: Every team gets one ballot at the start of the race, and on it they can nominate their favorite car (the People's Choice) and their most hated car (the People's Curse). The Curse was intended to keep awful behavior, and/or blatant cheating, in check, since it's a way for the other teams to all police one particularly egregious offender. As it turns out, we've only had one or two recipients who I thought really deserved it. The rest just got caught up in bad luck or sort of a mob mentality.

He wasn't in much of a mood to be gentle, and I can't say I felt very bad about that.

1243,"Having owned three different generations of the Honda Civic Si, two S2000s, and one Integra Type-R, you could say I have some passion for Honda’s cars. Like everyone with a pulse and a passion for cars, I was bummed Honda didn’t ship the Civic Type-R stateside, and always wanted to drive one. Each Gran Turismo version I bought would end up with one in my garage. But now that Honda is finally—finally!—bringing that red ‘R’ badge to the U.S. market, I wanted to see what we missed out on with those cool hatchbacks from my high school years."
1244,
1245,"With the original EK Type-R never being officially sold in the States, you have to get creative to drive one over here. Luckily, I know someone in Central Texas who owns a 1997 JDM model, who also previously owned a DC2 Integra Type-R, and also wanted to own a proper right-hand drive Civic Type-R that reminded him of his former Type-R experience. "
1246,"The owner isn’t new to importing JDM cars, and previously owned an S15 Nissan Silvia. I can’t share how he got them imported, nor how he actually got a legit Texas license plate on this Civic, but who really cares? Don’t sweat the details in life, you’ll live longer."

1249,
1250,We’ll start with arguably what matters most—what’s under the hood. 
1251,"The B16B engine was a big part of the sport compact tuner buzz in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It produces 185 horsepower at 8200 RPM and 118 lb-ft of torque at 7500 RPM. It revs high (that’s the whole damn point), makes a mechanical sound that newer cars aren’t allowed to exhibit, and surprisingly, has quite a bit more flexible torque than the ordinary single-cam Civics of that era. "
1252,Advertisement
1253,
1254,"The only trouble is that, as anyone even remotely familiar with Honda will tell you, you have to get on the VTEC to really make it go fast. The Type-R redlines at damn near 9000 RPM, and doesn’t hit its happy spot until after 6000 RPM. "
1255,"Once it does, you get the reminder of what older VTEC engines were known for, and it surges forward as well as any four-banger can. Red valve cover-equipped Hondas get something special underneath. The torque is much more linear than the spec sheet indicates. "
1256,"The louder exhaust cam roar once you hit VTEC is addictive. You keep wanting to downshift to get the revs up in that range, to get that tone and pull you don’t get in your normal Civic EX that everyone had in the 1990s. I was impressed by the pull at mid-range RPMs. It reminded me of my ‘98 Integra Type-R’s power band. Yes, I know that they’re the same family of engine, but the Integra gets way more attention from others. Oh, how I miss that sensation. "

1258,
1259,"Not much power is needed to have fun in a car that weighs so little, and it goes from 0 to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds and runs the quarter mile in 15.3 seconds. At 2,400 lbs, this thing is light. It only has two airbags, and doesn’t have traction control or any real comfort features."
1260,"The owner added a Hondata ECU, Comptech air box, and a Mugen header hooked up to a cat-back exhaust, so it does have a couple more ponies than the stock model, but it’s a subtle upgrade. He insisted on keeping it closer to factory settings for long-term reliability while making a little more fun to drive. While it’s a 1997 model, he updated the front clip and headlights to the 1999 spec."
1261,Advertisement
1262,
1263,"Factory Type-Rs come with 15-inc wheels, and this one maintains the standard size, but with a set of Volk TE-37s to shave a couple pounds while adding style. They look the part."
1264,"Type-R models lose sound deadening material for the benefit of weight savings, and while I’ll admit it’s a little noisier than you’d love on a 300-mile drive, it’s not bad at all. Added bonus: The engine note is easier to hear. There’s a hint of chassis noise too, but this car was the first Civic to have a seam welded monocoque, it’s 20 years old, and it has done over 236,000 kilometers. "
1265,Advertisement
1266,
1267,So how does it drive out in the real world? 
1268,"Tricky. It’s tricky, to tell you the truth. You’d be wrong to think it’s easy to jump right in, and have no trouble getting used to shifting with your left hand. I’ve driven more than a few right-hand drive cars, but it took a few minutes—and I’ll admit a 1-4 shift or two by mistake—to adjust to the motions of rowing through those gears. After ending the embarrassment of looking like a rookie driver, I was able to find out just what the Type-R was all about. "
1269,Advertisement
1270,
1271,"The handling is sharper than just about any modern hot hatch, and the Civic Type-R can attribute much of this to its weight, helical limited-slip differential and perfectly set up double wishbone suspension. There’s a hint of stiffness, but it’s still really subtle on the highway. You get the right amount of feedback, and have to use a little elbow grease in the tighter corners. No electric steering crap here. Just a good ol’ rack and pinion."
1272,"While a bit flashy, the Recaro seats in the Type-R are snug and functional. You expect them to keep you in place with the lateral and shoulder bolsters, but the thigh padding is surprisingly grippy. I’m neither a skinny nor an overly hefty guy, but I felt like they were all over my outer thighs. On the twisty roads, I wasn’t complaining at all, as they kept me perfectly in place. "
1273,Advertisement
1274,
1275,"Shifts in the Civic Type-R are so perfect, with a remarkably short throw. Direct, simple, and crisp. You know when you’re in the correct gear, and can almost feel every synchro engage. The titanium gear knob Honda provides has a nice fit in your palm, but I do remember the one in my Integra Type-R roasting my hand on hot Texas days. "
1276,"The key impression I got from this car is that it’s so tight. So analog. For various (stupid) safety and comfort reasons, they can’t make cars like this anymore, and even the more hardcore hot hatches currently offered can’t give you this feeling throughout. I’d pay a stupid amount of money if someone would make a super lightweight, zippy, and reliable hatch again. "
1277,Advertisement
1278,
1279,"On some twisty Texas Hill Country roads, I had the chance to put some good, hard miles on the car, and it didn’t show any signs of stress. Keep in mind, this car is two decades old. The A/C kept blowing cold, and the engine didn’t stutter at all. "
1280,"At the end of a day of driving, I walked away from this car impressed. The internet myth that Honda used to make pure, mechanical, passionate cars that drivers craved is absolutely an accurate one. "
1281,"And the owner of this Type-R is one lucky man. He gets to drive a simple, fun, inexpensive, analog car that came from the period of Honda’s finest work. "
1282,Advertisement
1283,
1284,"It’s my fear that the new Civic Type-R won’t be able to capture this emotion and sensation for the driver. In the 1990s, manufacturers made sports cars that the driver truly appreciated. Even when they’re unfathomably powerful, modern sporty cars are too heavy, dull, insulated, and comfortable. "
1285,"I can’t see Honda getting this mechanical feeling right with the new one, but I’m also not going to say no to the first ever Civic Type-R to officially come to our shores. It just has a lot to live up to. "

1359,"In the early seventies, Ferruccio's line up was all about the late Miura SVs or the 2+2 gran turismo Espadas, and while the V8 powered Uracco wasn't the factory's greatest creation, even that got more attention (thanks to its mid-engined configuration) than the beautiful Islero's successor. Maybe that's why only 328 were made."
1360,
1361,"The Jarama was born because Lamborghini had to redesign the Islero in order to meet the brand new safety and emissions regulations in the US. But instead of a simple facelift, they came out with this. The Jarama was designed by Marcello Gandini of Bertone, which is probably why it reminds us of Alfa Romeo's Montreal or the Iso Lele, another two of his creations from the late sixties."

1555,"On New Years' Day I decided to ask the Jaloposphere for a name for the goofy little car I've been drawing for a number of articles. Commenter 62ImperialCrown suggested ""Utopian Turtletop,"" which was a rejected name created by poet Marianne Moore for the Ford Edsel."
1556,
1557,"A poet was asked to come up with names for one of the most legendary flops of all time? How had I not heard about this? It has all my favorite things: cars, failure, weird ideas, turtles — so I did a bit of looking."
1558,"The story's reasonably well-known, and while that makes me feel a bit like an idiot, there's no reason any of you have to. So here's the whole story."
1559,"Back in 1955, when the Edsel line (it was originally intended to be an entire sub-brand) was in development, there was lots of confusion as to what to name the car. The ad agency Foote, Cone and Belding was retained to come up with names, and boy did they, cranking out a list of six freaking thousand of them. Those names, interestingly, included a number that the Edsel would use on model types and would also go on to be names for other cars, both Ford and other brands. Names like Pacer, Ranger, and Citation."
1560,Advertisement
1561,
1562,"Still, nothing in this huge list was getting anyone really excited, so, not entirely officially, members of the marketing team reached out to modernist poet Marianne Moore, who was known for her wit and unorthodox thinking. She even wrote (later on) the liner notes for Muhammad Ali's spoken word album!"
1563,"They sent the poet a letter that said, in part:"
1564,"We should like this name to be more than a label. Specifically, we should like it to have a compelling quality in itself and by itself. To convey, through association or other conjuration, some visceral feeling of elegance, fleetness, advanced features and design. A name, in short, that flashes a dramatically desirable picture in people's minds."
1565,Advertisement
1566,
1567,"So, based on these instructions, Moore came up with a pretty incredible list. Now, it's not really a list of car names that you could ever imagine actually being used, but there's a number in there I think would have been pretty incredible. The Ford Silver Sword has a really great rhythm to it and is just fun to say — go ahead, try it out. Plus, Resilient Bullet? That's pretty tough. Thunderblender? Evokes a really dangerous appliance too much, maybe. Astranaut is pretty fun, though Pastelogram is just weird and Varsity Stroke sounds like some advanced masturbation technique."
1568,"I've got the full list below, thanks to the good data-hoarders at Lists of Note."
1569,"Of course, in the end, they went with ""Edsel,"" after Henry Ford's late son. And it was a colossal flop, of course, partially due to the name, which no one outside of Ford insiders really understood or gave a crap about. Oh, and just to make things nice and confusing, around this same time there was a poet named Edsel Ford, completely unrelated to any of this, even though his name and occupation are a perfect combination of this entire event."

1577,"Well, ""love"" is maybe not the right word to use— I love that it exists, and love how abominably awful it is. If it was just slightly crappy, but generally close to mainstream racing games, I'd be disappointed. But that's so not the case."

Oh, and there's a lovely young traffic-woman who periodically commands you to, you know, keep it in line."
1581,

That's why it's kind of surprising that Conor started racing go karts at the ripe age of 10 years old. That seems young, but it actually is kind of old these days. Tons of kids start racing aged four."

1626,"As for next year, plans are currently up in the air, but Conor has said that the end goal is to get to Formula One. That means the next step is a ride in GP2 or a similar feeder series."

1648,"Also, there's just something obscenely cool about being a motorcycle cop. Taking a bike on patrol makes you easily 10 times more awesome than other cops."
1649,"But how do you make a police motorcycle even cooler? You add a sidecar, that's how."
1650,"After I moved to Washington, D.C., I was kind of surprised to learn that during the winter months, the police up here mount sidecars onto their patrol motorcycles. I had never really hard of modern-day police using them. When we think of sidecars, we tend to think of really old military bikes or Batman's motorcycle from the 1960s TV show."
1651,"But the cops in the District aren't doing it just to look badass, although they barely need the boost since they ride 1690 cc Harley-Davidsons. They use sidecars because the weather is so nasty up here during the winter months, and having an extra wheel from the sidecar helps keep the bike from falling over. This story from the Washington Post sums it up well:"
1652,"Every year, shortly after Columbus Day, sidecars are hooked up to the department's big bikes. The sidecars stay on until spring. With a third wheel, the motorcycle can stay upright in icy or snowy conditions or when roads are covered with wet leaves."

1656,"Rider Magazine last year published a pretty fascinating history of the motorcycle sidecar. They had their heyday in the first half of the 20th century until they were mostly made obsolete by — get this — cars. With the advent of cheaper automobiles, nobody wanted to ride around in a sidecar, except for fun."
1657,"They also said that in the U.S., only three motorcycle manufacturers sell sidecar rigs anymore: Harley-Davidson, Ural and Royal Enfield. I reached out to Harley-Davidson's media folks to ask about how many police departments in the U.S. ask for sidecars, but I never heard back."

After powering the most luxurious automobiles and setting up numerous speed records between the two world wars, V12s soon made it into motorsport, with Ferrari building its first car powered by a 1.5-litre Colombo V12. 1969 was loud from Porsche's mighty air-cooled flat-12 producing somewhere north of 580 hp in its earliest forms."

BMW also started putting V12s into its flagship 7 Series in 1986, meaning that pretty soon, the rest of the Germans had to follow. Volkswagen even went for a W12, but BMW got the crown much earlier, at the exact moment the first McLaren F1 was finished in Woking."

2257,"Hey Chris, why don't you come drift the Bentley?"
2258,STEP 2
2259,Getting a driver was even easier than getting the car or the location. I just emailed Ryan Tuerck and asked him if he wanted to drift a Bentley. People don't really say no to that kind of question.
2260,Advertisement
2261,
2262,"Why Tuerck? Well, he's one of the best sideways drivers in the country and I know him from when I handed him the keys to my own car and let him try and drift it. Hey, if he didn't wreck my $1,500 Baja Bug, surely he won't wreck a $410,000 Bentley."
2263,
2264,STEP 3
2265,"This is the hard part, and this is where I totally screw up. When I first write Kevin, my contact at East Coast Bash, I tell him that Kippenberger is bringing a Bentley, but I don't tell them we're going to drift it. I assume they'll get cold feet about the car crashing, I assume they won't let us in, I assume they'll hate the idea. I only tell Kevin about the plan when I finally met him face to face on Saturday morning. He immediately gives me a provisional okay to do go ahead with the plan, and then starts helping me coordinate when the car can go out on track."
2266,Advertisement
2267,
2268,I've totally underestimated how much a bunch of punk rock drift kids would want to see the car of choice for the world's up-and-coming billionaires melt its tires.
2269,"Maybe it's because nobody thinks the Bentley is actually going to show up, or maybe because nobody thinks that the car's traction control is going to let the car spin its tires, but everyone gives the plan the go-ahead. I spend the whole day figuring out the event's schedule, planning when the Bentley could run, and meeting the people who can make it happen."
2270,Advertisement
2271,
2272,"Mouths drop when Kippenberger shows up, and the two-tone Mulsanne glides past row after row of dented Nissan 240SXs with their bumpers torn off."
2273,"There's a crowd around the car when we park in the pits. ""Drift it!"" everyone shouts."
2274,Advertisement
2275,
2276,"We get Ryan Tuerck over and he's grinning from ear to ear. Tony, the chauffeur, hands him the key and people start clustering around Ryan. ""Let me touch it, just let me touch it,"" one girl jokes. Then she turns back to the car. ""Is it wrong that I want to just fuck it? Like, can I just put my dick in it? Let me put my dick in it."" She strokes the tailpipe. Everybody is cracking up."
2277,"The problem is Bentley doesn't know about any of this, and Kippenberger doesn't want them to piss them off. If he's responsible for wrecking their gigantic press car and he doesn't have approval from Bentley's top brass, not only is he screwed, but his whole video project is screwed, his connections with Bentley are screwed, and his reputation is screwed."
2278,Advertisement
2279,
2280,"Tony says he'll call his people at Bentley and see if he can get approval. If he doesn't get it, the plan is off."
2281,"Tony is on the phone for a long time. He gets the regional director at Bentley USA to give the okay. Then he gets the national director at Bentley USA to give the go-ahead. Everybody is freaking out, but Kippenberger says that unless he can get the approval in writing, the car isn't drifting. It's no good if the Mulsanne ends up in a wall and Kippenberger has to say, ""well, my driver said it was okay"" while everyone at Bentley backtracks their verbal approval."
2282,Advertisement
2283,
2284,The sun goes down and no email comes through. Plan B: let's just do a massive burnout. Everyone likes that plan. Now we just have to get the Bentley onto a hot track with drift cars running door to door right past it.
2285,"Tuerck hops into the driver's seat, Tony gives him a lengthy and secretive set of instructions on how to get the traction control off without pulling a fuse, how to get the suspension right, and how to put the car into sport mode."
2286,Advertisement
2287,
2288,We're gonna want sport mode.
2289,"We shoot through the pits and just as we're about to get on track, a little kid stops us. ""Do you have the money to pay for that thing if you crash it?"" he asks. ""Hell no!"" Tuerck laughs back."
2290,Advertisement
2291,
2292,"At least a dozen photographers follow us down to the far side of the track in the dark. Kevin comes with, and he looks like he's going to have a heart attack. Cars are running by, anyone could get run over at any time, or worse, somebody could scratch the car."
2293,"Nobody is sure if the car is going to do a burnout. It's got 752 lb-ft of torque and 505 horsepower, but we don't know if the traction control is going to cut in anyway, run all the power to one wheel, and skid the car straight into the wall. No such worries necessary. On the first try, Tuerck lights the rears up and melts the tires. It wasn't a sissy, wisps of smoke burnout. It was a full-on, billowing clouds pouring out of the wheel wells burnout."
2294,Advertisement
2295,
2296,"Kippenberger and his partner Markus are shooting the whole thing on a super stabilized carbon fiber gimbal they built themselves. I hear $14,000 thrown around when people ask how much it costs to make."
2297,Advertisement
2298,
2299,"Take two, Kippenberger walks up to the photographers watching. He needs a girl with brown hair and Kevin's girlfriend gets volunteered. ""Come with me,"" Kippenberger says. ""I'll make you famous."""
2300,"""Don't believe him,"" her friend laughs back. ""You'll wake up with a dildo in your ass!"""
2301,Advertisement
2302,
2303,"Tuerck rips another burnout and they send the girl to dance through the smoke. This is the moment of Peak Weirdness, when nobody has any idea what's going on, how this video is going to look, or who the hell this weird German with a floral print bucket hat and a $410,000 Bentley is. But everyone goes along with it, Kippenberger gets his shot, the car doesn't crash, and nobody gets run over."
2304,"We throw all the gear back into the Mulsanne, stuff as many people as we can into the back seat, and high tail it off the track. The whole track is hot, and any one of the drivers could smash into the Bentley. Again, Kevin looks like he's going to die."
2305,"We make it back to the pits, everyone shakes hands, and the shoot is a success. Kippenberger gets his last shot, we all share a drink, and they set off. The Bentley leaves just as mysteriously as it came. It feels like the whole thing never even happened, like it was some cut scene in The Big Lebowski."

2311,"Reader John saw this car when he was out camping with his wife in the Nevada Desert. He says this car passed him, and he has no idea what it is."

Everybody who was anybody was there: John D. Rockefeller Jr., Charles Schwab, Otto H. Kahn, Walter Chrysler, Marie Curie, Will Rogers, President Herbert Hoover—and, of course, the guest of honor, Thomas Edison himself. At the time, the Edison Institute was still relatively small. It consisted of just two buildings, both of which Henry Ford had moved from Menlo Park, New Jersey and re-constructed to look just as they had in 1879: Edison's laboratory and the boarding-house where he had lived while he perfected his invention. By the time the Institute opened to the public in 1933, however, it had grown much more elaborate and today the Henry Ford Museum (renamed after Ford's death in 1947) is one of the largest and best-known museums in the country."

2404,I'm not an old school guy. I love double clutch gearboxes and I think they're the way of the future. But I just drove a car with a gated manual shift and it's properly magical. It's also the end-of-the-line. So who is to blame?
2405,
2406,"(Full Disclosure: In order to get to VIR to drive the Lamborghini Gallardo Super Trofeo, Lambo let me drive a Gallardo down there. A 50th Anniversary Gallardo LP560-2. With 82 total miles on it. And a gated manual shift. I know, you hate me. I also hate me.)"
2407,
2408,"As far as I can tell, there are currently two cars you can buy with a traditional gated shifter: Audi R8 and Lamborghini Gallardo. And once the Gallardo is gone, which will be soon, the R8 will be the only one left since the Gallardo's replacement will be twin-clutch only."
2409,Advertisement
2410,
2411,
2412,I was ok with that. But that was before I had ever driven any car with a classic gated manual shift. It will change your outlook on life. And love.
2413,"The Gallardo is definitely faster with its paddle shift transmission, but it is so much better with the manual that the only reason not to buy it is if you only have one leg. And even then, the clutch is fairly light and very linear, a joy to use. I bet you could find a way to make it work with one leg."
2414,Advertisement
2415,
2416,Perhaps a pulley system?
2417,"You need to find a way to drive one, because the best part, by far, is shifting gears. The gates. Oh the gates. Dio mio. I don't know if there is a more evocative automotive sound than the distinct metal-on-metal clank of shifting a proper gated gearbox. Every single movement of the shift lever is satisfying, even a missed shift is fun, because it gives you a chance to shift again. It's almost like it was milled out of a single billet block of aluminum. If you're somewhat adept at using a manual gearbox, then this transmission is far smoother than e-gear would ever be."
2418,Advertisement
2419,
2420,"Inherently, there is a reason why basically no Lambos have this transmission. And it's because nobody wants it. There were rumors that at one time, once e-gear was offered, Lamborghini went for an entire year without selling a Gallardo with a manual gearbox. Lambo has told me this isn't strictly true, but the take rate for a manual is less than five percent of Gallardos sold."
2421,"If you didn't know, the Gallardo isn't exactly the Toyota Corolla, so that means the relative number of shift yourself baby Lambos is very small."
2422,"It's expensive to have an option basically nobody wants, but Lambo has kept the faith all these years that people will come running to the gated shifter."
2423,Advertisement
2424,
2425,They haven't.
2426,"And that means that Lamborghini isn't to blame for the demise of the manual transmission in its cars. The people who buy its cars are to blame. I'm starting to write letters to all the Lambo buyers out there today, to implore them to start using their left leg while driving. It's getting weak just sitting there."
2427,"The rest of this car is classic Gallardo, except the interior is entirely Alcantara. The seats. The dash. The wheel. The roofliner. Literally everything. The seats also don't have an adjustable rake, which makes it become quite uncomfortable during an extended drive. So I just shifted gears a bunch to forget about the back pain."
2428,Advertisement
2429,
2430,But it's still really fast. It still sounds like the world's most badass symphony. I still think it's one of the best looking cars in the world.
2431,"It's not as fast as a Ferrari 458 or McLaren 12C on a track, but the manual gearbox makes it so much more involving. This is a case where I'd trade a few seconds on track for the manual transmission in a heartbeat. The Gallardo with a gated shifter goes from being a gorgeous car with a questionable transmission to one of the most evocative and emotional automotive experiences you could ever have."

2459,"The agency has received 23 complaints of that drivers had to push harder than normal on the brake pedal to make the car stop. One driver crashed into a stopped vehicle while another had to use the emergency brake to stop, sending the car into a spin."

2466,"Bob King's successful term as prez of the UAW is coming to end in nine months, and secretary-treasurer Dennis Williams is likely to be the next guy in charge according to the Freep:"
2467,"Several UAW officials and other UAW insiders told the Free Press that Williams is widely viewed as a leading candidate to become the union's next president because of his achievements as regional director, the respect he has earned over the last four years and his ties to the administration of President Barack Obama.In addition, Williams has played a key role in the UAW's organizing efforts with Asian and German automakers. In 1989, Williams negotiated the union's first contract with Mitsubishi Motors at the company's Normal, Ill., plant. He also was part of the team that negotiated contracts with Caterpillar in 2011 and 2004.In 2007, Williams played a central role in then-Sen. Barack Obama's upset win in the Iowa caucuses that launched his successful presidential candidacy, according to his official UAW biography."
2468,5th Gear: How To Save Money On EVs

2470,
2471,"Everyone focuses on batteries with EVs, but much of the costs are in the 'power electronics box' that converts DC from the battery to AC for the electric motor/s. As Karl Henkel reports, this is a huge cost second only to the batteries to themselves."
2472,"For instance, Ford has reduced the number of battery cells — which together comprise a battery pack — in its hybrid vehicles from more than 250 in the last production model of the Escape hybrid (discontinued in 2012) to just 76 in the new C-Max and Fusion hybrids.But increasing efficiency of the battery is only part of the story: The power electronics box is responsible for transferring as much of the current as possible without wasting or losing energy. Ford's most recent production-ready box transfers 93 percent of the energy.""You want a box that is really efficient,"" Sankaran said. ""Otherwise in every process you're losing energy."""
2473,Reverse: Ford Loved Edison
2474,"On this day in 1929, the 50th birthday of the incandescent light bulb, Henry Ford throws a big party to celebrate the dedication of his new Thomas Edison Institute in Dearborn,Michigan. Everybody who was anybody was there: John D. Rockefeller Jr., Charles Schwab, Otto H. Kahn, Walter Chrysler, Marie Curie, Will Rogers, President Herbert Hoover—and, of course, the guest of honor, Thomas Edison himself. At the time, the Edison Institute was still relatively small. It consisted of just two buildings, both of which Henry Ford had moved from Menlo Park, New Jersey and re-constructed to look just as they had in 1879: Edison's laboratory and the boarding-house where he had lived while he perfected his invention. By the time the Institute opened to the public in 1933, however, it had grown much more elaborate and today the Henry Ford Museum (renamed after Ford's death in 1947) is one of the largest and best-known museums in the country."

2479,There are two kinds of car safety — there's passive safety like airbags and crumple zones. Then there's active safety like a car that lets you avoid a crash in the first place. This is a perfect demonstration of the latter.
2480,
2481," The driver Augustin Kuntz is behind the wheel of his Porsche 993 C2. It's around 20 years old and it hails from a time before high-strength steel substructures, side-curtain airbags, and lane-departure warning systems."

2483,
2484,"But it is nimble, with high grip levels and great visibility. To most people its thin window pillars and frail styling make it look unsafe. As you can see from this video, car safety isn't just about how well a vehicle deforms when it hits something. It's also about preventing crashes from happening altogether."
2485,The condition of the other drivers in this crash is unknown.
2486,"Nary a day goes by when one of us doesn't bemoan the lack of sporty Hondas these days. Sure, there's the Civic Si and the NSX is coming back, but many enthusiasts feel like the brand has left them high and dry. Now a concept is headed to the Tokyo Motor Show that may be the baby S2000 we've heard about."
2487,
2488,"Meet the Honda S660 Concept. Honda calls it an ""an open-top sports-type mini-vehicle,"" and its name clearly not only recalls the S2000 we love so much but also the tiny but awesome S600 and S800 roadsters from the 1960s. It also looks like a bit like a Honda Beat to me, which is pretty cool. The best part? It's mid-engined and rear-wheel drive."
2489,

2491,
2492,"The car appears to be an evolution of the Honda EV-STER concept from a couple years back. Here, it loses that Tesla Roadster-esque electric powertrain in favor of a traditional gasoline motor. This new concept also gets a fully retractable roof."
2493,
2494,"Now comes the part that may disappoint the hardcore enthusiasts: the specs. Australia's Motoring reports the car uses a turbocharged 660cc petrol engine putting out just 67 horsepower, which is delivered to the rear wheels through a continuously variable transmission. However, with a weight under 1,900 pounds, it should be pretty sprightly."
2495,Advertisement
2496,
2497,"Okay, so it's not a screaming roadster with a six-speed manual. But it sounds like fun, and it is apparently headed for production. Motoring says Honda is eyeing a version with a larger engine for export models, which would be nice for us Americans and Europeans who want a bit more oomph. As it is, it sounds like it could be an interesting Mini, Fiat 500 Abarth or even Miata fighter."
2498,"Motoring also reports that more fun Hondas could be on their way, which is really good news:"
2499,"Interestingly, the S660 is actually part of a bigger picture for Honda — a picture we are hearing involves three mid-engined sports cars and a reference to the “third brother” of a mid-engined trio that Honda bosses are currently evaluating."
2500,"That new coupe, says one Honda engineer, could be similar in size and price to the Toyota 86. That’s good news because without the S2000, Honda certainly needs a compact sports car to slot in between the new NSX and the S660."

2511,"First of all, it's great seeing all of them in one place, they have some great chemistry. Secondly, now I know that Harris and Spinelli read the comments that I post about their t-shirts being too small and that I don't think drifting is worthwhile."

2514,"There is nothing about it that stands out in the least. It has no discernible features. It has, as far as I can tell, no styling whatsoever. A Nissan Rogue has an engine, I suppose, in the same way that a Cuisinart has a motor or that a goldfish has fins. There's nothing to the car. It is the complete absence of car design."

2520,"As the Indianapolis Star notes, whatever the E7 fetches at auction in January probably won't even come close to erasing Carbon Motors' $21.7 million debt to private vendors and investors, nor will it pay back the $7 million in grants the company was given by the city of Connersville and the state."
2521,"Hilariously enough, the car going to auction is the show prototype ""used to woo investors"" into giving money to the now-bankrupt automaker."
2522,"The E7 was one of the more interesting automotive startups to come along in recent years, but it was also one of the biggest and most expensive failures. The car was to be built from the ground up explicitly for police duty, unlike the Chargers and Explorers that are converted to police cars. It was to be powered by the stonkingly torquetastic turbodiesel inline six engine from the old BMW 335d."
2523,"But earlier this year, Carbon quietly filed for bankruptcy not long after unceremoniously abandoning their Connersville plant. The company blamed their troubles, in part on getting turned down last year for a $310 million loan they sought from the U.S. Department of Energy, a loan they said they were led to believe would be approved."

(Earlier that day, President Calvin Coolidge had ceremonially opened the tunnel from his yacht on the Potomac by turning the same key that had ""opened"" the Panama Canal in 1915—Time called it ""the golden lever of the Presidential telegraphic instrument""—which rang a giant brass bell at the tunnel's entrances.)

And he likes to talk about them, as you'll see."

All while sketching a really lovely and precise drawing of an F-Type Coupé."

This year in the hallway between the two cavernous rooms glinting with new automobiles, there was a long display about the history of the show, bringing to light a bit of trivia."

2802,
2803,Buying a new car is stupid. But it's also awesome. 
2804,"Everybody on the internet knows that buying new cars is just plain stupid. New cars, after all, are just ""depreciating hunks of metal."" New cars depreciate an average of 20% immediately, and then go down another 15% each year after that, according to sources such as KBB and Edmunds. According to every message board I've ever read, buying a new car will probably cause you to lose your house, get divorced, and be sent to the Chateau d'If for thirteen years."
2805,"Chevrolet has done it. The Corvette has gone from being a world class sports car with a ""but"" to a sports car the world finally has to recognize. Put simply, the 2014 Corvette is one of the best sports cars ever born in America."
2806,"(Full Disclosure: Remember that time we leaked the 2014 Corvette a couple of years ahead of time? Well, it turns out that didn't necessarily make GM want us to drive it immediately. But we persevered, begged them, bought them shrimp, and as a Thanksgiving miracle, I got to drive it for the entire weekend. That's why I was thankful for horsepower this year.)"
2807,
2808,"Every single time a new Corvette is released, Chevy makes a bunch of promises. ""This car competes with the Porsche 911 on every level."" ""The interior is vastly improved."" ""This is unlike any Corvette that came before."" ""This is the new sports car benchmark."""
2809,"But the Corvette has never really followed through. The interior, for lack of a better word, has always been crap. On back roads, it's been point-and-shoot. The styling has been largely derivative, too stuck in the idea that heritage, not performance, is what sells Corvettes."
2810,Advertisement
2811,
2812,"Chevy is right. The Corvette name is stocked with cachet, but it's equal parts negative and positive. There's a certain group of people who believe performance starts and stops with a fiberglass wedge from Bowling Green. Then there's another group. The group that will deride the Corvette no matter what performance numbers it puts out or what other cars it beats."

2821,"If you're a Corvette traditionalist, you're going to be pissed off. I parked the C7 next to a C6, and the change is so drastic that it looks like this is actually a C12. Since the original Stingray, the Corvette has had round or oval rear taillights (bar a rounded rectangular interlude in the C4). And while tradition is tradition, it hasn't evolved. If you think the evolution of the Porsche 911 is slow, then you haven't looked closely at the Corvette."
2822,"Chevy knows that the exterior appearance of the C7 is divisive and will piss off the Corvette faithful. But they have to reach out beyond that group since the Corvette's current owner base is aging. They need to extend that appeal, and making the car look like a Transformer is one way to do just that. I know not everyone loves it, but I do. I think this is the most dynamic looking car on the road."
2823,"I am not as keen on all the contrasting black accents. The car I drove was an obnoxious yellow that I'd never ever order. All of the black accents, like the wing, rear bumper, side gills, and more, look cheap. This just looks like an angular bumble bee."

2828,Advertisement
2829,
2830,"The new Corvette's interior is quite similar to another brand new performance car: The Jaguar F-Type. Both have a center touch screen flanked by a handle on the passenger side, a subtle way to say ""hey, goober, don't reach over here."" The stock seats (my car didn't have the aggressive competition buckets) are better than the past, with actual bolsters on the side, though they could be better. Passengers get their own control near the vents for AC and seat heating, which is a nice touch."
2831,"But it isn't all perfect. Sitting to each side of the TFT rev counter are gauges that look terribly cheap. I'd like to wheel to be a little smaller and thicker, possibly Alcantara covered. Also, the paddles for the rev match feature feel plasticky."
2832,"The Corvette has never been about its interior. I don't think the interior of the C7 is as massive a leap forward from the C6 as the exterior, but ""crap interior"" is no longer a valid reason to leave the 'Vette off your list."

2840,The new LT1 engine puts out 460 horsepower and an equal amount of torques. That equals 0 to 60 in 3.8 seconds in ideal conditions. 
2841,"And it's not only quick off the line. Let's say you want to go from 60 to 80 MPH. Without downshifting, you just put your foot down and mountain of torque will get you there in mere seconds. If you want to downshift to accelerate, then you might actually turn time backwards as you get up to speed. It's ridiculous."

In Tour, it rides with the relaxed aplomb of the Cadillac CTS Vsport. In Sport, it firms up to an assertive level. In Track, the suspension is replaced with metal girders."
2855,"I left the car in Sport for almost the entirety of my driving time, since I found it was the best compromise between relaxing and breaking my back. Sport gives the best road feel for street driving, letting in the bumps you need to know about and isolating you from the crap that would just get annoying."

On my favorite back roads, it didn't even flinch at some truly nuts speeds. Most of the time it didn't even feel like it was working."
2860,It almost felt bored.
2861,"The Corvette is the anti-BRZ. The limits are so high that it just doesn't flinch at speeds sane people do on back roads. If you somehow reach the limit on the road and you lose it, you will be doing approximately 175 MPH when you crash into the trees and end up on LiveLeak."

2865,"On track, the Vette really comes alive, with a quick turn-in and a fun tendency to kick out the tail out on power down. This is fun defined, and where it feels at home."
2866,"So if you can't reach the limits on the road but can on a track, why buy the Corvette? Why not get a track day weapon like a Caterham or a backroad monster like a turbocharged Miata? For certain people (myself included), that is the answer. I adore this Corvette, but I'd trade some of that speed to know that my car is really working."

2874,"But — and there's always a but with a Corvette — when you aren't used to the extra gear, shifting can get sloppy. Porsche's seven speed in the 911 is a little sloppy, with a slightly rubbery feel. The smart thing they did was lock out seventh gear unless you're in fifth or sixth, that way you don't mistakenly grab it."
2875,"Chevrolet didn't do that, so for your first few hours in the car, expect a lot of fourth-to-seventh upshifts, some cursing, and then a downshift to fifth, or maybe third, by accident."
2876,Advertisement

There's also a very informative heads up display, cylinder deactivation, a rev match feature for the gearbox so wannabe heel-toers can roll with the big boys, and a cool reconfigurable display for the tach."
2883,"What is so cool about a reconfigurable tach, you ask? This one has three different ways to display your revs, and one of them is the same as the digital dash from a C4 Corvette. This is nostalgia of the best kind. "

Fully loaded, this Corvette costs $12,000 less than the starting price of Porsche's cheapest 911. The Porsche still has a nicer interior than the Corvette, but that gap has closed considerably."
2898,"Like the Nissan GT-R, what Chevrolet has done is build a car that costs far less than its competition, but can ruin them on the road. In fact, the Corvette is very GT-R-ey in how it drives along and makes you feel like a driving Superman.

So then I did the right thing and took my car to a tire shop, they checked for leaks and found out that the wheel itself was cracked. If I had done my due diligence in figuring out the problem properly, I'd have saved myself $90 in a needless tire."

In 1982, John DeLorean was charged with drug trafficking; prosecutors argued that he was attempting to raise money for his struggling company. In total, approximately 9,000 DMC-12s were produced. The car became a collector's item and got a big publicity boost when it was featured as a time-travel machine in the ""Back to the Future"" movies starring Michael J. Fox."

3101,The owner of one of the nation&aposs largest forums for Nissan Skyline fans got a call three weeks …
3102,"If your free time is spent at all like ours, you poke around European eBay sites checking out wonders of the automotive world that will never make it to our shores. Like fresh Guinness, strong coffee and heated towel racks, some creations just can't get across the Atlantic."
3103,"You can blame U.S. regulators for that. Mostly. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency tend to be pretty strict about what's safe enough or clean enough to be driven here. Generally speaking, anything that wasn't originally sold in the United States can't be imported if it isn't at least 25 years old. Don't even think about sneaking a car in, as your insurance would be void, and you may end up in jail - which wouldn't be nearly as awful as watching the feds crush your beloved Nissan Skyline."
3104,The question of whether such concerns are legitimate or simply protecting special interests - not to mention whether an increasingly globalized automotive market makes country-specific regulations anticompetitive - is a debate for another time for one reason.
3105,Advertisement

3107,There's a loophole.
3108,"OK, it's a loophole that's been around since 1998, when wealthy Porsche 959 owners like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Gates made a big enough stink that the feds created a ""Show and Display"" exemption into import regulations, allowing newer cars to be imported for the sole purpose of displaying historically or technologically important vehicles. These brilliant bits of Teutonic engineering had been impounded by customs agents for close to 10 years when the regulation was passed, and even then they weren't home free. ""Show and Display"" still only waived NHTSA safety requirements, so the cars still have to be modified to pass EPA regulations because they are newer than 21 years old. When all was said and done, they can be driven no more than 2,500 miles in a calendar year."
3109,"To simplify the process, NHTSA released a list of cars eligible for the exemption. Your garden-variety VW Scirocco or Alfa 159 is still banned, but if you have the money to buy any of the cars on the list, you might as well just fly to Europe when you want to get behind the wheel."

3412,Justin Bieber was pulled over and arrested for numerous offenses earlier today in a rented Lamborghini Gallardo that included DUI and resisting arrest. He's 19 years old and he had a suspended license. So how the hell did he get in the car in the first place? Welcome to the world of high priced exotic rentals.
3413,
3414,If there's a desire for something there's a company that will allow you have it for a brief period of time. Designer clothes. Sex. Lamborghinis.
3415,"Exotic car rental regulations vary by the company, but for the most part the age requirement for exotic car rental in the Miami area is 25, or to 21 year olds with an up-charge. Bieber is 19, which isn't 21 and certainly isn't 25. And a suspended license doesn't really make that any easier."
3416,"So the question is, how did he get his hands on that car? Was there fraud? Was someone so struck by the idea of Justin Bieber driving their car that they were willing to overlook every single part of their insurance policy?"
3417,Advertisement
3418,
3419,"According to Popular Mechanics, getting a rental exotic is actually pretty easy:"
3420,"Requirements are surprisingly simple, starting with a driver's-license check to make sure there are no odd violations on record, Temerian and Darvish say. Next comes a check of your own personal auto-insurance policy to see that it's valid and covers rental cars. Then they'll often request a security deposit on your credit card of up to $5000 depending upon which rental company you use. (What, you think they'd put someone behind the wheel of a Bentley without it?)"
3421,Matt Farah of The Smoking Tire also works a lot with Gotham Dream Cars. We spoke to Farah about exotic car rental practices and how Bieber could get his hands on the car.
3422,Advertisement
3423,
3424,"As Farah put it ""if homie was from Canada with a suspended license I wouldn't have rented him a car. We turn people down all the time for bad paperwork. Plus, we don't rent to anyone under 25."""
3425,"Matt says that Gotham's process requires that a client ""must be over 25 with valid license, comprehensive insurance coverage, and a $5,000 security deposit."""
3426,Advertisement
3427,
3428,"Of course, it's very possible that the car was not rented to Bieber but to a member of his entourage, though I find it doubtful that the people at the rental office wouldn't realize that Bieber would be in the car at any point. Matt doesn't believe that's impossible either when I asked if Bieber might have asked them to look the other way or thrown some money at them."
3429," I think it's much more likely someone at the rental company just said ""here bodyguard x, you're of age, we'll rent to you"" and bodyguard x just handed the keys over. But he also gets into every nightclub so it seems most people would think the risk is worth it to be associated with his name.  "
3430,"Gotham does a lot of celebrity rentals, and even if the celeb sends an assistant to pick up the car, it's not given out. "
3431," We have rented to many celebrities and the biggest problem is that usually they want their assistant to pick up the car, which we don't allow. Come to think of it, one of Bieber's of-age handlers may have legally rented the car for him."
3432,Advertisement
3433,
3434,"What that would mean is the car was totally legally rented, but Bieber wasn't named to drive it. It makes sense and is entirely plausible. That becomes the problem of the rental company, according to Farah:"
3435,"The law varies by state but technically anyone under 21 shouldn't be driving even if someone of age signs for the car. It would be the burden of the rental company to prosecute that though, as long as the car isn't stolen the cops wouldn't care. I'm sure the rental company will keep their deposit but it seems likely to pursue charges against Justin at this point simply for being behind the wheel, as long as the car wasn't damaged."
3436,"So how hard is it to get into a rental exotic? If you have money, and this won't be a shocker, it's not that difficult. But it can get difficult if something goes wrong."

3468,"The sheer volume of things that are measured in terms of the classic VW Beetle is staggering. From whale hearts to heavy artillery, one object is used more often than any other to give a perspective of size and weight. The Beetle's role as a standard unit of measurement is an unsung achievement. Let's take care of that. "
3469,"""E. coli … moves its whole length in two nanoseconds. If it were the size of a Volkswagen, it would be going four times the speed of light."" "
3470,"
The classic VW Bug, with its nearly immutable design, has been driven all over the world and all over the movies for the better part of a century. You'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who couldn't pick its shape out of a lineup or, more realistically, a weedy Southern California backyard. "
3471,"So its not surprising the Bug, so imbedded in our culture, is an object of reference. If you need to describe something about size of a Volkswagen to someone who can't see it, well, you know they're going know size of the Bug.
What's odd is how the VW absolutely eclipses all other objects of comparison. "
3472,"Sure, things are judged the size of a Buick or a 747, and maybe, for bonus points, your math teacher asked how many basketballs or dollar bills put end to end you need to reach this or that. It's true Quarter Pounders and other McDonald's menu items are forever being stacked to the moon. But these things don't compete with the massive number or variety of comparisons made to the VW. "
3473,Advertisement
3474,
3475,It's the measure of things. It is the ruler itself.
3476,"Most other objects are limited in their comparative function. For example, Mack trucks are exclusively used to describe objects we are to think of as large. But Volkswagens are used to describe things as too small and too large and, more importantly, as they really are."
3477,Advertisement
3478,
3479,"As such, science writers make the most use of the vehicle, deeming everything in or from space, made or conceived by man or God to be about the size of a Bug.

3484,Beloved Jalopnik writer and Bug owner Jason Torchinsky once suggested to me that so many spacecraft share the VW size because of the commonality of the delivery system — the cargo bays of the launch craft are similar in dimension. Why the cargo bays would be the size of a Volkswagen he didn't explain. 
3485,"It doesn't matter.
As seen in the table, people writing on every topic compare their subjects to the Volkswagen. The comparisons are pervasive, diverse, and at times inappropriate, useless, and forced — leading to the impression that many writers feel the examination of a subject would be incomplete without a Bug comparison."
3486,"Some subjects even appear to require it. With hundreds of thousands of Google references to the size of a blue whale's heart being that of a Volkswagen, I think I would have to be a genius or a fool to attempt describing it any other way."
3487,Advertisement
3488,
3489,"This intense desire to make the comparison manifests itself most plainly when an author, struggling with an object impossibly out of line with the VW's scale, makes do by referring to only a portion of the vehicle, turning the Bug into a divisible unit of measure.   "
3490,"You already think about manatees as about half the size of a VW. Who doesn't? But do you think of mounted bison heads the same way? Well, you should. Find those references helpful? All right, but is ""half the size of a VW glove box""really a known quantity? Is ""the size of a VW bucket seat"" especially useful, as opposed to some other bucket seat?  "
3491,"When divisibility doesn't work, writers switch to weight to find equilibrium with the Bug:"
3492,"""Each of the [USS Wisconsin's] dozen 16-inch/50 caliber guns can fire a 1,900-pound projectile, equivalent to the weight of a VW Beetle, 23 nautical miles."""
3493,Advertisement
3494,
3495,"These weight comparisons prove less common, presumably because a limited number of people can heft the weight of a Beetle in their head, as you would, say, a bowling ball.  
"
3496,"So why the persistent need to describe objects in Bug-terms? Is it the fan-boyish love of the brand (possibly found more prominently in free-spirited ""writer types"")? Is it just the iconic stature of the car? Is it the snowballing popularity of the metaphor itself? "
3497,"Maybe it's all of these.
Or maybe something more is going on.
Perhaps we're missing a unit of measure. Maybe the size in question is particularly useful for illustration and classification— an expression of the Goldilocks Principle as applied to measurement. The Bug is not too big or small. It's just right. It filled a descriptive void."

3729,
3730,Let me start by saying that I haven't seen the new Clubman in person yet. But our European bureau chief Máté Petrány has because he's in Geneva. He took these photos. 
3731,"""It's long,"" he told me when I asked him about it. "
3732,"Also, having driven the all-new 2014 Mini Cooper this car is based on, I kind of have a rough idea of how big it is. This one is about a foot longer than the new Cooper, and it's longer than even the current Countryman. "
3733,Advertisement
3734,
3735,
3736,"I totally get the idea of what Mini is doing with this new Clubman, whose production version will probably be very close to this concept. There are owners who swear by the last Clubman, saying its hinged rear doors and third door make the small car vastly more practical. "
3737,Advertisement
3738,
3739,"This new Clubman is a natural evolution of that ""longer, more practical Cooper"" concept in the sense that it adds an extra set of doors. The 2014 Cooper is longer than the old one, so if the Clubman is longer than that, it may as well just get an extra set of doors. Why not? "
3740,"I'll also say — and I may catch hell for this — that if you ignore Mini's heritage for a moment, this is not an unattractive car at all. It's actually a decent design. It's cute and lively, fun and practical. It looks better than the Countryman and makes infinitely more sense as a vehicle than the two-door Paceman crossover. "
3741,Advertisement
3742,
3743,"I just wonder if Mini as a whole is moving in a direction that's too big, that's all. A new Countryman is likely in the pipeline, so I expect it will get even bigger than this."
3744,"Small has its advantages. I'll take a small car over a big one almost any day of the week provided it has a decent amount of power. I live in a big, traffic-choked city, so I like my car because it can dart around bigger cars and I can park it anywhere. (It goes without saying that it's pretty fun to drive, too.) "
3745,"I always thought that was part of the appeal for Mini owners, but at the last Mini drive I went on they told me their buyers wanted bigger vehicles. "

3747,
3748,"I liked the 2014 Cooper quite a bit. When I reviewed I it wrote that in many ways, it's the best Mini ever made, especially in terms of comfort, technology and overall fit-and-finish. It's still a small car, too, and still fun to drive. But I just didn't like that it was bigger and slightly less tossable than its predecessors. "
3749,"So I feel like the ""Mini is losing its Mini-ness"" is a valid criticism and not just Internet noise. I also wonder how much the owners who love driving their current Clubmans (Clubmen?) will feel about driving this bigger car. "
3750,Advertisement
3751,
3752,"At the same time, it's not entirely Mini's fault that these things are getting bigger. They have tougher safety standards to meet, and they're also supposedly building the cars they say their customers want. They've definitely had some misfires with their current lineup, so can you blame them for going a little more mainstream with stuff like this? And to be fair, they probably wouldn't be getting this much criticism it their name wasn't ""Mini."" "

I'd venture to guess both groups of people exist out there, and there's probably some overlap too, but the new Clubman feels aimed squarely at the first group. "
3757,Which isn't to say the new Clubman isn't fun to drive. I don't know if it is or not because I haven't driven it yet. No one has. I'll hold off final judgement until I do get my turn behind the wheel. Maybe then I'll be able to sort out how I feel about this thing.

3828,"When I was a kid, there always seemed to be someone in the neighborhood building some wonderfully absurd kit car on an old VW chassis. That basic VW platform was the basis for so many DIY car projects. Sadly, there's nothing like that now. But maybe a new open-souce car called the Tabby will change that. "
3829,"I really love the idea of a viable open-source car platform: something that's cheap, relatively easy to build in a normal backyard or garage, and actually usable when completed. The old Beetle chassis/drivetrain combo is a pretty hard standard to beat, and it's still my benchmark for future DIY car platforms. You could find them anywhere, it contained pretty much everything you needed (suspension, transmission, electricals, seat mounting, body hard points, etc), it was cheap, and the end result of your home-built project, whether it looked like a vintage MG or a really tiny big rig, was something you could register and drive on the road."
3830,
3831,"With unibody cars all but universal now, there really isn't a good replacement for the old VW pans (until I can convince Tesla to sell their chassis alone — more on that soon), so I'm really happy to see projects like OSVehicle. The fundamental goal of the OSVehicle project seems to be to make the vehicular equivalent of an Arduino, the small, single-board computer that has been the key component in so many interesting DIY robotics, computing, art, and other projects for the past few years."
3832,Advertisement
3833,
3834,"The OSVehicle is, basically, a basic flat-pack very small car/quadracycle chassis, along with all the freely available plans and 3D models associated with it. Here's what they say themselves:"
3835,"OSV is born – Open Source Vehicle, the concept of industralizable open source hardware designed
for the automotive industry. From now on, anyone, with OSV, will be able to create his or her own
personalized vehicle: manufacturers, automotive companies, but also designers, makers, and
enthusiasts. "
3836,"OSV is based on a universal platform that anyone can modify or improve at will, to build
the vehicle that best satisfies his needs.
Tabby – this is what the first universal chassis is called – is the heart and basis of OSV. 100% versatile
and flexible, it allows the assembly of any type of vehicle, with 2 or 3 wheels, city cars, golf carts,
street food vehicles, off-road. "
3837,"One of the main features of Tabby is that it can be assembled in less than one hour. It comes flat
packed in easily transportable crates and doesn't need special tools for assembly. Designed with
versatility as key element, Tabby can be made longer and shorter to create vehicles with 2 or 4 seats
or increase its cargo capacity."
3838,Advertisement
3839,
3840,"That ""assembly in an hour"" part is very interesting, and happily they include a time-lapse to prove it, albeit in a nice, clean, orderly shop:"
3841,
3842,"The Tabby seems like a pretty well-designed platform, and actually manages to stick close to the layout of that old VW Type I standard: flat platform chassis with a rear-mounted engine. The biggest issue with the Tabby as it is right now is one of scale: it's really more of a quadracycle than a full car. Those are legal for non-licesnsed and young drivers in places like France and other parts of the EU, but in the US these things would not likely be street legal."
3843,Advertisement
3844,
3845,"This makes sense, from a regulatory standpoint. By not making them ""real"" cars, they can avoid the more difficult crash-testing, airbag, and other regulations that would make building something like this in a backyard prohibitive. So, while it's disappointing, I get why they went that route."
3846,"The Tabby has a choice of three engine types: all electric, electric/gas hybrid, where the gas engine seems to act primarily as a range extender, and an all ICE setup. None of the engines are all that powerful — they top out at about 33 HP — but for the application they're more than adequate. The ICE engines range from 50cc to 250cc and look to be single-cylinder units. The electric motor drivetrain seems to be the only one available at the moment, with the hybrid and ICE coming soon."
3847,Advertisement
3848,
3849,"A road-legal (well, based on those EU quadracycle versions of road legal) version of the platform has been developed, called Urban Tabby. Essentially, it takes the basic 2-seater Tabby platform and adds a body, lights, and other requirements for road legality, which don't seem to include a windshield. The result looks a bit like some of the Smart concept cars we've seen in basic shape, which, given the similarity of the drivetrain layout, isn't shocking."
3850,"You can currently order 2 or 4 seat chassis, wheels, seats, the electric motor and associated battery pack and wiring harness, etc. It looks like the total package for a functioning, drivable electric chassis would cost somewhere around $4500. It's a very interesting package, but at that price and without the ability to get it street legal in the US and with the limited utility/speed, I think most DIY car folks would likely try and find a used something to hack up into a project car."
3851,Advertisement
3852,
3853,"I think the fundamental idea is very sound, and I'd really love to see this concept developed further. We're getting to a point where the idea of a modular, DIY car isn't such an absurd proposition, but to make it work in the US there'd need to be some regulatory slack cut. Ideally, there'd be a provision for homebuilt/experimental cars, much like how the FAA has an 'experimental' classification for aircraft."
3854,"If there was such an 'experimental automotive' classification, with full acknowledgement of safety risks and special insurance or whatever, that allowed people to actually register and drive their home-built cars, that would really go a long way. While it's tempting to use the Arduino as an example, the differences in a tool that can let you tweet instructions to your personal massager and something that can possibly kill you on the highway at 70 MPH are pretty big."
3855,"Still, even with the significant increase in risk, cost, and resources to make a vehicle as opposed to electronic devices, I can still see a future renaissance in home-built creative vehicles and the associated industries to support them happening. With any luck, it'll feel like 1979 all over again, with neighborhood crackpots putting giant fiberglass whale bodies or tiny, immaculate RVs or replicas of long-forgotten cars on underpowered, rear-engine chassis."
3856,"I want you to imagine, if you can, the worst airline passenger in the history of aviation. A man so annoying that flight attendants had to boil a pot of water in case they needed it to defend themselves from his antics. That man, according to federal authorities, is Lemar Sheron Rogers. "

3858,"The Oregonian reports that on Tuesday, Rogers was a passenger on a Southwest flight to Sacramento when he forced the plane to make an emergency landing in Portland where he was arrested. "
3859,"According to a criminal complaint filed in U.S District court, Rogers barked at an attendant who told him to stow his bags and scared a woman and her kid into moving away from him. He then demanded three glasses of wine at once. "
3860,That's when things got weird. 
3861,"""Get the (expletive) out of my face,"" he sneered. Then he said, ""Jesus loves you,"" according to documents."

3863,"A flight attendant became so frightened that she asked another passenger to help her restrain Rogers if he became violent, according to court records. Another attendant boiled a pot of water to use against the suspect if he tried to approach the flight deck, the records show."

3871,"Lamborghini is most known for their ridiculous mid-engined supercars, but people forget that they've dabbled in all sorts of genres over the decades. The first Lambos were front-engined GTs; there was the famous Hummer-esque LM002; and then there was this. "
3872,"This is the Lamborghini Portofino. It's a sedan, but it has four scissor doors in case there's any doubt as to its Lamborghini heritage. It also has a 3.5-liter V8 stuffed behind the back seats. "
3873,"And if you take a close look at it, you might start to think, ""Huh... that looks a lot like the Dodge Intrepid and the other Chrysler LH cars from the 90s."" There's a reason for that! "
3874,"(Welcome to Long Lost Concept Cars, our semi-regular series on Fridays where we highlight amazing concepts from years past that never made it to production — but maybe should have.)"
3875,Advertisement
3876,
3877,"You could say that technically, the Portofino never really should have had a Lamborghini badge at all, since it started life as a Chrysler. Though the Portofino debuted at the 1987 Frankfurt Motor Show, it started life a year earlier under Chrysler designer Kevin Verduyn. He called it the Chrysler Navajo, but it never moved beyond the clay model stage. "
3878,"Then in 1987, for reasons known only to him and perhaps his spiritual advisor, Chrysler head honcho Lee Iacocca spearheaded the company's purchase of the perpetually financially troubled Lamborghini. (Actually, the word at the time was that Iacocca wanted Chrysler to shed its blue collar image and go more international; these days, it's the Italians that own them.) "
3879,Advertisement
3880,
3881,"According to Car Design News, then-Chrysler executive vice president Bob Lutz saw a lot of potential in Verduyn's design and ordered a few tweaks to be made so it could show up as a Lamborghini concept in Frankfurt. "
3882,"The design may have been all-Chrysler, but it had Lamborghini guts through and through. While it never saw production in this form, its eventual final version would have a huge impact on the way cars were designed. "
3883,"What was it? A four door, four seat, concept car built on a stretched Lamborghini Jalpa chassis."
3884,Advertisement
3885,
3886,What were the specs? The Portofino was mid-engined and rear-wheel drive and boasted the 3.5-liter SOHC V8 also borrowed from the Jalpa.  It also had a five-speed manual gearbox. It's not clear if any zero to 60 mph times or other specs were ever quoted. 
3887,"What else made it special? The car is most significant because its design featured a cabin that was stretched to the front and rear with wheels moved close to the corners, maximizing interior space in a way that was later termed ""cab forward."" This design would form the genesis of the Chrysler LH-platform cars of the 90s and 2000s like the Intrepid, Chrysler LHS and Eagle Vision (Bonus points to anyone who remembers the Eagle Vision.) "
3888,Advertisement
3889,
3890,"What did it look like on the inside? Roomy, thanks to the cab forward design! The long center console didn't make it to the later cars, but the rest of it looks very handsome and progressive for its time. "
3891,"Did it actually run? No clue. Given that it was based on a Jalpa chassis and had that car's engine, maybe. "
3892,Advertisement
3893,
3894,"Was it ever planned for production? Car Design News reports that the folks within Lamborghini were unimpressed with the design and called it the ""Big Potato."" That's mean. But it didn't matter what they thought, because Chrysler loved the design and so did the auto industry as a whole. The Portofino garnered several awards and was greenlit for production as a Chrysler. "
3895,"Should it have been produced? As a Lamborghini, with the mid-engine layout, scissor doors and the manual? Who knows. It certainly would have been outrageous enough for the time. If Lamborghini could make their crazy 4x4 military-looking LM002, then why not this? "
3896,Advertisement
3897,
3898,"But then again, the Portofino did see the light of day in 1993, just with drastic changes to make it palatable and produceable as a mainstream, midsize family car. The mid-engine architecture was dumped in favor of a front-engine, front-wheel drive platform developed from AMC/Renault/Eagle. "
3899,"I feel like the LH cars sometimes don't get enough credit. They were sleek, high-tech and extremely innovative for their time, and they were enough of a sales success to help Chrysler through some tough financial times in the 1990s. The platform stuck around until the mid-2000s too, so they got some mileage out of it. "
3900,It is kind of funny to think that the Dodge Intrepid driven by your middle-manager dad back in the day started life with a Lamborghini engine behind its seats. Those cars ended up with a more interesting heritage than most family sedans get.

Like the current car it will be all-wheel drive, but it will lose its manual transmission in favor of a seven-speed dual-clutch gearbox."
3908,
3909,"That's kind of a shame. Both the current V8 and V10 R8s still have a manual gearbox available, and it's a gated one too, one of the last few out there. But with the Huracan going DSG-only, it makes sense. "

4087,"Now, you might be asking yourself what, precisely, a beater is. Basically, it's a crap car you buy without really having to care what kind of shape it ends up in. It's a car to thrash without worrying about the paint, about curbing the wheels. A truck you can jump in a field without worrying if the suspension gets shot. A car you can park by feel in the office lot. Ideally, it's a car that's so dirt cheap you don't mind leaving it in bad neighborhoods with the doors unlocked and the windows down. It's a car to beat on, hence the name."

4092,"Your Jalopnik staff spent about 30 minutes compiling this list of beaters — and then we spent hours arguing over it. Chairs were thrown, blood was spilled, interns started crying, and Matt threatened to have the Foxtrot Alpha guy call in an air strike on our homes. But in the end, after several cases of Brefass Scotch and some awkwardly intense man-hugs, we settled on the chart you see here."

4095,I should say that there are two cars notable for their absence here: the BMW E30 and the NA Mazda Miata. And there are good reasons why those two cars aren't in this challenge. 
4096,"First of all, let me say that everyone knows both the NA Miata and the E30 are excellent low-cost cars. They drive great, they look great, they make you feel good owning them, and they're (reasonably) reliable. The problem is that everyone knows how good the E30 and NA Miata are. Maybe five or six years ago you could get a nice E30 for five hundred bucks and enter it in the 24 Hours of LeMons or Rally Mexico or whatever. "
4097,"But now if you own a halfway decent E30, you can expect strangers to shove four grand in your face every time you pull up to an auto parts store. Both the E30 and the NA Miata are going to owners who are nice people, people who will follow strict maintenance protocols and wax the paint, and restore them. This means these late '80s/early '90s wonders just aren't beaters anymore. They're simply nice old cars. They great, but they just don't belong in the running."

4106,It's not necessarily the best car in the world. The trans is crap when it's cold or when you're driving slow. The LCD screens suck. The key is made of crystal and costs thousands if you break it.

4108,"The 155-mph, luxury-outfitted, carbon-fiber Superbus is the product of Netherland's Delft University and, maybe, a few trips to Amsterdam. With 800-hp on tap, the all-electric bus aims to revolutionize public transportation. And it works! Video proof below."

4111,"If Ferdinand Piëch hadn't set his engineers on a course for 1,000 horsepower and 250 mph (Hello? Bugatti Veyron?), sports-car science projects like the Porsche 918 Spyder might not exist today. But he did, and it does. What's the 918 like to drive? Let's find out."
4112,
4113,"(Full disclosure: Porsche wanted us to drive the 918 Spyder so bad, they flew me to Austin, Texas for a few laps around the Circuit of The Americas and some road driving. The laps were led by factory driver Patrick Long in a 911 Turbo S. Later on, there was brisket.)"
4114,"An impossible turmoil of activity is going on beneath the Porsche 918 Spyder's skin. Sensors are gathering data. Microprocessors are firing. Countless lines of software code are cascading like great, nerdy waterfalls. Actuators are sorting out instructions and converting energy into motion. "
4115,And we haven't even left pit lane.
4116,"It's hard to conceptualize the Porsche 918 Spyder as a car at all. A few years ago, a vehicle with this engineering spec would have been like the Mars rover, or a napkin scribble in the pocket of a science-fiction novelist."
4117,Advertisement
4118,
4119,"Think about this. The 918 gets from 0 to 125 quicker than it took a Porsche 944 to get to 60. It has a plug-in, hybrid-electric power puzzle that's taken 50 engineers half a decade to solve. And the only production car quicker than the Porsche 918 Spyder around the Nürburgring — at 6 minutes 57 seconds — is a race car with turn signals pasted on. This car, if you haven't heard, is something very special."
4120,"As we roll out on to the COTA tarmac in all-electric mode, there's a moment when the whirring of the motor suggests we've merged into Logan's Run. I'm enjoying the torque and a pleasant 1970s sci-fi reverie, but that ends abruptly as the accelerator reaches half-way to the floor. That's when a piercing roar erupts behind my head and I'm back in the present. ""Oh, right,"" I say to Dr. Frank Walliser — development team leader behind the 918 — who's riding right seat, ""It has one of those."""
4121,Advertisement
4122,
4123,"Yes it does have one of those — a short-stroke, dry sump 4.6-liter direct-injection V8 related to the one that once powered the RS Spyder Le Mans prototype, producing 608 horsepower at 8600 rpm (the redline's at 9150). It also has two electric drive systems, a hybrid module bolted to the transmission producing 154 hp and an electric motor on the front axle, producing 127 hp. Both motors can decouple from the drivetrain, with the front motor clutching out at 146 mph to prevent the single-ratio gearing from overspeeding. It took thousands of development hours and years of testing and tuning to get those discrepant power sources to work together so well as a unit, the motors filling in torque as the V8 revs up to peak."
4124,"Walliser's deep-water calm and boundless knowledge of the 918's systems are welcome for these hot laps, during which we'll test out the 918 in all drivetrain modes. We're hunting down Porsche factory driver Patrick Long, who's leading in a 911 Turbo S, itself no slouch in the acceleration department. There's a lot here to wrap my head around, not the least of which is how the hell I keep ending up crawling into the tailpipe of a Le Mans winner in a really fast car. "

4126,
4127,"There are new terms to learn, like ""motor generator units"" and ""energy management systems"" and ""power scheduling"" — the optimal combination of electric and internal combustion power for a given performance level. Measurements like kilowatt-hours and mega joules and number of drivetrain data labels. ""Snuggle up to my CAN bus,"" the 918 seems to say, ""You'll be intellectually enriched by the pillow talk."""
4128,"The Porsche 918 has 40,000 types of powertrain data running through a massive quantity of ECUs; all together, around three times as many as a typical Porsche car, or about twice as many as the Panamera S E-Hybrid, with which the 918 shares a powertrain methodology, if not its actual parts. "
4129,Advertisement
4130,
4131,"We've left E-Power mode — where the electric motor takes precedence, and the active aerodynamics fold up for the least amount of drag — and are now in Hybrid mode. The engine and motors are working alternately with fuel economy in mind. As we move to Hybrid Sport mode, the engine and motors are now working together, with the V8 taking the lead and the e-motors providing torque fill-in and boost, while balancing regeneration to keep a constant state of charge. When we go to Race Hybrid mode, all the stops come off, the motors provide maximum output and the V8 charges the battery more intensely. The active aero bits, like the rear wing and diffuser channels underneath the body deploy for highest downforce."
4132,"On the last lap, I plunge the ""Hot Lap"" button, and every drop of juice zaps the motors. There's an unreal sense of space-time collapse, as we take a moment before the COTA back straight to give Long some distance, then punch it and catch his Turbo S by mid-wall at 165. There are no words. "
4133,"The systems work together precisely; I'm only conscious of the accelerator and brake, not the internal machinations, and how intensely fast and strangely nimble this space capsule is, and how it seems to leap off a slow corner. It's an entirely new realm of speed, and yet there are no new modulations for a driver to learn. Still, there's a sensation that lots of things are happening somewhere. Things that are helping. Things mortals don't need to know about."

4135,
4136,"The 918 performs flawlessly in that all-important track test: How long after taking an orientation lap around an unfamiliar track does it take for a driver to feel comfortable banging on it? The answer is two laps. By the third, we're a getting a more consistent view of the Turbo S's tail, hanging it out a little to feel the limits of the mechanical grip and how easy it is to merely countersteer and get back in line."
4137,"You really have to empathize with a driver like Long. A ferocious competitor and racing tactician, he's had to put up with the indignity of hack journalistos throwing away corners, then screaming up on his tail down the next straight. As astoundingly quick as the Turbo S is in the hands of a pro, the 918 truly is in another stratosphere."

4141,"In fact, the Porsche 918 is a technical exercise and an art object, and a very enjoyable high-performance automobile. It, and its Le Mans prototype cousin, the Porsche 919, would probably have had Smith quitting motorsports for badminton."
4142,"But while the Porsche 918 may not be a pure sports car, in the Smithian sense, it is an astoundingly well-executed engineering effort that combines a range of technologies that make us faster, safer drivers, and energizes the conversation about how sports cars, and motorsports broadly, fit into a future in which reducing carbon energy use and emissions are sacrosanct. That's no small feat. "

It's got clean, unfussy lines, gorgeously curvy wheel arches at the front and rear and a tight, muscular stance. It's the least design-forward among its peers, but in a good way. "
4150,"Consider too the design in context of packaging: Fitting in all the systems and subsystems, dealing with the extra weight of motors and battery packs, and having the finished product look like a sports car, not a mail truck. It's a win."

(It's always fun to see the tach pinned at zero during electric-only driving.) As typical for Porsche, it's clean and tidy and functional and not dressy. Want a custom Italian kidskin interior? That's what custom orders are for."

The sensation in the pit of the stomach during a traction-control launch is like a deep gut implosion matched with instant panic. It's probably a lot like BASE jumping, only sitting in a chair. The 918 hooks up and blasts forward with such violence, it's as if the world is ending, and it's taking physics with it."

Any concerns about and awkward threshold of braking force between hydraulic and energy recuperation have been addressed by smart kids with laptops. The algorithmic blending of systems, as the electric motors provide 0.5g of braking force off-throttle and up to 240 kW of regenerative power, works so well that there's nothing but good pedal feel and nice sharp braking force on the track. On the road, you have to get used to hearing new sounds — scratching and pinging and blooping — but the feel and action is natural."

4168,"The most astonishing thing about the 918 out on public roads is how unremarkable it feels. In fact, in hybrid mode, with Porsche's PASM active suspension handling real highway conditions, the 918 feels almost too much like a regular car. Unless you plant the accelerator and wake up that Le Mans engine, or start making wide swings on the steering wheel, there's no clue the 918 is a super-sports car at all. If you're looking for a street car that pings your sensors, this isn't it. But creeping along silently through the streets of a city that demands stiff congestion charges? This is your supercar."

But the potent combination of active rear steering, torque vectoring, massive front grip and a staggeringly low polar moment of inertia produce phenomenal turn-initiation response in slow corners and simply unreal stability in 120 mph, off-camber bends.

4173,"It's not a pure experience, but it's so well calibrated and sorted, you get all the right feelings as a driver, but at a level far above what you'd be doing in a straight mechanical beast. High-speed corners can be taken quicker than you'd think, with plenty of downforce and mechanical grip from the bespoke Michelins (265 front, 325 rear). Corrections are easily controlled with throttle and countersteer. Well done, engineers."

4177,"Porsche's seven-speed PDK remains the state of the art in dual-clutch transmissions. In automatic mode, it predicts the proper gear on track alarmingly well. Shifting manually while in sport or race mode, you get very quick shifts, and the joy of hearing the V8 scream up from 8,000 to 9,000 in a magnificent motoring moment. This is a car in which a manual just doesn't make technological sense. And when you're in the moment, with sparks flying and engine wailing and arms flailing, you don't miss it."

4181,"There's so much to play with in the 918, messing with it all is like doing Disney World in one day. There are new kinds of gauges to learn, with LEDs surrounding the tach to indicate power flow and delivery. There are the power modes, themselves, that warrant constant futzing. You can tune in multifunction displays to watch the interplay of engine and motor and battery, G meters, plus music and apps and smartphone integration with a good looking HTML5 interface. This is a nerd's paradise."

It sounds warm and detail-rich if you're noodling around town, though when the aggro V8 bursts through the cabin, it's pretty much a complete takeover. The engine itself is a bit too gravelly to make the list of best-sounding V8s."

4189,"How do you determine ""value"" for a $900,000 super-sports car? Let's break it down. If you're judging value by the sheer amount of materials science, mechanical and electrical engineering, motorsports know-how and software calibration that's gone into making the 918 a cohesive performance vehicle, I think you're getting away cheap. "
4190,"If you're judging how well Porsche engineers executed an engineering brief that unites seemingly at-odds goals — fuel efficiency, road manners, high-performance capability and visceral excitement — then again, you're getting your money's worth, though you'd have to want to see those goals united."
4191,"If you're judging value on the manner in which the 918 places absolutely stupefying track performance in the hands of an amateur driver, again you win. Of course, if you're isolating performance-per-dollar, perhaps it's a wash, considering you could put a 911 Turbo S, a Ferrari 458 Speciale, a Tesla Model S and every 911 GT3 version going back three generations in your garage for the same outlay.

Blue-sky projects are important for the advance of technology, especially in automotive, but unlike in aerospace — where public money pays for the moonshots — it's car buyers with the income and interest that must pick up the tab. For them, the combination of tech and streetability and batshit performance could be the ultimate draw. "

I personally can tell what someone drives simply by looking at their keys and registration card. A guy on an Amazon user's forum claims he can do it based on what you type."
4201,"Here's what the guy, Christopher, has to say about it:"
4202,"Hey guys, I've always been able to tell what kind of car someone drives almost immediately upon sight - it's pretty amazingly how correct I generally am. Obviously here I can't see you so I'd like to see if my ability would still work or not. Please tell me one thing about yourself, whatever you'd like, and I'll see if I can tell you what type of car you drive. Please follow-up and let me know if I got it right or wrong.Thanks!"

4205,"The front-engined, V8-powered Porsche 928 was intended to be an eventual replacement for the iconic but aging 911, but Porsche-philes everywhere made it clear that they prefer their flagship car has the engine in the back. That didn't stop the 928 from being great, and a lot of people long for a new one. "
4206,"Here is what a possible modern Porsche 928 could look like, according to French designer Anthony Colard. He calls it the 921 Vision Concept, and he cooked it up as part of a job application for Porsche. I like the name because it's in keeping with modern Porsche models like the 991 and 981 Boxster/Cayman. "
4207,"I also like it because it's gorgeous. It's a sleek, modern update of the 928 coupe with an unmistakably Porsche front end. Anthony writes that he sees it as a 400 horsepower V8 autobahn cruiser. From his site:"
4208,"The front end is very tidy and designed with very few lines, the volumes yet express strength and refinement with precise detailing in the lamps to show the technological quality of the car. The rear echoes back to the original 928 design with its very specific glasshouse, here now with a floating A-pillar to emphasize the curvature and continuity between windshield and side windows."
4209,"The tail shows its Porsche DNA by mixing the original 928 recessed lamp design with the new Porsche 991 lamps. The lower valance stays simple, integrating in orderly fashion the number plate and reflectors above a double exhaust diffuser."
4210,Advertisement
4211,
4212,"I'm a fan of the 928, so I'd love to see it make a comeback, even though I wonder where it would really fit into the Porsche lineup these days. Would it run the risk of stealing sales from the 911 if it was made to be too good, the same reason they don't put turbos on the Cayman? On the other hand, I feel like at least some buyers would be down with a Panamera-based coupe, especially if it was made to be more of a GT car than the 911. "
4213,"All I know is this: Someone out there needs to hire Anthony Colard if Porsche hasn't done so. This car looks lovely, and it's something I'd be more than happy to see on the road. "

4283,Let me start off by saying fuck the Ferrari 250 GTO.
4284,Fuck its multimillion dollar pricetag. Fuck the old backwards-looking farts who drool over these things. Fuck them and their nostalgia for the years when this not-at-all groundbreaking car won some races.
4285,"The only reason people give a crap about this car is because it has a prancing horse on the front and because it won its races in the early '60s, before the World Got Scary and when the radio played the songs you still listen to on your Golden Oldies station that plays Van Halen now what's going on with that?"
4286,"The world shoots too many eyeballs on this car, all fueled by the millions and millions of pounds and euros that speculators light on fire at its altar."
4287,"But hey, it's still a gorgeous, front-engined V12 racecar, one of the very last of its breed."
4288,

4292,"Stare at its curves  and be welcomed back to a time when the world was still simple and all the colonies hadn't revolted yet and Watergate hadn't happened and nobody was off at Vietnam and we could beat the Ruskies and everything was technicolor wonderful. Let that all fall into the V12 wail and understand why people shell out fortunes to 'own' this disposable, obsolete machine."
4293,"Forget your Ferrari pilots, the happiest driver I've seen in ages was behind the wheel of an old minivan."
4294,"At a rally, after the last race cars go by, a set of big 'sweep' trucks run the stage to tow out any stuck/crashed vehicles. After the race cars and the sweep trucks go by, then come a few officials' cars to check on everything and not long after the road is opened back up to the public. But there is a short window in there between the final officials and the first locals."
4295,"It's a moment of absolute automotive heaven - clear, closed roads."
4296,"The window is usually filled with rally marshals keeping order on the stage returning back to rally headquarters, with media people driving off to the next stage, with spectators filing away to the next viewer area."
4297,"I was at the Empire State Performance Rally in Rock Hill, New York over the weekend. It's a one-of-a-kind event here in America, as it's the only current stage rally run on tarmac. That is, it's run on paved roads. That is, it's run on country roads snaking straight through towns and developments about an hour and a half outside of New York City."
4298,Advertisement
4299,
4300,"I'd volunteered at one of the stages, and the last of the two dozen or so rally cars flies by, ten feet from me and at nearly a hundred miles an hour. And then the sweep trucks fly by. And then the officials' cars fly by. There's a bit of a breeze brushing the budding trees overlooking the lazy river next to the road and puffy clouds wander across the sky in and out of the sun's way."
4301,"And I hear a roar growing louder, and I swear it's another rally car. I hop up to look and see why another racer is coming by after all the sweep vehicles when a huge '90s minivan screams past, engine blaring. The window is down and in an instant I see the driver beaming at the wheel. And he screams out ""Woo hoo!!"" as the old box on wheels tears by."
4302,"The road ahead of him is one of the nicest I've seen, with rises and dips and flowing curves. And there were no cops, and no cars coming the other way."

4306,So forget all your high-priced exotics you can never really exploit. Happiness is a closed road and a minivan.

4312,"""Who pays $70,000 for a Hyundai?"" This was the question that was on my mind the entire week I had a 2014 Hyundai Equus in my garage. The Equus presents a real conundrum. It's either a complete joke or the luxury sedan bargain of the century. "
4313,"(Full disclosure: Hyundai needed me to drive an Equus so badly that they dropped one off at my place with a full tank of gas and told me to go gorillas. I didn't play with the iPad because they don't come with those anymore. Matt has had also two different Equusi (Equuses?) but hasn't reviewed either of them, so it fell to me to do it.)"
4314,"See, the Hyundai Genesis sedan I get. The Genesis is meant to show the world that the Koreans can make a car that runs with the BMW 5-Series and Mercedes E-Class,with power, rear-wheel drive and loads of features all for a fraction of the price. Luxury and performance, starting at $38,000 (more if you want a V8). It makes sense. It is also way better than you think it is."
4315,But maybe the Equus — Hyundai's competitor to the 7-Series and S-Class — is pushing that formula further than it can go. Does the car have any credibility as long as it shares a badge with the lowly Accent and Veloster? Would it be more believable if Hyundai had its own dedicated luxury brand and the Equus fit under their umbrella? Is Hyundai asking too much here?
4316,Advertisement
4317,
4318,"There's no question that when you buy the fancy German cars, or a Lexus LS 460, that the badge changes the way people see you. It creates an aura of wealth and success and good choices; this is why a lot of people buy them in the first place, and why the CLA250 is selling so well, even though despite its badge it's hardly the most premium-feeling car on the market."

4322,"Stuff like four cameras for parking, video screens mounted on the front headrests, rear heated and cooled seats, a center console in the back so the passengers can control the navigation, music and DVD player, and a reclining option that turns the passenger's side back seat into an amazing place to take a nap. Stuff. "
4323,"The Equus is, basically, a limousine, an S-Class for South Korean oligarchs who wanted an S-Class but preferred something from the home market instead. "
4324,"But is it any good? Well, it's quite impressive in some areas and falls short in others. I'm not ready to declare Equus the next Lexus, but it's one hell of an effort."

As I mentioned earlier, you get a dedicated hidden center console back there for controlling the navigation, climate controls, rear seat gizmos and display screens mounted on the front seats."
4336,"But is it all up to par with Lexus and the Germans? Not quite. The wood is real but it looks tacky, and the plastic buttons feel pretty cut-rate. Still, while it's not the best out there, it's convincingly premium.  "

4343,"It's not what I'd call fast, but it's not slow either. It's just kind of lazy. The V8 provides more than adequate juice around town or on the highway, but don't expect to win many drag races. The Equus is built to cruise, not race, and that's likely what its buyers want. Tests I've seen put the zero to 60 mph time in the mid-5 second range; that seems a tad optimistic to me. "
4344,The car's acceleration is also hampered a bit by its transmission. I'll get to that in a bit.

It may not be a performance car, but there's something to be said for getting in this car after a long day at work and just sort of gliding all the way home. It's an even better feeling if you're a passenger. "
4353,Handling - 5/10

4355,
4356,"The Equus is a better car to ride in than to drive, and nowhere is this more apparent than its handling. Its partial-electric steering rack lacks any feel whatsoever, and it is so light and so boosted that it barely feels connected to the car at all. Body roll is in bountiful supply as well. In this area, the Equus just comes up short against the Germans, or even Lexus. "

4359,
4360,"Here's what you do: switch the Equus into ""sport mode,"" which ostensibly sharpens the throttle response and stiffens the steering. Then stand on the accelerator pedal when you're on cruising on the highway. The next step is to wait for the 8-speed automatic transmission to kick down to the appropriate gear, and once it takes its sweet time getting there, it gives you the acceleration you want. Then it hangs at redline for a while before upshifting. In the normal driving setting, it isn't much better."

4400,
4401,"USA Today has some details on the plan Sergio Marchionne is set to unveil in Auburn Hills tomorrow, and it starts off with ""a redefinition of Dodge centered on American muscle."" They don't say what that could mean exactly, but I get the sense that they want Dodge to become a performance-centric brand not unlike what GM wanted to do with Pontiac before the bankruptcy. "
4402,"We'll have to see where this plan leaves less muscle-y cars like the Dart, although I'm still hoping for an SRT version of that. "
4403,"The plan, according to the newspaper, includes having the next generation of minivan go to Chrysler only; more Ram commercial vehicles; increased international production for Jeep; and more models for Alfa Romeo as they set it up to compete with Audi, BMW, Cadillac and Lexus."
4404,Advertisement
4405,
4406,"But where does that put Maserati, the other brand they want to become a global luxury volume-seller? Apparently that will get more high-end luxury sedans and SUVs, so maybe it will compete on a higher level than Alfa Romeo. "
4407,"Across the board, all of these brands — with the possible exception of Jeep and Ram — are starving for new products and a better definition of what they are and where they are in the marketplace. Marchionne knows this, so it will be very interesting to see if he can manage to give every marque the cars they need.   "
4408,Also: No plans at all for a four-door Ferrari. I don't think anyone is sad about that. 
4409,"Zipcar, the rent-by-the-hour car sharing service of choice for broke urban Millennials, has one hugely glaring and annoying flaw: after you check out a Zipcar, you have to put it back where you found it. Now they're about to unveil a new program that will fix that."
4410,"Later this year in Boston, Zipcar will launch the slightly annoyingly named Zipcar ONE>WAY program, which lets you check out a Honda Fit at one designated location and drop it off at another one with a guaranteed parking space. "
4411,"At the moment, when you check out a Zipcar, you have to bring it back to the same lot where you picked it up within the time frame you reserved the car. If you bring it back late, you incur a $50 late fee, which can make short errands potentially very expensive if you run into traffic and can't get back to the return lot on time. "
4412,"With this program, Zipcar takes direct aim at Car2Go, which lets you pick up a car and drop it any designated space whenever you want. It's also better than Car2Go in the sense that you get to drive a 2015 Honda Fit instead of a Smart Fortwo. Everything, including getting herpes, is preferable to driving a Smart Fortwo. "
4413,"I think it's a good move on Zipcar's part. After moving from Texas to D.C., I used Zipcar for a couple months before buying my Cooper S, and the late fees were easily the most frustrating part of an otherwise clever and convenient program. If you returned even a few minutes late because you got stuck in traffic — we get a little bit of that here in D.C. — you were hit with a late fee, and those alone made the program not really worth keeping. On top of the hourly and annual fees, Zipcar really starts to get pricey if you use it all the time. "

4415,
4416,"It's possible they may still have late fees with ONE>WAY, but presumably a one-way trip will eliminate the need for those. "

4421,"Let's talk a little bit about weights, shall we? Most of the world uses the metric system- centigrams, kilograms, etc. It's an easy to understand 10-base system. Here in America we also use the metric system, although not primarily. We still use the United States customary system for measurement and hence pretty much everything here is dually marked. It's not the greatest system but it gets us through the day."
4422,"Metrication has also taken place in Great Britain, but they still measure weights based on arcane calculations known as the Imperial System and seemingly having something to do with the number of stones it takes to sink a witch, or to describe fun girls named Rosie. This has resulted in crazypants measurements such as the hundredweight, which is also called the centum weight, or CWT. That brings us to today's 1965 Ford Thames 400E which was classified as a 15CWT van. What's that in non-Blighty? How the hell do I know?"

4426,"Other than its present location, the ad doesn't give much detail as to how it got to the Golden State's meth capital, or just what it's doing now that it's here. It does state that runs great, although that's tempered by the admission that 'IT'S A 1965 SO IT'S GONNA NEED SOME LOVE.' Fortunately it appears that it comes with a shop manual so that, while you won't be able to buy things like brake shoes or air filters, at least you'll know how to take the old ones off, and put them back on."

4430,"Before that however, nearly 200,000 Thames were built over the model's lifespan, both in RHD for the Isles, and LHD for export. This one's a Brit, as all the turny and pushy bits are where the passenger normally sits here in the States.

It's also not the available Perkins Four99 diesel either owing to its obvious carburetor and distributor. Gearbox choice additionally goes undisclosed in the ad is apparently automatic, owing to the copy on the mosaic pic."
4434,"These vans are apparently very popular owing to the fact that they even have their own Facebook page. Do YOU have your own Facebook page? You do? Oh, well, I guess you're pretty popular too. But then how do you look in BRG?"
4435,"One thing you can glean form all the pretty pictures on the Thames FB page is that the windows on this one look kind of hinkey. I don't know if they are right or not but at the very least they are there, ensuring that this one doesn't look like a total creeper van."

4438,"If you happen to be in Great Britain right now you might scoffing at the interest in this van over in the Colonies. You likely have a ton of them cluttering up the pre-owned lots and hence wouldn't find its rarity here in the States much of an incentive for supporting its $3,000 (GBP 1779) price tag. Picture Jeremy Clarkson affecting his most nasally American accent - Lookit' that, wouldja, it's a vaan with its steering wheel on the wrooong side. Ain't that a hoot!

4460,
4461,"Japanese news site Response reports that the S660 is officially set to begin production at Honda's Yokkaichi Works subsidiary, the same plant where the Honda Beat kei car roadster was made in the 1990s. It's more clear than ever that the S660 — which seemed headed for production at last year's Tokyo show — will be more like a neo-Beat than a screaming, insane neo-S2000."
4462,"That was apparent from the car's specs, too. At the show it boasted a turbocharged 660 cc engine with just 67 horsepower and a CVT gearbox. On the plus side, the S660 weighed less than 2,000 pounds in concept form, so it doesn't need much power to party."
4463,"No word yet on how much the S660 will cost or how many will be made, or whether it will make its way to markets outside of Japan. I really hope Honda decides to bring it here, but I think they'll need to beef up the engine at least a little bit first. "

Three, 380-volt battery capacities are available, with the 12 kWh good for a claimed 100-120 miles, the 15 kWh maxing out at 150 miles, and the massive 20 kWh lithium-ion pack getting 160-180 miles per charge – right in line with its combustion brethren.

(My wife, who loves vintage European cars, also demanded that we go, and I'm not gonna say no to that.)   "
4544,
4545,"To make the trip from Washington D.C. to North Carolina, I needed the right car. I could have done it in my Mini Cooper S, since that's technically a BMW, but where's the fun in that? Fortunately, BMW hooked me up with the M235i, the hottest version of their new 2-Series coupe. Until the BMW M2 comes out, anyway. "
4546,Advertisement
4547,
4548,"The car was exactly what I wanted, and not just because it's a small, rear-wheel drive coupe with 320 horsepower from its turbocharged inline six engine, and that sounded like a hell of a lot of fun. "
4549,"It was also because BMW has made a big deal about how the 2-Series is the modern-day successor to the old 2002, and I wanted to see how it fit in with actual 2002s and what their owners thought of the new car."
4550,Advertisement
4551,
4552,"The M235i turned out to be a hit, both with the old-school Bimmer fans and with myself. I haven't driven the new M3 and M4 yet, but at the moment, I'm convinced it's the new BMW you'll want to have right now. "
4553,Advertisement
4554,
4555,"Depending on the route you take, it's more than five hours and 300 miles from D.C. to Winston-Salem. That's a reasonably long trip, and driving on the Friday before Memorial Day is often fraught with perils like too much traffic, tons of cops out looking to score some speeding ticket revenue, and weekend warrior Harley guys with extremely questionable riding skills. (You people know who you are!)"
4556,"Fortunately, the M235i is a pretty great road trip car, despite being a small-ish coupe with sporting pretensions. The trunk is surprisingly decent, fitting my overnight bag, my wife's suitcase from a work trip and all our dog's junk with room to spare. "
4557,Advertisement
4558,
4559,"The front seats are generously bolstered without being too uncomfortable, and the ride, while erring on the side of firm, is pretty smooth and never beat us up. The back seats are small, sure, but the people I had back there didn't complain too much. They're roomy enough in a pinch."
4560,"But those cops I mentioned earlier? You've gotta watch out for 'em in the M235i, because the car is damned quick. Much quicker than I imagined it would be. The turbocharged 3.0-liter inline six packs a powerful midrange punch and charges hard all the way up to its 7,000 RPM redline. Zero to 60 mph comes in the mid-4 second range. "

4563,"Its power delivery isn't as manic as the Mercedes CLA45 AMG it will inevitably be compared to, but it feels more abundant. Having driven both I have total confidence in saying the Bimmer is the faster car. "
4564,"It's an eager, willing performer, even in the default ""Comfort"" setting; that's a misnomer because the car is pretty potent in that mode. Turning it up to ""Sport"" gives you more engine noise, a more sensitive throttle, more aggressive shifts, and a firmer ride from the Adaptive M Sport Suspension. "
4565,"If that's not enough for you, ""Sport Plus"" turns off traction control and makes it even more edgy, but most of the time the other two settings were fine for street use. It's impressive no matter what mode you have it in, and always fun to drive in the corners as well as on long straights. "
4566,Advertisement
4567,
4568,"My M235i tester came with a paddle-shift automatic. A six-speed manual is a zero cost option, and that's what I would get if my dollars were on the line. The good news is the automatic is ZF's wonderful 8-speed gearbox. "
4569,"It's everything you want in an auto — quick shifting paddles, responsive, and never sluggish. On most of my highway journey I kept it in manual mode and eighth gear, paddle-downshifting as necessary to pass lesser cars. "
4570,Advertisement
4571,
4572,"And while the M235i is a little heavier than you'd expect for its size at 3,535 pounds, it's an extremely adept handler, given to tail-happy antics whenever you want. Turn in is quick and the electric steering is surgically precise, especially at speed, even if it's not particularly full of feel.  "
4573,"The only real downsides to this car were the relative lack of options considering its $46,025 price tag. That's with no navigation, no Bluetooth streaming audio, no backup camera, a fairly unimpressive sound system and nothing else besides a sunroof. "
4574,Advertisement
4575,
4576,"There's also the matter of the artificially enhanced engine sound; knowing it wasn't entirely real kept me from enjoying an otherwise delightful inline-six baritone howl. It does have a pretty nice exhaust note, though. "
4577,"Still, I came away thinking it's hard not to love the M235i. But would the old-school BMW guys and gals feel the same way?"
4578,Advertisement
4579,
4580,"First, let's have a chat about BMW owners. They have a pretty negative reputation most days, thanks largely to asshat parking jobs, owners who would rather be seen in the cars than blast down twisty back roads, and newer M3 and M5 drivers with more ego than skill whose antics often end in hilarious Jalopnik-worthy tragedy. "
4581,"Classic BMW owners — or at least, all the ones I met at The Vintage — couldn't be further from that stereotype. They're an accepting, happy-go-lucky bunch who love the style, fun and relative ease of maintenance that comes with owning these cars. And they're totally cool if your BMW isn't Concours-perfect."
4582,"Got a 2002 with E21 seats? Join the club. Does it have Volkswagen brakes? Sure, why not! Did you swap in a different engine and transmission? Well, why the hell wouldn't you? "

4585,"The ""zero elitism"" is what appeals to people like 2002 owner Dudley Williams. ""I used to be in the Triumph scene,"" he told me. ""Judgey motherfuckers!"" "
4586,"And like any good car culture, Williams told me there's a ton of camaraderie between owners. The parking lot of The Vintage is a great place to break down because everyone there will jump in and help you get your car running again. "
4587,"""I'm a former soldier, and I couldn't reach out on a soldier website and say, 'I'm in California, let's hang out, and can I sleep in your house?'"" he said. But he can with fellow vintage BMW owners.  "

4589,
4590,"At The Vintage, you won't find many owners with big placards boasting how perfect their cars are, but you do see plenty of personal tales of how they came to be displayed in the dashboards. And you'll see some truly rare and fantastic machines."

4596,"That lovely orange hatchback is a 2002 Touring, which was never officially imported to the U.S. Its owner, Randy Anderson, brought it here a few years ago. He told me the story of how he fell in love with the 2002s in college and after seeing a bunch parked in a restaurant in 2006, he had to have one. The Touring is his second and he had it rebuilt recently."

4604,"I was a huge fan of this race-prepped white E21 323i as well. The six-cylinder 323i was never sold in the U.S., and the E21 is generally unloved compared to the cars that came before and after it, the 2002 and E30. It was great to see someone rocking such a kickass example. "

4610,"Clearly, there's a ton of great stuff on tap at The Vintage for any BMW enthusiast, fan of older cars, Europhile, or just someone who wants to see a car show that's a little different. But how did my M235i fare?"
4611,Advertisement
4612,
4613,"Thanks to organizer Scott Sturdy, I parked the car right up front next to a bright red, race-prepped 2002 — powered by an E30 M3 motor — owned by my new friend Marshall Lytle. "
4614,"He calls his  car the ""M2002,"" and with the race exhaust on it, you need earplugs to be in it. ""It's a lot faster (than an E30 M3), but much more primitive,"" he said, which I found to be slightly terrifying. "

4616,
4617,"My loaner may have more power, but I sure as hell wouldn't want to pit it against his car, especially since he's a track instructor at Summit Point and I'm, well... not. "
4618,"It turns out the M235i was a pretty big hit among the vintage faithful, and managed to get quite a bit of attention over the weekend. All day long, crowds came around to look it over, chat about its specs, talk about how it's the successor to the 1-Series coupe, poke around under its raised hood, and in one strange fellow's case, randomly jump inside without asking first. (Who even does that at a car show?) "
4619,Advertisement
4620,
4621,"I think it makes sense that people would get a kick out of the 2-Series. Does it drive like a 2002 or an E30? Hell no, but no modern car drives the same as its predecessor did decades ago. "
4622,"But it is a thoroughly modern execution of the formula that got people caring aboute BMWs in the first place: the small sports coupe, the two-door car that lets you have driving fun and some practicality at the same time. In my book, the 2-Series is a win for BMW. For all the crap we give them for their Gran Coupes and sloping-roof SUVs, when they want to get it right they really get it right. "
4623,Advertisement
4624,
4625,"The only real problem, if you want to call it that, is that this event drove home how badly I need a 2002. If anyone needs me, I'll be on Craigslist."
4626,"For some bizarre reason, CNBC decided that a bad review of the Mitsubishi Mirage was Big News, and so they featured it, and the writer on their show. They were right about one thing: it is a shockingly bad review. But not of the car. The bad part is the review itself, because it's everything wrong with the way cheap cars get reviewed."
4627,
4628,Let's get a couple things clear right off the bat: 1. Writers could definitely be more honest and critical in their reviews (and the lack of such honesty may be why this review is newsworthy). 2. I'm not in the pocket of Big Mitsubishi and the Mirage really isn't that great a car. 
4629,"I feel like I can take issue with this review because I reviewed the car as well. And, I certainly didn't give it a stellar review, but I think I had one quality in that review that this reviewer, John Pearley Huffman, lacked: I'm not absolutely deluded about what a cheap car should be."
4630,
4631,Advertisement
4632,
4633,"I get the appeal of writing a bad review — they're a hell of a lot more fun to write than a good review. A good bad review can be a really satisfying thing, and once you get going it's an almost cathartic experience. But you have to keep that critic-lust in check, sometimes, and try and really get to the truth of things."
4634,"Many of the criticisms in the review are valid — those hard efficiency tires are pretty gripless, that three-cylinder engine does idle rougher than a four, the brakes aren't great, nobody likes the CVT — but it feels like the majority of the issues are closer to complaints like this:"
4635,"The controls are straightforward and logical, but the dashboard is made of cheesy plastic. There's even a visible 1990s-style seam around the passenger air bag's cover, something that virtually all other cars have managed to hide."
4636,Advertisement
4637,
4638,"Is he really bitching about seeing a visible seam? Was he under the illusion that the car was hand-carved out of one perfect aged piece of wormwood by a Swiss craftsman? Is he the fucking Sultan Of Luxuristan, so refined and cultured he can't have his eyes violated by the sight of a seam? "
4639,"There's also complaints about the ""cheesy plastics"" and how the door feels ""flimsy"" and he says the 0-60 time of 10.9 seconds gives you a ""sense of peril."" This is all ridiculous hyperbole. You know what had a 0-60 time slower 10.9 seconds? A 1984 BMW 318i. Ten years later, the 1994 318is managed to shave that down to 10.1 seconds. If a car that can get to 60 in around 11 seconds is giving you a ""sense of peril,"" you're either driving it wrong or racing for pinks against a Camaro."
4640,Advertisement
4641,
4642,"I'm picking on Mr. J. Pearly Huffman because for whatever reason, his review's gotten a lot of attention, but he's by no means alone here. There's a certain pervasive belief that, somehow, no matter what the car costs, we all deserve the finest-feeling plastics and the best acceleration and that certain aspirational look that tells everyone we're mere weeks away from being able to buy some islands."
4643,This is bullshit.
4644,"In the same review, Huffman also mentions that the car is roomy, and can get 37 MPG city and 47 MPG highway (I personally observed almost 49 MPG in my tests). Then he goes on to say that ""Greyhound bus tickets"" and ""hitchhiking"" are viable alternatives. You know who probably doesn't agree with that? Every fucking person hitchhiking or stuck on Greyhound bus."
4645,Advertisement
4646,
4647,"The Mirage is a cheap car. You can get the base one for under $14,000. Maybe it's not as good as a Fiesta or Fit — that's a fair point to make. But the idea that somehow low-end cars need to have interiors with finger-orgasming plastics and no obscene seams like mid- and luxury cars costing 3-5x as much is absurd."
4648,"I love low-end cars. I love what low-end cars used to be. There was once an honest dignity about a cheap car that made it useful, easy to maintain, and classless. I love exposed screw heads and easily visible seams on things because that means if something needs tweaking or fixing, you can actually figure out what needs doing and do it without having to fight with stupid plastic tabs and screw-head modesty covers and other effete frippery."
4649,Advertisement
4650,
4651,"All the emphasis on the sort of bullshit that reviewers are panning cheap cars on is making these cars more expensive than they need to be, and diverting development resources away from what matters: durability, efficiency, safety, and driving dynamics. "
4652,"The truth is this humble little Mirage can compete head-to-head with a $300,000 Bentley in the contest of getting your ass from Point A to that adorable café by Point B and do just fine. It knows its job, and it does it well. The door panels feel plasticky? That's because they're made of fucking plastic, genius. And you know why? On a $14,000 car, plastic is a fantastic choice for an inner door panel. "
4653,"You find the plastic too ""cheap"" feeling? Spend more money or buy a used car or get a thrift store bomber jacket and a staple gun and have at it. I'm not saying cheap cars shouldn't strive for quality — they absolutely should — but I think the focus on these insipid trappings of ""luxury"" are totally out of place for a review of a low-end car."
4654,Advertisement
4655,
4656,"I managed to have fun in that 3-pot little Mirage. I drove it hard and pushed its limits and the result was a pretty good time, considering. I drove it with my wife and son and never once did I feel like my life was in danger. It's so vastly better than the entry-level cars we had years ago, it's not even funny."
4657,"And safety-wise, I'd rather be in a 2014 Mirage heading into a wall than a 1977 Rolls Royce Silver Shadow. So all of you reviewing cars under $15,000 and bitching that you can see stitching or a seam or a screw head can all go take your pampered little new-media hands and rub some velvet on your cheek or whatever you do to calm yourself after you touch some cheap plastic."

4659,
4660,I guess it's not really all the fault of car reviewers. I blame the designer that first decided to put fake stitching on a Chevette dashboard.
4661,"Did your car's engine just explode? Did your truck have a critical axle failure? Don't worry, as the world's greatest mechanic, I can repair it. Why? Because I just fixed my car's headlight, ALL BY MYSELF."
4662,"You read that right, I fixed my car's headlight. It was weak and dim before, blinking in and out, yet now it is strong and powerful and clear. My passenger-side headlight used to be a trickling, stagnant creek. Now it is the Niagara Falls of headlights."
4663,"Yes, this is a good time to sit down."

4669,"This was a test in and of itself. The first advice I got was from an old Brooklyn mechanic with a very thick South Asian accent and he recommended I scrub and clean my connectors with a kind of unpronounceable acid, and then they would be fine."
4670,"I then asked a long time rally fan what to do and he gave me much better advice: replace my connectors, because they had all rusted or shorted out. Just look at that burned out little bastard. Like a Deadhead who just ran out of his last stash of luudes."

4672,

4674,It all turned out to be very simple:
4675,"And like the master mechanic I now am, that's exactly what I did! I bought a new pigtail connector, a bunch of butt connectors (I needed extras), and shrink tubing. "

4677,
4678,"I then labeled all my wires (passenger side, driver's side, and top) and clipped my old wiring just aft of the halfway point of the old butt connectors. This was, as any seasoned mechanic will tell you, probably the most arduous task in the world of car repair. Please hold your applause."

4680,

4682,"Having clipped down to my old wiring, I then clamped in my new wires with butt connectors. I clamped them with my strong, weathered hands and I totally didn't break a sweat or make an owie on my pinky. Nope."
4683,Advertisement
4684,
4685,"From there all I had to do was slide the shrink tubing over the connectors and heat it with a lighter, not enough to get it to smoke, but enough to shrink it water-tight around all the wiring.

I managed to get two shrink tubes on and sealed the last one with electrical tape because the shrink tubing got stuck and my car is already deteriorating into a hoopty and I just don't care anymore and fuck it just fuck it all to hell why is everything falling apart why can't I just get one thing, ONE THING right for once please lord in heaven..."
4686,"Oh, it worked!"

4760,"Did your car's engine just explode? Did your truck have a critical axle failure? Don't worry, as the world's greatest mechanic, I can repair it. Why? Because I just fixed my car's headlight, ALL BY MYSELF."
4761,"You read that right, I fixed my car's headlight. It was weak and dim before, blinking in and out, yet now it is strong and powerful and clear. My passenger-side headlight used to be a trickling, stagnant creek. Now it is the Niagara Falls of headlights."
4762,"Yes, this is a good time to sit down."
4763,"(Welcome to the Continuing Misadventures of Raphael and his Baja Bug, a series on how I buy a half-broken 1973 Volkswagen offroader that I proceed to break, fix, break, fix, and break again.)"
4764,"As I said, my right headlight had been going dim, and after a few weeks of spluttering weakness, I decided to stand up, man up, shape up, toughen up, roll up my sleeves and take down the problem."

4766,
4767,I asked someone else how to fix everything.
4768,"This was a test in and of itself. The first advice I got was from an old Brooklyn mechanic with a very thick South Asian accent and he recommended I scrub and clean my connectors with a kind of unpronounceable acid, and then they would be fine."
4769,"I then asked a long time rally fan what to do and he gave me much better advice: replace my connectors, because they had all rusted or shorted out. Just look at that burned out little bastard. Like a Deadhead who just ran out of his last stash of luudes."

4774,"And like the master mechanic I now am, that's exactly what I did! I bought a new pigtail connector, a bunch of butt connectors (I needed extras), and shrink tubing. "
4775,Advertisement
4776,
4777,"I then labeled all my wires (passenger side, driver's side, and top) and clipped my old wiring just aft of the halfway point of the old butt connectors. This was, as any seasoned mechanic will tell you, probably the most arduous task in the world of car repair. Please hold your applause."
4778,Advertisement
4779,
4780,"I got out my new pigtail connector with its attached wires and slid the shrink tubing on there, keeping it out of the way of the ends. This is a level of foresight usually attributed to the finest minds in the global economist expert circuit."
4781,"Having clipped down to my old wiring, I then clamped in my new wires with butt connectors. I clamped them with my strong, weathered hands and I totally didn't break a sweat or make an owie on my pinky. Nope."
4782,Advertisement
4783,
4784,"From there all I had to do was slide the shrink tubing over the connectors and heat it with a lighter, not enough to get it to smoke, but enough to shrink it water-tight around all the wiring. For a Baja Bug that runs through mud and puddles and parks uncovered in the rain, this is important. I managed to get two shrink tubes on and sealed the last one with electrical tape because the shrink tubing got stuck and my car is already deteriorating into a hoopty and I just don't care anymore and fuck it just fuck it all to hell why is everything falling apart why can't I just get one thing, ONE THING right for once please lord in heaven..."

4799,"Back in 2011, Chrysler announced they'd be making over a dozen plug-in hybrid Ram 1500s. Since then, I haven't heard a word of news on these trucks."
4800,"The trucks were part of a study done with the Department of Energy and the UC Davis Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle Research Center. You can read the basic plan for this study right here. Well, I'm not sure if ""were"" is the right word. According to this UCD report from a 2013 conference, the program is only ending this month, June 2014."
4801,"It also implies that 140 vehicles were built, or that Chrysler intended to built that many trucks. It's not exactly clear. Car and Driver's 2011 report that 140 plug-in trucks were shipping out backs up the intention, but not the execution."
4802,"Adding to the murky mystery of this likely-doomed program, probably dying a quiet death like Chrysler's other electric plans of the 21st century, is that Allpar claims it started with a military hybrid truck project."
4803,"The rumor is that these trucks were built just as a favor to the government, basically, and that Chrysler has never had any intention of making them anything more than a study. A ""look, at least we're trying"" sort of gesture."
4804,Advertisement
4805,
4806,"Have you ever seen one of these trucks? Do you know if Chrysler has any intention of doing anything with them, or does the company care as little about their electric offerings as the rest of the world?"
4807,"UPDATE: Chrysler confirmed that they have built 140 of these trucks, and that their program is still running, focusing on 24 units in fleets. This project is for research and will be folded back into other programs, but not necessarily into building plug-in-hybrid trucks. Here are their own words:"
4808,"In a nutshell, this is a technology demonstration conducted in conjunction with a partnership between Chrysler Group LLC and the DOE. The results will inform future production programs, but not necessarily the vehicle applications demonstrated."

4815,"Yep, that's what he said. The CAD data they get from car companies is usually pretty unusable for the making in-game cars. And, even more telling, Forza developers never trust the manufacturer specs for HP, weight, etc. They do all their own dyno testing, and part-weighing. So turn on your Xbox One for accurate car specs."
4816,"It seems that the actual CAD files used to actually make new cars really aren't well suited to building video game cars (though they're sometimes an okay place to start), and it's not too surprising HP and weight figures might get fudged by makers of ultra-high performance cars. They wouldn't go into who's the worst offender for HP overestimation, sadly. I bet it's Smart."
4817,"I heard this from Dan Greenawalt, Creative Director for the Forza franchise, as he and his colleagues were showing a pack of feral auto journalists the highlights of the new Forza Horizon 2. We didn't get all that much hands-on time with the game, but from what I saw, it's pretty damn impressive, especially if you're a fan of evaporation."
4818,
4819,"Oh yeah, evaporation. And puddle formation, and meteorology. If your goal is to find an impressive, console-based precipitation and puddle-generation simulator that also includes a bit of driving, Horizon 2 is your answer. That's because one of the big things this new version is adding is a fully dynamic weather system, and that means rain. And puddles. And puddles evaporating."

4826,"Like the previous Forza Horizon, Horizon 2 is an open world, but this one is three times as large, and set in Southern Europe instead of Colorado. It's a totally open world, which means that all guard rails and barriers used in the previous game to keep your travels constrained are gone (except where they exist in reality). That means if you want to tear ass in your Huracan right through some poor Italian bastard's vineyard, have at it. In fact, I watched one of the developers do just that."

Hell, they could probably cut users out of the equation altogether! But that's probably not a great way to sell games."
4837,"There seems to be a crapload of content available here. There's over 200 cars, 700+ racing events, and they're saying that it would take over 100 hours to do all the races and events set up in the game.

4848,"Ferrari honcho Luca di Montezemolo has said that the 2014 regulations have made them interested in sports car racing again. However, these regulations expire in 2016, and it seems doubtful that they'd develop a car just to have it be immediately obsolete, unless their development is much further along than we already thought."

They're also lighter, tighter and just as much fun. Here are a few things I learned from driving the two Mers at a spectacular American race course."
4941,"(Full disclosure: BMW wanted me to drive the new M3 and M4 so bad, they flew me to Wisconsin for a dinner comprising strategically placed local cheese and a day of scaring myself giddy at one of America's most appealing, most fun racetracks, Road America.) "

4944,"""Come and drive the BMW M3 and M4 at Road America,"" they said. "
4945,"Road America is a long, fast, gorgeous circuit cut into the rolling hills between Milwaukee and Green Bay. A car with 425 horsepower and the proper gearing can top 150 mph three times per lap here. There's a steep, downhill 150-to-60 mph braking zone and similar gravity-fighting dives at several other corners. The force a car's rotors generate at Road America could power a Milwaukee sports bar on Packers-Vikings day. "

4954,"With the standard-issue four-piston (front) compounds, it's likely we'd have had a blast on the track for about an hour or two, and then gone off to see a puppet show or something while the cars rested. "
4955,"Clever choice of venue, BMW. Very clever. Not that I'm complaining. "
4956,"Granted, the CCBs cost an $8,150 extra and require one of the $1,200 uprated 19"" wheel packages (18"" wheels are standard). It's a heavy expense, but an absolutely essential factory option for buyers who track their cars and would rather not deal with the aftermarket. And it's heartening to see the downward cost slope CCBs have been on for the past five years. At this rate, they should be affordable for mortals by 2019."

The M3/4's new turbocharged I6 — sorry, I mean S55B30 — may not have drivers joyfully chasing the back of the tach, as the V8 did, but with acres of torque and flexibility and responsiveness and (yes) fuel economy when needed, there is remarkably little to complain about.

Albert Biermann, engineering head of M, says the betterment of this system comes down to four elements: the tightness of the front-end bits, overall tighter tolerances and a larger, lower-inertia electric motor to minimize the filtering effect that makes most EPAS systems feel numb. There's a closer connection between the torque sensor and the EPS boost controller. What's more, the system cuts out assist strategically, like when returning to center after a corner, making the unwinding a entirely mechanical proposition."
4979,"It's beautifully accurate and a vast improvement in feel over some other EPAS setups (fingers crossed that a future M2 gets this gear). It's obvious M's spent time and money getting this part right, and I suspect it matches or exceeds Porsche's EPAS right now. That would be a good comparo to do.

5141,Recently we learned that Dodge is seriously upping its muscle car game with the Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. The coupe will sport a supercharged 6.2-liter Hemi V8 with north of 600 horsepower. That's the most powerful V8 Chrysler has ever made. Great. Swell. Neat-o. Now bring on the sedan.  
5142,
5143,"Somewhat lost in the news about the Challenger Hellcat late last month was the fact that most likely, the Charger sedan is getting that engine too. Automotive News reported that ""the supercharged Hellcat is expected to migrate to other SRT vehicles, including the Charger SRT."" And the Dodge portion of Fiat Chrysler's five-year plan indicates the same. Check out the top right hand corner of this image. We've seen some possible mules with this engine running around too. "
5144,Nothing else with four doors comes close to the Hellcat's power. The soon-to-be-discontinued (and likely replaced by a new one) Cadillac CTS-V puts out 556 horsepower. The Charger SRT's 6.2-liter Hemi has 470 horsepower. The Chevrolet SS comes to the party with 415 horsepower. It sounds like the Hellcat will trump all of them. 
5145,Advertisement
5146,
5147,"We haven't seen any official specs on the Challenger Hellcat quite yet, but some have speculated a zero to 60 mph time of under four seconds, which given its estimated power figures seems entirely plausible. Put this into the Charger and you have what very well could be America's fastest sedan."
5148,Cool. 
5149,"I'm an unapologetic fan of the Dodge Charger. I drove a gorgeous blue Charger R/T Daytona halfway across Texas once, and I did burnouts in a Charger SRT8 on my wedding day. I like the car. I like the way it sounds, I like the way it drives, and I really like the way it looks.       "

5153,"See, it used to be that in America, you had entire ranges of V8 engines to choose from when you purchased your family sedan or wagon. Gas prices, emissions regulations, technology and the car-buying public's tastes have changed all that. "
5154,"The V8 engine, once the mainstay of American automotive transportation, is now a fairly rare thing; it has become relegated mainly to our luxury and high-end performance cars, available only to those willing to pay extra for both the gas and the motor. You can have V8s in Corvettes and Mustangs and Cadillacs, not affordable family cars."
5155,Advertisement
5156,
5157,"That's why I like the Charger. It's a long, wide family sedan with eight cylinders under its hood. It rolls like we used to. Sure, the Chevrolet SS is very similar, but it drives more like Chevy's take on the E39 BMW M5 than a classic American muscle sedan; not that this is necessarily a bad thing. (It's also from Australia. You know the toilets flush the other way down there? Weird.) "
5158,
5159,"The Charger is old school muscle, done in a modern way with some nice luxury touches and a really good infotainment system. You can drop your kids off at school in it, rip some burnouts in the parking lot, and then drive to work with everyone around you dropping their speed to 10 mph below the limit because they think you're a cop. Not many cars can do all three of those things."
5160,Advertisement
5161,
5162,"So I'm amped for the Charger to get a range of V8 options like the muscle cars of yore, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the Hellcat can do under its hood. The Challenger SRT Hellcat sounds like one of the mightiest performance cars America has ever unleashed, and adding extra two doors and more practicality to that is an enticing proposition. "

The Brasilia (made from 1973-1982) was important because it's really the only successful true Beetle replacement that VW ever produced using their own traditional air-cooled/rear engine architecture."
5224,"There's a few reasons for why the Brasilia came to be. VW was very big in Brazil, with a lot of local manufacturing from the 1950s. Starting in the later 1950s, the Brazilian government began a policy to restrict auto imports and produce as much of their cars and car parts internally as possible. This had the effect of making VW do Brasil very independent, and producing many unique cars to fill all sorts of market niches that VWs didn't seek out in the rest of the world."

5228,
5229,"The Beetle/Fusca was a constantly strong seller, but it was still essentially a 1938 design, and, just like in the rest of the world, the Beetle was finally starting to feel the pressure of competition from more modern small cars from Japan and elsewhere."
5230,Advertisement

5232,"In Brazil, the new upcoming competitor was the Chevette, which was a much more modern design with a hatchback, and VW wanted to be sure their products could compete with it and other more up-to-date cars. In the rest of the world, VW wouldn't manage to find a viable competitor until the Golf/Rabbit, and that required the acquisition of an entire other company's (NSU/Audi) technologies, and a near-total switch to water cooling and FWD."
5233,"But in Brazil, things were different. Rudolf Leiding, the head of VW Brazil, got his designers and engineers started on a new project: re-body the Beetle so it's more modern, roomier, practical, and able to compete with these new little boxy cars. Something flexible for Brazilian tastes. "

5235,
5236,"And so the Brasilia was born. Built on the same, tried-and-true Beetle chassis (well, actually the slightly wider Karmann-Ghia chassis, but it's pretty much the same) and using the same, rugged, well-known Beetle drivetrain, VWs designers accomplished something pretty remarkable: they made a car of the 30s look like a car of the '70s."
5237,"The new body was clean and crisp, and maximized the amount of usable area of the car. Much like the Type IIIs before it, they stuck the Beetle engine under a floor in the back, creating a usable load area/wagon above it, and the new boxier body pretty significantly increased luggage capacity up front. Unlike the Type III, the Brazilia used the normal upright-fan Beetle engine, so the rear luggage area wasn't terribly tall, but they did redesign the air cleaner and fan shroud to give enough room to be usable."

5241,"If you think how the Brasilia would have been with a now-common FWD drivetrain (an idea they considered late in the car's life) the sense of the layout becomes clear. Sure, you could deepen the rear luggage area, but you'd lose a good 30-40% of the car's length to the engine. "

5318,
5319,"Buy one car, buy 100 cars, I don't care. Just impress us with your spending idea."
5320,"Is there anything more subtly perfect than a Silver Porsche 356? It might not possess the visual drama of a Jaguar E-Type or a Ferrari Lusso, but there's something that's just so right about a 356. There isn't a single detail that's out of place."
5321,
5322,"This particular 356, owned by one Mr. Jack Griffin (who also owns this 914-6), is a particularly special one, with some tasty modifications. It's a 1955, badged as a ""Continental,"" thanks to Porsche importer Max Hoffman who thought US Porsches would need some sort of conventional name. Ford evidently didn't think this was such a great idea, since they sold the Lincoln Continental, so they requested Porsche to stop. Consequently, only about 1500 other 356s, all sold in 1955, wear that badge."
5323,
5324,"The engine was replaced with a '65 356 engine that produces 115 HP mated to a gearbox from a '62 356. 115 horsepower doesn't sound like a whole lot, but it's a ton of power for a car like this. Griffin also fitted disc brakes, a set of Fuchs wheels, a louvered engine lid, 12V electronics, and the gas filler is through the hood. "
5325,"The aim was to make it look like a period correct race car, and I think they absolutely nailed it. Griffin notes that while his car feels a lot more modern than a stock 1955 356, the handling is still pretty hairy, demanding your full attention."

I could just be falling for the ever lovely camera work of Petrolicious, but this car looks so perfect, especially in silver."
5329,"One of my personal automotive missions is to bring more attention to the very early period of automobiles. As in the hundred or so years before the usual assumed ""invention"" of the car by Karl Benz. For real automotive firsts, let's talk about Rickett's Steam Carriage. "
5330,"From what I can tell, there's at least three very significants ""firsts"" that can be applied to the steam carriages built by Thomas Rickett, foundry manager:"
5331,• The first automobile to actually be sold to a private individual
5332,• The first automobile to complete a significant (100+ mile) journey
5333,• The first car to be advertised in a publication
5334,"Any of those would be a pretty big deal — the fact that one car maker — hell, one person — was responsible for all three is incredible."
5335,"The car itself is interesting, and is quite clearly a product of the state of the art of the era. Rickett worked for Castle Foundry, which made farm equipment, expanding by 1857 to building stationary steam engines to power various pieces of farm machinery."
5336,"It's not hard to see how the combination of wheeled farm implements and steam engines would have made sense to Rickett, and by 1858 he had combined components to produce a self-propelled steam plough. "
5337,Advertisement
5338,
5339,"Somehow, the Marquess of Stafford encountered the steam plough, and that gave him the idea that he'd like to own a self-propelled steam carriage of his own. In 1860, he contacted Rickett, and ordered one. This act, I believe, makes the Marquess the very first private citizen to order and purchase an automobile from a manufacturer."
5340,"The car itself was something like a small locomotive with a bench seat up front. It was three-wheeled, with one wheel for steering up front, and a 110 psi boiler at the rear, providing steam for two pistons, displacing about 3402cc each. Transmission was by chain to the right rear wheel, and the steam car was said to be capable of about 19 MPH. Not bad!"
5341,"It was steered by tiller, with a regulator to control the speed, along with a brake and reversing lever. It did require one other person at the rear, to stoke the boiler and manage the engine."
5342,Advertisement
5343,
5344,"Apparently, titled royalty are as easily influenced as any of us, because before long he had an order for a second car later that year, this one from James Sinclair, the 14th Earl of Caithness. The Earl was a scientist and member of the Royal Society, so it's easy to see why he may have been so interested and open to try out something so new and novel. His carriage also had some significant improvements, including a two-speed gearbox."
5345,"This car was used on a 146-mile road trip from Inverness, Scotland to Barrogill Castle in Scotland. The trip was taken by the Earl and his wife, with Thomas Rickett himself acting as boiler man. That's service. Good luck trying to get Mary Barra to even ride along with you in your new Suburban down to Bed, Bath, and Beyond."

5347,

5349,
5350,"Likely encouraged from the success of selling his cars to blue-blood clientele, Rickett did his last major automotive first, placing what I believe to be the first-ever advertisement to sell cars. The ad was placed in the British literal gearhead journal, The Engineer, and advertised his steam carriages available for £180 to £200. That price seems pretty good, considering he had pretty much no competition at all."
5351,Advertisement
5352,
5353,"It doesn't seem like the ad was successful, because no more Rickett Steam Carriages were sold. That's too bad, but when you consider that this is still the early 1860s — Abraham Lincoln was alive then, after all — it's not really shocking. Rickett was ahead of his time by at least 40 or so years. It'd be like someone selling crude, Arpanet-capable portable cellular phone with a little CRT on it in the 1980s: no one would really be ready to know what to do with it. But, 40 years later, as we all walk around with our iPhones and Androids, we can look back and see how progressive that one guy was."

5363,
5364,"Somehow, the Marquess of Stafford encountered the steam plough, and that gave him the idea that he'd like to own a self-propelled steam carriage of his own. In 1860, he contacted Rickett, and ordered one. This act, I believe, makes the Marquess the very first private citizen to order and purchase an automobile from a manufacturer."
5365,"The car itself was something like a small locomotive with a bench seat up front. It was three-wheeled, with one wheel for steering up front, and a 110 psi boiler at the rear, providing steam for two pistons, displacing about 3402cc each. Transmission was by chain to the right rear wheel, and the steam car was said to be capable of about 19 MPH. Not bad!"
5366,"It was steered by tiller, with a regulator to control the speed, along with a brake and reversing lever. It did require one other person at the rear, to stoke the boiler and manage the engine."

5368,
5369,"Apparently, titled royalty are as easily influenced as any of us, because before long he had an order for a second car later that year, this one from James Sinclair, the 14th Earl of Caithness. The Earl was a scientist and member of the Royal Society, so it's easy to see why he may have been so interested and open to try out something so new and novel. His carriage also had some significant improvements, including a two-speed gearbox."
5370,"This car was used on a 146-mile road trip from Inverness, Scotland to Barrogill Castle in Scotland. The trip was taken by the Earl and his wife, with Thomas Rickett himself acting as boiler man. That's service. Good luck trying to get Mary Barra to even ride along with you in your new Suburban down to Bed, Bath, and Beyond."

5372,
5373,"This road trip was about 25 years earlier and over twice as long as Bertha Benz' famous surprise trip in the Benz Patent-Motorwagen, which I had previously always thought of as the first automobile road trip."
5374,
5375,"Likely encouraged from the success of selling his cars to blue-blood clientele, Rickett did his last major automotive first, placing what I believe to be the first-ever advertisement to sell cars. The ad was placed in the British literal gearhead journal, The Engineer, and advertised his steam carriages available for £180 to £200. That price seems pretty good, considering he had pretty much no competition at all."
5376,Advertisement
5377,
5378,"It doesn't seem like the ad was successful, because no more Rickett Steam Carriages were sold. That's too bad, but when you consider that this is still the early 1860s — Abraham Lincoln was alive then, after all — it's not really shocking. Rickett was ahead of his time by at least 40 or so years. It'd be like someone selling crude, Arpanet-capable portable cellular phone with a little CRT on it in the 1980s: no one would really be ready to know what to do with it. But, 40 years later, as we all walk around with our iPhones and Androids, we can look back and see how progressive that one guy was."
5379,"First, a warning. This article is going to be so geeky, so niche, so insanely VW Beetle-geek focused that those of you not crazily interested in Beetle minutia should probably just close the window now. Really. For those who can hang, get a drop cloth, because minds will be blown, Beetle-taillight-wise."
5380,"Okay. So, here's the deal: I recently found out about a variation of Volkswagen Beetle taillight I'd never heard of before. This may not seem like a big deal, but as a kid I used to doodle the evolution of Beetle taillights in my notebooks at school. I thought I knew every Beetle taillight variant, from the ""heart"" lenses of the early 50s to the add-on reverse lights of '67, to the two different sizes of ""tombstone"" lights used. I thought I was hot Beetle taillight shit."
5381,Then I got schooled.
5382,"Via some convoluted trail of Google image-searching, I happened to notice a picture of the rear of a Beetle that stayed my gaze like a condom full of chili flung into the front of a freight train. Something didn't look quite right. Most people likely wouldn't have noticed anything odd, but a lifetime of scrutinizing Beetle lights made me hypersensitive. These taillights had slightly different proportions of amber and red. They were divided half-and-half between the two colors, instead of the expected 1/3 to 2/3rds division."

5384,
5385,My blood ran cold. What was I looking at? I looked around my office. Was I in the same universe I woke up in? Did donuts eat people now? Who am I?
5386,"Get a grip. Research. Research. I dove in, determined to find out what the hell I was looking at, and find it I did. So let me enlighten all of you, my friends:"
5387,"These are known as the 50/50 taillights. They were produced for only one year, in 1960, and only for two markets: Australia and Italy. This is because in 1960, in those two countries alone, a law was passed requiring amber turn signals at the rear. That next year it would be required everywhere except in the US, and VW made the three-section lights with amber at the top (red still in the US) that we're all familiar with."
5388,Advertisement
5389,
5390,
5391,"But for that one glorious year, in those two glorious countries, the 50/50 light came in to save the day, with bright orange blinks of turn indication. Beetles were built in Australia as well as Germany at this time, so I suspect that these lights were probably made in Australia and imported into Italy for fitment on Italian Beetles."

5393,
5394,"So, here's my new comprehensive chart of VW Beetle taillights, with the 50/50 light included:"
5395,"As you can imagine, these are very rare, and get can get pretty expensive, and I've even heard reports of people hoarding stashes of them. Most people probably wouldn't have any idea or care if they found these, but they seem like something of a Holy Grail to VW folks."

He doesn't get why we wrench in our garages, spend weekends at track days, or take off in the middle of the night for a ride. He's like your Aunt Martha, except Brin has the power to change the world. And he doesn't make those awesome cookies."
5422,"
	Brin recently joined his compatriot, Google CEO Larry Page, on stage with venture capitalist Vinod Khosla to chat about where Google is headed."
5423,"
	In many respects, where Google goes, so goes the world, so naturally, the conversation turned to self-driving cars."
5424,
5425,"Watch the video above (the topic comes in at the 21-min mark), and it's striking to see how Brin looks at the world of driving from a disturbingly fundamentalist perspective."
5426,Advertisement
5427,
5428,"
	To Brin's mind, not just cars, but car ownership is inefficient, wasteful, and dangerous. They take up too much space, use too many resources, and, listening to Brin, are an unconscionable blight on society."
5429,"
	Of course, he has some points. Traffic congestion costs us around $120 billion dollars, wastes nearly 2 billion gallons of fuel, and keeps the average urban commuter trapped in a box for over 30 hours each year. But that's just time and money. The real goal is to eliminate the 2.3 million injuries and 33,000 fatalities each year in the U.S. "
5430,"
	These are all noble intentions (until you think about how Google will monetize it all), but they're also a utopian vision divorced from reality. And that shouldn't come as a surprise when you consider the source."
5431,Advertisement
5432,
5433,"
	Brin looks at the world through an engineer's lens. It's binary: good versus bad, progress versus stagnation. The idea that someone would derive any amount of pleasure from the act of driving is completely antithetical to the society Brin envisions. Add in the fact that he's also the protagonist in a world of his own creation, worth $30 billion, and nestled safely inside the Silicon Valley hive mind, and – with the right (Google) glasses – you can see where he's coming from. Until you can't."
5434,"
	Our reality is radically different from Brin's. We enjoy the drive, we thrive on the involvement, we revel in the experience of focusing on one thing well. It's part of who we are and what we do. Which makes Brin's ignorance that much more astounding."
5435,Advertisement
5436,
5437,"
	You'd assume that anyone that can get lost in something – say, coding – where the world slips away and the only thing that matters is the task at hand, would understand a single-minded passion. From that perspective, the line between Brin and us isn't that obscured. We're tinkers. Shade-tree engineers. Hackers, if you will. We tweak things to make them better. For Brin and Page, it started with search and evolved into an empire. For us, it started with a carburetor and evolved into a 9-second electric Miata."
5438,"
	But that's not the way Brin and his army of engineers, developers, and cheerleaders see it. They look at the world of cars with disdain – an outmoded system that needs to be torn down and rebuilt in their idealistic vision. And everyone has to be on board for it to work."

	I recently paid $904.61 in order to spend a week behind the wheel of the worst car I've ever driven.  It was a highly interesting experience, and I'd surely do it again, provided that my only alternate form of transportation involves getting dragged around for a while by an angry gorilla."
5497,"
	Yes, folks, that's right: I'm reviewing my European rental car.  The last time I went to Europe, 
	I also wrote a review of my rental car, and nobody really read it.  But I'm trying again, because this time I think I can captivate you.  I can excite you.  I can really draw you in.  Plus, I can deduct it all from my taxes."
5498,
5499,"
	The primary reason nobody bothered with the old review, I suspect, is that the car I drove was slow, boring, and gray.  Unfortunately, my latest rental car was even 
	more slow, and even more boring, though to be fair it's roughly the same amount of gray.  So I've decided to employ some extra special journalistic touches to keep you interested, starting with the following highly informative ""Q & A"" session:"
5500,"
Q: Is the Citroen C-Elysee the worst car you've ever driven?"
5501,"
	A: Yes."
5502,"
	Now that we have that out of the way, it's time to get a little background on the C-Elysee.  Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea what that background is.  Wikipedia says this car was designed in China and built in Spain, though my particular rental carried a French VIN number.  The whole thing is very confusing, which probably explains why Hertz stuck it in the ""Volkswagen Golf or similar"" rental class, instead of a more appropriate segment, such as ""Wheeled Hand Cart or similar."""
5503,Advertisement
5504,
5505,"
	Whatever the case, Wikipedia is certainly right about one thing: this car was designed for, I believe the politically correct term is, ""emerging markets."" What this really means is ""people with low standards.""  Or maybe even ""people who dump out their trash in rivers.""  Put another way, the C-Elysee is so depressingly mediocre that it isn't even offered in Citroen's home market of France.  Yes, folks: this is a French car so bad that 
	even the French don't want it."
5506,"
So why is it so bad?, you're wondering.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY IS IT SO BAD?!"
5507,"
	To help explain, we'll start in a place where the designers clearly didn't: the engine.  Although Citroen claims my C-Elysee was powered by a 92-horsepower 1.6-liter turbodiesel, I beg to differ.  I think it was powered by whatever keeps my iPhone running, except maybe slightly detuned so things don't get really out of hand.  Seriously: I've had 1:18 scale models with more juice than this thing."
5508,Advertisement
5509,
5510,"
	Now, I know what you're thinking, and that is: 
	Oh, look! The guy with the sports car thinks a small European diesel car is too slow!  What a surprise!  But let's not forget I recently owned a Nissan Cube, which boasts 120 horsepower and the acceleration of patio furniture.  The C-Elysee lives in a whole different world of slow, a world where you sometimes pull away from a stoplight and look down at the gear lever, convinced you've accidentally started in third."
5511,"
	To prove my point, I bring up one especially memorable occasion, while attempting to drive up a steep hill in Italy, when the car simply ran out of power.  Foot on the floor, lowest gear possible, the thing was rolling backwards like a teen driver practicing hill starts in her brother's 1997 Civic coupe.  We eventually had to park the car at the bottom of the hill and climb up the old-fashioned way: dragged by an angry gorilla."
5512,"
	If the engine was bad (and it was), then the styling was worse.  I have never, at any point in my life, seen a blander, duller, more boring car than this thing.  Seriously: there wasn't one unique line on the entire vehicle, except for the little cut in the hood where they install the surprisingly large Citroen badge, presumably designed to constantly remind people of the mistake they've made.

	To prove my point, I bring up one especially memorable occasion, while attempting to drive up a steep hill in Italy, when the car simply ran out of power.

The owner's manual is in Spanish!  The horn is still on. We Google ""horn"" in Spanish.  Google Translate gives us the translation for ""goat horn.""  The horn is still blaring.  The hood is up.  The crowd is growing larger.  And then… silence."

5638,"Ha ha! Just kidding! These little imperfections are all part of Monaco's charm, sort of like the principality's rocky beach, where you go to rest, and relax, and get away from it all by laying on a towel seven inches away from a 65-year-old Frenchman who thinks ""bathing suit"" is synonymous with ""jockstrap."" Really, you're constantly saying, as a tourist visiting the small country, how CHARMING!"
5639,"No, the real reason you go to Monaco, as a car enthusiast, is obvious: because they have a lot of cool cars. Oh, sure, Monaco will be forever associated with exotic sports cars and Formula 1 racing. But that's not all they have. This is proven by my most recent trip, just last week, during which I saw a DeLorean, a 1970s-era Stutz Bearcat, a 1990s Lincoln Town Car, and an original Fiat 500 that was covered in flower decals and parked next to a Ferrari 599 GTO. In fact, just about the only automotive marvel you won't find in Monaco is the ""StanceNation"" craze, which probably explains why property values there are so high."
5640,"But this column is devoted to Monaco's main automotive attraction: exotic cars. Exotic cars are everywhere in Monaco. And I mean everywhere. You can't walk down a street without seeing a Ferrari 458 Spider. You can't turn the corner without hearing the roar of a Lamborghini Aventador. You can't even hand a Euro coin to a scruffy-looking homeless man without him angrily replying: ""Do you think THAT will cover a new clutch for my 612 Scaglietti?!"" "
5641,AUTHOR'S NOTE: Just kidding on that last part. Monaco has a forcefield around the perimeter that prevents the homeless from entering.

5644,"Exotic cars are so common in Monaco that I think people who haven't been there don't really believe me when I explain the situation. In fact, when I tell people my standard line – that exotics in Monaco are as common as Corollas and Civics in the US – I tend to get one of two decidedly negative responses."
5645,"The first response is simple disbelief. Yes, people nod their heads, excitedly, like they totally understand what I mean. But you can tell that, deep down in their minds, they think I'm exaggerating. That I'm inventing things just to make Monaco seem cool. You can tell that they think I'm like the kid who tells his mommy that there's a boogeyman in the closet, poised to strike whenever it gets dark, ready to rip out his teeth and use his innards as a jump rope, and they're the mommy, who knows the only thing in the closet is some old socks."
5646,"The second response I get when discussing Monaco exotics is this bizarre insistence some car enthusiasts have to compare it to their own city. ""Ferraris in Monaco are more common than Civics in the US!"" I'll say. And the other person will reply: ""Oh yeah. That's just like [upper middle class suburb of some midsize US city, such as Saint Louis]. I see exotics all the time here. I've even seen some of the new Corvettes."" "

""No,"" I'll say. ""There are fifteen Enzos registered in Monaco! Fifteen!"" And they'll reply: ""Oh yeah, there's at least that many in [suburb]. I mean, I've seen six. My grandma has two."" "
5650,"So I've decided to help people understand just how crazy Monaco is, using the only medium that I know well: a poorly-made YouTube video. To create it, I spent the day running around the principality, wearing tennis shoes and shorts, carrying my video camera, and generally looking like the kind of American tourist who just came off a cruise ship and wants to know how to get to ""that big caseeeno."" "
5651,"It was embarrassing: people wouldn't even speak French when I approached, because they could sense the American tourist on me. ""Stupid American,"" they'd say, in that tone of contempt the French have mastered after years of eating moldy cheese as an evening snack. ""Where did you get those shorts? Some big-box retailer?! Now drink your lukewarm table water!"" And then they'd run off, nose in the air, to do something the French enjoy, such as putting on a jockstrap and going for a swim."

The Lamborghini Aventador Roadster. The Ferrari 360 Modena. Really, when you think about it, the pinnacle of everything today's finest automakers have to offer.

	I recently paid $904.61 in order to spend a week behind the wheel of the worst car I've ever driven.  It was a highly interesting experience, and I'd surely do it again, provided that my only alternate form of transportation involves getting dragged around for a while by an angry gorilla."
5658,"
	Yes, folks, that's right: I'm reviewing my European rental car.  The last time I went to Europe, 
	I also wrote a review of my rental car, and nobody really read it.  But I'm trying again, because this time I think I can captivate you.  I can excite you.  I can really draw you in.  Plus, I can deduct it all from my taxes."
5659,
5660,"
	The primary reason nobody bothered with the old review, I suspect, is that the car I drove was slow, boring, and gray.  Unfortunately, my latest rental car was even 
	more slow, and even more boring, though to be fair it's roughly the same amount of gray.  So I've decided to employ some extra special journalistic touches to keep you interested, starting with the following highly informative ""Q & A"" session:"
5661,"
Q: Is the Citroen C-Elysee the worst car you've ever driven?"
5662,"
	A: Yes."
5663,"
	Now that we have that out of the way, it's time to get a little background on the C-Elysee.  Unfortunately, I have absolutely no idea what that background is.  Wikipedia says this car was designed in China and built in Spain, though my particular rental carried a French VIN number.  The whole thing is very confusing, which probably explains why Hertz stuck it in the ""Volkswagen Golf or similar"" rental class, instead of a more appropriate segment, such as ""Wheeled Hand Cart or similar."""
5664,Advertisement
5665,
5666,"
	Whatever the case, Wikipedia is certainly right about one thing: this car was designed for, I believe the politically correct term is, ""emerging markets."" What this really means is ""people with low standards.""  Or maybe even ""people who dump out their trash in rivers.""  Put another way, the C-Elysee is so depressingly mediocre that it isn't even offered in Citroen's home market of France.  Yes, folks: this is a French car so bad that 
	even the French don't want it."
5667,"
So why is it so bad?, you're wondering.  FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY IS IT SO BAD?!"
5668,"
	To help explain, we'll start in a place where the designers clearly didn't: the engine.  Although Citroen claims my C-Elysee was powered by a 92-horsepower 1.6-liter turbodiesel, I beg to differ.  I think it was powered by whatever keeps my iPhone running, except maybe slightly detuned so things don't get really out of hand.  Seriously: I've had 1:18 scale models with more juice than this thing."
5669,Advertisement
5670,
5671,"
	Now, I know what you're thinking, and that is: 
	Oh, look! The guy with the sports car thinks a small European diesel car is too slow!  What a surprise!  But let's not forget I recently owned a Nissan Cube, which boasts 120 horsepower and the acceleration of patio furniture.  The C-Elysee lives in a whole different world of slow, a world where you sometimes pull away from a stoplight and look down at the gear lever, convinced you've accidentally started in third."
5672,"
	To prove my point, I bring up one especially memorable occasion, while attempting to drive up a steep hill in Italy, when the car simply ran out of power.  Foot on the floor, lowest gear possible, the thing was rolling backwards like a teen driver practicing hill starts in her brother's 1997 Civic coupe.  We eventually had to park the car at the bottom of the hill and climb up the old-fashioned way: dragged by an angry gorilla."
5673,"
	If the engine was bad (and it was), then the styling was worse.  I have never, at any point in my life, seen a blander, duller, more boring car than this thing.  Seriously: there wasn't one unique line on the entire vehicle, except for the little cut in the hood where they install the surprisingly large Citroen badge, presumably designed to constantly remind people of the mistake they've made.  Apparently recognizing the dull styling, Citroen installed a feature where the hazard lights blink incredibly fast, like strobe lights at a nightclub, for about 10 seconds whenever you press the remote.  Click!  Blink blink blink blink blink blink blink.  
	""Oh. That's what our car looks like?"""
5674,Advertisement
5675,
5676,"
	But the absolute worst part of the car is its ergonomics.  Yes, we can discuss the fact that it features power windows in front and crank windows in back.  We can talk about the center air vents, which only had one ""open/close"" slider, even though there were two vents.  We can mention the ""steering wheel"" stereo controls, which are actually mounted on a stalk located completely out of sight, directly behind the steering wheel.  But nothing comes close to the stereo."
5677,"
	A note to all automakers: when you make a stereo in a car, the huge, central knob should control only one thing: volume.  There are no exceptions to this.  The knob should control volume, it should 
	only control volume, and it shouldn't be allowed to control anything besides volume.  Any employee suggesting the knob's function be changed to anything but volume should have his company car immediately revoked and replaced with a Citroen C-Elysee."
5678,Advertisement
5679,
5680,"
	If, in some insanely incorrect decision approved by a group of employees whose sole automotive experience comes from watching old clips of 
	Herbie the Love Bug on late-night TV, you choose to make the central knob do anything other than volume, it should control the song track.  Turn to the right, next track.  Turn to the left, previous track.  But really, it should control volume."
5681,"
	In the C-Elysee, the central knob controlled… are you ready for it?  That's right: 
	playlist.  So what would happen is, you'd go to adjust the volume, and BAM!  You're listening to a different song, by a different artist, on a different playlist.  And then you'd go back to your previous playlist, and guess what?  The playlist starts over.  From the very. First. Song. "
5682,"
	In case you're curious, the volume buttons are over on the left of the stereo.  They're the exact same size and shape as 
	every other button, and they've been inexplicably placed directly next to the buttons for ""MODE"" and ""BAND,"" two things you never want to press when you're trying to turn up your favorite song."
5683,Advertisement
5684,
5685,"
	All this sounds pretty bad, considering that I paid more than $900 for the privilege of driving this thing for a week.  But it got even worse during a special moment I'm affectionately calling ""The Horn Incident.""  Here's what happened: at one point, I made the mistake of honking the car's horn.  This is a normal thing you do to signal your presence to other drivers, or alert someone to an impending dangerous situation.  In Europe, people honk the horn fairly often.  It's standard practice."
5686,"
	Not in the C-Elysee.  In the C-Elysee, it created pandemonium.  The horn 
	stayed on, loudly, firmly, even after I removed my hand from the horn pad, turned off the car, and stepped outside.  People are staring.  I decide to pull the fuse for the horn.

5754,"Most car guys are a little curious about the exotic car ownership experience. How does it drive on a race track? What does it sound like at full throttle in a long, glorious tunnel? How fast can you get it going on an empty highway? Well, those are all excellent questions, and today I've decided to ignore each of them. Instead, I'm going to tell you what it's like to get gas."
5755,"Getting gas in an exotic car is a lot like getting gas in your daily driver. What I mean by this is, having an exotic car won't stop you from accidentally pressing the ""car wash"" button at the pump. And then you cancel the transaction, so you have to go inside and pay. And as you're walking in, you trip over the fuel hose, and you fall on the ground, and gasoline sprays all over your shoes, and you walk around for the rest of the day smelling like a baby seal that spent its formative years in the Exxon-Valdez oil slick."
5756,But there is one especially unusual thing about getting gas in an exotic car: other people. 
5757,"Before I get started here, I want to say that I love when car enthusiasts approach me at the gas pump. When I had my E63 AMG wagon, this is all that ever happened: I'd be sitting there, filling the car with gas, and a guy would walk up and start talking about his V70R, and we'd share this blissful moment where we both realized that we were spending approximately one-quarter of our annual income on maintenance. Eventually, we'd part ways with a manly fist bump. Normal people would never approach me when I had my AMG wagon, because they thought I had just borrowed my mom's car, and also they wondered why there was some guy filling up his car without any pants on."

What kind of mileage does it get? How fast is it? What year is it? Then they start poking around the thing, as if they're trying to verify these facts for themselves. After a while, you start to feel like you're not driving a Ferrari, but rather hosting a yard sale where you're trying to unload a used lawnmower."
5759,Advertisement
5760,
5761,"As I've thought about this issue, I've specifically identified three main types of Ferrari approachers, at least one of whom I will almost surely encounter at every single gas stop. They are: "
5762,"1. Guy with other cool car, but he doesn't have it with him. For some reason, there's one of these people at every single gas station I visit. Basically, what happens is, they're filling up some normal car, like a Mazda3, or a Honda Accord, or a plumbing van, and they see you roll in. And it's at that moment they decide: you are not leaving until they can tell you about how their cousin's milkman has a 1991 Buick Reatta. "
5763,"So they open with a question about your car (""Cool car man! How many tickets have you gotten in that thing?!"") before launching into a long explanation about the Reatta (""Seriously, do you know how COOL fifteen inch wheels were in 1991?""), and after a while you wish you were an oil-covered baby seal, because at least then you'd never have to sit through an four-minute speech about the virtues of the General Motors 3800 V6."
5764,Advertisement
5765,
5766,"2. Guy who knows his car is better car than mine. Although this guy is rare, he exists, living a life of insecurity you typically only find in psychologist's offices and YouTube comments. This is the guy who walks up to me, driving his M3, and insists that a) his car is faster than mine, and b) he's a better driver than me. Now, I openly admit these things are probably true, but they don't need to be stated. I don't walk up to people at gas stations and brag that my Range Rover is taller than their cars."
5767,"So I'm always very nice to these people, and I always try to compliment their car until they realize they won't bait me into having some sort of bizarre gas station argument that eventually turns into an impromptu drag race through the streets. So they walk away, deflated, and they go back to cleaning off their angel eyes with a gas station squeegee."
5768,"3. Guy who gets way too excited. Like many people, I get excited about exotic cars I'd see on the road. Very excited, even. But some people get so excited that you wonder if, maybe, they come from a secret alien race where everyone is an exotic car, and they think mine is their mother."

Sometimes, they even ask questions so quickly that they can't possibly be hearing the answers: Is this a 458 Italia? What did it cost? What kind of mileage do you get? How fast is it? Have you gotten any tickets? Hey wait! Come back here! You're driving away in my mother!!!!"

5788,"So they open with a question about your car (""Cool car man! How many tickets have you gotten in that thing?!"") before launching into a long explanation about the Reatta (""Seriously, do you know how COOL fifteen inch wheels were in 1991?""), and after a while you wish you were an oil-covered baby seal, because at least then you'd never have to sit through an four-minute speech about the virtues of the General Motors 3800 V6."

6046,"And that brings us to a new chapter in my CarMax warranty saga.  For those of you who haven't been following along since the beginning, allow me to provide a little background.  I purchased a 2006 Range Rover from nationwide used-car superstore CarMax on December 7, 2012 (described by one commenter as ""a date that will live in Jalopnik infamy""). Along with my Range Rover, I spent $3,899 on a CarMax MaxCare warranty, which provides bumper-to-bumper coverage until December 7, 2018 (six years), or 125,000 total vehicle miles.  That may sound like a lot of money, but you have to remember that this is a Range Rover, and service bills are so expensive that they're usually measured in terms of major household appliances.

But this year has been a real whopper: in the first seven months of 2014, I've already been to the dealership three times.  There was the failed tilt steering column motor in March.  The leaking transmission sleeve and the collapsed air suspension in May.  And now, the problem with the horn."
6051,

6056,"So anyway: on Monday morning, I went into the dealership to drop off the car and pick up a loaner.  But this wouldn't be just any loaner, like a 2-door Evoque in that weird off-green color that's so ugly even squirrels won't run out in front of it on the road.  This would be an Enterprise loaner, given to customers who don't quite have a new enough Land Rover to score a base-spec LR2 with ""COURTESY CAR"" deals on the back window."

For those of you unfamiliar with this vehicle, imagine, if you will, a Jaguar the size of that old 1990s 7-Series we all love, except it trades the big honkin' manly chest-bumpin' V8 for a dainty little 2.0-liter 4-cylinder.  Admittedly, this 4-cylinder is turbocharged, which you'd think would help, but actually it makes things worse: the turbo lag is so bad that the delay between the throttle stab and any sort of real acceleration gives you several long seconds to think about all the better cars you could've had."
6062,"The good news is that I returned the Jaguar this morning and picked up my perfectly repaired Range Rover, which now has a new horn set and horn fuses.  The total cost for this repair was $229.74 (""a really nice microwave""), of which CarMax picked up all but my $50 deductible.  For those of you eagerly keeping track, my $3,899 warranty has now covered $4,870.26 in repairs — and it's only 28 percent complete.

6163,"So I'm driving along the other day, and I get up behind this woman in a Passat with out-of-state plates.  This poor woman: it was raining, it was late at night, and she probably had no idea how to get around in the big, unfamiliar city.  She was lost, confused, disoriented, unsure of herself.  "
6164,"So unsure, in fact, that she came to a complete stop in the only lane at a green light, where she probably began silently sobbing, wondering where the hell she was.  It was at this moment that I came up behind her and did what any caring, compassionate individual would do: I leaned on the horn for the better part of a minute."
6165,"No, that's not actually true: I would've leaned on the horn, but there was a problem.  After just a split-second of honking, the horn completely stopped working.  I have two horn buttons, and neither one of them made a sound.  Not a whisper.  Not even a murmur.  The horror of my predicament quickly dawned on me: I was now completely at the mercy of a person who chose to spend her hard-earned money on a Volkswagen Passat."
6166,"And that brings us to a new chapter in my CarMax warranty saga.  For those of you who haven't been following along since the beginning, allow me to provide a little background.  I purchased a 2006 Range Rover from nationwide used-car superstore CarMax on December 7, 2012 (described by one commenter as ""a date that will live in Jalopnik infamy""). Along with my Range Rover, I spent $3,899 on a CarMax MaxCare warranty, which provides bumper-to-bumper coverage until December 7, 2018 (six years), or 125,000 total vehicle miles.  That may sound like a lot of money, but you have to remember that this is a Range Rover, and service bills are so expensive that they're usually measured in terms of major household appliances. (""Sorry, Jim, but your air suspension is out. The total's going to come to two refrigerators and a ceiling fan."")"
6167,
6168,Advertisement
6169,
6170,"The first year of ownership was fairly uneventful, by which I mean CarMax only paid out around $1,700 in warranty claims.  But this year has been a real whopper: in the first seven months of 2014, I've already been to the dealership three times.  There was the failed tilt steering column motor in March.  The leaking transmission sleeve and the collapsed air suspension in May.  And now, the problem with the horn."
6171,
6172,"When I called the dealer Friday morning to schedule an appointment, a helpful service advisor answered the phone.  ""Mister DeMuro!"" she said, excitedly, once I explained the situation.  ""You're the one with MaxCare!"""
6173,Advertisement
6174,
6175,"That's right, folks: I've become known at the local Land Rover dealership as The One With MaxCare.  This is probably because I'm the only customer who doesn't get into a screaming argument with the service staff about why they charge approximately the same hourly rate as a former US president on the professional speaking circuit."
6176,"So anyway: on Monday morning, I went into the dealership to drop off the car and pick up a loaner.  But this wouldn't be just any loaner, like a 2-door Evoque in that weird off-green color that's so ugly even squirrels won't run out in front of it on the road.  This would be an Enterprise loaner, given to customers who don't quite have a new enough Land Rover to score a base-spec LR2 with ""COURTESY CAR"" deals on the back window."
6177,"But what would it be?!?!  I was so excited to find out.  Since Enterprise isn't tied in to an automaker, it could be just about anything.  Maybe a Dodge Journey SE.  Maybe a Dodge Journey SXT.  Maybe some fleet-only Dodge Journey trim level, which smells faintly of decomposing flesh.  The possibilities were endless!"
6178,Advertisement
6179,
6180,"Imagine my surprise, then, when the Enterprise guy came over and told me he had a Jaguar for me.  Initially, I thought he was talking to someone else: here I am, sitting in the waiting room, wearing flip flops and a stained Laguna Seca Raceway shirt, skimming through Travis's tweets on my phone, and this guy is giving me a Jaguar?  For free?  There had to be some catch."
6181,"But there wasn't a catch, unless you count the fact that this particular Jaguar was the XF 4-cylinder.  For those of you unfamiliar with this vehicle, imagine, if you will, a Jaguar the size of that old 1990s 7-Series we all love, except it trades the big honkin' manly chest-bumpin' V8 for a dainty little 2.0-liter 4-cylinder.  Admittedly, this 4-cylinder is turbocharged, which you'd think would help, but actually it makes things worse: the turbo lag is so bad that the delay between the throttle stab and any sort of real acceleration gives you several long seconds to think about all the better cars you could've had."
6182,"The good news is that I returned the Jaguar this morning and picked up my perfectly repaired Range Rover, which now has a new horn set and horn fuses.  The total cost for this repair was $229.74 (""a really nice microwave""), of which CarMax picked up all but my $50 deductible.  For those of you eagerly keeping track, my $3,899 warranty has now covered $4,870.26 in repairs — and it's only 28 percent complete.  And while the car's seven trips to the dealer in 20 months might seem like an inconvenience, I suspect my attitude to this whole thing is largely the same as yours: I can't wait to see what breaks next.

6188,"This all arose from a little Twitter challenge from Bloomberg's Matt Miller. At first he was asking if I'd buy a Cayman or a 911. I'd get a 911, mainly because a Cayman is a Porsche, a 911 is the Porsche. It's the icon, it's the car that Porsche has honed and refined for the last 50 years. It's what you think of when you hear the word Porsche."
6189,"The rules for this are simple: Build the 991-generation 911 you'd want to own. Yes, in an ideal world we'd all have GT3s with a manual, but that's not a thing that exists. And don't go crazy on spec-ing out the car and say you want a $200,000 Targa that's yellow with red seats. I don't believe you unless you're Ronald McDonald. Try and be realistic, please."
6190,"My configuration is linked here. It's a 911 GT3, white with black interior, the big fuel tank, model delete, LED headlights, red seatbelts, carbon brakes, and the front axle lift. That's all I need. Price comes to $147,555."

	The starting point is that the 205 GTI is generally considered the best hot hatch ever made. Many hot hatches have followed it (the 106 Rallye, the the MkIV GTI, the Renaultsport Megane 26.r, and the Pulsar GTI-R spring to mind) and a number preceded it (the Talbot Sunbeam, the Omni GLH-S, and the original Golf GTI are just a few). Still, none of them seem as eager, as balanced, as charming as the Peugeot 205 GTI."
6284,"
	Part of that charm comes down to the car's history."
6285,Advertisement
6286,
6287,"
	You could call the Peugeot 205 the car that saved Peugeot. Through the '70s the company had bought up then-bankrupt Citroen and also near-to-the-grave Chrysler Europe. After taking up all their debt, Peugeot found itself struggling. It was 
	losing billions of Francs a year, laying off workers by the tens of thousands and facing strikes in its factories across Europe. The result? Strikes and riots, particularly with North African immigrant workers, who got less pay and particularly poor conditions, as Victoria Marklew writes in Cash, Crisis, and Corporate Governance."
6288,"
	It was, as the 
	New York Times put it, ""an industry in distress."" Peugeot's lineup of dull, large family car was exactly the opposite of what the company needed."
6289,"
	Backing from the government helped keep Peugeot afloat (as did import restrictions on Japanese cars), but they might never have made it if it weren't for how much people wanted their brand new car, the 205."
6290,Advertisement
6291,
6292,"
	It looked good, it rode well, drove well, came with fully independent suspension, plenty of room for its size, good equipment, and even offered diesel engines 
	good enough to bring the fuel into the mainstream, a huge turning point for the European car industry."
6293,"
	What's more, the car became a kind of folk hero in competition, as well."
6294,"
	The 205 came out in 1983, just as Group B rallying was getting into full swing."
6295,Advertisement
6296,
6297,"
	In the history of car racing, there have only been a few modern series that have been basically anything-goes with the rules, and Group B was one of them. All an automaker had to do was build two hundred road-legal cars and they could run virtually unrestricted on narrow, treacherous forest and mountain roads."
6298,"
	The series got filled up with unbelievably advanced cars with an unprecedented amount of power for rallying. The cars from Audi and Lancia were fire-breathing beasts, and huge crowds and TV coverage followed suit."
6299,Advertisement
6300,
6301,"
	Peugeot got into Group B with their diminutive 205, and handily whupped the competition. Today we continue to idolize the legendary Audi Quattro, but it got thrashed by the little ""205 GTI Turbo 16."" You can watch 
	right here a little video interview that Juha Kankkunen gave where talks about how sweet the Peugeot handled, much more so than its competition."
6302,"
		It was more like a go-kart, a very easy car to drive.
	"
6303,"
		The Peugeot, you could even throw it a little bit sideways, and play more with the car.
	"
6304,"
		It was very, very easy. The smaller road you had, the faster the Peugeot was.
	"
6305,Advertisement
6306,
6307,"
	It's kind of a surprising bit of praise, since the 205 Turbo 16 shouldn't really be a good car to drive. The engine was moved to the middle, where the rear seats should be. The car's short 95-inch wheelbase should have made it twitchy and uncontrollable (as was the case with its rival, the Audi Quattro S1), but the Peugeot just soaked up its hundreds of horsepower and rocketed to two world championship titles. It even raced with
	 ground effects technology like the turbo F1 cars of the day, but that was banned almost before a single event was over."
6308,"
	It had tech that was too crazy for Group B. Think about that for a minute."
6309,"
	The car became a bit of a folk hero, a giant slayer in possibly the toughest major motorsport of the '80s."
6310,Advertisement
6311,
6312,"
	Group B ended up getting canned in '86 after it proved itself too fast, too dangerous to exist. A number of drivers died including one of rally's rising stars and another that was broadcast on TV, many more spectators died, including three in one crash alone."
6313,"
	There's something particularly alluring about rallying that can make a hold hero out of a car - that the 205 Turbo 16 racecar was and looked so similar to what was in Peugeot showrooms across Europe, and that it competed on real roads. The speed and the drama of the 205 certainly played a part, as well. Watch one sideways on ultra-skinny studded tires in Sweden to see what I mean."
6314,Advertisement
6315,
6316,"
	And there was the danger. Group B was a crucible, and the 205 emerged as the folk hero of the series."
6317,"
	Peugeot even had to sell road-going versions of the midengined rally car to the public. It was possible to see one of these things puttering through your town square, air scoops and all. "
6318,Advertisement
6319,
6320,"
	In truth, only a few hundred people will ever own a 205 Turbo 16. That car's glow, however, shone onto its little brother, the 205 GTI."
6321,"While the Turbo 16 got a custom midengine/4WD setup, the GTI remained front engined and front-drive. Not that it lost any of its beauty behind the wheel."
6322,Advertisement
6323,
6324,"In '85 CAR Magazine called it ""the finest-handling front-drive sports hatchback we have ever driven."" They found it was as fast or faster on track than not only all the cars in its class, but those a size larger."
6325,"
		The Peugeot raced nonchalantly and effortlessly around the circuit , executing four-wheel drifts at speeds that would send most front-driven fast hatchbacks understeering off ignominiously.
	"
6326,Advertisement
6327,
6328,"
	It didn't have heaps of power, so it had to be driven hard. The steering never seemed to lighten up, so it always needed to be muscled at speed. It might have felt a bit like a man's car, but excellent damping gave it a good ride even for rough British backroads, and it came with all of the space and ease of any other hatchback."
6329,Advertisement
6330,
6331,"
	The only way to think to improve the car would be to give it a bit more power, and that's exactly what the car got in '87. The 1.6 engine switched out some internals for those in the optional 1.9. The revvy smaller engine rose from 104 to 115 horsepower. The bigger, slightly lazier 1.9 threw around 126 horsepower, or 120 with a catalytic converter."
6332,"
	It was the best car in its class, but it wasn't the most expensive. High rates of car theft in the UK in the late '80s and '90s made all hot hatches very difficult to insure, but the 205 GTI remained about as affordable as it could be. Peugeot sold tons of them, and if you happen to find yourself wandering the streets of any major European city, you'll probably see one or two driving around."
6333,Advertisement
6334,
6335,"
	And that's where I was, in Paris, when I saw it. The VW-aping red trim caught my eye a block away. Grime on the windows, sizable dents all around the back, the rear badge half broken off."
6336,"
	I knew that in America this car would be cherished and pampered. I dreamed of polishing the car before touring through the choppy pavement of upstate New York. Perfectly adjusted valves singing off to the 6,500 rpm redline, 185-section tires barely squealing over a rock-lined rise."
6337,Advertisement
6338,
6339,"
	But on its home soil, the 205 GTI remains a beacon of practical, affordable, even disposable speed. That's a kind of car that I want to exist for people. A car that opens the world up, not one that closes it off with serious springs or tiny trunks or anti-social cramped cabins. The 205 GTI is a car that you and the whole world enjoys."
6340,"
	That's why I think that even though it's so attainable, it still deserves a spot in the Jalopnik Fantasy Garage. What do you think?"

6430,"Of course, all automakers set guidelines for their dealers, but Honda is well known as being among the most restrictive, the story says. And the consequences are real: too many violations mean dealers could lose Honda's $400 per vehicle ""marketing assistance."" "

6444,"The Fiesta ST is a hot hatchback. The world's been getting those for more than 30 years now. It's the same classic hot hatchback recipe as always: take a humble economy car, add more power, mix in an improved suspension, and keep the price reasonable. (Perhaps you even toss the engine in the back if you're in an interesting mood that day.) You get cheap performance with everyday practicality."

You can fit lots of stuff in it and park it just about anywhere. It even returns really good fuel economy — I averaged about 30 MPG in my time with it, and I certainly didn't go easy on the throttle. "
6448,"And most of all, the damn thing is just a ton of fun to drive. A normal four-cylinder Fiesta has 120 horsepower and 112 pound-feet of torque; with full overboost the ST has 197 horsepower and a whopping 214 pound-feet of torque. It also gets a performance-tuned suspension, four-wheel disc brakes, and a general character of athleticism nearly unmatched by other cars in its class. "

6475,"Because the Fiesta ST is so tiny and loud, it always manages to feel like it's going faster than it is.

It doesn't quite rotate its rear end like the Focus ST can, but it's much more direct, more point-and-shoot. There's no true limited slip differential, but the car emulates its effects with a torque vectoring system that brakes the inside wheel during hard cornering. "

6515,"But when I drove this car, I thought to myself, ""Would I ever need more car than this?"" And the answer was no, not really. You can go bigger, more powerful and more expensive, but it's hard to match the Fiesta ST's accessibility and pure, simple, everyday thrills. Plus, other, less well-equipped STs can be had for much closer to $21,000. "

6543,"As you may know, I'm weirdly obsessed with vehicle lighting systems. It's unhealthy. My wife has made me leave my collection of marker lights in the closet when we're, um, intimate. But still, I feel there's things I need to address. Like cornering lights."
6544,
6545,"Cornering lights are one of those types of vehicular lighting that aren't required by law anywhere, and aren't even particularly common. They're entirely voluntary, simply a good idea that gets implemented by thoughtful car-makers every now and then."
6546,"They're pretty much what the name suggests: a light used to help when turning corners. They're not so much an indicator light to communicate an intent to other drivers, but more of a light to help with visibility for the driver themselves. In that sense, they're more like headlights, or perhaps reverse lights."
6547,Advertisement
6548,
6549,"Cornering lights are normally white lights positioned usually at the front fenders of the car — very occasionally at the rear as well — and often integrated with the front side marker and/or turn indictaor lights. When the turn signal is activated, they illuminate, casting light around the corner being turned, so the driver can see the curb, the road, or the packs of ice weasels that may be lurking right around a dark bend. "
6550,Advertisement
6551,
6552,"Corner lights were introduced by Cadillac in 1962, and soon spread all over the GM fleet. As the delightfully obsessive site AutoBrevity says of the lights:"
6553,"In 1962, Cadillac announced a few new safety features, including the first separate front and rear braking systems. Among the new safety features for the year was an item Cadillac called the cornering lamp. Marketed by Cadillac as a safety feature, the brochure presented it as ""...an exclusive new cornering lamp that lights your way around turns..."" And it was part of the standard equipment package on every Cadillac model for 1962."
6554,"The cornering lamp was mounted near the forward edge of the front fender, just above the wrap around part of the bumper. It consisted of a clear lens surrounded by a chrome bezel, and it projected a clear, bright, steady beam of light in the direction of a turn. Operation of the cornering lamp was controlled by the turn indicator switch, which turned on the corresponding cornering lamp automatically, and the light was extinguished when the turn indicator was cancelled by returning the steering wheel back to the straight ahead position. The cornering lamp was wired through the headlight switch so it only worked when the parking or headlamps were turned on, as Cadillac felt it would be most effective during the hours of darkness or inclement weather."
6555,"The steady beam of bright light helped illuminate the way around dark corners, a benefit especially appreciated by drivers navigating their way in unknown territory. The cornering lamps also served as a warning to oncoming traffic that a car was about to make a turn. They were also helpful in illuminating addresses stenciled onto curbs, and they became part of the Twilight Sentinel feature, which not only automatically turned on and off headlamps according to lighting conditions, but allowed drivers to leave the headlamps on upon exiting the car to illuminate their way into their homes. One of the cornering lamps could also be illuminated by moving the turn indicator in the direction of the desired light. The delay period could be set from several seconds to several minutes, depending on individual preference."
6556,"This feature would become a staple of Cadillac's standard equipment from that point forward, and is still found on the new models. There are a few exceptions, such as the Cadillac Cimarron, which many Cadillac enthusiasts don't consider a true Cadillac anyway, but the vast majority of Cadillacs built since 1962 all have this one thing in common."
6557,Advertisement
6558,
6559,"The case of the C4 Corvette is especially interesting. Cornering lights were normally a staple of big American sedans and luxury cars, so having them on a sports car like the 'Vette was already unsual, let alone having them at the rear as well. Really, if your main criteria for buying a car was safe, well-illuminated cornering, you really can't do better than a C4 Corvette."
6560,"Cornering lights showed up on many American cars (Ford LTDs, for example) and a few foreign makes as well — the always safety-concerned Swedes stuck them on many Volvos and Saabs. "
6561,Advertisement
6562,
6563,"They're still around on a number of cars, and steerable headlights have replaced them on some makes, but there's still a lot of appeal to these often-unsung little illuminators of the dark bends. "
6564,"I encourage everyone to look around for some cars with cornering lights as you drive around tonight, or, better, if your car has them, really revel in those crisp white beams shooting out of your sides."
6565,"During my recent trans-continental drive, after about hour 300 of slogging across America's infinitely-wide state, Oklahoma, I found myself daydreaming about the possible benefits of an autonomous car. But I wanted to keep this archaic old RV, so I thought what about an autonomous driver-bot? This should be a thing, right?"
6566,
6567,"I've been in autonomous cars before, and so far they've all been converted production models, like a Nissan Leaf, or those Priuses Google has been using. The electronics and sensor packages are discreet units that are installed in/on the cars, and the car's actual controls are usually accessed via the car's drive-by-wire system."
6568,
6569,"It should be possible, I'd think, once the electronics are refined and packaged efficiently, to create an autonomous driving unit that is transportable and can be easily installed in pretty much any car. This could allow for use cases like the one I experienced, where you could make a vintage car (or RV, why not) into a self-driving (or really, robot-driven) vehicle quickly and easily."
6570,Advertisement
6571,
6572,"There are, of course, significant challenges and restrictions associated with this. The unit would need to be roughly humanoid in form, to occupy the driving position of the car. Since you can't always count on drive-by-wire controls in a car, especially a vintage one, physical interfaces to the car's controls would be needed. "
6573,"For the pedals, this problem has already been solved by the auto towing and trailering submarket. There's products known as supplemental braking systems that are essentially robotic feet that press a towed vehicle's brake pedal. This same basic concept would be used on our robotic chauffeur, but instead of just the brake, a unit, connected via Bluetooth or other wireless link to the main torso unit, would actuate the brake, accelerator, and, if present, the clutch."
6574,Advertisement
6575,
6576,"The pedal unit, since it could be wirelessly controlled, could be repositioned on the vehicle's floor wherever needed. The steering wheel controls on the main body of the robot would need to be adjustable and secured to the wheel via some manner of clamp system. An extra arm on the robot could be trained to find the locations of other controls, like lights, wipers, indicators, etc. "
6577,"The robot's main body would be placed in the driver's seat and secured with the standard seat belts, if available. If not, supplemental restraints could be used to secure the unit in place. The bottom of the main unit would have a rubberized pad to eliminate sliding on even the most American of huge vinyl bench seats."
6578,Advertisement
6579,
6580,"If an OBD-II port is available, the robot could connect to that to get vehicle data, like speed, RPMs, etc to assist with driving. If it's an older vehicle, speed would be calculated via the robot's GPS system, and RPMs could be assessed either via audio cues, visual inspection of a tachometer, or some combination of both."
6581,"If the car requires shifting, there would likely need to be a third arm dedicated to controlling the gearshift. Initial setup would allow the robot to pick between standard patterns (4-speed H-pattern, 3-on-the-tree, 6-speed, whatever) and perhaps a brief training session would be needed with a driver shifting to train the arm to the gear's locations. Clutch point and pressure would likely require a similar training session to get right as well."
6582,Advertisement
6583,
6584,"The head of the robot would contain the main visual, sonar, radar, and other sensors, though it's likely additional sensors would need to be mounted to the exterior of the car as well, where they could communicate wirelessly with the main unit."
6585,"These autonomous driving units would have to be a bit more flexible and robust than units built into a single car, for the obvious reason that their inputs would have much more variable results than in cars who's characteristics are already known. Still, I think the technology is rapidly approaching a point where this could be possible."
6586,"Think how handy this could be! Aside from taking over driving on long, straight, boring stretches of highway, the robot chauffeur could be used as a tow alternative if you have multiple cars to transport to a rally or car show or wherever. Just drive your, say, Lancia Stratos and let the robot follow you in your restored 2CV. Have it take your classic to the detailer while you lay around in your underwear, eating corn chips and playing video games. Start a long trip in your Jensen Interceptor, and then pull it out of the hatch when you want a nap or just get tired of driving. And, perhaps most importantly, perhaps systems like these could be the way to keep older, interesting cars on the road even in areas where autonomous cars may become mandated at some point in the future."
6587,Advertisement
6588,
6589,"Autonomous cars are coming, and while they're not exactly an enthusiast's dream, there are some pretty huge safety and convenience advantages hey could offer. It seems that the option to take advantage of these benefits, on demand, in any car you want, could be a really useful thing."
6590,So who's got an old robot sitting around looking for work? 
6591,"Three episodes in and James May's Cars of the People has already deviated a bit. This episode includes such proletariat rides as the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, Lamborghini Countach, and Porsche 911 Turbo. But as with all things James May, there's a method to his madness."

	With a new presidential limo contract soon to be awarded, it's probably a good time to look at the current terrible limo. Like America's foreign policy at the time of its introduction, ""The Beast"" was a clumsy solution to a delicate set of priorities that caused more problems that it solved."
6595,"
	We were all excited when ""The Beast"" first appeared in photos back in 2009. It seemed like a giant tank, which it kind of is."
6596,
6597,"
	Specifically, the Secret Service-requested vehicle is a heavy-duty GMC Topkick truck platform that had been cleverly designed to look like a Cadillac STS on the outside so that you can't quite tell it's basically a dump truck underneath."

	There's eight inches of armor plating around the 18-foot-long vehicle with glass thick enough to deflect Iron Man and titanium and kevlar basically everywhere. There's only one window that opens, and even that only drops three inches to allow for the driver to talk to other agents or pay tolls or whatever. It's even rumored to have a spare oxygen tank to provide fresh air in the event of a terrorist gas attack."
6602,"
	In the sense that it can keep the President alive under a heavy attack The Beast seems like it would do a fine job of resistant bombardment even though, thankfully, we've never seen that tested."

	Unfortunately, in every other way the current fleet of vehicles — which includes the older DTS-style, truck-based limos from 2005 — is pretty terrible."
6606,
6607,"
	Let's start with the size. The limos are far too big. So big they can be thwarted by a slightly angled driveway as in the video above at the U.S. Embassy in Dublin. All those large 7-Series limos can make it through but the big, heavy, DTS limo gets stuck."

	Here's ""The Beast"" unable to get around the driveway at 10 Downing Street where the British Prime Minister lives."
6611,
6612,"I'm not an expert on security, but I've visited armoring companies and talked to experts about their goals when designing these vehicles and they talk a lot about how they try to keep the passengers alive long enough to get them somewhere safe. Therefore, being stuck is a bad thing."
6613,Advertisement
6614,
6615,"To the credit of the designers, it's possible that the lower overhangs of the new STS-style Beast and what appears to be a taller ride height may have diminished this problem, but they seem to be using the older versions overseas in Europe where the streets aren't designed for 'Murican trucks — possibly because the new Beast is just too big."
6616,"
	But let's say there's no high curb or angled drive in the way. Let's say The Beast has nothing but open road ahead. Right now it's slow. Too slow. The top-speed is said to be 60 mph, meaning a bad guy in an old Beetle could easily catch up to it. It's actually slower than The Beast wooden roller coaster."

6618,
6619,"Some have complained that the vehicle is diesel since this leads to fuel-related mixups, but I actually think a diesel-powered vehicle makes sense given the relative stability of the fuel. Still, even with a diesel engine this gas guzzler only gets 8 mpg, which is terrible."
6620,"
	Finally, it's ugly. Cadillac has moved far away from this design language because it's so bland. The Germans, the Russians, hell, even the Chinese have better looking limousines."
6621,"
	American carmakers have turned their product quality and design around in the last few years and we deserve a presidential limo that reflects that. Maybe a Tesla?"

6652,"If you spend enough time writing on the Internet, you'll eventually be accused of creating a ""clickbait"" headline.  You know what I'm talking about: the headline mentions a revolutionary new advancement in modern technology, something that will change our lives forever, a feat of engineering that will alter the course of history as we know it, but the article is about shoes. "
6653,"Well, at first glance, today's column might seem a bit like that.  My headline has it all: a car crash.  A Formula 1 race.  A diamond that's worth more than a large home in suburban Des Moines.  And most importantly, the loss of this diamond, which adds an entirely new level of intrigue.  Was it stolen?  Damaged?  Pilfered?  Robbed?  Eaten?  YOU'LL HAVE TO CLICK MY ARTICLE TO FIND OUT, MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!"
6654,Advertisement
6655,
6656,"But I can assure you, dearest readers, that my headline isn't writing checks that this column can't cash.  On the contrary, the actual story of the Missing Formula 1 Diamond (dun dun dunnn…) is even more ridiculous than the headline makes it seem.  And today, you'll be treated to a full explanation of the entire thing from me, a bona fide expert on the topic, as I recently read several brief news articles about it."
6657,"To understand the full story behind the Missing Formula 1 Diamond, you'll have to take yourself back to 2004, which is when the entire event took place.  It's also the year that Ocean's Twelve came out in theatres.  You may also remember Ocean's Twelve, since it was the finest of the Ocean's movies, as measured on the age-old scale of total number of in-movie Range Rover appearances.  Other films that score highly on this scale include documentaries about the Queen, and of course that YouTube video of the guy who ran over all those motorcyclists a couple of years ago in Manhattan."
6658,Advertisement
6659,
6660,"Anyway: I bring this up because diamonds don't just find their own way into Formula 1 car races.  Instead, diamonds are added to Formula 1 races as part of, for instance, a movie promotion.  In this case, the diamond we're discussing showed up as part of a promotion for Ocean's Twelve, which is our first Point of Curiosity, considering that movie revolved around the theft of a Faberge egg.  "
6661,"But no matter: that's actually the most logical thing about today's Missing Formula 1 Diamond story.  Next, we move on to the least logical thing: the placement of the diamond.  You see, in order to fully advertise this movie, promoters apparently decided that they needed to make a huge splash, perhaps feeling that the first movie's $350 million box office profit wasn't quite enough. "
6662,"So what they did was, they went to the most popular race of the Formula 1 calendar — the Monaco Grand Prix — and they installed the diamond on the nose of a race car.  But this wasn't just any race car: they put this diamond on the front of an actual race car that would be racing in the actual Formula 1 race.  And it wasn't just one diamond: they did this with two different diamonds on two different race cars, both of which were taking part in the Grand Prix."
6663,Advertisement
6664,
6665,"Most importantly, this wasn't just some cheap little diamond your cousin might get from her forklift driver boyfriend after he proposes to her at Red Lobster.  The diamonds installed on the front of these race cars were reportedly worth $300,000 each — on loan from Israeli gem firm Steinmetz, who (surprise, surprise!) couldn't find anyone to insure them, presumably because every possible insurance agent who heard the idea quickly collapsed from a laughing-induced heart attack."
6666,"So just to be clear, here's the situation: we have two Formula 1 race cars driving around the most challenging track in the sport, reaching triple-digit speeds, racing neck-and-neck alongside other vehicles, with $300,000 diamonds strapped to their nose cone."
6667,Advertisement
6668,
6669,"OK, so we know that the inevitable happened. But here's the crazy part: it happened on the first lap.  Yes, that's right: Jaguar driver Christian Klien crashed his diamond-encrusted F1 car at the Loews Corner before he ever finished one trip around the circuit, thus creating a frenzy in the area around the crash as excited spectators went looking for the diamond.  And here's the really crazy part: track safety regulations prohibited Team Jaguar from searching for the diamond until after the race ended two hours later. "
6670,"To clarify what everyone was thinking during those two hours, here's an actual quote from Jaguar team spokesman Nav Sidhu about the crash: ""At that point, I probably should've been worried about the car or the driver.  But, I must admit, my immediate thought was for the diamond."""
6671,Advertisement
6672,
6673,"Of course, by the time the Jaguar folks arrived on the scene, the diamond was long gone.  No one knows what happened to it, though I'm thinking about doing a story on the aftermath. It would have no new information, of course, but there would be a clickbaity headline; something along the lines of: JEWEL THIEF MAKES OFF WITH $300,000 DIAMOND AFTER RACE CAR CRASH!!!

6683,Could be pretty clever.
6684,"A friend of mine recently purchased a Toyota Corolla.  Here's how it happened: my friend came up to me one day and said ""I'm going to purchase a Toyota Corolla!""  And I replied: ""OH GOD NO!! WHY??!? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?? TO SOCIETY??  TO HUMANITY!?? YOU ARE RUINING EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD!!"""
6685,"But my friend ignored my tirade, largely because he knows my current profession involves sitting around the house without any pants on and eating animal crackers.  Plus, he wasn't getting just any Corolla.  He was getting a Corolla with free maintenance."
6686,"Yes, that's right: my friend made his car-buying decision based on something called Toyota Care, which is a two-year or 25,000-mile program that touts the amazing benefit of no-cost automotive maintenance.  Only, there's a problem: this program, and all free maintenance programs, are just a huge marketing gimmick, primarily designed to appeal to the kind of person who hears the word ""free"" and gets excited like a Price is Right contestant who just won a sleeper sofa."
6687,"In order to explain what I mean, I'm going to shift gears from Toyota (Automotive Metaphor - 100 points) and instead shame Volkswagen, which I try to do as often as possible.  You see, several years ago, Volkswagen instituted a free maintenance program entitled ""Carefree Maintenance,"" which was presumably designed to address the perception we all have of Volkswagen products: that someday, when you're driving along, you may go to reach for the volume knob and discover that your passenger door has fallen off."

Maybe you have a family member who works at the Volkswagen dealership, and they're doing a special this month where the guy who sells the most cars gets a free floor lamp, and the guy who sells the least cars gets his ears chopped off."
6692,"But anyway, you purchased a new Jetta, and you're all excited because Volkswagen is going to take care of the maintenance, free of charge, for the next two years or 24,000 miles.  Two years! 24,000 miles!  THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES!  YOU COULD DRIVE AROUND THE WORLD!  TWICE!  OR TO THE GROCERY STORE A BUNCH OF TIMES!  "
6693,"But then you check the fine print and discover exactly what's covered: oil changes, tire rotations, and ""vehicle inspections,"" which probably consist of cursory glances from the guy who Windexes the Volkswagen logo in front of the dealership. (""Uh, sir? Your passenger door has fallen off."")  "
6694,Advertisement
6695,
6696,"And then you realize something else: in your new Jetta, the recommended interval for your oil changes and tire rotations is — get ready for it — ten thousand miles. So it turns out that your two years of free maintenance actually amounts to two oil changes and two tire rotations, and nothing further."
6697,"In other words: that free maintenance program you were so excited about will save you $150.  Maybe it'll save you $200, because Volkswagen probably charges a premium for their oil changes just so you don't feel like you're missing out on the true German car experience."
6698,"I know there are people out there who will say: ""HEY MAN! ONE FIFTY IS ONE FIFTY! BETTER THAN ZERO!!!""  But the simple truth is, that's not the case when it comes to buying a car.  As an example, say you walk into a Chrysler dealership and you have a pulse.  BOOM! You just got yourself $150 off, right there, regardless of whether you're man, woman, child, or adult raccoon.  And even if you didn't have a pulse, Chrysler would probably still get you a good interest rate on a Dodge Journey. "

6701,"Now, I suspect a few people will reply here and agree that normal car free maintenance programs are pretty stupid, but luxury brands go above and beyond to make them worth it.  BMW, for instance, is famous for offering the best program in the business: 4 years or 50,000 miles — and they cover brakes, which can be a bit on the pricey side when you're talking about a European luxury car."
6702,"But here's the thing: nobody keeps a BMW for that long.  Yes, I realize I'm generalizing here, but I do that a lot.  I mean, you don't actually think a Chrysler dealer would give an adult raccoon $150 off, do you?  Of course not!  They'd give it some pine nuts, and then try to sell it a Grand Caravan. "
6703,"Really, though: just over half of BMW drivers lease their cars – a number that climbs to 60 percent if we're talking about the volume-selling 3-Series.  And BMW has a nice little clause in its new car paperwork that says its free maintenance contract applies only to the first owner or lessor.  As a result, the majority of drivers will never see those free brakes.  Among the ones who buy, rather than lease, a huge portion won't keep the car four years anyway — and of those who do, not all will wear down the brakes far enough to qualify for free ones."

But they're also getting you in the service bay, where they undoubtedly try to sell you a wide variety of other items, all of which help to pay for that free stuff they're giving away.  In fact, this is how I imagine most free maintenance-related phone calls go:"
6707,"Service writer: Hello, Sir.  We got your free tire rotation taken care of.Owner: Great!Service writer: Unfortunately, we also have to replace the entire radio because we chopped off our worst salesman's ears and one of them got stuck in the CD player.Owner: Oh no!Service writer: Also, your passenger door has fallen off."

6712,"A friend of mine recently purchased a Toyota Corolla.  Here's how it happened: my friend came up to me one day and said ""I'm going to purchase a Toyota Corolla!""  And I replied: ""OH GOD NO!! WHY??!? HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO YOURSELF?? TO SOCIETY??  TO HUMANITY!?? YOU ARE RUINING EVERYTHING THAT'S RIGHT WITH THE WORLD!!"""
6713,"But my friend ignored my tirade, largely because he knows my current profession involves sitting around the house without any pants on and eating animal crackers.  Plus, he wasn't getting just any Corolla.  He was getting a Corolla with free maintenance."
6714,"Yes, that's right: my friend made his car-buying decision based on something called Toyota Care, which is a two-year or 25,000-mile program that touts the amazing benefit of no-cost automotive maintenance.  Only, there's a problem: this program, and all free maintenance programs, are just a huge marketing gimmick, primarily designed to appeal to the kind of person who hears the word ""free"" and gets excited like a Price is Right contestant who just won a sleeper sofa."
6715,"In order to explain what I mean, I'm going to shift gears from Toyota (Automotive Metaphor - 100 points) and instead shame Volkswagen, which I try to do as often as possible.  You see, several years ago, Volkswagen instituted a free maintenance program entitled ""Carefree Maintenance,"" which was presumably designed to address the perception we all have of Volkswagen products: that someday, when you're driving along, you may go to reach for the volume knob and discover that your passenger door has fallen off."
6716,"So I recently took a closer look at this highly touted Carefree Maintenance program, and I realized something: it really doesn't offer all that much. "
6717,Advertisement
6718,
6719,"To help you understand why I say this, I present to you a hypothetical situation. Say you just purchased a brand-new 2014 Jetta. I don't know why you did this.  You don't know why you did this.  Maybe you have a family member who works at the Volkswagen dealership, and they're doing a special this month where the guy who sells the most cars gets a free floor lamp, and the guy who sells the least cars gets his ears chopped off."
6720,"But anyway, you purchased a new Jetta, and you're all excited because Volkswagen is going to take care of the maintenance, free of charge, for the next two years or 24,000 miles.  Two years! 24,000 miles!  THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES!  YOU COULD DRIVE AROUND THE WORLD!  TWICE!  OR TO THE GROCERY STORE A BUNCH OF TIMES!  "
6721,"But then you check the fine print and discover exactly what's covered: oil changes, tire rotations, and ""vehicle inspections,"" which probably consist of cursory glances from the guy who Windexes the Volkswagen logo in front of the dealership. (""Uh, sir? Your passenger door has fallen off."")  "
6722,Advertisement
6723,
6724,"And then you realize something else: in your new Jetta, the recommended interval for your oil changes and tire rotations is — get ready for it — ten thousand miles. So it turns out that your two years of free maintenance actually amounts to two oil changes and two tire rotations, and nothing further."
6725,"In other words: that free maintenance program you were so excited about will save you $150.  Maybe it'll save you $200, because Volkswagen probably charges a premium for their oil changes just so you don't feel like you're missing out on the true German car experience."

6740,"I recently completed a 900-mile move from Atlanta to Philadelphia.  It was long, and arduous, and difficult, and I spent a large portion of it wishing I could claw my eyes out with a flathead screwdriver.  Here I'm referring to the part of the move where I had to deal with Comcast."
6741,"The rest of the move wasn't quite so bad.  You'd know this if you followed me on Twitter, because I posted several highly exciting eyewitness photos from the open road. There was, for example, the group of exotic cars that had been stopped by police just outside of Atlanta, presumably for racing.  And the Audi RS6 in central Virginia with the coolest vanity plate of all time."
6742,But what I didn't cover on social media is possibly the most exciting automotive part of the entire trip: what it's like to drive across the country in a fully-loaded 17-foot U-Haul with windshield wipers older than a second-grader.  So I'm going to do that now.
6743,"To begin, I should say that my U-Haul really was fully loaded, top to bottom, front to back, to the point where I had to push things into place as I shut the door, knowing that someday, if I ever made it to Philadelphia, it would immediately fall on my face.  "
6744,"This is because I didn't pack the U-Haul myself.  If I had packed the U-Haul myself, there would've been two U-Hauls, one marked ""PILLOWS"" and the other marked ""BROKEN STUFF.""  Instead, we hired two professional movers to pack it, and they utilized every square inch in the way that only two seasoned veterans of the moving industry can.  So we sat back, got out of the way, let them do their thing, and watched as they used up every nook and cranny of the moving truck, perfectly packaging all my goods with impressive, skillful care, until the end of the afternoon when they told us it was their first week on the job."
6745,Advertisement
6746,
6747,"So anyway: when we set off for Philadelphia, the U-Haul was a little heavy.  And this brings us to our first lesson in cross-country U-Haul transport, which is: fuel economy leaves a little something to be desired.  And when I say ""a little something to be desired,"" what I mean is that sometimes, as you glance down at the instrument panel, you'll notice that the fuel gauge is moving faster than the tachometer."
6748,"Indeed, our 900-mile journey yielded us an overall average of around 8.2 miles per gallon, which is right up there, in terms of fuel efficiency, with pouring cans of gasoline directly down a storm drain.  You know it's bad when you get passed by a Hummer H2, and you realize that, at this very moment, as you both drive down the very same road, he's doubling your fuel economy."
6749,"Now, before I go any further, I should admit that some of our gas mileage issues may have related to my driving style.  Since our stuff was so tightly packed in back, and thus there wasn't room for anything to roll around, I figured there was little chance something would break.  So I did what any red-blooded American male would do: I pushed my foot down at every possible opportunity.  It's at this point I must remind you that underneath its orange paint and troubling aerodynamics, the U-Haul is still a rear-wheel drive, V8-powered two-seater."
6750,Advertisement
6751,
6752,"No, I wasn't really that crazy with it.  But I did decide, very early on, that I wasn't going to sacrifice travel speed for fuel economy.  Yes, I know that some people hypermile these things and save a few bucks.  But I realized that doing this would mean instead of arriving at 9 p.m., as planned, we would probably get in around 1 a.m., and I would fold myself out of the van, collapse on the lawn, and scream: ""I DID IT!  I GOT TEN MILES PER GALLON!""  And then my neighbors would shoot me in the face, because this is Philadelphia."
6753,"So what I did, instead, was I decided to drive at normal speeds that you might travel in a normal passenger car.  In other words: in Georgia, 80 mph.  In South Carolina, 80 mph.  In North Carolina, 75 mph.  And in Virginia, 37 mph in the right lane with my emergency flashers on so I didn't accidentally reach a speed where I would be arrested for felony speeding and placed in the same holding cell as a guy who set fire to an orphanage."
6754,"And this brings me to a second lesson in cross-country U-Haul transport, which is: nobody likes getting passed by a U-Haul.  When you're driving 80 mph in a normal car, and you pass someone, what happens is: NOTHING.  Absolutely nothing.  You pass them, they forget about it, and everyone moves on.  This is a simple occurrence in our daily lives."
6755,Advertisement
6756,
6757,"Not so when you're in a U-Haul.  It doesn't matter how fast you're going.  You could be doing 85 miles per hour, passing someone going 50 miles per hour with their hazard lights on and farm plates and a chicken coop in the back.  The second you get up to their driver's window, they realize: ""OH MY GOD I'M GETTING PASSED BY A U-HAUL!!!"" And then they absolutely floor the accelerator so this injustice doesn't carry itself out.  ""NOT TODAY!!!"" they're probably screaming, as they dump chicken parts all over the road."
6758,"If this had happened once, I would've dismissed it as an unusual occurrence.  But it happened repeatedly; over, and over, and over again, with all sorts of different vehicles.  One guy in a GMC Yukon, lazily driving along and texting when I passed him somewhere in central Virginia, sped up to more than 100 mph to re-assert his dominance once he realized what had happened.  "
6759,"Fortunately, we eventually made it to Philadelphia, which brings me to our final U-Haul lesson of the day: you should not, under any circumstances, ever bring a 17-foot U-Haul into a city designed when the largest form of transportation was a Clydesdale. "
6760,Advertisement
6761,
6762,"I'll set the scene for you: my girlfriend and I had spent months searching for a house in Philadelphia.  We combed Craigslist, Zillow, Realtor.com – everything.  We had friends looking for places.  Finally, we picked one out, and looked at it on Street View every few days, eager to move in. We had a friend go through it and take photos of every room.  We checked online menus for area restaurants. We planned out, in our minds, exactly what furniture would go in exactly what space.  We were so excited.  And then, when we finally arrived in our neighborhood, to the house we had been thinking about for months, the U-Haul was too big to fit down our street.  "
6763,"So we've driven 900 miles, only to come to this: sitting at the end of our block, making a 10-point turn, trying to narrowly squeeze between a fire hydrant and a power pole, folding in the mirrors, blocking traffic in several directions, just fifty feet from our new front door."
6764,"But eventually, somehow, we made it down our street, to our house, where a different set of movers helped us unload all our stuff.  And eventually, somehow, we managed to return the U-Haul, after a harrowing drive through the center of Philadelphia in the middle of the day, dodging pedestrians, and cyclists, and delivery people, and city buses. As we dropped off the truck, I noticed a sign painted on one of the panels that prominently featured U-Haul's slogan: ""U-Haul: America's Moving Adventure.""  An adventure, indeed."

6779,It's pretty common to see people taking pretty new sports cars out at amateur drift events. It's also pretty common to see people get more than a little familiar with the wall.
6780,This is the airbag-filled result of the combination of the two.
6781,"Let's be honest, car makers do have a nasty habit of marketing against their brand philosophies. None pisses me off more than the Honda Fit She's. A Honda ""for women"" women didn't want. I don't care if it was designed by a female Honda executive. It's still sexist as hell."
6782,"Yes, I know. This might seem like old news (after all, we've covered it on Jezebel). It lasted only two model years. I've seen exactly three in the years since it came out, and in that time I've lived in four prefectures: Fukuoka, Chiba, Gunma, and Saitama. Yet it's worth exploring why it was doomed to failure from the very beginning. When CNN reported on the She's, they identified the designer as Tomonari Eri, a female Honda executive. It's terribly unfortunate her design was dead on arrival."
6783,
6784,"Still, much respect to Ms. Tomonari, making it to such a high position in many countries as a woman is difficult. In Japan? So much harder than many other places—even with anti-discrimination laws on the books. You have to respect the level of dedication and work (and sacrifice, probably in terms of family) she put into Honda Motors for her to have a chance at leading a design project."
6785,"That's all well and good. I don't know what kind of pressure she was facing from her superiors to be the woman who ""understands women"" and ""designs women stuff."" Unfortunately, whether under direct pressure, or simply because of the pressure to conform to Japan's still rather stringent gender segregation, she apparently ignored a truth that Honda had already figured out about three decades ago:"
6786,"Women buy cars for the same reasons men do. Oh, and calling anything a ""woman's car"" (or some lesser version of that) is completely stupid. "

6788,
6789,
6790,"There was a time when Honda promised us they ""don't make a woman's car."" A time when Honda looked at the burgeoning women's liberation movement, the seriousness with which feminist theory and women's studies were taken as true academic disciplines, and said, ""hey, we have an idea, why don't we publicly recognise the idea of a 'woman's car' is stupid and that women are individuals who shop for cars based on individual circumstances just like men."" "
6791,Advertisement
6792,
6793,"Wow, women are people (a radical notion some might know as ""feminism""); what a fucking concept. So tell me, how is what you figured out in 1970-whatever suddenly completely gone in 2012 and 2013? Did you get ahold of a time machine that can only replace your oldest executives with 1960 versions of themselves?"
6794,"Look, Honda, I know, things are hard in Japan right now. Car ownership is way down, especially because young people don't even want the damn things. You're trying desperately to figure out where to find new customer demographics. You know that today's Japanese women are more independent and have more disposable income than ever before in the island nation's history. More women are employed and employed for life, putting off or even totally eschewing husbands and children. And with recent government pushes to make women even more financially productive (and therefore taxpayers), this trend will only continue in the future."
6795,"It makes sense to consider women, but you don't need to offer us a product based on our eye shadow options. We might like the choice of pink, because some humans like pink, but it shouldn't be your signature color. And it shouldn't be splashed all over the interior like a five year old with a pink crayon was let loose in it without adequate supervision. All you need to do is give us options. Options are good! Yay, choice! You don't need to try to figure out what specific laundry list of pink tinted accents we need. It's bad enough when we're eight years old and in the toy aisle, now you're trying to do it to our big kid toys, too?!"

6797,
6798,"Fuck that. You have women fans, Honda. Lots of them. I'm one of them. And Honda Style Magazine just did an excellent feature on some beautiful EG and EK hatches from right here in Japan. You want to know what women who buy Honda want in your products? How about you start here:"
6799,"These are your loyal fans, not the ""woman driver"" you ""interviewed"" in the ""behind the scenes"" commercial commercial. No, that isn't an error, it's a commercial about a commercial. It's an ad where the She's marketing model explains why this particular car fits her, even though she's only had her license for a year, and she doesn't really know anything about cars."
6800,

6805,"Oh, General Motors said it was probably done recalling cars after an already brutal year? JUST KIDDING. There are now 205,309 more vehicles under recall from GM. And GM is hardly alone in the Detroit area, because now Chrysler has recalled almost 189,000 SUVs. "
6806,
6807,"The newest GM recall applies to 2013-2014 Cadillac XTS and 2014-2015 Chevrolet Impala sedans due to an issue where the electronic parking brake may stay engaged ""some vehicles,"" increasing the risk of fire. Unsurprisingly, the automaker said it was not aware of actual incidents because of the issue, nor of any incidents of fiery death."
6808,"Chrysler vehicles affected by that automaker's recall are Dodge Durangos and Jeep Grand Cherokees built from Jan. 25, 2010 through July 20, 2011. The issue for those vehicles is apparently an issue with the fuel pump relay, which can cause the vehicles to stall. Chrysler is offering to replace it for free. However, Ralph Nader's Center for Auto Safety, which has a track record of applying pressure to automakers, claims that the issue with the fuel pump relay affects five million other vehicles."

6843,"The Pao is a truly delightful looking car from the late 1980s which intentionally models itself off the original Austin Mini, the Citroën 2CV, and the Austin A40 Farina."
6844,"The Pao was part of the ""Pike"" series usually credited to Sakai Naoki. The ""Pikes"" were vehicles meant to create obvious brand offerings which would make Nissan a stand-out company amongst the vast Japanese automotive landscape. The models for the idea of a ""distinctive style"" were successful design elements from Japanese electronics makers, like Panasonic and Sony."
6845,Advertisement
6846,
6847,"The Nissan Pao arrived at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1987. At that time, the original Austin Mini was quite popular in Japan. It still is. The Pao adopted the Mini's outside hinges, took panel styling cues from Citroën, and had a half-and-half rear hatch modeled on the Austin A40. It was meant not only to be retro, but to be playful, even cartoonish – and most importantly, to be immediately recognizable as a Nissan product by Japanese consumers."
6848,"The Pao came with either a three speed automatic transmission or a five speed manual transmission. This vehicle has the five speed, which is actually much, much rarer than the automatic version. As far as I can tell, my neighbor (this is only two buildings down from my own apartment) has kept this 25 year old vehicle in really great condition. It has some rust, but for the most part, it looks good."

6854,"Renders of Toyota's new C-HR concept have been released and the sporty looking crossover seems almost like a Rally Fighter-inspired vehicle that just escaped from an automotive Blue's Clues. Yes, for the life of me, I now can't unsee this car as an eager puppy ready to play fetch at 70MPH."
6855,
6856,"Really, I just want to toss a basketball down the street and watch it go bounding off in pursuit trying desperately to place it in its grill in order to return it to me. Unfortunately, being a concept planned for auto shows, the styling isn't going to likely resemble a final production model, and the actual C-HR may look nothing like man's (or woman's? Human's?) best friend. This is a rough sketch in physical form at best. I'll try to get over my disappointment."
6857,Advertisement
6858,
6859,"Frankly, we don't know a lot about it. Our friends over at Carscoops say that Toyota is describing the C-HR concept as ""a bold new design language with an agile, engaging driving experience and a Hybrid powertrain."" So... Maybe less of a puppy and more of a small hunting dog? "
6860,"In any case, I'm intrigued. If you're Team Dog, maybe you are, too."

	Today's Nice Price or Crack Pipe candidate is a little different. It's not from Craigslist or eBay, or even that weird KiJiJi. Instead, it's a little Ford that I found at my local Cars & Coffee last Saturday. Let's see if this Courier is worth going to the show."
6863,"
	If you were to consider the opposite ends of the automotive coolness spectrum, you would most likely find Lotus populating one side - the cool end - and Kia holding down the fort at the other, far-less cool end. That's just the way things work out. What however would happen if you were to create some sort of unholy matrimony of these two incompatible brands?"
6864,"
	Well, it's been tried, and yesterday's example - a 1998 Kia Vigato - came away with an 88% Crack Pipe loss, owing to it being far to pricy for being a Kia, no matter how much of a lotus position it attempted."
6865,
6866,"
	Yesterday's ride was pretty pretentious. I mean, it was for a car company whose bread and butter has long been building cars for people who think Hyundais are too fancy. In contrast, today's Ford is about as unpretentious a vehicle as you could ever want to find."

	I just so happened to find this 1974 Ford Courier for sale at my neighborhood Cars & Coffee. Now, people generally gather at this sunrise event to share their cars, some car-conversation, and to enjoy an invigorating cup of joe from the Starbucks at the end of the parking lot. A few as well come to show off the cars that they have for sale. No one is obnoxious about it, and in fact this particular little pickup was parked near the back, out of the limelight."
6870,"
	The '70s were the heyday of the mini-truck, as prices for gas climbed and its availably plummeted. Toyota and Datsun pretty much led the pack, while both Chevy, with its Isuzu-sourced LUV, and Ford, tapping Mazda for the Courier, chose the wait and see approach to the genre's staying power."
6871,Advertisement
6872,
6873,"
	This one seems to have perseverance. It's described as being all-original, and at first glance that appears to be the case. The drivetrain is all Mazda, comprised of a sensible 74-bhp SOHC 1.8-litre four and 4-speed manual gearbox. There's nothing fancy about it, and this one only has 114,000 on that hardware."
6874,"
	Aesthetically, the truck is in pretty nice shape as well, and includes its original plain-jane wheels, dressed up a bit with some whitewall tires. There's no bumper in the back, which may make the truck a little less useful, but it absence does enhance the looks. The body has some minor nicks and dings here and there, but nothing serious, and there's no rust apparent anywhere."
6875,Advertisement
6876,
6877,"
	On to the interior, and that's where things get a little less original. From the factory, the Courier, in base form, came with a bench seat molded with a central divot to allow for the shifter to reach second and fourth."
6878,"
	Here, that bench has been replaced by a set of funky-looking semi-buckets, with integral seat belt mounts and individual cup holders. I've seen these someplace before, but can't quite place them. They don't look bad at all, and in fact neither does the rest of the cabin. Their mystery origin bothers me, however. Perhaps you'll know."
6879,Advertisement
6880,
6881,"
	The window sign notes that the truck is fun to drive and, being a '74, falls outside of even California's strict emissions testing requirements. It also says that the asking price for this basic and old-school set of wheels is $6,500. That's fully $3,500 above what the truck intro'd for when new. Of course three-grand in 1974 dollars is about fifteen-large today, so perhaps it's a bargain."
6882,Advertisement
6883,
6884,"
	What do you think about this Courier for $6,500? Is that a price that should have someone carrying it off soon? Or, is this a car meet seller that should have just stayed at home?"
6885,"
	You decide! "

7130,"The BMW i8 is the most significant and forward thinking car on the road today. This is BMW's vision of the future, and, for once, the future is no longer doom and gloom. The future is a positive, thrilling place. A place that we want to be. Don't be scared, gearheads, we're going to be ok."
7131,(Full Disclosure: BMW loaned us the i8 for five days. Five days where we couldn't go anywhere without having someone's jaw drop with a look like the future just drove by them. And that's because it did.)
7132,"BMW's i division is a huge gamble by the automaker. A company that has always been known for making ""The Ultimate Driving Machine"" was making a move into what are called ""personal mobility products."" "
7133,"Sounds sexy, right?"
7134,Advertisement
7135,
7136,"At first, a lot of people thought that this signaled the end of BMW as they knew it, but it seems now that this was a smart multi-billion dollar gamble to make BMW a leader in technologies like electric and hybrid cars, as well as the mass production of carbon fiber. The carbon fiber part is the big deal here. Lightweight construction using carbon fiber has been around in road cars since the Ferrari F40, but it has never really made its way down the pipeline to cars that everyone is buying."
7137,"Sure, Pagani makes works of art out of carbon fiber and all three new hybrid supercars from McLaren, Ferrari, and Porsche use carbon fiber, but the regular consumer has barely had a chance to touch the stuff other than as a trim piece. "
7138,"The BMW i3 and i8 both make make extensive use of the material in their construction, and in doing so become the most affordable cars made of CF and the first mass produced models to use it as the main component in its construction."
7139,Advertisement
7140,
7141,"The i3 and i8 are meant to represent the future of motoring as BMW sees it. And thankfully that doesn't mean soul sucking boredom. In the case of the i8, we have the 1.5 liter three cylinder from the Mini — which has been turboed to hell to make 228 horsepower and 236 pound feet of torque — sitting behind the driver. That charges the battery but also powers the rear wheels. Up front there is an electric motor producing 129 horsepower and 184 pound feet of torque. "
7142,"Under normal conditions, the electric motor powers the i8. It can get up to 75 MPH under electricity alone and can go for about 20 miles on a full charge with no interaction from the engine."
7143,Advertisement
7144,
7145,"But that's not all. The electric and gas can work together to change efficiency to performance. Put the i8 in sport mode or slam the pedal down, and you get pure torque from the electric motor and revvy turbo goodness from the engine. Like the McLaren P1, LaFerrari, and Porsche 918, the i8 uses its electric motor to increase performance."
7146,"But it looks crazier than any of those cars and it costs one tenth as much. ONE TENTH. BMW has cracked the code, because the i8 isn't just the deal of the century, it's a beacon of positivity as to what the future can hold for car fans. If you hate the i8, then you need to get a pill to fix your cynicism, because this car flat out rocks."
7147,Advertisement
7148,
7149,Exterior: 10/10
7150,We're pretty fortunate to drive a lot of cool cars around here. Some of those cars attract a lot of attention from passersby or others on the road.
7151,Advertisement
7152,
7153,None of those cars have come close to the amount of attention that the i8 generated.
7154,"Within 30 minutes of getting it, I had dozens of people take cell phone pictures, gawk at it, give me a thumbs up, I was pulled over by one curious dude in a Camaro, and had two cops stop and take pictures and look. This was all in 30 minutes. I took it to a Porsche dealer, salesmen ran out, stopped me from pulling away, and took pictures of it and with it. One even said ""this is way better than a Porsche."" It was parked near the highway at the Porsche dealer, and it actually made traffic."
7155,Advertisement
7156,
7157,"And it wasn't just people interested in cars. The i8 is physical proof that car worship is alive and well, but it is different than it was 20 years ago. Cars like the Lamborghini Countach could draw a crowd just because they looked so obviously different from everything else on the road."
7158,"Sure, an Aventador still attracts attention, but it's not close to the level of the i8. Kids look at this car and go apeshit, as if it's a Snack Pack in car form. Police see it and stop. They want to know what it is, they want rides. Everyone wants to know what it is, why it is, and how it is. You'll be followed, you'll make new friends, you'll be late to everything."
7159,Advertisement
7160,
7161,"But that's ok. The i8 is an ambassador of a friendly and exciting future. I love every little detail, especially the swooping gap between the trunk and fender at the rear. Sure, it's polarizing, but what other car has that? And to raise awareness of the i brand, I think BMW has had a huge success."
7162,Interior: 9/10
7163,Advertisement
7164,
7165,"Unlike the i3, the i8 feels distinctly like a car inside. There is no goofy gearshift, no recycled felt, and no reclaimed wood trim inside. Instead, you get your standard BMW gearshift, thin but cozy bucket seats, rear seats that make the Porsche 911 look roomy and family car-ish, and a straight forward driving position. "
7166,"In a vehicle that is so futuristic outside, I actually appreciate having controls that I recognize in places that make sense in the cabin. Some of the materials do feel a little cheap, but that's because they are once again recycled and reclaimed materials that just look like plastics."
7167,"The instrument panel is a large LCD screen that gives you efficiency data in regular driving, but turns all orange and angry when you flip it into sport mode. It's a little confusing at first, but not too hard to get used to."
7168,Advertisement
7169,
7170,"This is not the single greatest interior in the world, but everything falls easily to hand and works just as you'd expect. For me, that makes it the perfect familiar environment from which you can operate the future."
7171,Acceleration: 9/10
7172,Advertisement
7173,
7174,"The i8 is a different acceleration experience from pretty much any car you have ever been in. In electric mode, it's silent and about as fast as a Chevy Volt, which is to say ""not fast."" Still, it's a perfectly acceptable speed in real world driving."
7175,Then you mash your foot to the ground or put it in sport mode. The drivetrain changes from all-electric to electric-assist for the gas engine. What was a front drive econo-car has now become a rear drive supercar with electric turbos on the front wheels.
7176,Advertisement
7177,
7178,"When you dip into the ""e-boost"" for the first time (that's BMW's ultra cool name for when the electric motor kick in to aid acceleration), you've entered a whole new world of acceleration amazement. The i8 weighs in at 3,455 pounds, which is light for a car with all this tech at this price. And with the instant torque of the electric motor, the i8 physically shoves you back in the seat. Literally. Hands come out of the dash and push you."
7179,"The i8 has just 357 horsepower and 420 pound feet of torque, which are tiny numbers in today's 900+ horsepower supercar game, but it doesn't make an argument for needing more power. The transitions from electric to gas to e-boost are seamless, only a futuristic whirr of the electric motor lets you know what's going on."
7180,"BMW has built a car that punches far above its weight class, but, furthermore, it's a legitimately fun experience to push the pedal and suss out what the car is actually thinking."
7181,Advertisement
7182,
7183,Braking: 8/10
7184,"The i8 has regenerative braking at first, regular friction braking second. Pedal feel is pretty damn good for a car with regen, even though I did experience a slight deadspot in the pedal between regen and friction a few times, which was an off sensation."
7185,Advertisement
7186,
7187,"But on the street, the i8 was never wanting for more stopping power. On track, I could see the pads cooking, but this is not a car for the track."
7188,Ride: 8/10
7189,Advertisement
7190,
7191,"Since this is a predominantly carbon fiber car, the i8 is intensely rigid. This is not a relaxing ride, not that you expect a car with gullwing doors and a supercar shape to be a bastion of nirvana. Instead, this is a harsh ride, which I attribute to the weight of the batteries, the rigidity of the construction, and harder efficiency-focused tires."
7192,"You won't be uncomfortable in the i8, it's a great place to spend a lot of time, but don't expect it to coddle you. It's set up aggressively."
7193,Handling: 8/10
7194,Advertisement
7195,
7196,"Yes, the i8's steering is electric, though a hydraulic setup would be the ultimate irony, wouldn't it? It's numb and a tad lifeless, but it is accurate. While you can't necessarily feel the road, you can place the i8 where you need it to be on the road."
7197,"It's also surprisingly fun, which I do attribute to the narrow, relatively hard tires that are on board. That brings the limits within reach at speeds that won't kill you. Under constant throttle, the i8 remains neutral and a lift doesn't really induce oversteer. For a fact, the i8 cannot drift, no matter how badly we wish it could."
7198,"The one place where I found a cornering peculiarity was during power down mid corner or at corner exit of a tight turn (this is very specific). Here's the scenario: You enter slow and wide, bring the nose to the apex, and that's where you slam the throttle because the corner opens up on exit. The i8 engages the front electric motor on power down to help boost you out of the corner."
7199,Advertisement
7200,
7201,"But the motor also puts a ton of torque to the front wheels, which drags the front end off course and makes your exit a tad wider than you thought it'd be. But this is part of driving the future. In most cases, this is a car as you know it. But when it comes to certain cornering situations, we're going to need to try a new approach. Instead of hitting that traditional apex, make a later entry, turn sharper, and make more of a straightline exit. "
7202,"It's about driving to what best suits the car, and the i8 needs a different approach sometimes. "
7203,Gearbox: 9/10
7204,Advertisement
7205,
7206,"BMW has equipped the i8 with just a six speed automatic. In a world of eight and nine speed transmissions, I found myself consistently trying to force the car to shift to a gear above sixth. Guess that's what I've been trained to do."
7207,"The six speed is quick to react to inputs and downshifts seamlessly. It also comes online without you noticing when the drive wheels are engaged and the engine is on. Otherwise, the electric motor is a two speed and is so seamless that I thought it was a single speed the whole time."
7208,Toys: 10/10
7209,Advertisement
7210,
7211,I don't know what to say here. Even driving the i8 is like playing with a toy. Just a toy for adults.
7212,High score is replaced with either max efficiency or how much charge you can get out of it in sport mode. The nav system will work with the electric motor and gas engine to decide when is best to add charge to the batteries. It has one of those science fictiony top down cameras that I think works with a drone somehow.
7213,Advertisement
7214,
7215,I can't explain just how giddy the i8 makes you feel. It's honestly like seeing that you're driving a Hot Wheels everytime you get close to it. That alone earns it high marks.
7216,Audio: 9/10
7217,Advertisement
7218,
7219,"Yes, the engine noise is synthesized. Yes, it's noticeable. And no, it's not bad at all. This sounds like a mini straight six, it's aggressive and guttural, I like it a lot. From the outside, it makes these pops and farts on shifts that are just the business."
7220,"On the other side, we have the electric mode, which is a gentle whirr that kind of makes me go crazy. It's the perfect soundtrack for a car that is a bridge to what comes next. And in e-boost, with that wind down that sounds like the turbo from the future, well, it's sublime. I'd just like it to be a little louder in electric mode, like a Formula E car. Then it would be perfect."

7224,"The Porsche 918 is a carbon fiber hybrid supercar. The base price of the Porsche 918 is $845,000. Yes, it has a race derived engine and super impressive tech, but the i8 is a carbon fiber hybrid supercar, and it costs $136,000. "
7225,"That's a gigantic delta, and one that makes the i8 the deal of the century as far as I'm concerned."
7226,"When I had the i8, I had people asking why it costs so much more than a Volt or a Tesla when the range isn't better than either. While both those cars took risks on powertrains, neither have taken a risk in how we fundamentally build a car."
7227,Advertisement
7228,
7229,"Mass producing lightweight carbon fiber for a road car is a huge deal. For decades, carbon fiber was supposed to be for people with millions of dollars who could afford the superest of supercars. But BMW is the first to bring carbon fiber to the people with the i3 and the i8. Yes, the i8's range is just 20 miles on electric, which isn't even close to the Volt, but the construction of the i8 is the next generation while the Volt feels old in comparison."
7230,"On performance and price, the i8 technically competes with cars like the Audi R8, Porsche 911, Mercedes-AMG GT, Corvette, and others of that ilk. But in the real world, this is like flying an F22 Raptor in 1945. Compared to everything else in its class, the i8 feels like the first generation of something new and exciting. The other cars feel like the last generation of something that has been around forever."

7232,

7270,"While researching a series of exciting South American-built offroaders, I found myself perusing the online showroom of Chevrolet Uruguay. It is like looking into an alternate universe where the corpses of Old GM compacts rose up out of the grave."
7271,"For some car companies, it's easy to keep track of what's being shared across different models under the skin. Take BMW, as explained by Automotive News Europe. There are the front-drive Minis all on one platform. The i3 and i8 share architecture. The 5 series, 6 series and the 7 series are on the same platform along with the Rolls-Royce Ghost. The 3 series shares its bones with the 1,2, and 4 serieses but not with the X3 and X4, those two have their own a platform as do the X5 and X6 and hey isn't the X1 still based on the old 3 series wait no, this is actually all super confusing."
7272,"Relatively straightforward companies are difficult enough, but it's virtually impossible to get a handle on all of GM's platforms, possibly because they carry incomprehensible names like GM4200 and possibly because old platforms never die in GM-Land."
7273,"In America, you can buy two Chevrolets based off of GM's ""Gamma II"" platform. We get the Sonic and the Spark. Uruguay gets five."

One page describes it as a Gamma II car, which is understandable since it looks like a Sonic with a trunk. In fact, it's based on an old Opel Corsa B.

That's three orders of magnitude smaller than the US car market. Americans didn't just buy as many F-Series trucks alone as Uruguayans bought new cars last year; Americans bought as many F-series trucks just last month as Uruguayans bought new cars last year. You can double check my data here, here and here. GM clearly has an interest in the market, but it's understandable why it doesn't get the most attention."

7321,"For some car companies, it's easy to keep track of what's being shared across different models under the skin. Take BMW, as explained by Automotive News Europe. There are the front-drive Minis all on one platform. The i3 and i8 share architecture. The 5 series, 6 series and the 7 series are on the same platform along with the Rolls-Royce Ghost. The 3 series shares its bones with the 1,2, and 4 serieses but not with the X3 and X4, those two have their own a platform as do the X5 and X6 and hey isn't the X1 still based on the old 3 series wait no, this is actually all super confusing."

One page describes it as a Gamma II car, which is understandable since it looks like a Sonic with a trunk. In fact, it's based on an old Opel Corsa B. Don't think this is an El Camino-ized version of the Chevy Sail, though.

After a few invalid codes, the doors lock up, and a driverless car is rolling out of the wash. Yes, the law of unintended consequences is alive and well."
7379,"
	This comically overwrought report by Fox News in Detroit shows video footage of a Ford Focus rolling off the wash line as employees scatter to stop it before it crashes. And according to Mr. C's general manager, Rodney Watts, it's something they've encountered six times so far this year."

7387,"I've written before about Paul Schilperood's remarkable book that makes the case that the VW Beetle was largely developed based on the ideas of the Jewish auto journalist Josef Ganz and not Ferdinand Porsche, as has been commonly thought. Today, I want to look in detail at a key component of this idea: The Standard Superior."

7391,
7392,"For some reason, tracing the earliest origins of the Volkswagen Beetle has proven a continual source of fascination. As a kid, I remember reading so many retellings of the same basic story in every book about the Beetle I could get my little, simian hands on. "
7393,Advertisement
7394,
7395,"These stories all had the same basic cast and plot: Hitler wanted a ""people's car"" for (mostly) propaganda reasons, and Ferdinand Porsche happened to share the dream of an everyman's cheap, useful car. Porsche had been developing prototypes since the early 30s through companies like NSU and Zündapp before finally joining forces with the Nazis, who bankrolled the final development of the car. "
7396,"Only military variants were built during the war, and once in British control after the war, actual civilian VW Beetle production began in earnest. That's the basic story, pared down to the essentials, that I read over and over again. The Josef Ganz connection dramatically changes this narrative, demonstrating that the fundamental Beetle design came from Ganz' work and ideas, which were published extensively in the magazine he edited, Motor Kritik, and, importantly, in the cars that were developed using his ideas."
7397,Advertisement
7398,
7399,"I'm not going to retell the book here — it's too involved and too good, and I recommend it heartily to anyone. But what I would love to do is give us all a good look at the first production car really built to Ganz' fundamental principles. This car is also where I would personally put the start of the Beetle line, even if the company and name differ. The car is so closely related —  conceptually, technically, visually — to the Beetle, that I think if any car has a claim on being the Mother/Father of the Beetle, this is it."
7400,"The car is the Standard Superior, and it was even briefly called a ""volkswagen"" in advertising, before the Nazis decided that only their KdF company would be allowed to use that word. But a volkswagen it was, no matter what those ark-peeking-face-melters had to say about it: the Superior was absolutely a people's car."
7401,Advertisement
7402,
7403,"Introduced in 1933, the Superior was based on Ganz' prototypes made for the Ardie motorcycle company (1930) and the Adler automobile company (1931) where he finalized his fundamental design concepts: tubular backbone chassis, mid-rear mounted engines, and independent suspension with swing axles at the rear. Standard hired Ganz to design their new cheap people's car based on the strength of those prototypes and his published writings. Ganz' design for the Standard Superior included all of these traits, along with a somewhat streamlined body design."
7404,"It's remarkably easy to see the Superior as a Beetle ancestor. The backbone chassis is shared between both cars, and while the Beetle uses a stamped, inverted U-shaped tunnel for its backbone and the Standard uses an actual cylindrical pipe-like tube, the principles are the same. "
7405,Advertisement
7406,
7407,"Of course, there were a number of other cars of this era being built on similar principles, and ending up looking remarkably Beetle-like; the Tatra V570 comes to mind as an example. Even so, Ganz' wide publication of his ideas and the fact that the Superior made it into production (albeit limited) makes me still willing to give the nod to the Standard for Beetle-dadhood."
7408,"Early Beetles used a swing-axle suspension system much like the Superior's, and the overall plan, design, and layout of the Superior feel eerily like a foreshadowing of what the Beetle would become. The 1934 redesign of the Superior is even closer than the first version, incorporating rear side windows and a rudimentary luggage/seat area in the back for your hapless, crammable kids. The side profile of the Superior is remarkably close to the eventual Beetle shape."
7409,Advertisement
7410,
7411,"The one key area where the Superior and VW differ is in the engine. While both are air-cooled and mounted behind the driver, with horizontally-laying cylinders, the Standard uses a 396cc (later 500cc) two-stroke inline engine. The type of engine is less of a big difference than is the precise location: Ganz' designs stipulated an engine within the wheelbase of the car, so the Superior was a mid-mounted design. "
7412,"Porsche was fine with placing the engine outboard of the wheelbase to the rear, which is the primary factor for handling issues and idiosyncrasies of not just the Beetle, but nearly every other air-cooled VW and Porsche to follow for decades. You could easily and annoyingly argue that the Superior was, in fact, superior, at least in this trait."
7413,Advertisement
7414,
7415,"The Standard Superior was designed to fill the exact same role as the Beetle as well: a small, useful, rugged, and extremely cheap entry-level car. The Standard was able to be cheap by having a tiny engine and a body made largely of wood and artificial leather, save for the steel fenders. The Beetle, built more robustly out of steel, was to be cheap thanks to massive volumes and economies of scale."
7416,"The Standard Superior was never a great seller, for a variety of reasons, not the least of which has to do with all the upheaval going on in Germany at the time and the intervention of the Nazis into the German car industry. Production stopped in 1935, and only one manages to survive to this day. "
7417,Advertisement
7418,
7419,"Looking at pictures of the Standard Superior sort of gives me chills, though I'm not exactly sure why. Maybe it's sort of like when you see a doppelgänger of yourself or someone familiar in a very old photograph. The car is clearly not a Beetle, but there's so many familial and familiar traits there, it's hard not to equate the two. I think you could even argue that the Superior has more in common with what became the final Beetle than Porsche's Zündapp prototype, which was significantly bigger and used a doomed radial engine. "
7420,"I'm not trying to disregard Porsche's huge, crucial role in the development of the Beetle; I just feel it's worth giving attention to those other incredibly important cars and designers that eventually helped to create that car that inspired me to waste so much time as a kid reading about its origins in the first place."

7425,Are you tired of being embarrassed when you go out because you can't properly identify the year of a VW Beetle based on the engine lid? Sure you are. Nothing stings more than when the sexy someone you were chatting up flings a drink in your face because you had no idea how many vents are on a '72 Beetle decklid. I'm here to help.
7426,"I've felt with painful VW minutia before, and I don't really see any chance of stopping, so let's all just get through this as best we can. The engine cover on a VW Beetle — known also as the engine lid, the decklid, or, by drooling simpletons, 'the trunk,' is one of the best, quickest ways to ID the year of any VW you see."
7427,
7428,"The ones I'm listing in this chart are primarily US-market Beetles  — in Europe and elsewhere, Beetles with 1200 or 1300 engines often didn't have the ventilated decklids, those being reserved for the 1600cc engines we've enjoyed in the US since 1971. "
7429,"There's also a few exceptions, and, of course, the convertibles all had ventilated lids from the start, so for optimal results, use this only for US-spec Beetles. Well, except for that Brazilian one I stuck on there. Besides, you often see US Beetles with replacement Brazilian decklids, so you can impress the honeys with that little zinger, if needed. Oh, and decklid badges varied a bit, so I'm not including those, save for the one-year only '1300' in 1966. From 1967- in the US, almost all said VOLKSWAGEN until 1976 when, flush with technical pride, they read FUEL INJECTION."
7430,Advertisement
7431,
7432,"There's also a couple good terms you can throw around, too. Lids from 1947-1957 (roughly; there's some debate there) used license plate light housings called ""Pope's Nose"" because they looked like, well, the Pontiff's Nose, I guess."
7433,"The pope of that era would have been Pope Pius XII, and, if you look at him, I guess his nose sort of did resemble a Beetle license plate light. Maybe his nostrils illuminated his upper lip at night, too. That'd really sell it."
7434,"The early deck lids, covering the split-to-oval window era of Beetles (1938-1957), are known as the 'W' lids, because, well, they sort of look like a W."
7435,Advertisement
7436,
7437,"Some other details: the late 1963 change has to do with the tiny curved ends of that center narrow parabola being replaced with straight ones, and the very early decklids  ('38-'46) had a pressing for the license plate and a crude, round stop lamp in place of a metal shaped license plate light. The '47-'48 Pope's Nose light also incorporated a larger window at the bottom with a red stop lamp, too."

And we will run consumer stories in the Business section, including regular coverage on Fridays. The Driven videos will continue online."
7445,"But despite sensational work over the years by Jim Cobb and his crew, the masthead and I concluded there is no longer an economic reason for a separate section."
7446,"Jim was there 20 years ago when the Sunday section was launched, and he has made The Times proud ever since. In the day, the insatiable demand among print advertisers had the coverage spread across several days, including Sunday. Now we'll consolidate our print efforts on Friday, while remaining nimble on the web."
7447,"There will be opportunities in the coming weeks to single out the great work of Jim, Norman Mayersohn, Jim Schembari, Robert Peele and the many contributors, but let me start here by saying how grateful I am for two decades of imagination and dedication in making our Sunday section the best read in the business."

You could tell a friend to imagine a successful, middle aged man, probably an orthodontist or something, who has good taste, is a responsible and dedicated dad, but also has one of the most elaborate and well-appointed sex dungeons in three states. The car's kind of like that."
7455,"I mean, think about it: the Charger is a full-size, four-door sedan. It's the kind of car that was once the default sort of car in America, and is now something of a dying breed. A car designed to transport a whole family and their luggage in easy, air-conditioned comfort. And this car — this rational, eminently conventional and traditional sort of car — is also available in a version that's capable of going about three times the speed limit of anywhere in the country.

By any rational standard, that would be the insanely quick version — but, of course, it's not. Having a family sedan with 707 HP on tap is sort of like having a vacuum cleaner that could, if you wanted it to, vacuum the finish right off your hardwood and then keep going until it sucked a hole in the fabric of spacetime, which would then become a singularity that would suck in your entire home, family, pets, underpants, and the whole planet.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say, accounting for a statistical margin of error, exactly 0.0% of people who buy a Charger Hellcat actually can or should drive it at 204 MPH."

7466,"See, even though it's made in Canada by poutine-gorged Canadians, the whole Charger line may just be one of the last truly American cars out there. Unlike so many other American (and Japanese, Korean, etc) car makers, Dodge (even if they're owned by Italians) has managed to avoid the lure of trying to make German/European-style performance sedans. Dodge hasn't fallen prey to the ravenous beast of alphanumeric naming, and the fundamental character and design of cars like the Charger are unmistakably American."

It's on par, equipment-wise, with what's being offered from Europe or Japan. But the fundamental layout and shape and arrangement of the interior is absolutely an evolution of the big American sedans I grew up riding in in the 70s and 80s. "
7474,"The dash is tall and panel-like, the interior is wide and roomy, and while the seats are nice, supportive buckets, it's so easy to imagine a nice long vinyl bench seat in there. The whole feel of the car is Detroit, and it may be the only American-branded sedan out right now that really feels that way."

The exterior styling feels American as well — it's substantial, and a little deceptive. In bland colors, the car can be almost anonymous in profile, but the more you look at it, the more dramatic it is. The big side scallop and sculpted rear haunches I think are quite attractive and I appreciate the willingness to take some risks — in fact no body panels are shared with the previous generation car.

At night, there's nothing else that looks like it from the rear."

7485,"In traffic on the way to the track, it was a quiet, one-finger-on-the-wheel sort of thing. Like American cars have been for decades. Acceleration was, of course, quite good, even in the sub 500 HP cars. Steering was precise (and speed-sensitive) if a bit removed from the feel of the road, but the car did handle and maneuver in a way that ignored its considerable size and weight."

7488,"Once on the track, with TRACK mode set on the controls and the Red Key in use (the Hellcat comes with a red key for full power use and a black one for valets and untrustworthy simpletons like myself) the car's rampant bonkersism became alarmingly clear."
7489,"The track at Summit Point isn't overly fast, but it does have one pretty decent, if a bit short, straight. On that straight, without even really trying hard, that Hellcat gets to about 140 MPH without breaking a sweat (to compare, the 392, non-supercharged versions get to about 120). You come out of the turn on to the straight and stomp the gas, and the uncut speed-heroin gets injected between your toes, and every sensible thought you had gets blasted out the back of your skull. "
7490,Advertisement
7491,
7492,"The braking point arrives alarmingly quickly, and the massive brakes (6 piston front, 4 piston rear) manage to turn 100 MPH of speed into invisible heat astoundingly fast, and with almost no histrionics. You come in hot at 140, put some pressure on that pedal, and you rapidly and confidently end up at 40 MPH. Those brakes are seriously impressive."
7493,"I've driven two other cars with comparable levels of power to this four-door sedan on a track: a Lamborghini Aventador and the Ford GT 500. Both of these cars were much more overtly aggressive in the way they drove. The Lambo was like a purpose-built speedbot, with dramatically mechanical shifts and a very sophisticated and busy feeling, and the GT500 felt like driving a golem with rocket skates. Both fun, both impressive, and both much more focused on reminding you that you're in a machine designed just to go fast."
7494,

7496,
7497,"The Charger Hellcat, though, felt just like a big American sedan (admittedly with much tighter handling and braking) that you could somehow, magically make go hair-meltingly fast. Which is why it's so goddamn insane. It's cunning and stealthy. You could own one of these for months, driving like it was any other car, until that one day came that made you want to step on the gas and the next thing you know you're hurtling into an orphanage/kitteneteria at 198 MPH, with no regrets whatsoever. This car requires the self-control of a castrated saint who thinks you're watching him."
7498,"Keep in mind that this is a car that can get gas mileage in the 20s until you really stomp it, and then I think you can empty the tank in 20 minutes or so."

7500,
7501,"I don't know what the hell to think of this car. Part of me loves it, part of me loves that Dodge is building it, but another big part of me knows just how richly, lavishly insipid it is. If you own one, you're never going to really be able to experience what this car is capable of until the day comes that you snap and decide to plow you, three passengers, and a good number of well-packed suitcases right the fuck off the side of a mountain or something."
7502,"Now, what does make a bit more sense are the lower-powered versions of this car, and perhaps most notably, the Police Interceptor variant."
7503,Advertisement
7504,
7505,"Yes, we got to drive around a fully-loaded cop car and play with the sirens and lights and loudspeaker and all that. The cop version even doubles down on the Americana aspect by having a column-shift transmission — when was the last car you saw with one of those? "
7506,"Chasing after other cars on the track in the cop car was a blast not just because of the movie-scenes replayed in your head (I pleaded for a bunch of empty cardboard boxes we could drive through, cop-through-alley style, but no luck) but because the cop car was actually set up in what may be the ideal track car version of the Charger."
7507,Advertisement
7508,
7509,"The 392 engine has 475 lb-ft of torque that gives great acceleration, and the whole cop package includes beefed up suspension and a set of heavy front brakes that stop just about as well as the Hellcat's more exotic, lighter setup. The guy in charge of the police car division made the excellent point that if you're looking for a ready-to-roll track day car, you can do really well by picking up a used cop Charger from an auction."
7510,"I think he's really on to something, as I found the cop car setup to be the sweet spot of the cars I ran on the track — quick, surprisingly  nimble for its size, fantastic stopping power, and about 200 lbs lighter than the Hellcat. Plus, you might be able to pick one up with that screen and seamless, hose-down-able back seat!"
7511,Advertisement
7512,
7513,"In the end, I have to say I'm really conflicted about the Charger Hellcat. It's impressive and ridiculous. I suppose when the alien invaders are scrutinizing our culture, trying to figure out how we mate via Snapchat on our pocket-databars, they'll eventually find a Charger Hellcat, and I think that might just explain everything."
7514,"Once they evaluate the engineering behind a car designed to transport a whole famili-cluster of humans in comfort, but also with the potential to go screaming across the land at Mach 0.26, they should be able to understand that, fundamentally, we're a pack of dangerous, thrill-seeking, destructive lunatics. And then they'll probably get the hell off Earth. Especially if they get their hands on a Tesla Model SD right afterwards."

7518,"If you're a regular reader, you probably know that I write two frequent series here on Jalopnik.  In one, I document all the problems I have with my used Range Rover, which I bought two years ago from CarMax with a bizarrely comprehensive six-year warranty.  In the other, I tell you what it's like to own a used Ferrari. These columns are very popular, and most people seem to like them, except the folks over at the Ferrari and Land Rover message boards who believe I am worse than the Taliban."
7519,
7520,"But yesterday was a big day, because my worlds collided: I brought my Ferrari to CarMax.  You'd know this if you followed me on Twitter, because I announced that I took the Ferrari to CarMax for an appraisal.  But you wouldn't know the hilarious story that came out of my trip to CarMax.  So I'm going to share with you now."
7521,"To begin, it's important to explain exactly why I visited CarMax in the first place. So here's the deal: in addition to being the nation's leading provider of unreliable high-performance used cars with comprehensive warranties, CarMax also has this program where they will buy your used car, no matter what it is, and give you cash on the spot – even if you don't buy a car from them. Seriously. You show up in a Ford Pinto? They'll buy it. Buick Roadmaster? They'll buy it. Saturn Relay? Hahahaha, no, even CarMax won't touch that crap."
7522,Advertisement
7523,
7524,"Just kidding, they'll buy a Relay, presumably in an even trade for a socket wrench they have lying around the service department. In fact, they say they'll buy anything, no matter how awful. So I'm sitting around the house the other day, and it hits me: I wonder what would happen if I asked them to make me an offer on my Ferrari. "
7525,You can see where this is going.
7526,"So the next morning, I'm driving out to my local CarMax in the Ferrari, and a thought hits me: What if they recognize me? I've been doing these Range Rover columns for a while, and they're pretty popular, and I've received quite a few e-mails from current and former CarMax employees, sharing some funny stories of their own. So are they going to know it's me?  Are they going to recognize my name?  DO THEY HAVE A ""WANTED: DOUG DEMURO"" POSTER HANGING UP IN EVERY SHOWROOM?!?!?!"
7527,Advertisement
7528,
7529,"I was so concerned that I decided to pull up to the front of the store and take a photo of the Ferrari with the CarMax sign first, so that I could eventually post it up on Twitter. My theory was that if they recognized me and told me to get lost, I would at least have photographic evidence of that time I attempted to take a Ferrari to CarMax for an appraisal."
7530,"So anyway: I walk in and I'm met by the CarMax greeter, who tells me to fill out my information on a touchscreen they have in the lobby.  It's mostly just standard personal stuff — name, address, etc — but there's also a section for ""additional comments.""  These were mine:"
7531,Advertisement
7532,
7533,"Eventually, a CarMax buyer named Ryan comes out and he goes over the entire process with me.  It'll take about 25 minutes, Ryan says, during which he'll run the Autocheck report, examine the car for body work, take it for a short test-drive, and check out selling prices for comparable vehicles.  Ryan is professional. He doesn't seem bothered by the fact that it's a Ferrari.  It might as well be a Mercury Topaz."
7534,"We walk outside, and we're quickly joined by Ryan's buying manager – a nice guy who shakes my hand and wants to check out the car. We discuss it for a little bit – fuel economy, performance, condition.  The usual.  I'm nervous that he'll recognize me, but he doesn't say a thing.  Eventually he goes back inside.  Then Ryan tells me I picked the perfect day to bring in the Ferrari."
7535,Advertisement
7536,
7537,"""Why is that?"" I say."
7538,"""Because our regional manager just happens to be here today,"" Ryan replies.  ""We have to call him anyway, before we buy a car like this. So it's good that he's already here."""
7539,"Now I'm nervous.  The regional manager will definitely recognize me, right??  What an unlucky day! I think. Now they're going to know I'm not serious, and they won't give me a quote! I stand there as Ryan continues to go over the car, manually entering the options into his computer because CarMax's third-party VIN tool doesn't exactly have data for Ferrari.  And then regional manager walks out, accompanied by a store manager.  I'm trying to shield my face, certain that the jig is up, when the regional manager introduces himself to me."
7540,Advertisement
7541,
7542,"""Hi!"" he says.  ""I'm Troy!"""
7543,"It turns out that Troy is a big car enthusiast: he's spent nearly 20 years with CarMax, and he was interested in British car restoration before that.  He's great to talk to, and he really appreciates the Ferrari – and cars in general.  It's no surprise, then, that we get to talking about some of the other interesting cars they have on the lot: a BMW M5, and an M3. A Porsche Panamera. A Range Rover. I tell him I wish they carried some other high-line stuff, like Bentley or Maserati.  And that's when…"
7544,"""Do you ever read that website, Jalopnik?"" says Troy.  I can tell the question is genuine: he's not just trying to screw with me.  ""There's a guy on there, and he loves us.  He's got an old Range Rover he bought with a warranty, and he writes about all the problems he has."""
7545,Advertisement
7546,
7547,I chuckle. 
7548,"No, Troy. I've never heard of that guy."
7549,"Eventually, Troy goes back inside, and Ryan and I take the car for the test drive – with me in the driver's seat.  I try to insist that Ryan take it for a spin, which is the usual CarMax process, but he's worried about the risk."
7550,Advertisement
7551,
7552,"""It's not every day that you get to drive a Ferrari!"" I say, trying to convince Ryan to get behind the wheel."
7553,"""That's exactly why we don't want him driving it!"" jokes Ryan's manager, as he walks back into the dealer."
7554,"When we're done with the test drive, I park the car and Ryan and I walk inside.  At this point, I'm excitedly texting my friends: They know OF me!  But they don't know it IS me!!!  As Ryan goes into the back office to come up with an offer, I'm giggling in the showroom. The whole thing is hilarious."
7555,Advertisement
7556,
7557,"After a few minutes, Ryan returns, offer in hand.  It's tremendously low (EDIT: I don't want a potential buyer using the offer against me, but I'll reveal it when I sell the car!), but I don't blame them: this isn't a car that CarMax wants anything to do with. Not only can they not sell it to a retail buyer, but they'd need to purge all the service records in the interest of privacy — not a big deal on a 3-year-old Camry, but a four-figure value hit on a modern Ferrari.  I thank Ryan, and ask him for one quick favor: ""Can you grab Troy?"""
7558,"Troy walks back out into the showroom, and I shake his hand."
7559,"""I have to come clean about something,"" I say.  ""I'm the guy with the Range Rover."""
7560,Advertisement
7561,
7562,"""Yeah, we just figured that out while we were preparing the offer!"" says Troy. We chat about cars for a while – Troy says the warranties used to be even cheaper than they are today – and he tells me he always chooses the ""cool stuff"" for his company cars, even if it's not one of the latest models.  As I'm leaving, he extends his hand again: ""You're welcome here any time!"""
7563,That's good to know. Because I think we can all assume it won't be long before my next warranty claim.

7641,"I'm not going to lie to you: I think most movies Hollywood makes targeted at gearheads and car lovers sort of suck. Sort of really suck. And I get that there's suspension of disbelief and fun and over-the-top-action, but these movies seem to take all that to Dimension Stupid. And the new Furious 7 trailer suggests that plan is going just fine."
7642,
7643,"If you've yet to see the trailer, here it is:"
7644,
7645,"I know there's a good number of you out there who like these movies and are forgiving of all the ways physics gets chloroformed and vigorously misused and all the inane dialog and insipid, overly compacted and ultimately meaningless plots, so chances are if that's you, you'll have a blast at this movie. And that's great."

7647,
7648,"But when I see this trailer, my miserable, joyless eyes just see a string of really, really terrible decisions. Like, if we accept that these characters exist and have goals to accomplish, it's really hard to understand why or how they do anything, assuming the world of this movie is anything remotely like the real world. I mean, it's never said that these movies take place in a parallel universe where people have faces made of steel and the ability to affect physics if they just want it badly enough. "
7649,Let's just look at some examples here:

7651,
7652,"First, this basic idea of parachuting a bunch of cars out of a plane to intercept another vehicle: this seems like such a terrible idea, even in the reality of the film. I mean, I'm assuming they have a goal here — why are they introducing so many novel ways to kill off their entire crew at once?"

That big red button fires the guns, which seem to target on their own."

7673,"Again, I get suspension of disbelief, I get action movie over-the-topedness, but holy shit, this is such a monumentally stupid, stupid plan. Who's idea was that?"

Maybe Land Rover is finally feeling too mom-car for these spray-tanned, expensive-smelling people, bodies slick with costly unguents, clad in shimmering pullovers made of the finest smoked salmon, flown in fresh that morning, and branded with the logos of their ""fav"" luxury brands."

Apparently not enough people RSVP'd with a yes. "
7756,"(Update: After this story ran a Toyota spokesman said via Twitter said that only the final half-day was cancelled, and that was for business writers and some foreign media.) "

7761,"(For the record, they already did do a track day with the RC F at Monticello Motor Club in New York, which Travis attended for Jalopnik. It's the story I linked to above.) "
7762,"So why the cancellation? Some blame it on a declining interest in cars in Japan, a refrain we hear in America sometimes too but is apparently even worse over there. Foreign journalists also balked at the drive near Tokyo, which would have meant just being stuck in traffic. Location may be the primary issue here. "

7767,"There's a particular moment you have, I think everyone has, when you start your first trip on the road in a GT-R. The transmission clunks in second, the rear end emits expensive-sounding rumblings, and the whole body shudders. You think to yourself, isn't this kind of terrible? Here's how I came to love that grumbling terribleness, and it has everything to do with a racetrack."
7768,"Well, two racetracks, actually. I ran a new GT-R at New Jersey Motorsports Park's Thunderbolt and then Lightning tracks as part of Jeffapalooza, an awesome season ending track day with open passing and a ton of great cars. One big and fast, one small and tight. One that let the car stretch out and one that restrained it in. The car bonked 135 at the end of one straight, 140 on the other."
7769,"This was my second time driving a GT-R, both of which were more ordinary daily driver-spec cars, still priced well into the six figures and throwing 545 horsepower at all four wheels. The first drive was on a deserted country backroad, and it was an exercise in frustration. It's hard enough keeping a big butt GT-R in its lane at any speed, but not straying over the yellow line on a winding road was a constant effort. The car could transport itself into triple-digit speeds at the slightest hint of a straight, but that was more worrying than anything else. I didn't want to go to jail that day."
7770,
7771,Advertisement
7772,
7773,The feeling you get driving a GT-R on the road is not that you're bored; it's that the car itself is bored. And that makes you feel inadequate. And bitter.
7774,"I got more of that driving the two and a half hours down from NYC to NJMP. I thought the car would be an easy highway cruiser, what with it weighing five tons and being larger than some school buses. This is not the case. Getting onto the turnpike, the car was darty. It wandered around its lane, oversensitive to the pavement, to the throttle, to the somewhat heavy steering. The transmission grumbled at every low-speed shift, and the GT-R felt both leaden and nervous at the same time."
7775,"Bleary-eyed at five or six in the morning, I did not enjoy these qualities."
7776,Advertisement
7777,
7778,"And things did not start well for me even when I got on the track. I followed my coworker Travis in a Camaro Z/28 down the front stretch and nearly plowed into his back bumper going into turn one. I copied his braking point, but he had carbon ceramics and I... didn't."
7779,"The next few laps got worse. I dropped wheels on a couple of different corners, rushing too fast in, and plowing wide. The little glimmers of oversteer I got when a tire hit the dirt was as much rotation as I got out of the car for my first hour or two."
7780,Advertisement
7781,
7782,"But then I started really learning the track, and then I started really learning the car."
7783,"The GT-R may be equal parts inert and fidgety in cold highway traffic, but it gets up on its toes and smooths itself out when you can really commit to a corner. When you have room to let the car transfer its weight left and right through wide esses. When you finally get your line right braking for a blind crest into a falling, narrowing turn. There's a transition as the car gets light, and the all-wheel drive feels like it's shuffling cards. Then that almighty shove returns, pulling you back as it rattles up to a hundred, a hundred ten, a hundred I can't even look any more."
7784,Advertisement
7785,
7786,"When you first drive a GT-R, there's no way you can anticipate how alive it will feel moving around under braking from fifth into a third-gear left hander. You just think that the car is crappy. And even when you do what everyone else does — launch it — you can't imagine how sweet it will feel waiting for that sharp left to straighten out, the wheel unwinding and your foot falling deeper into the gas pedal."
7787,Advertisement
7788,
7789,"A lot of people dismiss the GT-R, hate the GT-R. I figure this has something to do with the people who buy it and why they do. It's a fast car. It goes very quickly. People who want a car to go fast buy it, they go fast, then they get bored. You can only launch a GT-R so many times before it starts to feel a little routine. This is why there are so many tuned GT-Rs with four-figure horsepower numbers; owners are trying to get that unbelievable sensation of speed back from something that's turned ordinary."
7790,"The keen (and broke) among the car world can be quick to point out that fast isn't always fun. That having a lot of raw performance doesn't mean fun. And that's a fine argument. I learned that when I tracked my daily driver, a car that doesn't even have traction control to turn off, a car that is slower than some tractors in a straight line, and car whose handling may be best described as 'willfully horrific.'"

7799,"Drive one on a track and you'll finally understand why the GT-R was made, why it stands as both a mechanical achievement as well as a great driver's car, and why it's worth putting up with its surprising compromises as a road tripper. I did."

After the hour-long highway jaunt to the parklands, I turned right where I normally turn left. I was going to get lost, and I was going to find a new favorite byway. "
7815,"It took a while. I looped around some lake that was lined with driveways, got routed into some tiny town, and decided I would just head home having not found anything spectacular."

It turned out to be an uphill climb to a trailhead, empty and beautiful. I couldn't go fast on it, the visibility was too bad, particularly down at the bottom where reeds came right up to the edge of the road. It was like driving in a canyon."
7827,"I turned around at the trailhead and rejoined the road I'd found before. Then it got too slow, also. Too many driveways. And that was a good thing, because I came over one blind crest and the road just disappeared. Sky blue where there should have been asphalt grey."
7828,"If it was a rally stage, it'd be marked as a jump. That morning I was just glad I was staying sane, not driving past what I could see. A scenic drive, not a road-scorching tear."

7837,
7838,"Honestly, the power wasn't an issue. The car had no trouble sitting at a 70-odd mile an hour cruise, and seemed uncomfortably eager to blat up to 90. It's a car that you have to hold back to keep your license. Even on country two lanes, it still has a tendency to walk itself up to uncomfortably high speeds. Again, it's a car that requires restraint from your right foot."
7839,"I didn't even want the exhaust louder. When you're out in the middle of nowhere at the crack of dawn on a Saturday morning, you don't want to be waking everyone up."
7840,But I did want a bit more character. The boxer burble I had dreamed of was nowhere to be found.
7841,Advertisement
7842,
7843,"Worse than that, the car wasn't as playful as I'd hoped. I don't know how else to put it, but it was kind of... remote. The steering gave a fair sense of what the front wheels were doing, but the road always felt a bit ironed out. There wasn't that bristling, shimmying feedback you get in the best sports cars."
7844,"In a really communicative car, there's a particular sensation you get when you start approaching the limit. It's not so much that the tail steps out or the nose washes wide, but that the whole car rotates around you. The car gets up on its toes, and you can play with the balance front and rear."
7845,"The BRZ should have done that. Instead, it just stayed planted, sturdy, tied down."
7846,Advertisement
7847,

The quiet exhaust. It's a car that's easy to justify buying and easy to keep out of trouble with little experience."
7849,"The first things I would do is get the car more alert, more nervous, more darty. I'd try and get more warble out of the exhaust. An alignment, new tires, new components in the steering column, whatever. I would do everything to make it harder to drive, less relaxing on a daily basis, worse."

7853,"There are lots of cars that are objectively good. Cars that grip and roar and slide and do every wonderful thing you could imagine. And good as these cars may be, they don't all possess a certain something. The kind of car that stays on your mind. Ones that feel alive."
7854,Advertisement
7855,

On most lesser vehicles, rarity is called 'people were too smart to buy these shitboxes.' So what's the rarest non-supercar you can think of?"
7881,"I think one of the best examples of this highly exclusive club has to be the Saab 9-4X. Built on GM's Theta platform, this premium SUV was one of the last cars that GM made and slapped Saab badges on. It was the first and only Mexican-built Saab, and they only made 457 of them."

7885,"(Full Disclosure: Porsche wanted us to drive the 911 Carrera GTS so bad, they flew me to the West Coast for an overnight at a Pasadena golf resort, a ""spirited drive"" through the canyons – where we saw the driver of a 1991 Jaguar XJ6 Sovereign in Oyster Gold (with Florida plates) pull the bravest passing move in the history of driving — and a few laps at Willow Springs in the high desert above Los Angeles. I got to say it was a good day.)"

7890,
7891,"The Carrera GTS scoffs at the very idea. A single checkbox delivers a swell-looking, 3.8-seconds-to-60, 190-mph Porsche, so buyers can spend their time driving instead of memorizing feature codes. Choosing among rear-drive GTS coupe, all-wheel-drive Carrera 4 GTS, or Cabrio versions thickens the plot somewhat, but those in sunnier or snowier climes deserve a shot at the perfect 911 too. Intrinsically, however, the only choice is two-wheeler hardtop."
7892,"Introduced in the 911's 997 model generation, the Carrera GTS muscles in between the Carrera S and GT3 in Porsche's now-19-strong lineup of 911 variants. Cynics have derided the GTS as a packaging exercise, and they're right. The question is, does that package provide more value than the retail sum of its options? Let's run it down."
7893,Advertisement
7894,
7895,"The Carrera S Powerkit adds 30 hp to the 3.8-liter flat six's output (peak torque stays the same). The kit comes with hotter cams and a novel, two-channel intake plenum with six flaps that open and close based on engine speed and throttle position."
7896,"My grasp of fluid dynamics is spotty, but engineers say this variable resonance induction system creates pressure-wave oscillations that help pack the combustion chambers with life-giving air. A kind of low-level forced induction, if you will. "
7897,Advertisement
7898,
7899,"Moreover, the intake ports have been resurfaced via some sort of abrasive compound, to help boost intake efficiency. Talking about this process gets the engineers pretty wound up, so you know it's something special."
7900,"In effect, driving a Powerkit-equipped car is kind of like turning up the midrange knob on your dad's old Marantz stereo. Where the standard Carrera S's torque curve swells to a vivid finish at its highest revs, the Powerkit shifts the band downward slightly. So, what you may give up in back-of-the-tach drama, you get back in a bit more potency at the center of the rev range. It comes standard with the sport exhaust, which, when fully alit, sounds like pure malevolence."
7901,Advertisement
7902,
7903,"Is it worth it? Well, paying $17,800 atop a Carrera S for some extra lower-end brightness always felt like a stretch, but packing the kit into the GTS is slightly more palatable."
7904,"The GTS also comes with the Sport Chrono package, which bundles all the fun stuff: PASM continuously-adjustable dampers (the suspension's lowered by 10mm), dynamic engine mounts, and the Sport Plus button, which stiffens the suspension, raises the stability-control threshold to allow more slip angle, sharpens throttle mapping and tells PDK to shift quicker and closer to redline. Personally, I think ordering a 911 without Sport Plus is like buying half a car."
7905,Advertisement
7906,
7907,"The GTS also gets the wider track that's standard on the Carrera 4S; that's something you can't get for any price on a Carrera S. Years ago, the 911 ""turbo look"" option was a way to give the base car more muscle in the haunch region. On the GTS, the extra girth just looks cooler. The wider arches and 36mm extra width give it incrementally more road presence, and – like the 4S – it's possible a slightly higher lateral G number over the base model as well."
7908,"At Big Willow, the GTS has more than enough grip to carry ludicrous speeds through turn two's double apex, and that mind-twisting windup of turns 8 and 9."
7909,Advertisement
7910,
7911,"Not to mention, the GTS also comes with the Carrera Turbo's 20"" center locking hub wheels, which you can't get on a Carrera S, and the same size shoes as the 4S (and GT3): 245s in front and 305s in the rear."
7912,"Transmission. While you'll probably at least want to want the seven-speed manual, that maddeningly brilliant optional PDK just keeps mocking us with its competency in every aspect – in both manual and automatic modes. GTS buyers going PDK also get an electronic rear diff. (That e-diff runs off of the PDK's processor, so you can't get it with the manual.) It engages the rear locker so accurately, driving e-diff and mech-diff cars back-to-back reveals a real difference in rear stability, both on initial turn-in and in quick direction changes. The fully-mechanical part may feel more familiar, but the e-diff is very, very clever."

7914,
7915,"On the inside, the GTS is a vision in Alcantara. I happen to like the look and feel of faux-suede. You can choose leather instead. Outside, you get black trimmings and smoky-eye headlamps. And the sport seats offer a good mix of road-trip comfort and track-force posterior enfoldment."
7916,"What's not included in the GTS package? Porsche's Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC) is a trick system that employs hydraulic actuators to counter-load the antisway bars as needed for flatter cornering without sacrificing general ride quality. Sport PASM drops the ride height by 20 mm on firmer springs. Ceramic composite brakes are a must for all-day track flogging. Total extra cost for all of those, plus PDK: upward of $17,000, sending the GTS coupe right up to base-GT3 pricing."

It's ""usable performance"" personified, and there's not much at canyon speeds to distinguish the GTS from a Carrera S.  On the track, the GTS is sure-footed and fun, delivering the kind of accuracy and confidence we've come to expect from the 991-series 911. "
7920,"Let's face it. These days, the world's last rear-engined sports car is in the hands of a technocracy bent on giving lay-drivers full access to its performance envelope. As such, the 911's true brilliance emerges the closer it gets to its ridiculously high limits, and so a 911 that never sees a racetrack is like a pair of titanium kevlar skis that never leave the bunny slope."

7923,"Should you buy a base GT3 instead? Only if you're a track rat. The GT3 is in another league, performance-wise, but it's not for daily use by the soft of spine."
7924,"In many ways, the Carrera GTS remains the 911's enthusiast's conscience. It's close enough to the GT3 to keep enthusiast buyers interested, and yet, it's a sports car whose accessibility just broadens its appeal. It's not as special as a GT3, as the cynics have a point – it's largely just a spec'ed up Carrera S. But it's got practically all the things an enthusiast driver would order, plus the visual gravitas of extra rear track width, at, Porsche reps say, a 10-15% discount over a similarly-equipped Carrera S."

7989,"You might be surprised what happens if you get stopped for speeding in Virginia. Even if you don't live here, you may find yourself passing through for business or vacation. Educate yourself in advance."
7990,"(The way Virginia deals with speeders has been a hot topic this year, thanks to the jail sentences of our own Patrick George and now Washington Nationals outfielder Jayson Werth. In light of this, we asked Virginia traffic defense attorney Andrew Flusche to shed some light on the state's speeding laws. -Ed.)"

7992,
7993,
7994,Many people think nothing of being stopped for speeding. You'll get a ticket which you can just pay when you get back home. Not in Virginia.
7995,Advertisement
7996,
7997,"Many people who get stopped on the interstates in Virginia get home to find out that they were actually charged with a crime. It's called reckless driving, and it prohibits going over 80 mph or any speed 20+ over the speed limit. This is a misdemeanor offense in Virginia, which is the same level of offense as DUI."
7998,"What's even crazier is that the officer may not tell you exactly what type of ticket you're getting. Many officers simply write ""RD"" on the ticket, which drivers don't usually recognize as reckless driving right away. I think that helps reduce arguments on the side of the road."
7999,"Reckless driving tickets present unique problems for drivers, since they are technically jailable offenses for which the judge could suspend your license. Realistically, most people don't receive punishments that severe. However, people do regularly go to jail and lose their license for this offense."
8000,Advertisement
8001,
8002,"Now that you know the scary truth of Virginia's reckless driving law, what can you do about it in advance?"
8003,Simple. Don't go over 80 in Virginia. No matter what.
8004,"And keep your speed no more than 19 mph over the speed limit. But if the speed limit is 65 mph, you still have to keep it under 80 mph too."
8005,Advertisement
8006,
8007,"That alone will help keep you out of the reckless driving boat. Although there are other types of reckless driving that you could still get nabbed for, such as simply running off the road, which usually entails a reckless driving ticket for ""failure to maintain control"" of the vehicle."
8008,"Also, when you drive through Virginia for a holiday weekend, pay extra careful attention to your driving and your speed. Holiday weekends are major enforcement times for Virginia's traffic laws. For example, during the 2014 Thanksgiving weekend, Virginia State Police cited 2,312 people for reckless driving and 9,789 people for speeding. That's not even including all the tickets issued by local sheriff's offices and police departments. The summer holiday weekends can have even higher numbers, with 2,673 reckless driving tickets issued by the State Police from July 4 to July 6, 2014."
8009,"If you're an unlucky recipient of one of these criminal charges, what should you do?"
8010,Advertisement
8011,
8012,"First of all, read the ticket and look up the ""Law Section"" that you're charged with. If it's regular speeding, you can decide about paying it versus hiring a lawyer to try to have it dismissed."
8013,"But if you're charged with reckless driving, you need to think carefully about how to respond."
8014,"Most importantly, beware of the counties that let you just pay the ticket. Be sure you're making an informed decision before you accept a conviction for reckless driving. You'd be surprised how many people try to get an old reckless driving conviction expunged in Virginia, only to be told that it's impossible. In Virginia, if you are found guilty of a crime, it's on the record for good."
8015,Advertisement
8016,
8017,The best way to learn the truth about what you're really facing is by calling a local traffic lawyer who regularly handles cases where your ticket is pending. You don't have to hire them. But they should be willing to give you an overview of the realistic punishments that the judge may impose.
8018,"Knowing what you're facing gives you the power to make a solid decision about the costs and benefits of different approaches. If the judge never gives jail for the speed you're accused of, that could certainly make the ticket a little less stressful at least."
8019,"It's critical to talk with a local lawyer, since these cases vary widely across Virginia. For example, in some courts, 100 mph is the magic line where jail becomes a threat. But in other courts, 90 mph could land you in jail for a couple days. That makes a big difference if you're charged with 92 in a 70 mph zone."
8020,Advertisement
8021,
8022,"People often ask why Virginia treats speeding so harshly. There are many opinions on this, but it seems like a mix of reasons."
8023,"One is political. Legislators want to look like they're keeping people safe, and having stern traffic laws theoretically makes the roads safer. Almost every year there are proposals in the Virginia General Assembly to loosen the reckless driving laws, and they seem to routinely fail."
8024,Advertisement
8025,
8026,"Financial reasons exist too. Reckless driving fines can go up to $2,500. While that number is not imposed often, it's not unusual to see a fine of $350 or more for these offenses; whereas, the maximum fine for a regular Virginia speeding ticket is $250. Plus, the court costs are higher for a misdemeanor offense than for a traffic ticket. Reckless driving tickets raise a hefty chunk of revenue for the state."
8027,"Now that you're informed, you hopefully won't end up meeting a member of the Virginia State Police during your travels."

And in non-U.S. markets, the 1-Series hatchback was among their chief visual offenders. No longer! With a 2016 refresh, it's far less offensive than it used to be."
8134,"Now, I'm not talking about the old 1-Series coupe and convertible we got in America. That thing was fine. I'm talking about the car that replaced it, the F20 and F21 hatchbacks, cars roundly criticized for their homeliness. Its driving dynamics were fine, but its looks were never great, until now. "

If you want fun, get the M135i, which has a turbo inline six and 326 horsepower. I wish we did! "

According to Motorsport.com, Verstappen was already on his seventh and fifth power unit elements (of only four allowed!). He received an additional 10-place penalty because his crew broke the seals on his engine in the rush to send him out to qualify.

	Today's 
	Nice Price or Crack Pipe contender will require some fancy footwork owing to its six-speed stick. You'll have to decide if that rare option, and its relatively low miles, ensures its price isn't the same old Saab and dance."
8176,"
	Our fun and games were rudely interrupted yesterday when the object of our attention - the 
	1965 Sunbeam Tiger described as running like new - was unceremoniously sold before most of us could weigh in on whether its price was a deal or not. That didn't stop the pluckiest of you from doing so anyway, because that's just how you roll. Hopefully the new owner was able to drive away for less than the asking, seeing as that Tiger was striped with a 76% Crack Pipe loss."

	Hey, remember Saab? You know, funny cars designed by airplane engineers and featuring spunky two-stroke triples and a penchant for rally wins and inspiring the phrase Carlsson på taket? No? Well, how about eclectic cars with wrap-around windscreens, backward engines originally sourced from Triumph, and their ignition switch between the seats? Still not ringing a bell? Okay, how about the Saabs that were little more than thinly veiled Opels with GM Ecotec engines? Ah, there we go."

	The Saab 9-3 of the past decade eschewed much of the uniqueness that made its pre-GM ancestors so damn quirky and endearing. That's not to say these weren't good cars, in fact they're probably some of the best that GM's stable had to offer during the Aughts."
8182,"
	This 
	2003 Saab 9-3 is an upper-level Arc model, which means it should rock the 207-bhp B207R. That's a 2-litre DOHC all-aluminum four, fitted with a Mitsubishi turbo. Backing that up is the car's starring player, a 6-speed F40 manual. That option was removed the following year so its presence here, along with the upscale trim level, makes this an interesting, and relatively unique Swede."

	Visually the car looks to be in pretty good shape both inside and out, with the ad claiming but a few scratches in the paint here are there - but nothing major. There is also a Euro front end according to the ad, which eliminates the front side marker lights. I don't know if that's a mod that's impressive enough to get you laid by a Saab groupie however, but there it is."

8190,"
	The 9-3 has always been a little bit more Opel than Saab, but there is still the key between the seats and the fact that it was built in Sweden to give you the sense of tradition. This one, with its energetic engine and buffet of gears transmission looks to be a pretty good - and is pretty unique - but is it worth $4,800?"

As I recall, they ranged from ""Get a Tesla!"" and ""Why not an Audi R8?"" to ""You don't know automotive perfection until you've driven a 1997 Chrysler Concorde."""

But for now, let me just show you a little glimpse of the very bizarre and brutal car landscape of Iceland. Also, they have a penis museum."
8361,"We'll talk about penises some other time — maybe over drinks? I won't push it — your call. What I really want to talk about is how incredibly strange the carscape of Reykjavik — and, really, all of Iceland — is."
8362,"I went in assuming that Iceland's general population of cars would be a lot like Northern Europe and Scandinavia — and, to some degree, it is. But what I didn't expect was that it would also have a lot in common with the United States, and even Japan. "
8363,"Iceland is, in a very literal way, divided between the Americas and Europe. It's literal because the island nation actually sits right on the border of two tectonic plates: the North American one and the European one. I actually saw this divide in person, and it looks like a line of mountains, which are created, ever so slowly, where the plates bump into one another."
8364,Advertisement
8365,
8366,"The cars in Iceland are somehow aware of the country's divided nature, and reflect that incredibly well. You have the usual assortment of European cars — Citroens, Renaults, VWs, Skodas, and so on — but they're sharing the road with the same sort of everyday cars we see here in the US — Chrysler Town and Countrys, PT Cruisers, Chevy Cruzes, big Chryslers, Ford Econoline vans, etc. It's a mixing you really don't see almost anywhere else."
8367,"Add to that mix a smattering of cars I've never seen outside the Japanese domestic market and some Ladas, GAZ trucks, and other Eastern Bloc cars, and you have the makings of a very interesting wheeled population."
8368,"The one thing you don't really see on the road are old cars, and here's the reason why:"
8369,Advertisement
8370,
8371,"Iceland is positively brutal on cars. Well, really, the climate makes it pretty brutal on anything, but the long, long, wet, cold winters and liberal use of road salt means rust is a cruel, powerful dragon waiting to devour your beloved car in a cloud of brown dust. That Polo up there is from the mid-to-late 90s — not really all that old, but still one of the oldest cars I saw, and it's succumbing to terminal metal acne fast. I thought that lower rear spoiler was plastic, but it looks like it found some novel way to rust too, even."
8372,"Iceland does love cars, though, and there actually is a good population of some fantastic classic cars, but I had to really hunt them down — I'll tell you all about that soon. For now, let's just see what's in daily use:"

Four doors, a huge big glass hatch, and what looked like a lot of usable space inside. It felt a bit like a modern take on a 2CV. "
8383,"Also, it's important to point out that these little FWD city cars are all over Reykjavik, mostly because gas — like almost everything else on the island — is pretty expensive. And, while there's lots of 4WD SUVs and trucks getting around the snowy, icy streets, these little guys manage it just fine as well."
8384,"People in the US justify buying a Range Rover because they drive in the rain and one day hope to drive a couple hundred feet across a lawn, if they feel brave. Out here, they drive cars the size of Cozy Coupes over ice so slick you can't even walk on it. Just think about that."

I've never seen this car outside of Japan, but here it is. I'm sure it's elsewhere in Europe, but still it's great to see this guy mixing it up in the ice and snow."

This was once so common and mundane in the US, and so out of place-looking in Iceland. It's like seeing a horse playing pachinko."

8409,"Sorry for the awful photo, but that's a giant, lifted Sprinter van. They had similar Econolpne ones, too, and they prowled around the city late at night like terrifying monsters. Probably looking for prey of some sort."

But for now, let me just show you a little glimpse of the very bizarre and brutal car landscape of Iceland. Also, they have a penis museum."
8432,"We'll talk about penises some other time — maybe over drinks? I won't push it — your call. What I really want to talk about is how incredibly strange the carscape of Reykjavik — and, really, all of Iceland — is."

8434,"Iceland is, in a very literal way, divided between the Americas and Europe. It's literal because the island nation actually sits right on the border of two tectonic plates: the North American one and the European one. I actually saw this divide in person, and it looks like a line of mountains, which are created, ever so slowly, where the plates bump into one another."

Well, really, the climate makes it pretty brutal on anything, but the long, long, wet, cold winters and liberal use of road salt means rust is a cruel, powerful dragon waiting to devour your beloved car in a cloud of brown dust. That Polo up there is from the mid-to-late 90s — not really all that old, but still one of the oldest cars I saw, and it's succumbing to terminal metal acne fast. I thought that lower rear spoiler was plastic, but it looks like it found some novel way to rust too, even."

8454,"Also, it's important to point out that these little FWD city cars are all over Reykjavik, mostly because gas — like almost everything else on the island — is pretty expensive. And, while there's lots of 4WD SUVs and trucks getting around the snowy, icy streets, these little guys manage it just fine as well."

That task is being handled by a bunch of sailors, and longshoremen, and dockworkers, and port employees, all of whom are currently taking a union-mandated smoke break."
8504,

That means I have a lot of ground to cover if I plan to thoroughly document every part of the import process before the car shows up on U.S. soil, where it will inspire the following conversation among port staff:"

8507,"So today, we start from the start: the laws, rules, and regulations that actually make it possible for me to bring this car to the United States. Based on the e-mails and Tweets and Facebook posts and text messages I’ve received over the last few days, I know a LOT of you are very interested in this. “How can you bring this non-conforming car into America?” you’ve asked me. “You? YOU?? A normal guy like the rest of us, a regular Joe Schmo, with a cell phone, and a couple of credit cards, and a desktop printer that occasionally makes unexplained noises in the night?”"
8508,Advertisement
8509,
8510,"Well, the answer is: it isn’t as difficult as you think. And today I’m going to prove that to you from a legal standpoint, as I’m going to detail the four legal channels you can use to import a vehicle to the United States of America. Special thanks to everyone who helped me gather the information for this column, and especially Japanese Classics, LLC, the importer and dealership in Richmond, Virginia, who is both a) importing my Skyline, and b) patiently answering all of my stupid questions about the import process. (“Will the car get wet?”)"
8511,"Anyway, without further ado: here are the four legal channels you can use to import an automobile to the United States."
8512,Advertisement
8513,
8514,"By far the most obvious way to legally import a vehicle into the United States is to simply bring it into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations. Unfortunately, “simple” is hardly the word to describe this process, as it’s easily the most expensive strategy on this list. "
8515,"To start, bringing a non-conforming car into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations requires crash testing the car in order to prove that it meets U.S. safety standards. That means you can’t simply buy one example of the car you want to import: you have to buy several. And as you can probably guess, all will be destroyed in the ensuing crash tests. This alone can cost anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to over a million, depending on the vehicle."
8516,"In addition to the crash tests, you’ll have to bring your car into compliance with other safety rules and regulations, too. A speedometer that only reads in kilometers must be converted to miles. Headlight angles must be checked to ensure they meet U.S. standards; if not, they’ll have to be replaced with ones that do. You’ll have to install orange reflectors on the front sides of the car, and red reflectors in back. You’ll also have to comply with regulations dictating positioning of the third brake light and the strength of the bumpers. And then there’s stuff you didn’t even consider, like the little chime that beeps when you don’t have your seatbelt on, and a device that limits fuel spillage in an accident. It all must be there, and converting a vehicle to meet these specifications alone can easily cost more than $10,000."
8517,Advertisement
8518,
8519,"And all of this is assuming the car passes its crash tests. If it fails, you’ll have to add additional structural reinforcement in the doors, the roof, the bumpers, the front and rear ends, or possibly all of the above. So once you’ve spent tens – and potentially hundreds – of thousands of dollars just to destroy the vehicle you’re considering in government-mandated crash tests, you may need to spend thousands more to ensure it can pass. "
8520,"The good news: once you’ve passed your crash tests, it’s over. There’s no re-testing, there’s no annual compliance procedure. It’s a massive expense, sure, but it’s a one-time expense – and once you’re certified, you can bring over as many cars as you want."
8521,"Unfortunately there’s another wrinkle involved before that happens. You see, the Department of Transportation isn’t the only federal agency that takes a look at non-conforming cars. Your imported vehicle will also need approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is interested in just how much your desired vehicle pollutes. While getting a pre-1995 vehicle to pass EPA regulations isn’t tremendously difficult, any car made in 1995 or later will need an on-board diagnostics (OBD II) system installed. In some cases, this can be prohibitively expensive, since many foreign-market 1990s vehicles were never manufactured with such a system in the first place."
8522,Advertisement
8523,
8524,"And then there’s one more wrinkle: the great state of California, which I’ll cover below in section four."
8525,"But in spite the enormous expense associated with the process of bringing a foreign car into compliance, several vehicles have been legally imported this way over the years. For example: many car enthusiasts know about Motorex, who brought the mid-1990s “R33” Nissan Skyline GT-R into compliance at great expense – an interesting tale I’ll cover in greater depth in a future column. But Motorex isn’t the only importer to complete the undertaking: a New Mexico-based imported called Europa brought the Mercedes G-Wagen into compliance and sold them for years, long before Mercedes-Benz arrived with an official version in 2002."
8526,Advertisement
8527,
8528,"If a vehicle is “substantially similar” to one that was already sold in the United States, then you can ignore everything I’ve said above and bring it right in. "
8529,"Or at least, that’s the simple explanation. The reality is, of course, a lot more complicated."
8530,"The “substantially similar” clause is primarily aimed at vehicles coming in to the United States from Canada. Imagine this situation: let’s say you bought a Canadian-spec Toyota Highlander in Toronto, and then your job transferred you to the United States. Rather than going through the trouble and expense of selling your Canadian Highlander and buying another one in the States, you can simply claim your Highlander is “substantially similar” to a U.S. model – a claim that’s undoubtedly true, since Canada and the United States broadly share most emissions and vehicle safety regulations. You get a few forms, you sign a few papers, you submit a standard letter from the automaker, and boom! Your Highlander is now legal in the United States."
8531,Advertisement
8532,
8533,"Unfortunately, enthusiasts are largely locked out of the “substantially similar” clause. The reason is that while Canadian cars largely conform to U.S. laws, vehicles from other markets do not necessarily share the same reciprocity. "
8534,"I’ll give you an example to help illustrate my point. When I started this process more than six months ago, my initial plan was to import a late-2000s “E60” BMW M5 station wagon; the one with the huge V10 and that awful transmission; the one that felt like you were in the car with a 14-year-old whose only previous experience with a stick shift was driving a farm tractor through a hay field. "
8535,"My thinking was this: although BMW never sold the M5 wagon in the U.S., they did sell the regular 5 Series wagon – and that means the M5 wagon’s body is “substantially similar” to a vehicle that’s already in compliance. Likewise, they never sold a wagon with that V10 – but they did sell a sedan with that engine, which makes the engine “substantially similar,” too. I figured I would merely need to find a car, change a few headlights, and I’d be on my way, cruising around America in a suave M5 wagon."
8536,Advertisement
8537,
8538,"But here’s what I found out: although the V10 engine in the European-spec M5 is “substantially similar” the one in the American-spec model, the EPA can’t confirm that without conducting its tests. And although the body is substantially similar, the Department of Transportation doesn’t quite operate on the “See how similar it looks?” theory of government regulation. They, too, would need to run tests – crash tests, I mean – in order to prove that the car is in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations. "
8539,"However: if you’re interested in a substantially similar car, there is one interesting way around these tests: all you need to do is get an automaker to write you a letter stating that the car is indeed substantially similar to a vehicle sold in the United States. "
8540,"Now, this may sound like a long, tiresome process; a process where you speak to 20 different people and listen to hold music for the better part of a week, and eventually you just chew off your own thumb. But in reality, it’s common practice in the Toyota Highlander example given above. Just call an automaker’s customer service line, tell them you’re moving from Canada with your car, and you’ll probably get the letter."
8541,Advertisement
8542,
8543,But for a car coming in from Europe? Good luck. 
8544,"The automaker has two major incentives not to write this letter. Number one: they don’t want some idiot spending big money on a foreign version of its product, when that person could just go buy a new one in the United States. And number two: they don’t want the liability of certifying the safety equipment of a foreign-spec vehicle – because the automaker would undoubtedly get sued if an accident took place."
8545,"So, a simple summary of the above paragraphs: unless you want to import a car from Canada that was already sold in the United States, you stand a very small chance of bringing it here under the “substantially similar” clause."
8546,Advertisement
8547,
8548,"However, there is one glimmer of hope. In 2006, a highly reputable Registered Importer in Baltimore called JK Technologies managed to convince the government that the “B5” Audi RS4 Avant was “substantially similar” to the A4 and S4 Avant models already sold here by Audi (despite protests from Volkswagen of America). That means two things: number one, the 2000-2001 Audi RS4 Avant is indeed legal for importation under this clause, with a few minor modifications. And number two: it’s possible to import a cool enthusiast car under the “substantially similar” clause. But it’s very, very unlikely. "

8550,
8551,"If you’re a car enthusiast in the United States, you’re probably familiar with the Show and Display rule: the law that Bill Gates got passed in order to drive a Porsche 959 in America."
8552,"In reality, the history of the Show and Display law is a little more complicated. For one thing, it wasn’t just Gates who wanted the law passed, but actually several wealthy American car enthusiasts – including Ralph Lauren and Otis Chandler, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. "
8553,"Eager to drive the 959 and various other rare vehicles never offered in the United States, the group banded together and hired an attorney in Washington, D.C., to approach the EPA, the NHTSA, and major automakers in order to come up with a “Show and Display” rule – essentially a law that allows certain unique vehicles to be exempted from the government’s stringent rules and regulations, provided they are brought over solely for purposes of “show and display.”"
8554,Advertisement
8555,
8556,"The law was eventually passed in 1999, and it exempted certain unique vehicles from the federal government’s challenging regulations and rules surrounding motor vehicle safety. In other words: No crash tests. No side marker lights. No headlight swaps. No seat belt chimes. Contrary to popular belief, however, vehicles imported under the “Show and Display” exemption must still conform to EPA rules and regulations – but that’s the easy part. And most importantly, it’s better than nothing."
8557,But here’s the problem with Show and Display: it does not apply to you. 
8558,"What I mean by this is, Show and Display was primarily designed solely to apply to the most unusual, rarest, and most expensive vehicles on the planet. In fact, the U.S. government maintains a list of vehicles it has approved for Show and Display – and the list includes cars like the Aston Martin One-77, the Bugatti EB110, the McLaren F1, and the Mercedes CLK-GTR. Likewise, it maintains a list of vehicle it has denied under Show and Display – and that list includes cars like the Mazda Cosmo, the Lotus Elise S1, the Audi RS2, and virtually every standard variation of the Nissan Skyline GT-R that you can possibly imagine."
8559,Advertisement
8560,
8561,"Essentially, for a car to pass Show and Display scrutiny, the rules are these. Number one, it must never have been offered for sale in the United States. Number two, it must be out of production. Number three, it cannot be a replica or a kit car. And number four, production cannot exceed 500 examples. Admittedly, there are a few exceptions to these rules, but this is the general gist of it."
8562,"Beyond those strict guidelines, the government imposes a few additional measures on Show and Display vehicles. First: you can’t sell the car without written approval from the NHTSA, as they don’t want Show and Displayers turning into profiteers. After all, the government probably figures, these cars are for show and display not import and profit. And second: you’re limited to 2,500 miles per year. No cross-country roadtrips in your Bugatti EB110."
8563,"As a result, Show and Display is out for importing a vehicle unless you have Ralph Lauren money – and you’re bringing in a Ralph Lauren-style car."
8564,Advertisement
8565,
8566,"Here’s the crazy thing about all these regulations. After all the words I’ve written above; after all the EPA restrictions, and DOT regulations, and crash tests, and bumper strength laws; after all the rules and guidelines and mileage limits; after all that … the day a car turns 25 years old, it’s legal to import, with no restrictions at all. "
8567,Advertisement
8568,
8569,And I mean 25 years old. And I mean no restrictions. 
8570,"Seriously: if a car is 24 years and 11 months old, you’d better bring it into compliance or else risk it getting crushed into a cube the size of a surge protector. But the moment it turns 25 years old, anything goes. No seat belts? No problem. No headlights? No problem. You want to import a Nissan Figaro with a big block Chevy V8 and windows tinted so dark that they look like one-way mirrors? As long as it’s 25 years old, no problem. Bring it in, with only one caveat: it needs to be using its original engine, or one that was already EPA certified."
8571,"This is how I’m importing my Skyline GT-R. Since the first “R32” GT-Rs were manufactured in August 1989, they became 25 years old – and thus fully legal – in August 2014. No crash tests, no headlight changes, no EPA certification. My car is a January 1990 build, which means it’s legally importable as of January 2015. And that means it’ll be ready to go when it comes off the boat in March. "
8572,Advertisement
8573,
8574,"There are only two exceptions to this little rule. Number one: your own state laws might have something to say about a car, 25 years old or not, without safety items like seat belts and headlights. So even though you’re exempt from federal laws on the subject, you still have to comply with your own state rules and regulations. Some states have no inspection, so this isn’t a problem – but in Virginia (where the car will be arriving) and Pennsylvania (where I live), I had better have seat belts, or I won’t get plates. "
8575,"Exception number two: the great state of California, whose emissions laws are stricter than the federal government’s. You see, while the EPA exempts vehicles on a rolling 21-year basis, meaning that anything age 21 or older is exempt from federal emissions laws, California laws start with all vehicles manufactured after 1975. In other words: if your car is newer than 1975, and it was never originally certified to operate in California, you must go about getting it certified there – even if it’s already legal in every other state. Since this process can cost thousands of dollars, I won’t be doing this – which means my car can’t go to a buyer in California. "
8576,"So there you go, ladies and gentlemen: a quick rundown of the import laws that somehow turned into an incredibly lengthy rundown of the import laws. You may now take your union-mandated smoke break. "

A speedometer that only reads in kilometers must be converted to miles. Headlight angles must be checked to ensure they meet U.S. standards; if not, they’ll have to be replaced with ones that do. You’ll have to install orange reflectors on the front sides of the car, and red reflectors in back. You’ll also have to comply with regulations dictating positioning of the third brake light and the strength of the bumpers. And then there’s stuff you didn’t even consider, like the little chime that beeps when you don’t have your seatbelt on, and a device that limits fuel spillage in an accident. It all must be there, and converting a vehicle to meet these specifications alone can easily cost more than $10,000."
8597,Advertisement
8598,
8599,"And all of this is assuming the car passes its crash tests. If it fails, you’ll have to add additional structural reinforcement in the doors, the roof, the bumpers, the front and rear ends, or possibly all of the above. So once you’ve spent tens – and potentially hundreds – of thousands of dollars just to destroy the vehicle you’re considering in government-mandated crash tests, you may need to spend thousands more to ensure it can pass. "
8600,"The good news: once you’ve passed your crash tests, it’s over. There’s no re-testing, there’s no annual compliance procedure. It’s a massive expense, sure, but it’s a one-time expense – and once you’re certified, you can bring over as many cars as you want."
8601,"Unfortunately there’s another wrinkle involved before that happens. You see, the Department of Transportation isn’t the only federal agency that takes a look at non-conforming cars. Your imported vehicle will also need approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is interested in just how much your desired vehicle pollutes. While getting a pre-1995 vehicle to pass EPA regulations isn’t tremendously difficult, any car made in 1995 or later will need an on-board diagnostics (OBD II) system installed. In some cases, this can be prohibitively expensive, since many foreign-market 1990s vehicles were never manufactured with such a system in the first place."
8602,Advertisement
8603,
8604,"And then there’s one more wrinkle: the great state of California, which I’ll cover below in section four."
8605,"But in spite the enormous expense associated with the process of bringing a foreign car into compliance, several vehicles have been legally imported this way over the years. For example: many car enthusiasts know about Motorex, who brought the mid-1990s “R33” Nissan Skyline GT-R into compliance at great expense – an interesting tale I’ll cover in greater depth in a future column. But Motorex isn’t the only importer to complete the undertaking: a New Mexico-based imported called Europa brought the Mercedes G-Wagen into compliance and sold them for years, long before Mercedes-Benz arrived with an official version in 2002."

8608,"If a vehicle is “substantially similar” to one that was already sold in the United States, then you can ignore everything I’ve said above and bring it right in. "
8609,"Or at least, that’s the simple explanation. The reality is, of course, a lot more complicated."
8610,"The “substantially similar” clause is primarily aimed at vehicles coming in to the United States from Canada. Imagine this situation: let’s say you bought a Canadian-spec Toyota Highlander in Toronto, and then your job transferred you to the United States. Rather than going through the trouble and expense of selling your Canadian Highlander and buying another one in the States, you can simply claim your Highlander is “substantially similar” to a U.S. model – a claim that’s undoubtedly true, since Canada and the United States broadly share most emissions and vehicle safety regulations. You get a few forms, you sign a few papers, you submit a standard letter from the automaker, and boom! Your Highlander is now legal in the United States."
8611,Advertisement
8612,
8613,"Unfortunately, enthusiasts are largely locked out of the “substantially similar” clause. The reason is that while Canadian cars largely conform to U.S. laws, vehicles from other markets do not necessarily share the same reciprocity. "
8614,"I’ll give you an example to help illustrate my point. When I started this process more than six months ago, my initial plan was to import a late-2000s “E60” BMW M5 station wagon; the one with the huge V10 and that awful transmission; the one that felt like you were in the car with a 14-year-old whose only previous experience with a stick shift was driving a farm tractor through a hay field. "
8615,"My thinking was this: although BMW never sold the M5 wagon in the U.S., they did sell the regular 5 Series wagon – and that means the M5 wagon’s body is “substantially similar” to a vehicle that’s already in compliance. Likewise, they never sold a wagon with that V10 – but they did sell a sedan with that engine, which makes the engine “substantially similar,” too. I figured I would merely need to find a car, change a few headlights, and I’d be on my way, cruising around America in a suave M5 wagon."
8616,Advertisement
8617,
8618,"But here’s what I found out: although the V10 engine in the European-spec M5 is “substantially similar” the one in the American-spec model, the EPA can’t confirm that without conducting its tests. And although the body is substantially similar, the Department of Transportation doesn’t quite operate on the “See how similar it looks?” theory of government regulation. They, too, would need to run tests – crash tests, I mean – in order to prove that the car is in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations. "
8619,"However: if you’re interested in a substantially similar car, there is one interesting way around these tests: all you need to do is get an automaker to write you a letter stating that the car is indeed substantially similar to a vehicle sold in the United States. "
8620,"Now, this may sound like a long, tiresome process; a process where you speak to 20 different people and listen to hold music for the better part of a week, and eventually you just chew off your own thumb. But in reality, it’s common practice in the Toyota Highlander example given above. Just call an automaker’s customer service line, tell them you’re moving from Canada with your car, and you’ll probably get the letter."
8621,Advertisement
8622,
8623,But for a car coming in from Europe? Good luck. 
8624,"The automaker has two major incentives not to write this letter. Number one: they don’t want some idiot spending big money on a foreign version of its product, when that person could just go buy a new one in the United States. And number two: they don’t want the liability of certifying the safety equipment of a foreign-spec vehicle – because the automaker would undoubtedly get sued if an accident took place."
8625,"So, a simple summary of the above paragraphs: unless you want to import a car from Canada that was already sold in the United States, you stand a very small chance of bringing it here under the “substantially similar” clause."
8626,Advertisement
8627,
8628,"However, there is one glimmer of hope. In 2006, a highly reputable Registered Importer in Baltimore called JK Technologies managed to convince the government that the “B5” Audi RS4 Avant was “substantially similar” to the A4 and S4 Avant models already sold here by Audi (despite protests from Volkswagen of America). That means two things: number one, the 2000-2001 Audi RS4 Avant is indeed legal for importation under this clause, with a few minor modifications. And number two: it’s possible to import a cool enthusiast car under the “substantially similar” clause. But it’s very, very unlikely. "

8630,
8631,"If you’re a car enthusiast in the United States, you’re probably familiar with the Show and Display rule: the law that Bill Gates got passed in order to drive a Porsche 959 in America."
8632,"In reality, the history of the Show and Display law is a little more complicated. For one thing, it wasn’t just Gates who wanted the law passed, but actually several wealthy American car enthusiasts – including Ralph Lauren and Otis Chandler, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. "
8633,"Eager to drive the 959 and various other rare vehicles never offered in the United States, the group banded together and hired an attorney in Washington, D.C., to approach the EPA, the NHTSA, and major automakers in order to come up with a “Show and Display” rule – essentially a law that allows certain unique vehicles to be exempted from the government’s stringent rules and regulations, provided they are brought over solely for purposes of “show and display.”"
8634,Advertisement
8635,
8636,"The law was eventually passed in 1999, and it exempted certain unique vehicles from the federal government’s challenging regulations and rules surrounding motor vehicle safety. In other words: No crash tests. No side marker lights. No headlight swaps. No seat belt chimes. Contrary to popular belief, however, vehicles imported under the “Show and Display” exemption must still conform to EPA rules and regulations – but that’s the easy part. And most importantly, it’s better than nothing."
8637,But here’s the problem with Show and Display: it does not apply to you. 
8638,"What I mean by this is, Show and Display was primarily designed solely to apply to the most unusual, rarest, and most expensive vehicles on the planet. In fact, the U.S. government maintains a list of vehicles it has approved for Show and Display – and the list includes cars like the Aston Martin One-77, the Bugatti EB110, the McLaren F1, and the Mercedes CLK-GTR. Likewise, it maintains a list of vehicle it has denied under Show and Display – and that list includes cars like the Mazda Cosmo, the Lotus Elise S1, the Audi RS2, and virtually every standard variation of the Nissan Skyline GT-R that you can possibly imagine."
8639,Advertisement
8640,
8641,"Essentially, for a car to pass Show and Display scrutiny, the rules are these. Number one, it must never have been offered for sale in the United States. Number two, it must be out of production. Number three, it cannot be a replica or a kit car. And number four, production cannot exceed 500 examples. Admittedly, there are a few exceptions to these rules, but this is the general gist of it."
8642,"Beyond those strict guidelines, the government imposes a few additional measures on Show and Display vehicles. First: you can’t sell the car without written approval from the NHTSA, as they don’t want Show and Displayers turning into profiteers. After all, the government probably figures, these cars are for show and display not import and profit. And second: you’re limited to 2,500 miles per year. No cross-country roadtrips in your Bugatti EB110."
8643,"As a result, Show and Display is out for importing a vehicle unless you have Ralph Lauren money – and you’re bringing in a Ralph Lauren-style car."

8645,
8646,"Here’s the crazy thing about all these regulations. After all the words I’ve written above; after all the EPA restrictions, and DOT regulations, and crash tests, and bumper strength laws; after all the rules and guidelines and mileage limits; after all that … the day a car turns 25 years old, it’s legal to import, with no restrictions at all. "
8647,Advertisement
8648,
8649,And I mean 25 years old. And I mean no restrictions. 
8650,"Seriously: if a car is 24 years and 11 months old, you’d better bring it into compliance or else risk it getting crushed into a cube the size of a surge protector. But the moment it turns 25 years old, anything goes. No seat belts? No problem. No headlights? No problem. You want to import a Nissan Figaro with a big block Chevy V8 and windows tinted so dark that they look like one-way mirrors? As long as it’s 25 years old, no problem. Bring it in, with only one caveat: it needs to be using its original engine, or one that was already EPA certified."
8651,"This is how I’m importing my Skyline GT-R. Since the first “R32” GT-Rs were manufactured in August 1989, they became 25 years old – and thus fully legal – in August 2014. No crash tests, no headlight changes, no EPA certification. My car is a January 1990 build, which means it’s legally importable as of January 2015. And that means it’ll be ready to go when it comes off the boat in March. "
8652,Advertisement
8653,
8654,"There are only two exceptions to this little rule. Number one: your own state laws might have something to say about a car, 25 years old or not, without safety items like seat belts and headlights. So even though you’re exempt from federal laws on the subject, you still have to comply with your own state rules and regulations. Some states have no inspection, so this isn’t a problem – but in Virginia (where the car will be arriving) and Pennsylvania (where I live), I had better have seat belts, or I won’t get plates. "
8655,"Exception number two: the great state of California, whose emissions laws are stricter than the federal government’s. You see, while the EPA exempts vehicles on a rolling 21-year basis, meaning that anything age 21 or older is exempt from federal emissions laws, California laws start with all vehicles manufactured after 1975. In other words: if your car is newer than 1975, and it was never originally certified to operate in California, you must go about getting it certified there – even if it’s already legal in every other state. Since this process can cost thousands of dollars, I won’t be doing this – which means my car can’t go to a buyer in California. "
8656,"So there you go, ladies and gentlemen: a quick rundown of the import laws that somehow turned into an incredibly lengthy rundown of the import laws. You may now take your union-mandated smoke break. "

8663,"As many of you know, I am currently importing a 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R to the United States. Well, just to be clear, I am not importing it. That task is being handled by a bunch of sailors, and longshoremen, and dockworkers, and port employees, all of whom are currently taking a union-mandated smoke break."
8664,
8665,"But anyway: someone is importing my Skyline GT-R to America. And if you followed me on Twitter, you’d know that my new car is just seven weeks away from reaching the United States. That means I have a lot of ground to cover if I plan to thoroughly document every part of the import process before the car shows up on U.S. soil, where it will inspire the following conversation among port staff:"
8666,"Port Worker 1: Why the hell would anyone spend so much money just to import this crappy old Nissan?Port Worker 2: I don’t know, but I think it’s time for our union-mandated smoke break!"
8667,"So today, we start from the start: the laws, rules, and regulations that actually make it possible for me to bring this car to the United States. Based on the e-mails and Tweets and Facebook posts and text messages I’ve received over the last few days, I know a LOT of you are very interested in this. “How can you bring this non-conforming car into America?” you’ve asked me. “You? YOU?? A normal guy like the rest of us, a regular Joe Schmo, with a cell phone, and a couple of credit cards, and a desktop printer that occasionally makes unexplained noises in the night?”"

8670,"Well, the answer is: it isn’t as difficult as you think. And today I’m going to prove that to you from a legal standpoint, as I’m going to detail the four legal channels you can use to import a vehicle to the United States of America. Special thanks to everyone who helped me gather the information for this column, and especially Japanese Classics, LLC, the importer and dealership in Richmond, Virginia, who is both a) importing my Skyline, and b) patiently answering all of my stupid questions about the import process. (“Will the car get wet?”)"
8671,"Anyway, without further ado: here are the four legal channels you can use to import an automobile to the United States."
8672,Advertisement
8673,
8674,"By far the most obvious way to legally import a vehicle into the United States is to simply bring it into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations. Unfortunately, “simple” is hardly the word to describe this process, as it’s easily the most expensive strategy on this list. "
8675,"To start, bringing a non-conforming car into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations requires crash testing the car in order to prove that it meets U.S. safety standards. That means you can’t simply buy one example of the car you want to import: you have to buy several. And as you can probably guess, all will be destroyed in the ensuing crash tests. This alone can cost anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to over a million, depending on the vehicle."
8676,"In addition to the crash tests, you’ll have to bring your car into compliance with other safety rules and regulations, too. A speedometer that only reads in kilometers must be converted to miles. Headlight angles must be checked to ensure they meet U.S. standards; if not, they’ll have to be replaced with ones that do. You’ll have to install orange reflectors on the front sides of the car, and red reflectors in back. You’ll also have to comply with regulations dictating positioning of the third brake light and the strength of the bumpers. And then there’s stuff you didn’t even consider, like the little chime that beeps when you don’t have your seatbelt on, and a device that limits fuel spillage in an accident.

You see, while the EPA exempts vehicles on a rolling 21-year basis, meaning that anything age 21 or older is exempt from federal emissions laws, California laws start with all vehicles manufactured after 1975. In other words: if your car is newer than 1975, and it was never originally certified to operate in California, you must go about getting it certified there – even if it’s already legal in every other state. Since this process can cost thousands of dollars, I won’t be doing this – which means my car can’t go to a buyer in California. "
8736,"So there you go, ladies and gentlemen: a quick rundown of the import laws that somehow turned into an incredibly lengthy rundown of the import laws. You may now take your union-mandated smoke break. "

He worked as a manager for Porsche Cars North America before quitting to become a writer, largely because it meant he no longer had to wear pants. Also, he wrote this entire bio himself in the third person."

8743,"As many of you know, I am currently importing a 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R to the United States. Well, just to be clear, I am not importing it. That task is being handled by a bunch of sailors, and longshoremen, and dockworkers, and port employees, all of whom are currently taking a union-mandated smoke break."
8744,
8745,"But anyway: someone is importing my Skyline GT-R to America. And if you followed me on Twitter, you’d know that my new car is just seven weeks away from reaching the United States. That means I have a lot of ground to cover if I plan to thoroughly document every part of the import process before the car shows up on U.S. soil, where it will inspire the following conversation among port staff:"
8746,"Port Worker 1: Why the hell would anyone spend so much money just to import this crappy old Nissan?Port Worker 2: I don’t know, but I think it’s time for our union-mandated smoke break!"
8747,"So today, we start from the start: the laws, rules, and regulations that actually make it possible for me to bring this car to the United States. Based on the e-mails and Tweets and Facebook posts and text messages I’ve received over the last few days, I know a LOT of you are very interested in this. “How can you bring this non-conforming car into America?” you’ve asked me. “You? YOU?? A normal guy like the rest of us, a regular Joe Schmo, with a cell phone, and a couple of credit cards, and a desktop printer that occasionally makes unexplained noises in the night?”"
8748,Advertisement
8749,
8750,"Well, the answer is: it isn’t as difficult as you think. And today I’m going to prove that to you from a legal standpoint, as I’m going to detail the four legal channels you can use to import a vehicle to the United States of America. Special thanks to everyone who helped me gather the information for this column, and especially Japanese Classics, LLC, the importer and dealership in Richmond, Virginia, who is both a) importing my Skyline, and b) patiently answering all of my stupid questions about the import process. (“Will the car get wet?”)"
8751,"Anyway, without further ado: here are the four legal channels you can use to import an automobile to the United States."
8752,Advertisement
8753,
8754,"By far the most obvious way to legally import a vehicle into the United States is to simply bring it into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations. Unfortunately, “simple” is hardly the word to describe this process, as it’s easily the most expensive strategy on this list. "
8755,"To start, bringing a non-conforming car into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations requires crash testing the car in order to prove that it meets U.S. safety standards. That means you can’t simply buy one example of the car you want to import: you have to buy several. And as you can probably guess, all will be destroyed in the ensuing crash tests. This alone can cost anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to over a million, depending on the vehicle."
8756,"In addition to the crash tests, you’ll have to bring your car into compliance with other safety rules and regulations, too. A speedometer that only reads in kilometers must be converted to miles. Headlight angles must be checked to ensure they meet U.S. standards; if not, they’ll have to be replaced with ones that do. You’ll have to install orange reflectors on the front sides of the car, and red reflectors in back. You’ll also have to comply with regulations dictating positioning of the third brake light and the strength of the bumpers. And then there’s stuff you didn’t even consider, like the little chime that beeps when you don’t have your seatbelt on, and a device that limits fuel spillage in an accident. It all must be there, and converting a vehicle to meet these specifications alone can easily cost more than $10,000."
8757,Advertisement
8758,
8759,"And all of this is assuming the car passes its crash tests. If it fails, you’ll have to add additional structural reinforcement in the doors, the roof, the bumpers, the front and rear ends, or possibly all of the above. So once you’ve spent tens – and potentially hundreds – of thousands of dollars just to destroy the vehicle you’re considering in government-mandated crash tests, you may need to spend thousands more to ensure it can pass. "
8760,"The good news: once you’ve passed your crash tests, it’s over. There’s no re-testing, there’s no annual compliance procedure. It’s a massive expense, sure, but it’s a one-time expense – and once you’re certified, you can bring over as many cars as you want."
8761,"Unfortunately there’s another wrinkle involved before that happens. You see, the Department of Transportation isn’t the only federal agency that takes a look at non-conforming cars. Your imported vehicle will also need approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is interested in just how much your desired vehicle pollutes. While getting a pre-1995 vehicle to pass EPA regulations isn’t tremendously difficult, any car made in 1995 or later will need an on-board diagnostics (OBD II) system installed. In some cases, this can be prohibitively expensive, since many foreign-market 1990s vehicles were never manufactured with such a system in the first place."
8762,Advertisement
8763,
8764,"And then there’s one more wrinkle: the great state of California, which I’ll cover below in section four."
8765,"But in spite the enormous expense associated with the process of bringing a foreign car into compliance, several vehicles have been legally imported this way over the years. For example: many car enthusiasts know about Motorex, who brought the mid-1990s “R33” Nissan Skyline GT-R into compliance at great expense – an interesting tale I’ll cover in greater depth in a future column. But Motorex isn’t the only importer to complete the undertaking: a New Mexico-based imported called Europa brought the Mercedes G-Wagen into compliance and sold them for years, long before Mercedes-Benz arrived with an official version in 2002."

8767,
8768,"If a vehicle is “substantially similar” to one that was already sold in the United States, then you can ignore everything I’ve said above and bring it right in. "
8769,"Or at least, that’s the simple explanation. The reality is, of course, a lot more complicated."
8770,"The “substantially similar” clause is primarily aimed at vehicles coming in to the United States from Canada. Imagine this situation: let’s say you bought a Canadian-spec Toyota Highlander in Toronto, and then your job transferred you to the United States. Rather than going through the trouble and expense of selling your Canadian Highlander and buying another one in the States, you can simply claim your Highlander is “substantially similar” to a U.S. model – a claim that’s undoubtedly true, since Canada and the United States broadly share most emissions and vehicle safety regulations. You get a few forms, you sign a few papers, you submit a standard letter from the automaker, and boom! Your Highlander is now legal in the United States."
8771,Advertisement
8772,
8773,"Unfortunately, enthusiasts are largely locked out of the “substantially similar” clause. The reason is that while Canadian cars largely conform to U.S. laws, vehicles from other markets do not necessarily share the same reciprocity. "
8774,"I’ll give you an example to help illustrate my point. When I started this process more than six months ago, my initial plan was to import a late-2000s “E60” BMW M5 station wagon; the one with the huge V10 and that awful transmission; the one that felt like you were in the car with a 14-year-old whose only previous experience with a stick shift was driving a farm tractor through a hay field. "
8775,"My thinking was this: although BMW never sold the M5 wagon in the U.S., they did sell the regular 5 Series wagon – and that means the M5 wagon’s body is “substantially similar” to a vehicle that’s already in compliance. Likewise, they never sold a wagon with that V10 – but they did sell a sedan with that engine, which makes the engine “substantially similar,” too. I figured I would merely need to find a car, change a few headlights, and I’d be on my way, cruising around America in a suave M5 wagon."
8776,Advertisement
8777,
8778,"But here’s what I found out: although the V10 engine in the European-spec M5 is “substantially similar” the one in the American-spec model, the EPA can’t confirm that without conducting its tests. And although the body is substantially similar, the Department of Transportation doesn’t quite operate on the “See how similar it looks?” theory of government regulation. They, too, would need to run tests – crash tests, I mean – in order to prove that the car is in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations. "
8779,"However: if you’re interested in a substantially similar car, there is one interesting way around these tests: all you need to do is get an automaker to write you a letter stating that the car is indeed substantially similar to a vehicle sold in the United States. "
8780,"Now, this may sound like a long, tiresome process; a process where you speak to 20 different people and listen to hold music for the better part of a week, and eventually you just chew off your own thumb. But in reality, it’s common practice in the Toyota Highlander example given above. Just call an automaker’s customer service line, tell them you’re moving from Canada with your car, and you’ll probably get the letter."
8781,Advertisement
8782,
8783,But for a car coming in from Europe? Good luck. 
8784,"The automaker has two major incentives not to write this letter. Number one: they don’t want some idiot spending big money on a foreign version of its product, when that person could just go buy a new one in the United States. And number two: they don’t want the liability of certifying the safety equipment of a foreign-spec vehicle – because the automaker would undoubtedly get sued if an accident took place."
8785,"So, a simple summary of the above paragraphs: unless you want to import a car from Canada that was already sold in the United States, you stand a very small chance of bringing it here under the “substantially similar” clause."
8786,Advertisement
8787,
8788,"However, there is one glimmer of hope. In 2006, a highly reputable Registered Importer in Baltimore called JK Technologies managed to convince the government that the “B5” Audi RS4 Avant was “substantially similar” to the A4 and S4 Avant models already sold here by Audi (despite protests from Volkswagen of America). That means two things: number one, the 2000-2001 Audi RS4 Avant is indeed legal for importation under this clause, with a few minor modifications. And number two: it’s possible to import a cool enthusiast car under the “substantially similar” clause. But it’s very, very unlikely. "

8790,
8791,"If you’re a car enthusiast in the United States, you’re probably familiar with the Show and Display rule: the law that Bill Gates got passed in order to drive a Porsche 959 in America."
8792,"In reality, the history of the Show and Display law is a little more complicated. For one thing, it wasn’t just Gates who wanted the law passed, but actually several wealthy American car enthusiasts – including Ralph Lauren and Otis Chandler, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. "
8793,"Eager to drive the 959 and various other rare vehicles never offered in the United States, the group banded together and hired an attorney in Washington, D.C., to approach the EPA, the NHTSA, and major automakers in order to come up with a “Show and Display” rule – essentially a law that allows certain unique vehicles to be exempted from the government’s stringent rules and regulations, provided they are brought over solely for purposes of “show and display.”"
8794,Advertisement
8795,
8796,"The law was eventually passed in 1999, and it exempted certain unique vehicles from the federal government’s challenging regulations and rules surrounding motor vehicle safety. In other words: No crash tests. No side marker lights. No headlight swaps. No seat belt chimes. Contrary to popular belief, however, vehicles imported under the “Show and Display” exemption must still conform to EPA rules and regulations – but that’s the easy part. And most importantly, it’s better than nothing."
8797,But here’s the problem with Show and Display: it does not apply to you. 
8798,"What I mean by this is, Show and Display was primarily designed solely to apply to the most unusual, rarest, and most expensive vehicles on the planet. In fact, the U.S. government maintains a list of vehicles it has approved for Show and Display – and the list includes cars like the Aston Martin One-77, the Bugatti EB110, the McLaren F1, and the Mercedes CLK-GTR. Likewise, it maintains a list of vehicle it has denied under Show and Display – and that list includes cars like the Mazda Cosmo, the Lotus Elise S1, the Audi RS2, and virtually every standard variation of the Nissan Skyline GT-R that you can possibly imagine."
8799,Advertisement
8800,
8801,"Essentially, for a car to pass Show and Display scrutiny, the rules are these. Number one, it must never have been offered for sale in the United States. Number two, it must be out of production. Number three, it cannot be a replica or a kit car. And number four, production cannot exceed 500 examples. Admittedly, there are a few exceptions to these rules, but this is the general gist of it."
8802,"Beyond those strict guidelines, the government imposes a few additional measures on Show and Display vehicles. First: you can’t sell the car without written approval from the NHTSA, as they don’t want Show and Displayers turning into profiteers. After all, the government probably figures, these cars are for show and display not import and profit. And second: you’re limited to 2,500 miles per year. No cross-country roadtrips in your Bugatti EB110."
8803,"As a result, Show and Display is out for importing a vehicle unless you have Ralph Lauren money – and you’re bringing in a Ralph Lauren-style car."

8805,
8806,"Here’s the crazy thing about all these regulations. After all the words I’ve written above; after all the EPA restrictions, and DOT regulations, and crash tests, and bumper strength laws; after all the rules and guidelines and mileage limits; after all that … the day a car turns 25 years old, it’s legal to import, with no restrictions at all. "
8807,Advertisement
8808,
8809,And I mean 25 years old. And I mean no restrictions. 
8810,"Seriously: if a car is 24 years and 11 months old, you’d better bring it into compliance or else risk it getting crushed into a cube the size of a surge protector. But the moment it turns 25 years old, anything goes. No seat belts? No problem. No headlights? No problem. You want to import a Nissan Figaro with a big block Chevy V8 and windows tinted so dark that they look like one-way mirrors? As long as it’s 25 years old, no problem. Bring it in, with only one caveat: it needs to be using its original engine, or one that was already EPA certified."
8811,"This is how I’m importing my Skyline GT-R. Since the first “R32” GT-Rs were manufactured in August 1989, they became 25 years old – and thus fully legal – in August 2014. No crash tests, no headlight changes, no EPA certification. My car is a January 1990 build, which means it’s legally importable as of January 2015. And that means it’ll be ready to go when it comes off the boat in March. "
8812,Advertisement
8813,
8814,"There are only two exceptions to this little rule. Number one: your own state laws might have something to say about a car, 25 years old or not, without safety items like seat belts and headlights. So even though you’re exempt from federal laws on the subject, you still have to comply with your own state rules and regulations. Some states have no inspection, so this isn’t a problem – but in Virginia (where the car will be arriving) and Pennsylvania (where I live), I had better have seat belts, or I won’t get plates. "
8815,"Exception number two: the great state of California, whose emissions laws are stricter than the federal government’s.

8876,"The law was eventually passed in 1999, and it exempted certain unique vehicles from the federal government’s challenging regulations and rules surrounding motor vehicle safety. In other words: No crash tests. No side marker lights. No headlight swaps. No seat belt chimes. Contrary to popular belief, however, vehicles imported under the “Show and Display” exemption must still conform to EPA rules and regulations – but that’s the easy part. And most importantly, it’s better than nothing."
8877,But here’s the problem with Show and Display: it does not apply to you. 
8878,"What I mean by this is, Show and Display was primarily designed solely to apply to the most unusual, rarest, and most expensive vehicles on the planet. In fact, the U.S. government maintains a list of vehicles it has approved for Show and Display – and the list includes cars like the Aston Martin One-77, the Bugatti EB110, the McLaren F1, and the Mercedes CLK-GTR. Likewise, it maintains a list of vehicle it has denied under Show and Display – and that list includes cars like the Mazda Cosmo, the Lotus Elise S1, the Audi RS2, and virtually every standard variation of the Nissan Skyline GT-R that you can possibly imagine."
8879,Advertisement
8880,
8881,"Essentially, for a car to pass Show and Display scrutiny, the rules are these. Number one, it must never have been offered for sale in the United States. Number two, it must be out of production. Number three, it cannot be a replica or a kit car. And number four, production cannot exceed 500 examples. Admittedly, there are a few exceptions to these rules, but this is the general gist of it."
8882,"Beyond those strict guidelines, the government imposes a few additional measures on Show and Display vehicles. First: you can’t sell the car without written approval from the NHTSA, as they don’t want Show and Displayers turning into profiteers. After all, the government probably figures, these cars are for show and display not import and profit. And second: you’re limited to 2,500 miles per year. No cross-country roadtrips in your Bugatti EB110."
8883,"As a result, Show and Display is out for importing a vehicle unless you have Ralph Lauren money – and you’re bringing in a Ralph Lauren-style car."

8886,"Here’s the crazy thing about all these regulations. After all the words I’ve written above; after all the EPA restrictions, and DOT regulations, and crash tests, and bumper strength laws; after all the rules and guidelines and mileage limits; after all that … the day a car turns 25 years old, it’s legal to import, with no restrictions at all. "
8887,Advertisement
8888,
8889,And I mean 25 years old. And I mean no restrictions. 
8890,"Seriously: if a car is 24 years and 11 months old, you’d better bring it into compliance or else risk it getting crushed into a cube the size of a surge protector. But the moment it turns 25 years old, anything goes. No seat belts? No problem. No headlights? No problem. You want to import a Nissan Figaro with a big block Chevy V8 and windows tinted so dark that they look like one-way mirrors? As long as it’s 25 years old, no problem. Bring it in, with only one caveat: it needs to be using its original engine, or one that was already EPA certified."
8891,"This is how I’m importing my Skyline GT-R. Since the first “R32” GT-Rs were manufactured in August 1989, they became 25 years old – and thus fully legal – in August 2014. No crash tests, no headlight changes, no EPA certification. My car is a January 1990 build, which means it’s legally importable as of January 2015. And that means it’ll be ready to go when it comes off the boat in March. "
8892,Advertisement
8893,
8894,"There are only two exceptions to this little rule. Number one: your own state laws might have something to say about a car, 25 years old or not, without safety items like seat belts and headlights. So even though you’re exempt from federal laws on the subject, you still have to comply with your own state rules and regulations. Some states have no inspection, so this isn’t a problem – but in Virginia (where the car will be arriving) and Pennsylvania (where I live), I had better have seat belts, or I won’t get plates. "
8895,"Exception number two: the great state of California, whose emissions laws are stricter than the federal government’s. You see, while the EPA exempts vehicles on a rolling 21-year basis, meaning that anything age 21 or older is exempt from federal emissions laws, California laws start with all vehicles manufactured after 1975. In other words: if your car is newer than 1975, and it was never originally certified to operate in California, you must go about getting it certified there – even if it’s already legal in every other state. Since this process can cost thousands of dollars, I won’t be doing this – which means my car can’t go to a buyer in California. "
8896,"So there you go, ladies and gentlemen: a quick rundown of the import laws that somehow turned into an incredibly lengthy rundown of the import laws. You may now take your union-mandated smoke break. "

He worked as a manager for Porsche Cars North America before quitting to become a writer, largely because it meant he no longer had to wear pants. Also, he wrote this entire bio himself in the third person."
8901,
8902,
8903,"As many of you know, I am currently importing a 1990 Nissan Skyline GT-R to the United States. Well, just to be clear, I am not importing it. That task is being handled by a bunch of sailors, and longshoremen, and dockworkers, and port employees, all of whom are currently taking a union-mandated smoke break."
8904,
8905,"But anyway: someone is importing my Skyline GT-R to America. And if you followed me on Twitter, you’d know that my new car is just seven weeks away from reaching the United States. That means I have a lot of ground to cover if I plan to thoroughly document every part of the import process before the car shows up on U.S. soil, where it will inspire the following conversation among port staff:"
8906,"Port Worker 1: Why the hell would anyone spend so much money just to import this crappy old Nissan?Port Worker 2: I don’t know, but I think it’s time for our union-mandated smoke break!"
8907,"So today, we start from the start: the laws, rules, and regulations that actually make it possible for me to bring this car to the United States. Based on the e-mails and Tweets and Facebook posts and text messages I’ve received over the last few days, I know a LOT of you are very interested in this. “How can you bring this non-conforming car into America?” you’ve asked me. “You? YOU?? A normal guy like the rest of us, a regular Joe Schmo, with a cell phone, and a couple of credit cards, and a desktop printer that occasionally makes unexplained noises in the night?”"
8908,Advertisement
8909,
8910,"Well, the answer is: it isn’t as difficult as you think. And today I’m going to prove that to you from a legal standpoint, as I’m going to detail the four legal channels you can use to import a vehicle to the United States of America. Special thanks to everyone who helped me gather the information for this column, and especially Japanese Classics, LLC, the importer and dealership in Richmond, Virginia, who is both a) importing my Skyline, and b) patiently answering all of my stupid questions about the import process. (“Will the car get wet?”)"
8911,"Anyway, without further ado: here are the four legal channels you can use to import an automobile to the United States."
8912,Advertisement
8913,
8914,"By far the most obvious way to legally import a vehicle into the United States is to simply bring it into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations. Unfortunately, “simple” is hardly the word to describe this process, as it’s easily the most expensive strategy on this list. "
8915,"To start, bringing a non-conforming car into compliance with U.S. rules and regulations requires crash testing the car in order to prove that it meets U.S. safety standards. That means you can’t simply buy one example of the car you want to import: you have to buy several. And as you can probably guess, all will be destroyed in the ensuing crash tests. This alone can cost anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to over a million, depending on the vehicle."
8916,"In addition to the crash tests, you’ll have to bring your car into compliance with other safety rules and regulations, too. A speedometer that only reads in kilometers must be converted to miles. Headlight angles must be checked to ensure they meet U.S. standards; if not, they’ll have to be replaced with ones that do. You’ll have to install orange reflectors on the front sides of the car, and red reflectors in back. You’ll also have to comply with regulations dictating positioning of the third brake light and the strength of the bumpers. And then there’s stuff you didn’t even consider, like the little chime that beeps when you don’t have your seatbelt on, and a device that limits fuel spillage in an accident. It all must be there, and converting a vehicle to meet these specifications alone can easily cost more than $10,000."
8917,Advertisement
8918,
8919,"And all of this is assuming the car passes its crash tests. If it fails, you’ll have to add additional structural reinforcement in the doors, the roof, the bumpers, the front and rear ends, or possibly all of the above. So once you’ve spent tens – and potentially hundreds – of thousands of dollars just to destroy the vehicle you’re considering in government-mandated crash tests, you may need to spend thousands more to ensure it can pass. "
8920,"The good news: once you’ve passed your crash tests, it’s over. There’s no re-testing, there’s no annual compliance procedure. It’s a massive expense, sure, but it’s a one-time expense – and once you’re certified, you can bring over as many cars as you want."
8921,"Unfortunately there’s another wrinkle involved before that happens. You see, the Department of Transportation isn’t the only federal agency that takes a look at non-conforming cars. Your imported vehicle will also need approval from the Environmental Protection Agency, which is interested in just how much your desired vehicle pollutes. While getting a pre-1995 vehicle to pass EPA regulations isn’t tremendously difficult, any car made in 1995 or later will need an on-board diagnostics (OBD II) system installed. In some cases, this can be prohibitively expensive, since many foreign-market 1990s vehicles were never manufactured with such a system in the first place."
8922,Advertisement
8923,
8924,"And then there’s one more wrinkle: the great state of California, which I’ll cover below in section four."
8925,"But in spite the enormous expense associated with the process of bringing a foreign car into compliance, several vehicles have been legally imported this way over the years. For example: many car enthusiasts know about Motorex, who brought the mid-1990s “R33” Nissan Skyline GT-R into compliance at great expense – an interesting tale I’ll cover in greater depth in a future column. But Motorex isn’t the only importer to complete the undertaking: a New Mexico-based imported called Europa brought the Mercedes G-Wagen into compliance and sold them for years, long before Mercedes-Benz arrived with an official version in 2002."

8927,
8928,"If a vehicle is “substantially similar” to one that was already sold in the United States, then you can ignore everything I’ve said above and bring it right in. "
8929,"Or at least, that’s the simple explanation. The reality is, of course, a lot more complicated."
8930,"The “substantially similar” clause is primarily aimed at vehicles coming in to the United States from Canada. Imagine this situation: let’s say you bought a Canadian-spec Toyota Highlander in Toronto, and then your job transferred you to the United States. Rather than going through the trouble and expense of selling your Canadian Highlander and buying another one in the States, you can simply claim your Highlander is “substantially similar” to a U.S. model – a claim that’s undoubtedly true, since Canada and the United States broadly share most emissions and vehicle safety regulations. You get a few forms, you sign a few papers, you submit a standard letter from the automaker, and boom! Your Highlander is now legal in the United States."
8931,Advertisement
8932,
8933,"Unfortunately, enthusiasts are largely locked out of the “substantially similar” clause. The reason is that while Canadian cars largely conform to U.S. laws, vehicles from other markets do not necessarily share the same reciprocity. "
8934,"I’ll give you an example to help illustrate my point. When I started this process more than six months ago, my initial plan was to import a late-2000s “E60” BMW M5 station wagon; the one with the huge V10 and that awful transmission; the one that felt like you were in the car with a 14-year-old whose only previous experience with a stick shift was driving a farm tractor through a hay field. "
8935,"My thinking was this: although BMW never sold the M5 wagon in the U.S., they did sell the regular 5 Series wagon – and that means the M5 wagon’s body is “substantially similar” to a vehicle that’s already in compliance. Likewise, they never sold a wagon with that V10 – but they did sell a sedan with that engine, which makes the engine “substantially similar,” too. I figured I would merely need to find a car, change a few headlights, and I’d be on my way, cruising around America in a suave M5 wagon."
8936,Advertisement
8937,
8938,"But here’s what I found out: although the V10 engine in the European-spec M5 is “substantially similar” the one in the American-spec model, the EPA can’t confirm that without conducting its tests. And although the body is substantially similar, the Department of Transportation doesn’t quite operate on the “See how similar it looks?” theory of government regulation. They, too, would need to run tests – crash tests, I mean – in order to prove that the car is in compliance with U.S. laws and regulations. "
8939,"However: if you’re interested in a substantially similar car, there is one interesting way around these tests: all you need to do is get an automaker to write you a letter stating that the car is indeed substantially similar to a vehicle sold in the United States. "
8940,"Now, this may sound like a long, tiresome process; a process where you speak to 20 different people and listen to hold music for the better part of a week, and eventually you just chew off your own thumb. But in reality, it’s common practice in the Toyota Highlander example given above. Just call an automaker’s customer service line, tell them you’re moving from Canada with your car, and you’ll probably get the letter."
8941,Advertisement
8942,
8943,But for a car coming in from Europe? Good luck. 
8944,"The automaker has two major incentives not to write this letter. Number one: they don’t want some idiot spending big money on a foreign version of its product, when that person could just go buy a new one in the United States. And number two: they don’t want the liability of certifying the safety equipment of a foreign-spec vehicle – because the automaker would undoubtedly get sued if an accident took place."
8945,"So, a simple summary of the above paragraphs: unless you want to import a car from Canada that was already sold in the United States, you stand a very small chance of bringing it here under the “substantially similar” clause."
8946,Advertisement
8947,
8948,"However, there is one glimmer of hope. In 2006, a highly reputable Registered Importer in Baltimore called JK Technologies managed to convince the government that the “B5” Audi RS4 Avant was “substantially similar” to the A4 and S4 Avant models already sold here by Audi (despite protests from Volkswagen of America). That means two things: number one, the 2000-2001 Audi RS4 Avant is indeed legal for importation under this clause, with a few minor modifications. And number two: it’s possible to import a cool enthusiast car under the “substantially similar” clause. But it’s very, very unlikely. "

8951,"If you’re a car enthusiast in the United States, you’re probably familiar with the Show and Display rule: the law that Bill Gates got passed in order to drive a Porsche 959 in America."
8952,"In reality, the history of the Show and Display law is a little more complicated. For one thing, it wasn’t just Gates who wanted the law passed, but actually several wealthy American car enthusiasts – including Ralph Lauren and Otis Chandler, former publisher of the Los Angeles Times. "
8953,"Eager to drive the 959 and various other rare vehicles never offered in the United States, the group banded together and hired an attorney in Washington, D.C., to approach the EPA, the NHTSA, and major automakers in order to come up with a “Show and Display” rule – essentially a law that allows certain unique vehicles to be exempted from the government’s stringent rules and regulations, provided they are brought over solely for purposes of “show and display.”"

8981,
8982,"Good news, everyone: I've decided to devote today's column to the most outdated, obsolete, antiquated relic of the entire automotive industry."
8983,"But before I get started, I already know what you're thinking: You're going to write an entire column about the Nissan Frontier?!"
8984,"And I admit, the Nissan Frontier is indeed fairly old-fashioned. So old-fashioned, in fact, that the owner's manual includes a three-page section entitled: ""Headlight Operation: Models Equipped with Kerosene Lamps.""  Other completely true Frontier facts you can tell your kids: the Frontier's bed was specifically designed to fit the most advanced infotainment system of its day, the harpsichord. Also: it's named the Frontier because Lewis and Clark used an SV King Cab model as a support vehicle when they explored the American frontier in 1804. (According to trip notes, Sacagawea was especially impressed with the Frontier because it provided comfort, shelter, and room for her harpsichord.)"
8985,"But the truth is, I am not going to sit here and insult the Frontier for an entire column, largely because the designer – reportedly a true American hero who helped us secure several important enemy beaches during the Spanish-American war – could read it and take great offense. So instead, I'm going to discuss concept cars."
8986,"For those of you who don't know anything about concept cars, allow me to clue you in on the current situation. Here's how it works: at every major auto show and also the Chicago Auto Show, automakers reveal new products. Some automakers reveal production cars, which you will soon be able to purchase at your local dealership and drive on your local roads. And some automakers reveal concept cars, which typically do not include door handles and only occasionally have a windshield."
8987,Advertisement
8988,
8989,"For more information on the subject, I'm going to refer you to my all-time favorite concept car, which was revealed by Mercedes-Benz just a couple of weeks ago at the Detroit Auto Show. It's called – this is its actual name – the ""F 015 Luxury In Motion,"" and it looks like an art sculpture that a university would attempt to install in a public place over the protests of its students."
8990,"As you climb inside the F 015 Luxury In Motion, you quickly notice that it includes everything you would expect to see in a modern, state-of-the-art office conference room. Seriously: there are wood floors. There are swivel chairs that face one another. There are screens all over the interior, including on the door panels, where you can make presentations and show charts. And there is a desktop printer that requires an $80 ink refill every eleven hours.  OK, I made that last part up, but the rest are true.  "
8991,Advertisement
8992,
8993,"So, you might be wondering, if this concept car is so chic and modern, why the hell do you think concept cars are outdated and old-fashioned?"
8994,The answer is: because nobody cares about concept cars anymore.
8995,"To prove my point, let's go back to a time when people got really excited about concept cars. It was the 1950s and 1960s, when concept cars were all the rage. What happened back then was, you'd see a concept car at a show, or in the news, or on TV, and you'd get all excited. ""Gall-dangit!"" you'd exclaim, as your extra-tar cigarette dropped from your mouth to the asbestos-lined floor. ""Those Pontiac boys sure are up to something!"" And then you'd purchase a home for $6,000, because that's what stuff cost back in the 1950s."
8996,Advertisement
8997,
8998,"Really, though: concept cars used to be a huge deal, decades ago. While a new production car was cool, a new concept car previewed technology that was still a few years away. The 1960 Buick shows us what's HERE today, you'd think, as a child of the 1960s. But the Buick Concept shows us what WILL be here in 1967! And then you'd run home and put baseball cards in the spokes of your bicycle wheels. "
8999,"I think concept cars went wrong sometime in the 1980s. Automakers got so caught up in previewing cool technology that they forgot this technology was actually supposed to make it into a vehicle.  The absolute low point came in about 1990, when Oldsmobile created this cool aerodynamic concept sports car called the Aerotech – which A.J. Foyt drove 257 miles per hour on a test track – at the same time their production lineup included the Cutlass Ciera with a 3-speed automatic and a blue velour interior."
9000,"So now, when you launch a concept car, the reaction is precisely as follows:"
9001,"1. You stand up there and excitedly discuss how your cool new concept car has lasers for wheels, and reinforced tissue paper for doors, and a built-in baby-changing station, and its environmental impact is so minimal that you've brought a baby seal on stage to say a few words about the design process."
9002,Advertisement
9003,
9004,2. Approximately fourteen industry insiders read about the car in AutoWeek.
9005,3. The car goes completely unnoticed by the general public.
9006,"4. The designer of the Nissan Frontier has an ""accident"" in his adult diaper."
9007,"The problem is that too many concept cars have lied to us over the years. There was the Cadillac Cien, a cool supercar concept that never saw the light of day. The Cadillac Sixteen, a full-size luxury sedan that never happened. The Mazda Furai, an awesome race car concept that never made it past one unit. The Ford GT90, a now-dead modern take on the GT40. The Jeep Hurricane. The Mercedes C111. The Ford Bronco. The Chrysler ME-412. The Plymouth Pronto Spyder.  There's Infiniti, the worldwide leader in concept cars, who has created seven different concept vehicles in the last three years – none of which have seen production. And then there's the bizarre Tokyo Auto Show, where automakers show concept cars with names like ""Happiness Emporium"" and features like a built-in washing machine for handbags."
9008,Advertisement
9009,
9010,
9011,"So today, when we car enthusiasts see a concept car, we think two things. Number one, we assume there is absolutely no way it'll ever reach production. And number two, we laugh at the ridiculous styling and the over-the-top futuristic equipment. Meanwhile, the general public stopped paying attention years ago. And do you blame them?"
9012,"Of course you don't blame them – and that's because the concept car is stupid and useless. These days, it's a way for automakers to grab headlines they don't deserve by rolling out technology they can't mass-produce. Car enthusiasts don't buy it. The public doesn't care about it. And so I propose a general moratorium on concept cars, or at least a little more honesty about each new vehicle when it's revealed. For example: instead of the ""F 015 Luxury In Motion"", how about the ""F 015 Giant Jellybean That Doesn't Conform to a Single Government Regulation""? I bet the public would read about that. I know I would."

9017,"Good news, everyone: I've decided to devote today's column to the most outdated, obsolete, antiquated relic of the entire automotive industry."
9018,"But before I get started, I already know what you're thinking: You're going to write an entire column about the Nissan Frontier?!"
9019,"And I admit, the Nissan Frontier is indeed fairly old-fashioned. So old-fashioned, in fact, that the owner's manual includes a three-page section entitled: ""Headlight Operation: Models Equipped with Kerosene Lamps.""  Other completely true Frontier facts you can tell your kids: the Frontier's bed was specifically designed to fit the most advanced infotainment system of its day, the harpsichord. Also: it's named the Frontier because Lewis and Clark used an SV King Cab model as a support vehicle when they explored the American frontier in 1804. (According to trip notes, Sacagawea was especially impressed with the Frontier because it provided comfort, shelter, and room for her harpsichord.)"
9020,"But the truth is, I am not going to sit here and insult the Frontier for an entire column, largely because the designer – reportedly a true American hero who helped us secure several important enemy beaches during the Spanish-American war – could read it and take great offense. So instead, I'm going to discuss concept cars."
9021,"For those of you who don't know anything about concept cars, allow me to clue you in on the current situation. Here's how it works: at every major auto show and also the Chicago Auto Show, automakers reveal new products. Some automakers reveal production cars, which you will soon be able to purchase at your local dealership and drive on your local roads. And some automakers reveal concept cars, which typically do not include door handles and only occasionally have a windshield."
9022,Advertisement
9023,
9024,"For more information on the subject, I'm going to refer you to my all-time favorite concept car, which was revealed by Mercedes-Benz just a couple of weeks ago at the Detroit Auto Show. It's called – this is its actual name – the ""F 015 Luxury In Motion,"" and it looks like an art sculpture that a university would attempt to install in a public place over the protests of its students."
9025,"As you climb inside the F 015 Luxury In Motion, you quickly notice that it includes everything you would expect to see in a modern, state-of-the-art office conference room. Seriously: there are wood floors. There are swivel chairs that face one another. There are screens all over the interior, including on the door panels, where you can make presentations and show charts. And there is a desktop printer that requires an $80 ink refill every eleven hours.  OK, I made that last part up, but the rest are true.  "
9026,Advertisement
9027,
9028,"So, you might be wondering, if this concept car is so chic and modern, why the hell do you think concept cars are outdated and old-fashioned?"
9029,The answer is: because nobody cares about concept cars anymore.
9030,"To prove my point, let's go back to a time when people got really excited about concept cars. It was the 1950s and 1960s, when concept cars were all the rage. What happened back then was, you'd see a concept car at a show, or in the news, or on TV, and you'd get all excited. ""Gall-dangit!"" you'd exclaim, as your extra-tar cigarette dropped from your mouth to the asbestos-lined floor. ""Those Pontiac boys sure are up to something!"" And then you'd purchase a home for $6,000, because that's what stuff cost back in the 1950s."
9031,Advertisement
9032,
9033,"Really, though: concept cars used to be a huge deal, decades ago. While a new production car was cool, a new concept car previewed technology that was still a few years away. The 1960 Buick shows us what's HERE today, you'd think, as a child of the 1960s. But the Buick Concept shows us what WILL be here in 1967! And then you'd run home and put baseball cards in the spokes of your bicycle wheels. "
9034,"I think concept cars went wrong sometime in the 1980s. Automakers got so caught up in previewing cool technology that they forgot this technology was actually supposed to make it into a vehicle.  The absolute low point came in about 1990, when Oldsmobile created this cool aerodynamic concept sports car called the Aerotech – which A.J. Foyt drove 257 miles per hour on a test track – at the same time their production lineup included the Cutlass Ciera with a 3-speed automatic and a blue velour interior."
9035,"So now, when you launch a concept car, the reaction is precisely as follows:"
9036,"1. You stand up there and excitedly discuss how your cool new concept car has lasers for wheels, and reinforced tissue paper for doors, and a built-in baby-changing station, and its environmental impact is so minimal that you've brought a baby seal on stage to say a few words about the design process."
9037,Advertisement
9038,
9039,2. Approximately fourteen industry insiders read about the car in AutoWeek.
9040,3. The car goes completely unnoticed by the general public.
9041,"4. The designer of the Nissan Frontier has an ""accident"" in his adult diaper."
9042,"The problem is that too many concept cars have lied to us over the years. There was the Cadillac Cien, a cool supercar concept that never saw the light of day. The Cadillac Sixteen, a full-size luxury sedan that never happened. The Mazda Furai, an awesome race car concept that never made it past one unit. The Ford GT90, a now-dead modern take on the GT40. The Jeep Hurricane. The Mercedes C111. The Ford Bronco. The Chrysler ME-412. The Plymouth Pronto Spyder.  There's Infiniti, the worldwide leader in concept cars, who has created seven different concept vehicles in the last three years – none of which have seen production. And then there's the bizarre Tokyo Auto Show, where automakers show concept cars with names like ""Happiness Emporium"" and features like a built-in washing machine for handbags."
9043,Advertisement
9044,
9045,
9046,"So today, when we car enthusiasts see a concept car, we think two things. Number one, we assume there is absolutely no way it'll ever reach production. And number two, we laugh at the ridiculous styling and the over-the-top futuristic equipment. Meanwhile, the general public stopped paying attention years ago. And do you blame them?"
9047,"Of course you don't blame them – and that's because the concept car is stupid and useless. These days, it's a way for automakers to grab headlines they don't deserve by rolling out technology they can't mass-produce. Car enthusiasts don't buy it. The public doesn't care about it. And so I propose a general moratorium on concept cars, or at least a little more honesty about each new vehicle when it's revealed. For example: instead of the ""F 015 Luxury In Motion"", how about the ""F 015 Giant Jellybean That Doesn't Conform to a Single Government Regulation""? I bet the public would read about that. I know I would."

9076,"They say that there are no truly bad new cars anymore, and with the redesign of the Smart ForTwo that might actually be true. But that doesn’t mean that all new car choices equal a great bang for your buck. Case in point: the 2015 Chevrolet Trax, Chevy’s new mini-crossover."
9077,
9078,"(Full disclosure: Chevrolet needed me to drive the Trax so badly they dropped one off at my house for a week with a full tank of gas. I drove it a lot and used it to take my dog, some friends and their dog to get trailer food because I’m all about that #active #urban #Milliennial lifestyle.)"
9079,"What is the Trax, and why should you care? I can at least answer one of those questions: it’s Chevrolet’s newest, smallest crossover vehicle. Built in South Korea, it’s on the same platform as the subcompact Chevy Sonic as well as the crossover Buick Encore/Opel Mokka, with which it shares many similarities."
9080,Advertisement
9081,
9082,"It’s an important car for the General because the compact crossover segment is poised to become the hottest thing in cars this year, both here and in Europe. This is the rationale behind the Jeep Renegade, the Mercedes-Benz GLA, the Mazda CX-3, and the Encore, of which about 48,000 were sold last year. "
9083,It turns out all it really took to make Americans want hatchbacks was a couple inches of ride height and some plastic body cladding.
9084,"So here we have the Trax, essentially a big Sonic or a de-contented Encore. There’s nothing wrong with either of those things, or its $20,120 starting price — at least at first glance. My tester was a top-of-the-line, unnecessarily and unrealistically loaded like all press cars, all-wheel drive Trax LTZ model. It came in at $27,405."
9085,Advertisement
9086,
9087,"We need to start with the engine, because that was probably my biggest beef with the tiny Trax. Its only available motor is a 1.4-liter turbo mill that puts out 138 horsepower and 148 pound-feet of torque. In the underrated Sonic RS, it’s actually kind of a fun, peppy little engine; it’s woefully inadequate at motivating the 3,200-pound all-wheel drive Trax."
9088,"Simply put, this thing is slow as a dog. Zero to 60 mph is somewhere in the nine second range; when you’re passing cars, pick your battles carefully. It’s a buzzy, weak motor that doesn’t like to be pushed and takes forever to build revs and speed. It makes you feel like some kind of European, and not the good kind that drives some crazy forbidden Audi RS wagon. The other kind, the one that drives an abysmal microcar we don’t want. "
9089,Advertisement
9090,
9091,"I was on an access road trying to merge onto the highway when I noticed a Camaro coming up fast behind me; I quickly changed lanes to let him by and then got back on. “Bastard,” I said, glaring at him, “I was in a Hellcat this morning.” Just a few hours earlier I would have sent him home feeling bad about his life."
9092,"Visually, it’s indistinctive, but it’s not at all unattractive. My tester came in this nice orange color that I rather liked and helped it feel a little bit less like an appliance. Chevy seems to be targeting a younger crowd with the Trax, and fun colors can’t hurt. It’s better than beige or silver. "
9093,Advertisement
9094,
9095,"Inside, it’s a reminder how high tech even budget-minded modern cars can feel. It all feels simple and clean and basic, but there’s still a 7-inch touch screen and haptic panel below it taking up most of the central real estate. This does manage to avoid an overload of buttons and switches, which is kind of refreshing, as is the actual honest-to-God gear lever — I can’t escape feeling like their days are numbered. "
9096,"My tester also had leather seats, which never felt especially premium and which probably no one will ever spring for on a Trax. I was a fan of the “motorcycle-inspired” gauge cluster, which also comes from the Sonic. It’s a nice touch and surprisingly functional. "
9097,Advertisement
9098,
9099,"The problem lies with the plastic splayed across the dash, which was distinctly rental car-cheap and probably responsible for the strange rattle I heard in front of the steering wheel. Not very encouraging on a car with just 900 miles on the odometer when I got it. On the plus side, there’s a lot of storage compartments inside to compensate for the lack of a center arm rest — one on the top of the dash, one in front of the passenger, and a glove compartment. You have options when it comes to hiding your narcotics. "
9100,"In the back seat, you get a decent amount of rear headroom and legroom, though the former is definitely better than the latter. Put the rear seats down and you have an extremely practical vehicle, albeit one that isn’t all that superior to some hatchbacks in terms of space. (More on that in a bit.) "
9101,Advertisement
9102,
9103,"Chevy’s MyLink infotainment system isn’t the best out there, but it’s seriously not bad. The touch screen is reasonably responsive and the big, colorful graphics are nice. It’s no UConnect, but nothing is. Curiously, navigation isn’t even an option; instead you can download an iOS or Android navigation app called BringGo that sends map directions to the system. "
9104,"I’m not against that on principle, since a smartphone is inherently easier to type an address into than a car’s touch screen is. My problem was that it costs 99 cents to download and requires you to sign up for a BringGo account to use. I didn’t bother with that. It makes a strong case for Apple CarPlay or some other smartphone integration system. "
9105,Advertisement
9106,
9107,"So how does the Trax actually drive? Aside from the aforementioned lack of power, it’s not terrible, but certainly not great. The steering is incredibly numb. Despite its compact size, it never feels especially nimble, betraying its Sonic origins. The suspension is pretty soft, so expect a reasonable amount of body roll. "
9108,"Fuel economy wasn’t what I’d consider outstanding. It’s rated at 24 MPG in the city and 31 MPG on the highway, but in mostly city driving I averaged about 22 MPG in my week of testing. It turns out that when you make tiny, turbocharged engines work their balls off to do anything, their gas mileage isn’t great. Who knew?"
9109,Advertisement
9110,
9111,"It’s never a fun or engaging car to drive. Part of me thinks it could be if it had the option of a manual and you could rev it out within in an inch of its life like the Sonic RS, but the six-speed automatic is the only available gearbox. Bummer. It’s not doing this car any favors."
9112,"Maybe your average Trax buyer isn’t looking for a fun or engaging car. I get that. I see the main draw as being its size and ride height. It’s a car that will appeal maybe to younger buyers starting families, or older empty-nesters who find it easy to get in and out of. "
9113,"I think GM sees it drawing that coveted young urban Millennial driver, the one who lives an “active” lifestyle, and wants something practical that he or she can also park easily enough. And it does that. "
9114,Advertisement
9115,
9116,"Here’s the thing: I think your money can get you so much more elsewhere. The Trax is affordable, but it isn’t cheap; mine cost a few thousand shy of $30,000. You can get a lot more car for that kind of money than you can with the Trax. "
9117,"Should you decide to spend $27,000 on a practical vehicle, you can get yourself a Mazda CX-5, a Honda CR-V or a Ford Escape, all of which offer more space, more room and more power than the Trax does. If you somehow want something fun and also usable, it’s hard not to recommend a Mazda3 or even a Volkswagen GTI over this. "
9118,Advertisement
9119,
9120,"Hell, you can even get into a Buick Encore at that loaded price, but I can’t see how it’s much better than this considering it has the same motor."
9121,"Thanks to its subcompact underpinnings, the Trax will always be inherently compromised when it comes to size, but it doesn’t have a bargain-basement price working in its favor. If this thing started at $17,000 or so, I’d consider it a good deal (and a good first car) if you keep the options light. As it is here, you can probably do better. "
9122,"Here’s what you really ought to do, in my professional opinion: make “Trax” over to your Jeep dealer and buy a Renegade instead. There you can get a small crossover that’s cheaper, legitimately interesting to look at, and can be had with more power and four-wheel drive AND a six-speed manual. I haven’t driven the Renegade yet, but I can tell you that at least on paper it outclasses the Trax in most ways that count. "

9126,"Amidst all the hoopla about Vampire Weekend's torching of a pair of Saabs for their Diane Young video, and the band's subsequent apology to the Saab faithful, nobody mentioned one of the best uses of a Saab in a musical context in recent years — Peter Hughes' concept album Fangio. It's a collection of songs about racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio driving a 900 SPG across the Andes mountains to kill notorious Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. And that, frankly, is the most badass concept for an album in the history of human existence. "
9127,
9128,"Hughes is currently with the indie-folk outfit the Mountain Goats, but in 2010 he put out a solo album featuring songs about the fictional, Saab-hooning, dictator-killing exploits of the five-time Formula One world champion. In addition to his music, Hughes is also a big car guy, who blogs about cars, says he learned who James Joyce was from famed British auto journalist L.J.K. Setright, and once participated in a Save Saab rally in Detroit with his 900 SPG. "
9129,

9133,Here's what he told me about that SPG:
9134,"""I can tell you that the car in the video is (still!) my daily driver, and one of the most brilliant cars I've ever driven. Although I have to say I've never really gotten the 900 convertible thing — for me what makes the 900 Turbo so special is having this car that is fast, handles, and can swallow a refrigerator. Take the hatch and fold-flat seat out of the equation and you just have a front-wheel-drive ragtop — it misses the whole point. in which case the VW video car is no great loss, even to me. Still, that was a perfectly good set of 16"" super aeros I would've happily taken off their hands."" "
9135,"The video has been around for a while now, but I only recently got a chance to listen to the full album for the first time. I liked it a lot. Many of the songs sound kind of early New Order-y, which is never a bad thing."
9136,Advertisement
9137,
9138,"My favorite is ""El Hombre Mas Macho,"" an upbeat anthemic ode to Fangio drifting an SLR, leading at Monaco, presenting the Heisman Trophy to Marilyn Monroe and killing someone named ""Escobar."" I'm guessing it's Pablo Escobar, the notorious drug kingpin. Fangio was a force for justice after all. "
9139,Hughes had this to say about the Vampire Weekend video:
9140,"""Hey, I don't know those guys, I've got no beef with them personally. But what do you want me to say? They're Saab-burners. They'll answer for that someday. I almost feel sorry for them."""

9145,"I told you driving a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat wasn't easy! People act like all you have to do is mash the throttle for instant tire-melting American glory, and then they wonder how they end up in a ditch. Imagine that: a 707 horsepower, rear-drive car that's kind of tricky. "

9264,"Here was the plan: take a $112,000 Mercedes E63 AMG S Wagon, a Subaru STI, a BMW 228i, and a 1973 Volkswagen Baja Bug, and blast sideways on a snow-covered private test track hidden in the woods of Connecticut. Simple, right?"
9265,"Here's the thing about Jalopnik. Up until two weeks ago, I was convinced that things did not get any better than this job."
9266,But that was two weeks ago. Then I went to Connecticut.
9267,
9268,"This is the first video of our newest series, to be joined by others in the future. What is it? Ok, let me break it down. We do neat stuff! In cars! Cars that are cool! We're calling it Neat Stuff in Cool Cars! I don't know how we ever got so clever. Suggestions on what we should do next? Drop them in the comments. Will we listen? Maybe!"

9271,"So two weeks ago we visited Consumer Reports' automotive testing branch, tucked away in the woods of Connecticut. What's interesting about CR is that they buy their own cars and do their own independent tests on them. That means they send people out to dealerships to purchase the cars they review, they have a garage as big as a dealership's service center to handle them, and they also have a test track."
9272,Consumer Reports has its own private test track. I have now seen the next echelon of how good life can get.
9273,The people at CR were kind enough to leave their track covered in snow for us to go hoon the living daylights out of the cars we brought:
9274,"The idea was to just go screw around and after not too long, we decided to see who could pull of the best long, sweeping drift in the car of their choice."

9277,Consumer Reports' head of auto testing Jake Fisher took the rear-drive BMW. His powerslide was perfectly smooth and sweet.
9278,"My boss Matt took his beloved Mercedes wagon and, after a few tries, managed to get a hang of the car's hugely powerful V8 and recently standard all-wheel drive."
9279,"Travis took the STI and unsurprisingly whipped the best slide out of anybody, huge rooster tails of snow shooting off all four wheels."

9281,
9282,"I, in the Baja, was just happy not to crash."
9283,"The strict automotive conclusions we got from our day of 'testing' were straightforward: the more manual control a car had, the more fun it was. The more driven wheels a car had, the better it was at carrying speed in the snow. The more power a car had, the more you slammed your foot to the floor and grinned. "
9284,"The more apt conclusion was this: holy crap, I need a private test track and I need it now."

9296,Thanks! 
9297,Leonard
9298,"Leonard, you've asked an excellent question, because this is something I hear all the time. ""YO MAN"" people tell me. ""I CAN GET XYZ COOL CAR FOR XYZ MONEY. THEY'RE SO CHEAP!"""
9299,"I especially heard this when I had my Ferrari. People would see my videos, and they'd see my car, and they'd get all excited, so they'd go on eBay, and they'd find a gray 360 that was about four years overdue for a major service; a car that had mismatched wheels and bald tires and a ""minor accident"" on the Carfax and 47,000 miles and a nonfunctional F1 transmission, and it would be going for $49,250. And they'd say to me: ""MAN! 360s ARE LESS THAN FIFTY GRAND NOW!"""
9300,"And then I'd sit them down, and I'd look them directly in the face, and I'd spit on them."
9301,"You see, Leonard, here's the thing: just because you can buy a cool, high-performance sports car for a ""low"" price doesn't mean you should. To explain what I mean, I suggest you log on to AutoTrader.com, perform a nationwide search for 2009-2011 GT-Rs, and check in the bottom right corner. See where it says ""Average Price""? That's right: $70,000. The average asking price of a 2009-2011 GT-R is seventy grand."
9302,Advertisement
9303,
9304,"Now, what this means is that if you're very lucky, and you play your cards right, and you're willing to go for a higher mileage example, and you compromise on color, and you're OK with searching across the entire country, you might find a good one in the mid-sixties. Maybe even the low sixties if you get really lucky and you allow them to buy your trade-in with coins from the parts department cash register."
9305,"Now, that doesn't mean the $45,000 GT-R doesn't exist. But I will promise you this: every single GT-R available for $45,000 has severe problems. Every. Single. One. And now, I will go over what some of these problems might be, because I am a bona fide GT-R expert in the sense that I spent about 15 minutes on the forums earlier this week."
9306,"POTENTIAL PROBLEM #1: It has a severe accident in its history. If you find a GT-R for around $20,000 less than the going rate, it probably has some sort of severe accident history. Now, you might be thinking: ""I don't care about that shit! I'll drive it anyway!"" But you know who cares? Your insurance company, Leonard. When you call and try to insure a car with a salvage title, they're going to laugh at you like a Full House studio audience: loudly, and for way too long."

9308,

"
9310,POTENTIAL PROBLEM #2: It has a bad transmission. Allow me to explain how the R35 GT-R works. You have a reliable car with a robust engine and a sturdy chassis and a nice interior and a strong frame and an impressive all-wheel drive system. And then you have a transmission made out of pine straw.
9311,"Seriously: the GT-R is a wonderful, excellent, amazing, beautiful automobile, but its gearbox doesn't seem up to the task of lasting forever. The result is that transmission failure is rampant in these things. So rampant that the GT-R is the only car Nissan doesn't offer in its certified pre-owned program."

9315,"Now, I know what you're thinking: ""So what?! I once had a Dodge Caliber with a bad transmission, and me and my buddy Gary changed that out in my driveway on a Saturday."" Yeah, well, here's the thing: a GT-R transmission costs $13,500 before shipping and installation. In fact, for the cost of a GT-R transmission, you could buy a running, driving Dodge Caliber and still have enough left over to bail Gary out of jail for his drunk and disorderly charge. Think about that."
9316,"POTENTIAL PROBLEM #3: It's actually an Altima Coupe. There is the distinct possibility that a low-priced GT-R is not a GT-R at all, but actually an Altima Coupe. To verify this, climb inside the vehicle and check in the back. If you can sit in the middle, it's an Altima Coupe. This vehicle is not worth $45,000. In fact, Kelley Blue Book says the current going rate for an Altima Coupe is ""three heads of lettuce,"" or – if it's a V6 model – ""three heads of lettuce and a Power Bar."""

9319,"And so, Leonard, a quick summary. When I was searching for my Ferrari, someone told me a fantastic adage that certainly applies in this situation: the cheapest Ferrari is actually the most expensive Ferrari. And while the GT-R isn't as expensive to own as a Ferrari, the lesson remains true: these things aren't cheap. And cheap ones especially aren't cheap. If you have to find one with accident history or a bad transmission in order to get your foot in the door, you might want to wait a few more years and save your money for a nicer example."

	Ladies and gentlemen, the day has come: it's time for a new list of unreliable CarMax cars. You know what this means: I'm excited. You're excited. And CarMax is probably going to raise the warranty prices on each of these by 50 percent the moment they see this list."
9389,"
	For those of you who don't know what the hell I'm talking about, allow me to explain: about two years ago, I purchased a used 2006 Range Rover – a vehicle with roughly the same durability as disposable contact lenses – from nationwide used car retailer CarMax. While I was buying it, I discovered that CarMax offers 
	a long, bumper-to-bumper warranty on any car in its inventory. So I responded in the way any normal person would: I stood up and did a celebratory jig right there in the showroom."
9390,"
	The result has been exactly as you'd expect: although I'm only two years and two months into my warranty, 
	CarMax has already paid out $6,149.03 in claims – or roughly 57 percent more than the warranty cost to buy. And now you, too, can join in the fun with your own CarMax warranty, which I highly recommend on the following exciting and unusual unreliable used cars."
9391,Advertisement
9392,
9393,"
	Yes, ladies and gentlemen, CarMax has an R8. This is no secret. I say this because this car seems to be in very high demand, having been transferred three times to three separate stores: first Los Angeles, then to Las Vegas, and now to Colorado. In fact, it seems to be inching closer to me, which only makes it more tempting."
9394,"
	I called on warranty prices for this thing, and I discovered that a bumper-to-bumper plan for five years or up to 125,000 total vehicle miles costs just $4,499. But since you probably won't 
	reach 125,000 miles in five years, consider the 75,000-mile plan: it's just $2,989. The deal of the century."
9395,Advertisement
9396,
9397,"
	Somehow, CarMax always seems to have a healthy supply of BMW 1 Series Ms. And while there are always a few commenters who question my characterization of these things as ""unreliable,"" I think we'd all agree that the best way to own a used high-performance BMW of questionable ownership history is with a long, comprehensive warranty issued by an automobile dealership who primarily makes money by selling service plans on Altimas."
9398,Advertisement
9399,
9400,"
	In my long, sad years of staying up late and searching CarMax inventory, I don't think I can recall seeing a vehicle that so desperately needed a warranty like the Jaguar S-Type R. I'm stunned they even offer this car, which is known primarily for two things: 400 horsepower, and constant breakdowns. I know there are better deals out there than this S-Type R. But ladies and gentlemen, I promise you this: when all is said and done, this will end up being the cheapest one you can buy."

	The CLK55 AMG Coupe is one of my all-time favorite cars. Styling is gorgeous and simple, sizing is perfect, and it uses a naturally-aspirated 362-horsepower 5.4-liter V8 that provides excellent, smooth power at any RPM. The only problem: this is an 11-year-old German car made by the two paragons of unreliability: Mercedes-Benz and AMG. So I highly recommend a warranty, which almost nobody is willing to sell on a car this old – except crazy CarMax, who is offering this gorgeous example for just $17,000."

	When I did 
	a list of unreliable CarMax cars four months ago, I proudly featured this S65, calling it the Holy Grail of CarMax. Back then, it was a thousand dollars more expensive, and it was still a great deal – especially since the warranty was only $3,589 for another 59,000 miles, or $5,599 for another 84,000 miles. Although I suspect the bizarre tan color is holding this one back from finding a buyer, it shouldn't be. C'mon, people: you don't want black or silver anywhere near as much as you want a warranty."

	As every Porsche enthusiast knows, the ""996"" 911 model – made from 1999 to 2004 – has a severe engine issue with the intermediate shaft, or IMS, that results in catastrophic engine failure without warning. Although such a failure can be expensive, buying this 996 with a CarMax warranty means you don't have to take the risk: just pony up a few grand for MaxCare and drive along without a care in the world. Need a new engine? That'll be a $50 deductible, please."

9414,"With a lot of other high-end manufacturers getting into the track-only special game, Aston Martin clearly just saw that the waters are too tempting not to jump in. Enter the Aston Martin Vulcan, a surprise 800 horsepower bombshell of a V12 track day monster. With everything you need, and nothing you don't."
9415,"And everything you need starts with Aston Martin's 7.0-liter V12, sending all of that (at least) 800 horsepower from the front-midship directly to the back wheels, with nothing else getting in the way. Meaning no hybrid system here, unlike the other track-only offerings from McLaren and Ferrari."
9416,"But while Aston Martin doesn't offer you a massive battery pack, it does give you everything else you'd ever want to go as obscenely fast as is possible on non-public roads. Oh yeah, also, ""obscenely fast"" in this situation really does mean obscenely fast, as the monocoque and body are both made of carbon fiber. Giving the Vulcan a greater power-to-weight ratio, as Aston Martin notes, than one of their GTE racing cars."

9418,
9419,"Of course, Aston Martin does intend on selling these to just 24 of the most discerning trackday bros in the world for an inconceivable and undisclosed amount of money, and not to just specially trained and qualified racers. So to make sure the 24 new owners of a Vulcan don't go and promptly kill themselves, they'll have their own driver training program. Not only will they get simulator time, they'll get training in real life, too."
9420,"It'll start out with coaching in the relatively mild Aston Martin V12 Vantage S, then proceed to the medium spice of an Aston Martin One-77. From there, they'll step up to the habeneros of the Aston Martin Vantage GT4 racer."
9421,"And the final step, the half-eaten bhut jolokia of Satan's scovillefest from hell, is the Vulcan. Well, for a few specially-designated track days with Aston Martin."

They do get this magnificent beast, and, as Hooniverse notes, they get the same dynamic suspension spool valve technology that you can only find on the Aston Martin One-77 and the Chevy Camaro Z/28. (And yes, that is the only time in life you will see two people directly compare the One-77 and the Camaro Z/28.)"
9425,"But it's not even about the technology, or how simple it is in relation to other super-ultra-crazy customer track cars. It's about that styling. Unlike the P1 GTR or the FXX K, the Vulcan doesn't appear to be directly based on anything other ""production"" offerings from Aston, so the company was free to explore stylistic boundaries. Unlike other Astons, and especially the One-77, it's lost much of the curves and replaced them with sharp, angular creases. And although I'm a little iffy on the headlights which make it looks like it's lost its glasses, I might just come around to them once I see it in person."

9449,"But they didn't just make a VIN plate. Instead, Brad's car went through three separate VIN inspections: one from the typical oil change inspection place, one from the DMV, and one from two detectives who spent two hours inspecting all the VIN plates and running it through an INTERPOL database to ensure it wasn't stolen."

Whether it's in Japanese or German or Dutch, your imported car's title will be in a language they can't read over at the DMV. This is one of the many things you might not typically think about when you're going to register an imported vehicle, but it's a crucial one for obvious reasons. So you'll have to get your title translated into English, either through a certified translator (Texas) or – this is how it's done in Virginia – through a translation that you provide yourself. I have no idea how this is legal, but Japanese Classics tells me they do it every time."
9453,"OK, so you've convinced them to accept the VIN, and you've got your title translation. You also have your state title application document (usually a standard form you can print online) and a foreign bill of sale (you have that, right?), along with your NHTSA form, your EPA form, and your customs form from the import process.

There's always something, and there will be even more somethings on your first try. In fact, Brad told me he went back to the DMV three times before he got the VIN confirmed – and that doesn't count the trip to get the VIN inspection from the detectives, and the final visit to the separate tag office to get plates and a title."

	'Ludes are not a popular drug any more, nor are Preludes popular cars – at least not at Honda which stopped making them some time ago. Today's 
	Nice Price or Crack Pipe Si is from back when they did, and it has 4WS too. Will its price however, prove a worthy prelude to purchase?"
9518,"
	Among the great debates of the ages - great taste/less filling, tightie whities/billowy boxers - you can add the desirability of yesterday's 
	1998 Mercedes E320, which was claimed to have some Brabus bits appended to it. That debate extended to its price, however in the end, it came away a 56% Nice Price winner as the likes slightly outweighed the no-likes."
9519,
9520,"
	There should be no debate over the likability of today's 
	1991 Honda Prelude, I would imagine. Honda's entrant in the '80s/'90s FWD coupe wars has always been well regarded -as far as such things go."
9521,Advertisement
9522,
9523,"
	FWD sporty coupes were all the rage back when MTV played music videos and tweeting was just how little kids farted. Honda's first stab at the sporty coupe market arrived in the form of the '78 Prelude which shared its suspension with the Accord, and its styling with boredom."
9524,"
	The second generation Prelude was both better proportioned and featured larger engines to better account for its sporting pretensions. By the third generation, the Prelude offered evolutionary styling changes from before, keeping pop-up headlights and a jaunty jump in the mid-car beltline. It also offered some pretty cool options."
9525,Advertisement
9526,
9527,"
	This '91 comes from that generation's final model year and like most Honda product of the era acquits itself pretty well stylistically. These cars looked good then and still do now. This one is red, which along with white seems to have been the most common color these cars carried. That paint is a respray, as noted in the ad, and one that is now showing some signs of wear."
9528,"
	The interior of the car seems to be in nice shape, although the only look at it we get are in a shot of the back seat - almost never used in these cars owing to their cramped dimensions - and one of the center stack and 5-speed stick."
9529,Advertisement
9530,
9531,"
	Being an Si, this Prelude should rock the 140-horse B21A1 DOHC four, and the ad notes major maintenance having been undertaken on the mill in the past two years, which included the timing belt. I don't remember if these are interference engines, but even if not, a broken timing belt can ruin your whole day."
9532,"
	One of the cool features that this Si possesses is 4WS. It's a mechanical system with a long shaft running between the front and rear axles and actuating a hypocycloid gear steering box for the rear wheels. Rear steering angles depended on those of the fronts and the whole thing made for excellent handling. At least according to the Road & Track road test of the day."
9533,Advertisement
9534,
9535,"
	Speaking of excellent, the ad for this Honda does just such a job of explaining the car's strengths and foibles, as well as its history. At least as known by the current owner. Among the issues it details are some oil usage - common in older Hondas - and some finicky A/C controls. Other than that the car seems to be in excellent (there's that word again) shape for 231,000 miles."
9536,"
	The question for today however is whether it's in sufficient shape to account for its $3,000 price tag. These aren't all that common these days, and this one, being entirely stock seems to be a great example of the breed. What's your take on $3,000 for this Si? Is that a price that might make you consider it? Or, is that amount a prelude to a miss?"

9564,"The hardest part, apparently, was just getting the engine to fit. Third-generation Miatas share the same platform as the RX-8, and the Renesis engine swaps easily between them. First gen Miatas also are often made with earlier Mazda rotary engines, but getting the Renesis to fit was nearly impossible. “This one almost killed me,” Gleason said."
9565,"Getting the RX-8’s brain in the Miata, along with its motor, the mounts, and the diff required a lot of custom fabrication. CJ Wilson Mazda is not a fab shop. They bought Dan a welder and a cutting tool and he had to learn from there. “They let me run wild back there,” he said. “and I appreciate it.”"

9567,
9568,"Just as difficult as getting the drivetrain in was getting the car’s electronics to work. The RX-8 has nine different modules that need to talk to each other to work. Even though the RX-8 is five years old now, it’s still quite advanced. “A couple gigahertz away from being self-aware,” is how Dan describes it."
9569,The electronics work ranged from the straightforward to the painfully surprising. Dan had to do everything from fit the RX-8’s instrument panel in the dashboard to install keyless entry. Some module needed to be installed for the system to read key codes it needed for the engine to turn on. This all required a lot of installation in not a lot of space.

9572,"The end result in absolutely amazing. The car only got minor performance modifications like an improved intake and exhaust, but it didn’t need much. We’re talking about moving a 250 horsepower engine from the 3,100-pound RX-8 into a 1,900-pound MX-5. “The car moves,” Dan said after a test drive, “plain and simple.”"
9573,Just listen to the thing wail up to redline. The car is amazingly smooth now.
9574,
9575,"Dan has worked on Mazdas for 19 years now. He’s a rotary engine devotee, with a rotary tattoo and a REPU in his driveway. Even with all of that, this build stumped him on many occasions. “A significant amount of time was spent staring at it and wondering what am I getting myself into,” Dan told me. And for someone with his level of experience, that was “kinda fun.”"

9578,"Anybody can go and build a fast Miata. Anybody can cram a V8 up front and call it a day. But the owner of this Renesis-powered car gets to have something unlike anything else. Unbelievably smooth, unbelievably clean, and unbelievably accomplished. This car might have taken hundreds of man hours, but it produced a unicorn. I think it was worth it."
9579,"Special thanks to Richard Fisher, Autobarn Mazda, CJ Wilson Mazda, Declan Brennan, Eric Vates, and Dan Gleason for the information, interviews, photos, and video of this car. What an amazing machine."

9584,Ferrari has built some rather hardcore cars for public consumption. The question is which one was the most extreme.
9585,"I have a personal soft spot for the Ferrari 348 because when it comes to cars I'm a contrarian and also because I think it looks cool and also it apparently has the best steering of any midengine V8 Ferrari, at least according to this old EVO magazine test. It is unassisted, after all."
9586,"I have even more of a soft spot for 1993's Ferrari 348 GT Competizione, the car that started this whole Stradale/Scuderia/Speciale thing. The 348 GT Competizione was built for Ferrari's one-make series for the model. Here's the race version. Not so different, is it?"
9587,Advertisement
9588,
9589,"The road car version knocked 190 kilos out of the car (from 1370 to 1180), which is pretty impressive given that it has what looks like a full roll cage. Ferrari didn't go for a sissy half cage like you get in a Porsche RS."
9590,Advertisement
9591,
9592,"The car did lose air conditioning and floor mats, as per the hardcore road car norm. The fuel tank, despite holding a rather impressive 88 liters, was actually downsized from the regular 348's 95l! It is also possible that the Competizione only had one seat. This press photo suggests as much."
9593,"Er, maybe not. This Ferrari press photo suggests the car has two seats. Ferrari's press office is not to be trusted."

9595,
9596,"As for what was added, the thing got bigger wheels and tires (18"" wheels up from 17,"" 239 section tires up front and 265 rear), a new multi-plate racing clutch, and brakes derived from the F40. There was no ABS. The only engine modification was a free-flowing exhaust. If you're curious, the dry-sumped 3.4 liter V8 made 320 horsepower (up from 300 standard), and 340 Nm of torque (up from 324)."
9597,Can you think of a Ferrari road car that was more of a hardcore machine than this?

The original Beetle was a car that got shit done, and now it's time for the Beetle to go back to work."
9614,"Fundamentally, the original Beetle was about cheap, reliable, honest transportation. It was because of this lack of pretension that the Beetle was able to transcend its bargain-basement role to become a car anyone would drive, rich or poor, famous or anonymous, jackass or saint. "

The Gen3 Beetle should ideally sell in the US for around $10-$12,000 or so, and would compete with cars like the base Fiat 500, Chevy Spark, Mitsubishi Mirage, etc."
9619,"Now, these sorts of cars are rarely appealing for companies in the US market. I know that. That's why this Gen3 Beetle should be designed as something that would be a volume seller in China and India as well. The Beetle needs to get back to its genuine People's Car roots, and to do that you've got to go where the people are. I hear China and India have plenty."

That means from a distance, it shouldn't look too radically different than the current or first-gen New Beetle, since they both modernized the essential look quite well. Proportions will change a bit, and I personally want to bring back the front hood stamping design, but it's going to be very recognizable as a Beetle. There will be cost-saving details like a LeCar/Renault 5-style cutout door handle, exposed hinges on the rear hatch, and an unstressed and removable roof panel via simple, exposed screws.  "
9623,"Part of the essential charm of the original Beetle had to do with its novel engineering. Novel, but rational — the Beetle wasn't weird to be weird, it just ended up weird compared to the mainstream because of the solutions it took to problems. Air-cooling means no radiator or water plumbing system, rear engine means no driveshaft and good traction, the curvy shape meant less steel used, and so on. The Gen3 will have rational and novel engineering as well, all pulled from work VW is already doing."

9625,
9626,"The basic platform will be shared with the Up!, as much as possible. That will take the car down a full size from the current modern Beetle, so packaging and space utilization will be very important. That's where we dig into VW's past, and pull from a prototype that almost became the Beetle's successor — the EA266."
9627,
9628,"The EA266 was a master of space utilization. Here, look at this:"

9632,"There's a few differences, but we're basically dealing with the same idea. I'd put the radiator/AC condenser up front, shape the fuel tank to act as the front trunk floor, and let the Beetle's rounded shape help give back a little headroom to the raised rear seat. It's not all that different from the new Renault Twingo, but the engine is more mid- than rear-mounted (it's in front of the rear axle line), which should help mitigate oversteer and improve handling."
9633,Advertisement
9634,
9635,"For the engine itself, I see two options: the 800cc two-cylinder diesel from the Volkswagen XL1 for non-US markets, and the 1L three-cylinder from the current Up!. The diesel will play especially well in countries like India, where diesel small cars are the norm, but I think the output of around 50 HP would be too little for the US. Maybe they could get some more out of it? I'm just not sure."
9636,
9637,"The Up!'s 3-cylinder makes near enough to 100HP to make it viable to compete with the low-end of the US market, and should be plenty of power for the car. Gas mileage should be very strong on the 1L version, and should be phenomenal — well over 50MPG, probably? — on the diesel. As far as transaxle/rest of the mid-engine drivetrain goes, I'm hoping VW could leverage the hardware and work they've already developed for their other stillborn mid-engine car, the BlueSport."

9639,
9640,"I think VW already has most of the bones of this car developed in one form or another, and while there's certainly plenty of work needed to adapt these engines and drivetrains into the Up! platform, it hardly seems like an impossible task."
9641,"The Gen3 Beetle needs to be as rugged and worry-free as possible as well, and the way to achieve this is to give up a bit of conventional aesthetic constraints. The bumpers, for example, should be unpainted black rubber/plastic. No factory option for paint. The bumpers are there to do a job, and if you back into a hydrant or a meth-addled rotweiller goes to town on your bumper, it barely matters. No dings that crack paint and give you a $1500 repair bill here. In the same way, the original Beetle's runningboard is referenced in the Gen3 by a tough black rubber side-guard to help stave off dings and absorb mild damage."

Proportions will change a bit, and I personally want to bring back the front hood stamping design, but it's going to be very recognizable as a Beetle. There will be cost-saving details like a LeCar/Renault 5-style cutout door handle, exposed hinges on the rear hatch, and an unstressed and removable roof panel via simple, exposed screws.  "
9739,"Part of the essential charm of the original Beetle had to do with its novel engineering. Novel, but rational — the Beetle wasn't weird to be weird, it just ended up weird compared to the mainstream because of the solutions it took to problems. Air-cooling means no radiator or water plumbing system, rear engine means no driveshaft and good traction, the curvy shape meant less steel used, and so on. The Gen3 will have rational and novel engineering as well, all pulled from work VW is already doing."
9740,Advertisement
9741,
9742,"The basic platform will be shared with the Up!, as much as possible. That will take the car down a full size from the current modern Beetle, so packaging and space utilization will be very important. That's where we dig into VW's past, and pull from a prototype that almost became the Beetle's successor — the EA266."
9743,
9744,"The EA266 was a master of space utilization. Here, look at this:"
9745,Advertisement
9746,
9747,"A front trunk, a hatch at rear, the back seat passenger sits on the engine, and the whole length of the car is usable for people or cargo. I love it. So, I'm pretty much stealing it:"
9748,"There's a few differences, but we're basically dealing with the same idea. I'd put the radiator/AC condenser up front, shape the fuel tank to act as the front trunk floor, and let the Beetle's rounded shape help give back a little headroom to the raised rear seat. It's not all that different from the new Renault Twingo, but the engine is more mid- than rear-mounted (it's in front of the rear axle line), which should help mitigate oversteer and improve handling."
9749,Advertisement
9750,
9751,"For the engine itself, I see two options: the 800cc two-cylinder diesel from the Volkswagen XL1 for non-US markets, and the 1L three-cylinder from the current Up!. The diesel will play especially well in countries like India, where diesel small cars are the norm, but I think the output of around 50 HP would be too little for the US. Maybe they could get some more out of it? I'm just not sure."
9752,
9753,"The Up!'s 3-cylinder makes near enough to 100HP to make it viable to compete with the low-end of the US market, and should be plenty of power for the car. Gas mileage should be very strong on the 1L version, and should be phenomenal — well over 50MPG, probably? — on the diesel. As far as transaxle/rest of the mid-engine drivetrain goes, I'm hoping VW could leverage the hardware and work they've already developed for their other stillborn mid-engine car, the BlueSport."
9754,Advertisement
9755,
9756,"I think VW already has most of the bones of this car developed in one form or another, and while there's certainly plenty of work needed to adapt these engines and drivetrains into the Up! platform, it hardly seems like an impossible task."
9757,"The Gen3 Beetle needs to be as rugged and worry-free as possible as well, and the way to achieve this is to give up a bit of conventional aesthetic constraints. The bumpers, for example, should be unpainted black rubber/plastic. No factory option for paint. The bumpers are there to do a job, and if you back into a hydrant or a meth-addled rotweiller goes to town on your bumper, it barely matters. No dings that crack paint and give you a $1500 repair bill here. In the same way, the original Beetle's runningboard is referenced in the Gen3 by a tough black rubber side-guard to help stave off dings and absorb mild damage."
9758,Advertisement
9759,
9760,"There's just steelies available for the wheels, and inside, instead of a lot of carpet, there's rubber mats. You can fold down the seat and stick your dog in the back, and if he pukes masticated cat poops everywhere, it's not the end of the world. Maybe there should even be a drain in the floor. Everything is comfortable and well-made, but designed for durability over luxury."
9761,"Of course, US versions would need to have airbags and all the required safety equipment. Non-US ones could probably get away with a good bit less."
9762,"Aftermarket suppliers should be encouraged to make things like fancier wheels or painted bumper caps or replaceable roof panels (canvas sunroof? Clear plexi? Why not?) if people want them, but VW just makes the basics."
9763,Advertisement
9764,
9765,"Even the dashboard and controls should fit the philosophy. It's modeled after the original Beetle dash, but the main instrument binnacle is a monochrome, relatively lo-res backlit LCD panel. Those are cheap as dirt now, and still plenty flexible to display anything you'd need to see. All the infotainment/nav and other controls would be handled by your smartphone. There would be a special slide-in docking unit on the dash to hold and connect to/power the phone. An app on the phone would activate when docked, and give you all the required controls. No phone? VW could sell you a dedicated drop-in unit, then. But come on, everyone has a phone."
9766,"This new Gen3 Beetle could pick up where the original left off. It would be designed honestly, with clear goals and minimal pretention. It would be light and simple, and fun to drive as a result. The cars should be cheap enough that people would feel free to personalize and experiment, just like they did with the original Beetle. It would make an ideal first car, or a very handy second or third car for families."
9767,Advertisement
9768,
9769,"The Gen3 Beetle would be born into an iconic reputation and status, which would free it from having to try and find some identity. That freedom means it doesn't have to hide behind too much artificial frippery. It's free to be a transportation tool that gets used however you need it, but it has an ingrained sense of fun."
9770,"It should come in a ton of interesting colors, have fun options for the color and design of the cheap/rugged interior materials, and, above all, become a car you could actually love, simply because it just is what it is."

"
9909," The are a few letdowns. The continuously variable transmission, while up to the task, still feels unrefined when hooked up to the raspy boxer four. The Legacy also suffers from a ride that’s less forgiving and an infotainment system that’s attractive and feature-packed but falls short in ease-of-use and basic functionality. However, AWD and a sweet price make many of those concerns evaporate, and you’d be doing yourself a disservice to not seriously consider the Legacy when shopping around. "

9916," While you can get into a well-equipped, entry-level Accord for around $22k, as soon as you start tacking on the options the price shoots up quickly. Things like heated seats, satellite radio, proximity keys, and Honda’s trick LaneWatch system, which ups the ante on blind spot detection with a video of what’s on your side, means you’ll be shooting towards $30,000 with ease. "
9917," It is, however, one of the only sedans that offers a V6 in the segment, and that 278 hp is delivered in a sonorous, spinning blast to a traditional six-speed automatic. The six is arguably the best engine in its class, and while the four-cylinder gets the job done, it makes do with a CVT. But Honda’s laser-like focus on the details seems to be slipping. The seats are hard and offer little support, the navigation system is a mess of buttons and screens, and if you want something that’s properly specced, you’ll be looking at 30-large, easily. "

9952,"The Focus ST practically feels like an old friend at this point. It’s been on the market since 2012 and remains one of the top contenders in the hot hatchback world. In those three years, it’s proven itself to be a solid pick for enthusiasts. I see these cars everywhere, and I know a lot of Jalops who own them and enjoy them daily."

9956,"Ford’s bigger ST gets a few tweaks for the 2015 model year. None of it’s too drastic, though. The front fascia has been redesigned. The headlamps get LEDs. There’s a few new wheels and a new exterior color. The gauge cluster has been tweaked. There’s a new flat-bottomed steering wheel that’s way better than the old four-spoke unit. And most notably, the ST has new front springs and better shock absorber tuning front and rear to improve handling. "
9957,Advertisement
9958,
9959,"Frankly, Ford didn’t need to change a lot on the Focus ST because it was already pretty damn good. Power from the 2.0-liter EcoBoost® (sorry) turbo engine remains unchanged at 252 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque."
9960,"That’s a lot of grunt to send through the front wheels, so the big question if you’re considering a Focus ST becomes this: How much torque steer are you willing to put up with?"
9961,Advertisement
9962,
9963,"Make no mistake that the Focus ST is pretty quick. Ford doesn’t put out official zero to 60 mph times, and ones I’ve seen in magazines are all over the place, but you should be able to hit it in well under six seconds. "
9964,"More than any quoted time will tell you, the ST just always feels eager to behave badly. It is very, very easy to drive like an asshole in this car, to give in to your darker impulses on the road, to deliver divine passing justice to anyone fool enough to hog the left lane. It may be just a small four-banger, but the turbo gives you more than enough thrust for real-world situations as well as your track days. "
9965,"Here’s what I like about the Focus ST: unlike that McLaren, or a Hellcat, you can actually wring this thing out on a public road and not die or crash or risk arrest, probably. It’s fast but its power is always manageable. It’s easy to work with."
9966,Advertisement
9967,
9968,"You don’t ever have to hold it back — quite the opposite, in fact. The ST wants you to go nuts. It’s best when it’s being thrashed. Overpowered cars are wonderful, but there’s something to be said for that kind of accessibility, too. "
9969,"Handling-wise, it’s an interesting car. There’s that torque steer, sure, but in a straight line I really didn’t mind it at all. The way I see it, torque steer on a powerful front-wheel drive car is just part of the experience, like rear wheelspin on a Hellcat. It’s just the machine’s character. "
9970,Advertisement
9971,
9972,"In the corners, the ST is kind of unique in this class for its ability to controllably rotate its rear end when you lift off the throttle. The steering is improved so it delivers more feel and accuracy, though like a lot of electric units it’s a bit numb. All that torque steer can make it a little unpredictable shooting out of corners, too — there were times when I was never really sure what it would do. It’s good at keeping things lively, that’s for sure. "
9973,"A six-speed manual remains the only gearbox option for the Focus ST. Good. As wonderful and lightning-quick as modern paddle shift transmissions are, nothing can beat the involvement of doing it yourself with your left foot and your hand. And the gearbox in the ST is a pretty good one, with light, easy, mostly accurate throws, even if they’re a bit on the long side. The clutch is a delight to use as well."

9975,
9976,"I got into the Focus ST immediately after driving the 2015 Golf Sportwagen, so the interior was an abject letdown compared to that, but I stopped caring after a while. It’s heavy on cheap plastics, but it gets the job done. The new wheel is a big improvement too. Ford has finally gotten Sync to the point where it’s not a crippling pain in the ass anymore; it paired with my phone immediately and worked very well the entire time I had it. "
9977,"As for the rest of the interior, it’s roomy and practical, ideal for the single enthusiast who needs something more than a sports car or the mom or dad with a small, young family who isn’t ready to dump the fun car for a huge SUV or minivan quite yet. It’s a great do-everything car."

9980,"Let’s talk about the Recaros for a second, though. Eventually I got used to them, but I still think they’re too aggressively bolstered, and that the ass part of the seat is angled upward in this awkward way that made working my left foot kind of uncomfortable at first. Sure, bolstering is good. But like birthday cake, or cocaine, you can have too much of a good thing. "
9981,"I’m gonna get slammed by the ST lovers and the forum bros for this, but I still don’t think the ST’s Recaros are worth springing for. I know the fans swear by them, though. I can’t tell if they mean that or if they’re just unwilling to admit that they know the seats suck. (It’s okay, folks. This is a safe place, free of judgment.) It’s also possible I’m spoiled after driving a supercar that has actual good seats, but that car cost $311,225 so I need to get over it. "
9982,"Besides that, the only other major gripe I had about the ST was the sound. There’s not enough of it. You get some growly engine noise piped in through a symposer, but it’s kind of anonymous and not nearly loud enough. There’s also no notable exhaust note from within the car, either. I’d like a little more grunt in the aural department, and if this were my car, an aftermarket exhaust would be the first order of business. "
9983,Advertisement
9984,
9985,"So in the end, the Focus ST was a delight to have around for a week. When I didn’t feel like pulling the supercar out of the garage (which totally makes it sound like I get those all the time even though I don’t), when I wanted to drive something normal and practical that didn’t attract a ton of attention, this was still a lot of satisfying fun. "
9986,"I just don’t think it’s the hot hatch I’d buy, to be honest, and that’s more of a personal preference than anything deficient about the Focus. As I push into my 30s — as my knees give out and I have to pee three times a night and I can’t even tell you what’s on fleek these days — the bright orange hot hatch with the insane seats holds a little less appeal to me than others in its class. I’d rather have a new Volkswagen GTI, or even the revised Subaru WRX. "

It’s not even bad at $30,070 as equipped here with navigation, the Sony sound system, dual zone climate control and Xenon HID headlamps, painted wheels and the fancy orange paint. "
9990,"Actually, scratch that — 22-year-old P.G. would have preferred the Ford Fiesta ST, as does grown-ass 29-year-old P.G. The Fiesta ST may not have the Focus ST’s raw power, but it’s smaller, more tossable, cheaper, also very practical and just plain more fun to drive. Given America’s lack of really tiny hot hatches, it just feels more special, too. It’s the way I’d go at any age."

9998," Jeremy Clarkson berated a Top Gear producer throughout the evening of March 4 before he attacked him physically until a witness intervened, the BBC said in their investigation of the incident that led to Clarkson’s termination from the famed motoring program. "
9999," The investigation led by BBC Scotland head Ken MacQuarrie was based on interviews with the participants in the so-called “fracas” and witnesses. It says that the incident took place at the Simonstone Hall Hotel in North Yorkshire during a Top Gear shoot, a few hours after filming took place in the Surrey studio. "
10000," Producer Oisin Tymon “was subject to an unprovoked physical and verbal attack by Jeremy Clarkson” that left him with a swollen and bleeding lip. Whatever prompted this attack was not included in MacQuarrie’s report, but news reports have said it started because Clarkson was angry over receiving a dinner of cold cuts instead of a steak. "
10001, The physical attack happened on the hotel patio and lasted about 30 seconds until it was halted by the intervention of a witness. Tymon reportedly did not retaliate. 
10002," Clarkson’s verbal abuse continued inside the hotel, the report said, “and contained the strongest expletives and threats to sack” Tymon. It also included verbal assaults on other members of the Top Gear crew. "

10006, The report concluded with this: 
10007," It was not disputed by Jeremy Clarkson or any witness that Oisin Tymon was the victim of an unprovoked physical and verbal attack.

10012,This is a BMW 740Ld xDrive. It's my current test vehicle. And I freaking love it.
10013,"Normally when it comes to BMWs, and cars in general, I prefer the fastest, hardest, angriest, adrenaline-pumpingest thing I can get my hands on. But this diesel 7-Series is so smooth, so comfortable, so chilled out that I just love spending time behind the wheel. There's just something nice about cruising around in a huge, well-equipped executive sedan that still has something of a sporting edge to it."
10014,"Because BMW nomenclature makes little sense anymore, it's not a 4.0-liter V8; it's actually a diesel 3.0-liter turbo inline six, the same motor out of the last generation BMW 335d. That was one of our favorite 3-Series engines because it has 255 horsepower (okay) and 413 pound-feet of torque (oh hell yes.) "
10015,"Things I like: Glides along with levels of comfort you'd expect from its shared platform with Rolls-Royce, diesel engine has ample thrust everywhere, fantastic seats, really outstanding Harman Kardon sound system, 8-speed ZF automatic is great as always, steering is impressive."
10016,"Things I don't like as much: Not as many insane toys as a Mercedes S-Class, loads of brake dive because it's so heavy and softly sprung, not as fast as other expensive BMWs, I always feel underdressed in it like I should have worn a blazer or something."

10020,"I have it for a couple days before I peace out for the New York Auto Show. If you have questions, drop 'em in the comments."
10021,"Considering the dramatic rebirth Ford has undergone in the last decade, Lincoln’s comparative lack of direction is pretty surprising. Maybe, though, this new Lincoln Continental Concept represents the re-discovery of something Lincoln’s so desperately needed: an identity."
10022,"Technically, this will be the tenth generation of Continental (hey, Mark X looks and sounds pretty good as a name), and the second time the nameplate has come back from the dead. After the first generation came to a halt in 1948, it wasn’t until 1956 that the name was brought back. The last time a car has worn the Continental name was back in 2002."
10023,"Of course, 2002 was also the year that Lincoln tested the waters with a very handsome and striking Continental concept car, one that I suspect Lincoln has been regretting not turning into a production vehicle back then. This new Continental may be their chance to pick up again."
10024,Advertisement
10025,
10026,"And, from what we can see so far, it doesn’t look bad. The design has a strong, chrome-trimmed shoulder line that runs from the fender leading edge back that echo’s the Continental’s high mark, the 1961-1969 fourth generation. The grille has a very interesting mid-century inspired mesh pattern, one that auto show attendees may recognize from the large screens Lincoln decorates their booths with, and which has often been the most interesting design element in those booths."
10027,"The Continental concept includes some interesting details like Tesla-style pop-out door handles (good luck getting in if the battery dies, buddy) and a novel dynamically-tinting clear roof that’s visually designed as an unbroken element from the windshield. Also, the interior of the concept seems well-considered and very unafraid of blue and wood, not bad things."
10028,
10029,Still no suicide doors at the rear. Dammit.
10030,"It’s also possible to move the empty front passenger seat from the rear, a nice touch, and the rear seats fully recline. Also:"
10031,"Rear-seat passengers also enjoy the convenience of a tablet lap tray that deploys from the Through-center console, a champagne storage compartment, and Venetian leather first-class travel cases."
10032,Advertisement
10033,
10034,"Whew. Poor champagne storage is my number one deal breaker when I’m shopping for cars. Also, chili storage."
10035,"The lighting design is interesting as well, with the long-desired full-length taillight unit and headlights that feature five smaller light units per headlight, designed to look like the Lincoln star badge. We’ll see how much of this makes it to production, but it’s at least novel."
10036,
10037,"Technically, it doesn’t look like FoMoCo is planning to get too crazy, with the 3L EcoBoost V6 as the powerplant. The overall drivetrain isn’t yet specified, and since Ford doesn’t really have all that many RWD platforms (F150 and Mustang are the biggies) it’s safe to guess this will be AWD. They also specify:"
10038,"... Lincoln Drive Control that offers clients a choice of three driving modes – normal, sport and comfort – to suit their individual preferences."
10039,Advertisement
10040,
10041,"... but I can’t think of any car with any kind of selectable driving mode that doesn’t offer those three basic preferences. A Lincoln should have some setting like HyperSmoothClass mode, where the suspension is softened to such a degree that you could play Jenga in the back while driving over railroad tracks."
10042,"According to Lincoln’s press release,"
10043,"“Luxury at its best is about simplifying and quietly exceeding expectations, rather than being the loudest statement on the road,” said Mark Fields, Ford Motor Company president and CEO. “The Continental Concept showcases the promise of quiet luxury from Lincoln going forward. It also is a strong indication of what’s to come next year as we introduce our new Lincoln Continental full-size luxury sedan.”"
10044,Advertisement
10045,
10046,"So, this ‘quiet luxury’ thing — what is that, PR code for ‘old and rich?’ Maybe. I mean, it’s not a bad market to target, really. "
10047,"I think Lincoln actually has managed to make a handsome, elegant car here that doesn’t totally feel like everything else on the market, and that’s a very good thing — provided they can keep that feeling from getting watered down as this makes its (probable) way from concept to production. For example, I actually really like those pinwheel wheels, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see them tamed into anonymity by the time this gets to market."
10048,Advertisement
10049,
10050,Lincoln’s PR also had this quote:
10051,"“Some brands talk about the machine. Lincoln is different. For us, it is about more than the machine. It is about what our vehicles do for our clients.” - Kumar Galhotra, Lincoln president"
10052,"I think that’s a dig at BMW, Audi, Mercedes, and the other German car makers? Maybe? It’s all sort of PR horseshit, though. “What the vehicles do for our clients” — they ferry their asses to and from restaurants, primarily. Happy now, Kumar?"
10053,Advertisement
10054,
10055,"Despite my cynicism to press releases, I’m hopeful about this new Lincoln. It’s the first thing we’ve seen from Lincoln in quite a while that gets close to what the brand’s original spirit and appeal was all about — elegance, refinement, and a distinctively American take on luxury and comfort. We don’t need another copycat BMW or Audi, and it looks like Lincoln is finally out of that trap and on its way to rediscovering itself."
10056,Good luck!
10057,"Usually, the production version of a concept car is something of a disappointment. When you all of a sudden have to take a car made of dreams and ideas and magic ground-up fairy testes and somehow try and make it only cost $25,000 and able to drive over bumps bigger than snoozing gnats, the fun bits often get lost. But not always."
10058,"Rarely, there’s a car that somehow, despite having to exist in our brutal reality, manages to be better than the idealized concept car that preceded it. The Nissan GT-R is a good example of this. The car came out in 2007, but back in 2001 the first GT-R concept was shown, and as you can see, it was something of a dopey, heavy-looking slab of silver."
10059,"It was clean without, somehow, being sleek. Some of what would become the GT-R’s lines were there, but they hadn’t matured into the athletic, modern look that the production GT-R became."
10060,"I know it’s tricky, but there must be other examples, right? Help me out — let’s see what you come up with, smarties. Oh, and I’m going to go ahead and say the Citroën DS with balls for wheels doesn’t count as a concept car. So don’t use that one."

10062,
10063,"(Tavarish suggested the GT-R, by the way. It was a good suggestion. Happy now?)"
10064,"Generally speaking, I’ve been a fan of Cadillac’s stuff over the past few years. They make damn good cars that are fast and luxurious and stylish, even if they aren’t quite on the level of the Germans in some areas. But one major sticking point has been their CUE infotainment system and haptic touch panel for certain controls. It looks like the 2016 Cadillac CT6 is trying to fix some of that. "
10065,
10066,"As a whole, the CT6 seems to have a better-designed and more premium interior than the CTS does, and that car was no slouch to begin with. (The ATS was another matter, in certain ways.) The car on display at the New York Auto Show is a preproduction prototype, not the final model, but right off the bat it’s impressive. "
10067,"One thing I noticed during the car’s debut last night is that the giant, piano black center panel that features prominently on the CTS and ATS has been minimized quite a bit. It used to take up a huge amount of center real estate, now it’s been downsized and lowered to make room for that 10.2-inch touch screen. "
10068,Advertisement
10069,
10070,"For comparison purposes, here’s what a 2015 CTS looks like on the inside. I’m referring to the CTS’ control panel, which a lot of folks have described as looking like a Transformer’s head."
10071,"If you’ve never driven a CTS or ATS, you might not know that the control panel replaces buttons with areas that sort of vibrate when you push them. It works a lot better in practice than in theory. "
10072,Advertisement
10073,
10074,"Early versions of this CUE technology, which include the touch screen and infotainment system, were criticized for being slow and laggy and painful to use even by the standards of modern infotainment systems, most of which suck. Cadillac has implemented some CUE updates since then, but it’s still less than ideal."
10075,"The CT6 — which slots above the CTS — looks like it’s designed to address some of these complaints. The haptic panel is still there, but it’s not as prominent. Perhaps more importantly, the steering wheel has more a traditional array of actual buttons, which has to make it easier to operate stuff during driving. "
10076,Advertisement
10077,
10078,"I can’t speak to the updated CUE software itself because I didn’t get to play with it much, but Cadillac promises it will be faster and more responsive. There’s also a touchpad below and to the right of the shortened gear selector that lets you control some functions instead of having to use the touch screen. "
10079,"Also, the outside of the car looks better in person than it does in photos. You’ll have to take my word on this, I guess. It’s definitely not a radical design, but they’re definitely doing a 3-Series/5-Series/7-Series family resemblance thing here compared to its smaller brothers in the Cadillac line. "
10080,The CT6 seems interesting so far. I look forward to driving one at some point. Hopefully I won’t want to put my fist through the CUE screen this time.

10086,
10087," There’s two big things to make note of here — first, I’m trying really hard to avoid typing “Smart smartphone” and second, the Smart seems to be the first car to actually leverage the fact that almost everyone already has a high-quality color LCD screen in their pockets, so why build another one into the dash? "
10088,"I’m excited because this is basically the concept I proposed using on my hypothetical mid-engine, entry-level Beetle. I’m, of course, not the first to come up with this concept — let the driver’s smartphone handle the car’s infotainment/navigation/center stack screen tasks — but I think Smart may be the first to really implement it. "
10089,Advertisement
10090,
10091," Well, Datsun did sort of have a similar physical docking system, but there’s some big differences here: the Datsun one was basically just a phone holder. Smart’s docking system holds the phone at physically the right center-stack location on the dash, and communicates via Bluetooth to a special Smart app that provides controls for the car’s nav/infotainment system. Here’s what it does, according to the robot-translated German site: "
10092,The functions of the smart crossConnect app at a glance:
10093,"I’m especially pleased to see “G-Force” listed as part of the “most important vehicle data.” Looking at this list, this is pretty much moots what people tend to use that center screen for, and it has the advantage of being able to go with you when you leave the car to remind you where you parked, and how much time you have left on your meter."
10094,Advertisement
10095,
10096,"Also, if your phone is doing some of the center console/infotainment work for you, people may be less inclined or able to do stupid things like text and drive."
10097,"My biggest gripe about the system right now is that it looks like it still requires a separate, physical cable to handle charging the phone, which you’d likely need to do if you have it running, with Bluetooth active, as your car’s center stack screen. I don’t see why they couldn’t have integrated 5V of USB-level charging power into the mount itself, with some sort of swappable end to accommodate iPhones or Android phones or whatever. I mean, the USB port is nearby and a dangling cable isn’t the end of the world, but they came this far, and adding charging to the dock would have just make it so much better."
10098,Advertisement
10099,
10100,"Still, this is a good start. The app interface looks pretty clean and easy to use, from what I can tell from these pictures (I tried to find and download the app to my phone, but the only Smart app that comes up in the US App Store is something that’s not this, and a crapload of brain puzzle things). "
10101,"I’m very curious to try this system out on my own, and see if it makes a viable case for letting your phone take over some of the potentially redundant hardware in your car. I could see one day your phone even replacing your car keys, which would be convenient, and could leave you even more boned if you lose or break your phone than you are now. Or if your phone runs out of power, you could be stranded. "

10153,Roughly ten years ago a lone editor’s attempt to post photos of a Lexus hybrid failed because he didn’t bring more batteries.
10154," Our digicam crapped out before we could get some shots of the newest Lexus hybrid to stun the automotive world: the 300hp, 450h luxury sedan. The world’s first hybrid luxury sedan, the 450h is also the first front-engined full hybrid vehicle with rear wheel drive and the performance of a V8, making it as much a breakthrough as was its dimunitive sibling, the Toyota Prius. The hybrid-drive system combines a 3.5-liter V6 engine with a high-output electric motor — delivering enough power to propell the sedan from zero to 60 in less than six seconds. If gas goes to $4 a gallon in the US, Toyota will rule the world. [Thanks to the mighty Japanese Car Fans for picking up the slack.]"

10160,"For most people, a driver’s license or ID card is the most straightforward thing in the world. Here’s who I am, and this is where I live. But what if you live in an RV? What if you don’t have an address? And what if you’re an expatriate who hasn’t had a fixed address in your home country in years? Allow me to share with you the bureaucratic nightmare that came with my “moving” from Texas to New Mexico."
10161,"Strictly speaking, I don’t live in my “recreational vehicle” or a vehicle of any kind, nor do I live in Texas or New Mexico. I live in Japan. But as an American citizen, I am still required to be domiciled in a U.S. state. And like many RVers and avid travelers, this means I lack a house or apartment. "
10162,"For U.S. expatriates, the United States, and one of its states specifically, isn’t really home. My home is not the United States, so in the conceptualisation we have of “home is where the heart is,” everyone knows that Japan is my home. "
10163,"That doesn’t, however, exempt me from having and maintaining a domicile in the United States. The only way to do that is to relinquish U.S. citizenship, because as a natural-born American, I am a “citizen of the United States and of the state in which (I) reside.” "
10164,"So, being honest that really, my home is an hour outside of Tokyo doesn’t change the fact that I must reside somewhere in the United States, and if I want to do certain things, Japan will insist I do it in the country of origin — and that means in the state in which I am legally domiciled."
10165,Advertisement
10166,
10167,"I had some documentation issues I had to sort out in Japan, but my home state of Texas wasn’t allowing me to do what I wanted to do. And while I didn’t care, Japan did. And in order to go through necessary procedures for naturalisation to Japan, I needed to change or obtain documents only available through the state level because of “dual-sovereignty” (or the concept that in the United States political system, some powers are the federal government’s and some powers are retained by the states). So I “moved” to New Mexico instead. "
10168,This process isn’t just for people seeking to emigrate. Other people choose to move their domicile for tax reasons or estate planning or marriage (such as same-sex marriage) or divorce proceedings. There’s nothing illegal about this as long as you are really doing it. Where people run into problems is when they think they can move a domicile for some reason and then continue to operate in their previous state as if it was still a legal domicile. 
10169,"Sounds confusing, right? I know. Try having to actually do it. "
10170,"For me, moving to New Mexico was a no-brainer. Not only were the documentation processes considerably easier and simpler, and the political situation more to my liking (protection of sexual orientation in public employment since 1985, LGBT anti-discrimination laws since 2003, and same-sex marriage since 2013), I have family there and went to school there for a time. In a legal action contesting my residency, this would be strong evidence in my favor. I’m no stranger to New Mexico. But even if I was, the process would have been the same."
10171,Advertisement
10172,
10173,"I should point out that while “residence” and “domicile” are often conflated, they are not always legally the same. Rule of thumb is that you can have many physical residences (like Mitt Romney!), but you may only have one “domicile.” Your domicile is where you claim that you have established permanent residency. It is where you maintain “intent to return.” It is home. You are allowed to change your “domicile” but you need to establish a pattern of proof (we’ll get to that). "
10174,"All other residences are temporary, ephemeral, or the like. Vacation homes (again, like Mitt Romney, it’s pretty to good to be Mitt Romney) if you want to think of it that way. As an expatriate, this can be complicated, because a true expatriate’s home isn’t in their nation of origin."
10175,"Here’s how you do it. Let’s assume that you, like myself, did not have access to an apartment or house and that for reasons generally outside of your control, or that you did not have anyone willing to allow you to use an address. If you are an RVer or avid traveler and live out of your vehicle or are an expat, you wouldn’t need nor want to purchase property or sign a lease agreement. "
10176,Advertisement
10177,
10178,"So how do you get an address? Mailbox services. Not P.O. Boxes, those don’t count. I mean a mailbox which can exist at a verifiable physical address. There are many companies that do this. It’s the same for if you have a small business and incorporating laws require you have a physical address. I chose a UPS location within walking distance of my mother’s residence. All you need is a valid current ID. I used my passport. "
10179,"These mailbox companies can forward the mail for a small fee to anywhere you know you are going to be, even internationally, if you just pick up the phone or email them and tell them what you need sent, where, and when."
10180,"Now you have a legal physical address. This will appear like a suite or apartment number, and may be listed as such by various institutions or agencies, but never tell anyone to do that, say number or # to be completely accurate and honest about the address. You don’t need to volunteer that it is a mailbox, but it doesn’t legally matter that it is. "
10181,Advertisement
10182,
10183,"From here you can acquire other proofs of residency because you will need to surrender your old driver’s license and obtain a new one from your new state. You will need to update your address with your financial institutions, brokerages, cell phone, health insurance, auto insurance, etc, etc. "
10184,"Once you do that, you can look up the necessary document lists, and collect the required documents (for New Mexico it was proof of social security number, either the card or a signed letter from the field manager of the local Social Security Administration office, one form of identity which is your former license, and two proofs of residency)."
10185,It’s up to you to make sure that you are operating within the laws of both the state in which your formerly resided and the state in which you are trying to establish residency.
10186,Advertisement
10187,
10188,"For New Mexico, and indeed many states, you can register your motor vehicle in the state before obtaining a driver’s license. This is great, because then you can use your motor vehicle registration and your auto insurance policy as proof of your residency with your new address. I didn’t have a car (my car is in Japan!), so I used my life insurance policy and a statement from my retirement account. I also registered to vote in New Mexico at the same time my temporary license was approved, which further cements my position that New Mexico is my domicile."
10189,"The more time you have to gather the documentation, the easier this process is. I ended up spending two days from dawn to dusk running around from agency to agency to agency, because often in order to get one document you need one of the other documents. So for me, trying to get this all done within one week before I fly back to Japan, I didn’t always know I needed one document for another document until I showed up and was told, leaving empty handed. But if you do have a couple of weeks to spend on the process, and can spend time finding out the document order, the process is actually simple."
10190,"I should add a disclaimer, while from all of my research, I believe what I have done is both legal and accurate, I am not a lawyer. And residency requirements from state to state (not to mention nation to nation) do differ. Sometimes considerably. "

They responded by saying that the sales manager does not allow test drives of the Golf R, as it’s limited production. Other dealerships want to run our credit before giving a test drive, which seems like a bit too much information to give when we haven’t settled on a specific car yet (how can we... we haven’t driven it). "
10201," Now, we’re not some tire-kicking teenagers. We’re both highly paid tech-industry workers and homeowners who actually want to buy a car. Is “buying without test driving” actually a thing?

Other dealerships want to run our credit before giving a test drive, which seems like a bit too much information to give when we haven’t settled on a specific car yet (how can we... we haven’t driven it). "
10257," Now, we’re not some tire-kicking teenagers. We’re both highly paid tech-industry workers and homeowners who actually want to buy a car. Is “buying without test driving” actually a thing? What’s the best way to find a dealership that isn’t surrounded by an aura of smug, or should we just give up on getting a Golf R without giving up all of our personal information? "
10258," Thanks, "
10259, Cynthia 
10260," To answer your question, Cynthia, I am going to provide a little personal experience. When I was a lad of merely 18 years of age, I worked at a Ferrari dealership, where I was paid to drive exotic cars – and occasionally a short-bed Chevrolet Colorado covered in Ferrari dealership logos – to customers’ houses. This was a dream job, and there are still days when I wake up in utter shock that I chose a college degree over driving around all day in Ferraris. "
10261,Advertisement
10262,
10263," Anyway: we would often have people come into the dealership to look at cars, particularly used ones. As I recall, we had a wide range of cool used cars on the lot: Porsches, Aston-Martins, Bentleys, Lotuses, and the like. And do you know what would happen when a serious buyer would come in for a test drive? We would give it to them. Bentley, Aston-Martin, Lotus, whatever. It didn’t matter They would get a test drive. Because test driving sells cars, and we were a reputable business trying to make money. "
10264," And now we return to your own experience with the Volkswagen dealership. Here’s the situation, as I understand it: you walked into a Volkswagen dealership, attempting to test drive a hatchback. The Volkswagen dealership said no one drives this hatchback without a credit check. If this is a correct assessment of the situation, then I will present you with the reaction I would’ve given the sales manager: "
10265, HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAAHHAH 
10266,Advertisement
10267,
10268, And then I would’ve spit on the floor and asked him how the Routan business is going. 
10269," Here’s the deal: although I completely understand a Porsche dealer not wanting to give joyrides to questionable buyers, or a Ferrari dealer not wanting a high-schooler to sit in a sold car, there is absolutely no excuse for a Volkswagen dealership not to let people test-drive a freaking Golf. The idea of it is laughable, and it kind of makes you wonder if the dealership’s insurance policy has lapsed, and they aren’t allowing any test drives, unless of course someone stupid enough to buy a Routan walks through the door. "
10270," Now, I do understand that the Golf R is a high-performance Volkswagen, and a special little snowflake of a car, and sometimes they cost a whopping forty grand. But here’s the deal: if dealerships stopped allowing cars that cost more than $40,000 to be test driven, then no one would ever be able to test drive a Mercedes. People would just walk into the dealership, stare at the GL-Class for a while, then drive it home, only later realizing that it’s the size of a low-income housing project. "
10271,Advertisement
10272,
10273," And so, Cynthia, here’s the advice I have for you: tell these idiots that they will let you drive the Golf R, or else you will go to one of the ten million other Volkswagen dealerships in your area, all of whom are undoubtedly so desperate for business that they may start to offer the Tiguan at competitive prices. "
10274," And if there aren’t any other Volkswagen dealers nearby, then for God’s sake, just wait for the Focus RS. It’ll be just as fast. It’ll be just as fun. And there’s another benefit: you won’t have to return to the Volkswagen dealership for service. "

If we were measuring the Fiat 500L’s benefits and drawbacks in terms of water storage, all the good things I just named would fill a little Evian bottle; the kind of Evian bottle Turkish men try to sell you on the street, and you refuse, because you’re pretty sure it’s half-full of their saliva.

10296,
10297, One major problem is hesitation. Allow me to explain what happens when you’re in a 500L and a traffic light turns green: 
10298, 1. You put your foot on the gas. 
10299, 2. All the other traffic goes. 
10300, 3. People on bicycles go. 
10301, 4. Pedestrians start to go. 
10302, 5. Glaciers melt. 
10303, 6. Working Internet reaches commercial airplanes. 
10304, 7. Entire animal species go extinct. 
10305, 8. The city of Cleveland becomes a top honeymoon destination. 
10306, 9. The 500L’s transmission selects first gear and you’re on your way. 
10307," Seriously: I’ve never driven a car that hesitates so dramatically when you push the accelerator. And I am including in this statement subcompact cars, hatchbacks, large trucks, vans, scooters, that PT Cruiser I crushed, vehicles whose parking brakes are on, vehicles I have driven in dreams, etc. "
10308,Advertisement
10309,
10310," And then there’s the problem with the gear selector itself. In a normal automatic car, you have the gears arranged in a simple P-R-N-D-L format, which makes it very easy to figure out exactly what gear you’re in at any given moment because every single automatic car manufactured in the last ten zillion years has used this exact same shift pattern, and why would anyone ever want to change it? "
10311," Well, in the 500L, they changed it. You have auto and manual over to the left, grouped together in a way that leaves you in manual sometimes and automatic sometimes, for no apparent reason and with no obvious method for switching between the two. Then on the right you have neutral on top, and reverse at the bottom, which is counterintuitive to anyone expecting “R” to come before “N” in the world of automatic transmission gear selectors. "
10312," To illustrate my point, I’ve taken a photo of the offending gear selector for your viewing benefit: "
10313,Advertisement
10314,
10315," But these issues pale in comparison to the transmission’s biggest drawback, which is: no matter what situation you find yourself in, no matter where you’re sitting, no matter where you’re parked, the 500L rolls in the exact opposite direction of what you want. If you had been stranded on a mountain with your 500L for the last month, with no food or water, and you finally found a path that leads you back down the mountain to safety, the 500L’s transmission would find a way to roll you back up. "
10316," All of these wonderful features came together in possibly the worst transmission-related incident I’ve ever experienced in my entire automotive life. Picture this: we’re trying to parallel park in a tiny spot on a narrow street with dozens of Istanbul drivers stacked up behind me, all of whom use the horn with the same regularity that you or I might use the mirrors. "
10317,Advertisement
10318,
10319," So I’m backing into this tiny spot, and of course it’s night, and of course the 500L doesn’t have sensors or a camera, and of course I have no idea how big it is. So I’m backing up, and HONK HONK HONK from the Istanbul drivers, and I start to go forward, and HONK HONK HONK, because I’m still blocking the road, and then I shift into reverse, and the car begins rolling forward, because that’s what the 500L does, regardless of what gear it’s in, even if you’re on a surface with approximately the same overall grade as Nebraska. "
10320," So I push the pedal and nothing happens, but that’s normal in the 500L thanks to its huge lag time. So I’m waiting for the transmission to kick in, and the people behind me are honking, and nothing’s happening, so I push the pedal even harder, and still nothing’s happening, and now we’ve rolled so far that I’m about three inches away from the car in front of me. And I push the pedal again, and HONK HONK HONK, and then I look down and discover I’m not in reverse, but rather I’m in neutral, because the transmission lever is arranged with the logic of plane crash debris. "
10321," So I shift into reverse, and do you know what happens? We CONTINUE to roll forward, now only about an inch from the car in front. So I JAM the accelerator, and I wait for the Hesitation Period, and FINALLY the car starts to move backwards, except now it’s going at roughly the speed of a bullet train, and we avoid the car behind us by about a centimeter. So then I throw the car back into drive, which is of course manual mode, and now we’re rolling again, and the transmission is hesitating, and HONK HONK HONK, and I can’t see where I’m going, and after about 30 seconds of this I realized I absolutely do not need to park in Turkey, unless I come upon a spot that was recently vacated by a box truck.

10375," It’s finally here. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that’s right: after nearly three months of waiting, and transit, and customs, and preparation, my Nissan Skyline GT-R has finally completed its 10,000-mile journey from Japan to America. I’ve welcomed it with open arms, and also the occasional curse word when I try to get into the driver’s seat by walking up to the passenger door. "
10376," You’d know all about my new Skyline GT-R if you followed me on Twitter, because I’ve been posting photos of it there like a first-time mother with Facebook access. I was especially proud of this photo from the Richmond airport, where I posed the Skyline – one of the most exciting high-performance Japanese cars of all time – with a sign welcoming me to Virginia, a state where they’ll give you a speeding ticket if your dog runs too fast at the park. "
10377," But today, I’m going to tell you the story of picking up the Skyline and driving it home, starting from the very first moment where I climbed in, twisted the key, fired up the engine, and couldn’t find reverse. "
10378," I’ve also summed up this story in a video, which is included below for your viewing pleasure. But since I’m aware that many of your workplaces have instituted a ban on motion pictures, I will also recount the experience for you the old-fashioned way: by writing about it on the Internet. 
   "
10379,
10380," The story begins back in December, when I asked you what car I should buy
    to replace my Ferrari, and you overwhelmingly told me to import a Nissan Skyline GT-R from Japan. So I called up Japanese Classics, noted importer of automobiles I crashed in Gran Turismo 2, and we spent the next two months on the phone once a week in order to fully report on the process of importing a car, from start to finish. "
10381,Advertisement
10382,
10383,
10384," And then, after all the e-mails, and phone calls, and messages, and waiting, there I was: at Japanese Classics in Richmond, Virginia, standing in a warehouse I can describe only as JDM heaven. "
10385," There were other GT-Rs, and a 300ZX, and various imported Skyline sedans. There was a Honda City Turbo and an old Civic with only a few thousand original miles. Bizarrely, there was a Buick Grand National. There were dozens of engines and hundreds of parts, all neatly arranged on the shelves. And then, there was my personal favorite Japanese Classics gem: a right-hand drive 1990 Toyota 4Runner, complete with a diesel engine, a manual transmission, and only 71,000 original miles. Fortunately, it was already sold, or else I would’ve had to figure out how to get two vehicles back home from Richmond. "
10386,Advertisement
10387,
10388,
10389," Anyway: back to the Skyline. After we did the paperwork, I walked outside to take my very first drive in my “new” 25-year-old Japanese car. "
10390," At this point, I must confess that my expectations were rather low. I kind of thought the Skyline would be a really cool Maxima, and I figured this whole culture around it was totally overblown and ridiculous and out of proportion. After all: there’s a fan club for everything, including that mid-1990s Mustang with panel gaps the size of an octopus. So I figured the Skyline would be an overhyped letdown and I’d want to get rid of it before I even got home from Virginia. "
10391,Advertisement
10392,
10393, And then… the key twist. The first turn of the wheel. Letting out the clutch. And the discovery that the Skyline GT-R really is as cool as everyone says it is. 
10394," Here’s the thing: my experience with Japanese cars primarily came from my parents, who owned a large assortment of boring, basic transportation Japanese vehicles throughout my entire young life. But this car isn’t anything like the point-A to point-B Japanese cars I’m used to. The engine burbles like a V8. The steering is as tight as a Porsche 911 or an E36 BMW M3. The car is as stable at high speeds as a Mercedes-Benz. It’s all so well-done that you kind of wonder if, had Nissan brought over this car 25 years ago, people would now associate the Japanese with the kind of purpose-built, high-performance sports cars the Europeans are now famous for. "
10395," Unfortunately, I didn’t really get to investigate the matter further, because I was driving a newly imported right-hand drive automobile with a window-mounted temporary license plate and a kilometers per hour speedometer through Virginia, a state where Jalopnik’s own Patrick George once put his foot down and ended up in jail
    with the kind of people whose primary occupation is convenience store robbery. This meant the odds of getting pulled over were roughly equivalent to the chance that you may, at some point during your life, die. "
10396,Advertisement
10397,
10398,
10399," So I took it easy in Virginia and I used the time to learn several other important details about the car. For example: did you know the R32 GT-R is a 5-speed manual, and not a 6-speed? I certainly didn’t, but I learned it the moment I almost shifted into reverse on the highway. "
10400," Also, I discovered that my Skyline has been surprisingly well maintained, in the sense that everything works, from the mini-disc player to the air conditioning to the power windows, power locks, and mirrors. The only thing that doesn’t work is the clock, but that’s OK, because I don’t really care what time it is in Osaka. "
10401,Advertisement
10402,
10403," Eventually, I reached Washington, D.C., where I was meeting up with a couple of readers for lunch. It was here that I started to discover the Skyline’s biggest flaw: 25-year-old automotive seats aren’t made with the same level of cushion that you get from modern automotive seats. On the contrary, 25-year-old automotive seats sort of feel like giant slabs of stone that were not, in any way, shaped to fit a human rear end. By the time I reached D.C., I was so sore that I pulled up to the first parking garage I could find and paid the attendant – this is true – twenty dollars to park my car for an hour and a half. "
10404," After lunch, I made the mistake of attempting to leave D.C. at 4 p.m., which meant I was stuck in traffic for the better part of early April. Seriously: while you guys were off celebrating Easter by consuming large amounts of bunny-shaped chocolate, I was sitting in traffic behind a guy in a ’99 Accord who had been fired from his job nine weeks earlier and was still trying to commute home. "
10405," But despite its age and its lack of regular use (my Skyline has only 35,000 original miles), the car handled rush hour just fine. Not a hint of overheating. No funny noises. No strange behavior. Just one perfectly cool right-hand drive automobile and one very sore driver who was starting to wonder if maybe the Japanese do not have butts, and this is why they designed the seats to feel like you’re sitting on a piece of brutalist architecture.

10410," 1. The Skyline attracts just as much attention as any car I’ve ever driven. JDM enthusiasts come up beside you and ask questions. Old people notice you’re driving on the “wrong side of the car” and do a double-take. People who know the “GT-R” name see the badge, and think you’re just some idiot who stuck it on an old Sentra, until they realize that you’re sitting on the right side of the car. Then they give you a thumbs up. The entire experience is very much like driving the Ferrari, except nobody hates you. "

10412,
10413," 2. The Skyline is incredibly fun to drive. And I don’t mean it’s somewhat fun to drive, and I’ll get tired of it after a few weeks behind the wheel. I mean the steering is tight, the acceleration is top-notch, and the car pulls hard at every speed, in every gear. It was all so exciting that when I finally got to Philadelphia, I wanted to drive the car even more, except that I was only about 50 percent sure my legs were still attached to my body. "
10414," So the Skyline is now here, and I’m pleased to report that I truly couldn’t be happier. It’s fun, it’s fast, the driving experience is everything I hoped for, and I’m legitimately excited every time catch a glimpse of it in my garage. Maybe, just maybe, this thing really does deserve the “Godzilla” moniker. I suspect we’ll find out for sure over the next few months. "

10424," The story begins back in December, when I asked you what car I should buy
    to replace my Ferrari, and you overwhelmingly told me to import a Nissan Skyline GT-R from Japan. So I called up Japanese Classics, noted importer of automobiles I crashed in Gran Turismo 2, and we spent the next two months on the phone once a week in order to fully report on the process of importing a car, from start to finish. "

10428," And then, after all the e-mails, and phone calls, and messages, and waiting, there I was: at Japanese Classics in Richmond, Virginia, standing in a warehouse I can describe only as JDM heaven. "
10429," There were other GT-Rs, and a 300ZX, and various imported Skyline sedans. There was a Honda City Turbo and an old Civic with only a few thousand original miles. Bizarrely, there was a Buick Grand National. There were dozens of engines and hundreds of parts, all neatly arranged on the shelves. And then, there was my personal favorite Japanese Classics gem: a right-hand drive 1990 Toyota 4Runner, complete with a diesel engine, a manual transmission, and only 71,000 original miles. Fortunately, it was already sold, or else I would’ve had to figure out how to get two vehicles back home from Richmond. "

10434," At this point, I must confess that my expectations were rather low. I kind of thought the Skyline would be a really cool Maxima, and I figured this whole culture around it was totally overblown and ridiculous and out of proportion. After all: there’s a fan club for everything, including that mid-1990s Mustang with panel gaps the size of an octopus. So I figured the Skyline would be an overhyped letdown and I’d want to get rid of it before I even got home from Virginia. "

10437, And then… the key twist. The first turn of the wheel. Letting out the clutch. And the discovery that the Skyline GT-R really is as cool as everyone says it is. 
10438," Here’s the thing: my experience with Japanese cars primarily came from my parents, who owned a large assortment of boring, basic transportation Japanese vehicles throughout my entire young life. But this car isn’t anything like the point-A to point-B Japanese cars I’m used to. The engine burbles like a V8. The steering is as tight as a Porsche 911 or an E36 BMW M3. The car is as stable at high speeds as a Mercedes-Benz. It’s all so well-done that you kind of wonder if, had Nissan brought over this car 25 years ago, people would now associate the Japanese with the kind of purpose-built, high-performance sports cars the Europeans are now famous for. "
10439," Unfortunately, I didn’t really get to investigate the matter further, because I was driving a newly imported right-hand drive automobile with a window-mounted temporary license plate and a kilometers per hour speedometer through Virginia, a state where Jalopnik’s own Patrick George once put his foot down and ended up in jail
    with the kind of people whose primary occupation is convenience store robbery. This meant the odds of getting pulled over were roughly equivalent to the chance that you may, at some point during your life, die. "

10444," Also, I discovered that my Skyline has been surprisingly well maintained, in the sense that everything works, from the mini-disc player to the air conditioning to the power windows, power locks, and mirrors. The only thing that doesn’t work is the clock, but that’s OK, because I don’t really care what time it is in Osaka. "

Old people notice you’re driving on the “wrong side of the car” and do a double-take. People who know the “GT-R” name see the badge, and think you’re just some idiot who stuck it on an old Sentra, until they realize that you’re sitting on the right side of the car. Then they give you a thumbs up. The entire experience is very much like driving the Ferrari, except nobody hates you. "

10544,
10545," 2. The Skyline is incredibly fun to drive. And I don’t mean it’s somewhat fun to drive, and I’ll get tired of it after a few weeks behind the wheel. I mean the steering is tight, the acceleration is top-notch, and the car pulls hard at every speed, in every gear. It was all so exciting that when I finally got to Philadelphia, I wanted to drive the car even more, except that I was only about 50 percent sure my legs were still attached to my body. "
10546," So the Skyline is now here, and I’m pleased to report that I truly couldn’t be happier. It’s fun, it’s fast, the driving experience is everything I hoped for, and I’m legitimately excited every time catch a glimpse of it in my garage. Maybe, just maybe, this thing really does deserve the “Godzilla” moniker. I suspect we’ll find out for sure over the next few months. "

Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that’s right: after nearly three months of waiting, and transit, and customs, and preparation, my Nissan Skyline GT-R has finally completed its 10,000-mile journey from Japan to America. I’ve welcomed it with open arms, and also the occasional curse word when I try to get into the driver’s seat by walking up to the passenger door. "
10552," You’d know all about my new Skyline GT-R if you followed me on Twitter, because I’ve been posting photos of it there like a first-time mother with Facebook access. I was especially proud of this photo from the Richmond airport, where I posed the Skyline – one of the most exciting high-performance Japanese cars of all time – with a sign welcoming me to Virginia, a state where they’ll give you a speeding ticket if your dog runs too fast at the park.

10553," But today, I’m going to tell you the story of picking up the Skyline and driving it home, starting from the very first moment where I climbed in, twisted the key, fired up the engine, and couldn’t find reverse. "

   "
10555,
10556," The story begins back in December, when I asked you what car I should buy
    to replace my Ferrari, and you overwhelmingly told me to import a Nissan Skyline GT-R from Japan. So I called up Japanese Classics, noted importer of automobiles I crashed in Gran Turismo 2, and we spent the next two months on the phone once a week in order to fully report on the process of importing a car, from start to finish. "

10558,
10559,
10560," And then, after all the e-mails, and phone calls, and messages, and waiting, there I was: at Japanese Classics in Richmond, Virginia, standing in a warehouse I can describe only as JDM heaven. "
10561," There were other GT-Rs, and a 300ZX, and various imported Skyline sedans. There was a Honda City Turbo and an old Civic with only a few thousand original miles. Bizarrely, there was a Buick Grand National. There were dozens of engines and hundreds of parts, all neatly arranged on the shelves. And then, there was my personal favorite Japanese Classics gem: a right-hand drive 1990 Toyota 4Runner, complete with a diesel engine, a manual transmission, and only 71,000 original miles. Fortunately, it was already sold, or else I would’ve had to figure out how to get two vehicles back home from Richmond. "

10563,
10564,
10565," Anyway: back to the Skyline. After we did the paperwork, I walked outside to take my very first drive in my “new” 25-year-old Japanese car. "
10566," At this point, I must confess that my expectations were rather low. I kind of thought the Skyline would be a really cool Maxima, and I figured this whole culture around it was totally overblown and ridiculous and out of proportion. After all: there’s a fan club for everything, including that mid-1990s Mustang with panel gaps the size of an octopus. So I figured the Skyline would be an overhyped letdown and I’d want to get rid of it before I even got home from Virginia. "

10568,
10569, And then… the key twist. The first turn of the wheel. Letting out the clutch. And the discovery that the Skyline GT-R really is as cool as everyone says it is. 
10570," Here’s the thing: my experience with Japanese cars primarily came from my parents, who owned a large assortment of boring, basic transportation Japanese vehicles throughout my entire young life. But this car isn’t anything like the point-A to point-B Japanese cars I’m used to. The engine burbles like a V8. The steering is as tight as a Porsche 911 or an E36 BMW M3. The car is as stable at high speeds as a Mercedes-Benz. It’s all so well-done that you kind of wonder if, had Nissan brought over this car 25 years ago, people would now associate the Japanese with the kind of purpose-built, high-performance sports cars the Europeans are now famous for. "
10571," Unfortunately, I didn’t really get to investigate the matter further, because I was driving a newly imported right-hand drive automobile with a window-mounted temporary license plate and a kilometers per hour speedometer through Virginia, a state where Jalopnik’s own Patrick George once put his foot down and ended up in jail
    with the kind of people whose primary occupation is convenience store robbery. This meant the odds of getting pulled over were roughly equivalent to the chance that you may, at some point during your life, die. "

10573,

10575," So I took it easy in Virginia and I used the time to learn several other important details about the car. For example: did you know the R32 GT-R is a 5-speed manual, and not a 6-speed? I certainly didn’t, but I learned it the moment I almost shifted into reverse on the highway. "
10576," Also, I discovered that my Skyline has been surprisingly well maintained, in the sense that everything works, from the mini-disc player to the air conditioning to the power windows, power locks, and mirrors. The only thing that doesn’t work is the clock, but that’s OK, because I don’t really care what time it is in Osaka. "

10578,
10579," Eventually, I reached Washington, D.C., where I was meeting up with a couple of readers for lunch. It was here that I started to discover the Skyline’s biggest flaw: 25-year-old automotive seats aren’t made with the same level of cushion that you get from modern automotive seats. On the contrary, 25-year-old automotive seats sort of feel like giant slabs of stone that were not, in any way, shaped to fit a human rear end. By the time I reached D.C., I was so sore that I pulled up to the first parking garage I could find and paid the attendant – this is true – twenty dollars to park my car for an hour and a half. "
10580," After lunch, I made the mistake of attempting to leave D.C. at 4 p.m., which meant I was stuck in traffic for the better part of early April. Seriously: while you guys were off celebrating Easter by consuming large amounts of bunny-shaped chocolate, I was sitting in traffic behind a guy in a ’99 Accord who had been fired from his job nine weeks earlier and was still trying to commute home. "
10581," But despite its age and its lack of regular use (my Skyline has only 35,000 original miles), the car handled rush hour just fine. Not a hint of overheating. No funny noises. No strange behavior. Just one perfectly cool right-hand drive automobile and one very sore driver who was starting to wonder if maybe the Japanese do not have butts, and this is why they designed the seats to feel like you’re sitting on a piece of brutalist architecture. "

10683," It’s finally here. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that’s right: after nearly three months of waiting, and transit, and customs, and preparation, my Nissan Skyline GT-R has finally completed its 10,000-mile journey from Japan to America. I’ve welcomed it with open arms, and also the occasional curse word when I try to get into the driver’s seat by walking up to the passenger door. "
10684," You’d know all about my new Skyline GT-R if you followed me on Twitter, because I’ve been posting photos of it there like a first-time mother with Facebook access. I was especially proud of this photo from the Richmond airport, where I posed the Skyline – one of the most exciting high-performance Japanese cars of all time – with a sign welcoming me to Virginia, a state where they’ll give you a speeding ticket if your dog runs too fast at the park.

10687,
10688," The story begins back in December, when I asked you what car I should buy
    to replace my Ferrari, and you overwhelmingly told me to import a Nissan Skyline GT-R from Japan. So I called up Japanese Classics, noted importer of automobiles I crashed in Gran Turismo 2, and we spent the next two months on the phone once a week in order to fully report on the process of importing a car, from start to finish. "

10690,
10691,
10692," And then, after all the e-mails, and phone calls, and messages, and waiting, there I was: at Japanese Classics in Richmond, Virginia, standing in a warehouse I can describe only as JDM heaven. "
10693," There were other GT-Rs, and a 300ZX, and various imported Skyline sedans. There was a Honda City Turbo and an old Civic with only a few thousand original miles. Bizarrely, there was a Buick Grand National. There were dozens of engines and hundreds of parts, all neatly arranged on the shelves. And then, there was my personal favorite Japanese Classics gem: a right-hand drive 1990 Toyota 4Runner, complete with a diesel engine, a manual transmission, and only 71,000 original miles. Fortunately, it was already sold, or else I would’ve had to figure out how to get two vehicles back home from Richmond. "

10695,
10696,
10697," Anyway: back to the Skyline. After we did the paperwork, I walked outside to take my very first drive in my “new” 25-year-old Japanese car. "
10698," At this point, I must confess that my expectations were rather low. I kind of thought the Skyline would be a really cool Maxima, and I figured this whole culture around it was totally overblown and ridiculous and out of proportion. After all: there’s a fan club for everything, including that mid-1990s Mustang with panel gaps the size of an octopus. So I figured the Skyline would be an overhyped letdown and I’d want to get rid of it before I even got home from Virginia. "

10700,
10701, And then… the key twist. The first turn of the wheel. Letting out the clutch. And the discovery that the Skyline GT-R really is as cool as everyone says it is. 
10702," Here’s the thing: my experience with Japanese cars primarily came from my parents, who owned a large assortment of boring, basic transportation Japanese vehicles throughout my entire young life. But this car isn’t anything like the point-A to point-B Japanese cars I’m used to. The engine burbles like a V8. The steering is as tight as a Porsche 911 or an E36 BMW M3. The car is as stable at high speeds as a Mercedes-Benz. It’s all so well-done that you kind of wonder if, had Nissan brought over this car 25 years ago, people would now associate the Japanese with the kind of purpose-built, high-performance sports cars the Europeans are now famous for. "
10703," Unfortunately, I didn’t really get to investigate the matter further, because I was driving a newly imported right-hand drive automobile with a window-mounted temporary license plate and a kilometers per hour speedometer through Virginia, a state where Jalopnik’s own Patrick George once put his foot down and ended up in jail
    with the kind of people whose primary occupation is convenience store robbery. This meant the odds of getting pulled over were roughly equivalent to the chance that you may, at some point during your life, die. "
10704,Advertisement
10705,
10706,
10707," So I took it easy in Virginia and I used the time to learn several other important details about the car. For example: did you know the R32 GT-R is a 5-speed manual, and not a 6-speed? I certainly didn’t, but I learned it the moment I almost shifted into reverse on the highway. "
10708," Also, I discovered that my Skyline has been surprisingly well maintained, in the sense that everything works, from the mini-disc player to the air conditioning to the power windows, power locks, and mirrors. The only thing that doesn’t work is the clock, but that’s OK, because I don’t really care what time it is in Osaka. "

10710,
10711," Eventually, I reached Washington, D.C., where I was meeting up with a couple of readers for lunch. It was here that I started to discover the Skyline’s biggest flaw: 25-year-old automotive seats aren’t made with the same level of cushion that you get from modern automotive seats. On the contrary, 25-year-old automotive seats sort of feel like giant slabs of stone that were not, in any way, shaped to fit a human rear end. By the time I reached D.C., I was so sore that I pulled up to the first parking garage I could find and paid the attendant – this is true – twenty dollars to park my car for an hour and a half. "
10712," After lunch, I made the mistake of attempting to leave D.C. at 4 p.m., which meant I was stuck in traffic for the better part of early April. Seriously: while you guys were off celebrating Easter by consuming large amounts of bunny-shaped chocolate, I was sitting in traffic behind a guy in a ’99 Accord who had been fired from his job nine weeks earlier and was still trying to commute home. "
10713," But despite its age and its lack of regular use (my Skyline has only 35,000 original miles), the car handled rush hour just fine. Not a hint of overheating. No funny noises. No strange behavior. Just one perfectly cool right-hand drive automobile and one very sore driver who was starting to wonder if maybe the Japanese do not have butts, and this is why they designed the seats to feel like you’re sitting on a piece of brutalist architecture. "
10714,Advertisement
10715,
10716," Eventually, we cleared Baltimore, and the traffic thinned, and I became very excited because I knew I could later describe this experience using automotive journalist metaphors, such as “stretch the car’s legs.” And indeed I did stretch the car’s legs, although what I really wanted to do was stretch my own legs, which were now starting to feel like I had recently decided to take up bicycling and very my first ride was the Tour de France. "
10717, Here’s what I discovered while driving through Maryland and Delaware: 
10718," 1. The Skyline attracts just as much attention as any car I’ve ever driven. JDM enthusiasts come up beside you and ask questions. Old people notice you’re driving on the “wrong side of the car” and do a double-take. People who know the “GT-R” name see the badge, and think you’re just some idiot who stuck it on an old Sentra, until they realize that you’re sitting on the right side of the car. Then they give you a thumbs up. The entire experience is very much like driving the Ferrari, except nobody hates you. "
10719,Advertisement
10720,
10721," 2. The Skyline is incredibly fun to drive. And I don’t mean it’s somewhat fun to drive, and I’ll get tired of it after a few weeks behind the wheel. I mean the steering is tight, the acceleration is top-notch, and the car pulls hard at every speed, in every gear. It was all so exciting that when I finally got to Philadelphia, I wanted to drive the car even more, except that I was only about 50 percent sure my legs were still attached to my body. "
10722," So the Skyline is now here, and I’m pleased to report that I truly couldn’t be happier. It’s fun, it’s fast, the driving experience is everything I hoped for, and I’m legitimately excited every time catch a glimpse of it in my garage. Maybe, just maybe, this thing really does deserve the “Godzilla” moniker. I suspect we’ll find out for sure over the next few months. "

10824," And then, after all the e-mails, and phone calls, and messages, and waiting, there I was: at Japanese Classics in Richmond, Virginia, standing in a warehouse I can describe only as JDM heaven. "
10825," There were other GT-Rs, and a 300ZX, and various imported Skyline sedans. There was a Honda City Turbo and an old Civic with only a few thousand original miles. Bizarrely, there was a Buick Grand National. There were dozens of engines and hundreds of parts, all neatly arranged on the shelves. And then, there was my personal favorite Japanese Classics gem: a right-hand drive 1990 Toyota 4Runner, complete with a diesel engine, a manual transmission, and only 71,000 original miles. Fortunately, it was already sold, or else I would’ve had to figure out how to get two vehicles back home from Richmond. "
10826,Advertisement
10827,
10828,
10829," Anyway: back to the Skyline. After we did the paperwork, I walked outside to take my very first drive in my “new” 25-year-old Japanese car. "
10830," At this point, I must confess that my expectations were rather low. I kind of thought the Skyline would be a really cool Maxima, and I figured this whole culture around it was totally overblown and ridiculous and out of proportion. After all: there’s a fan club for everything, including that mid-1990s Mustang with panel gaps the size of an octopus. So I figured the Skyline would be an overhyped letdown and I’d want to get rid of it before I even got home from Virginia. "
10831,Advertisement
10832,
10833, And then… the key twist. The first turn of the wheel. Letting out the clutch. And the discovery that the Skyline GT-R really is as cool as everyone says it is. 
10834," Here’s the thing: my experience with Japanese cars primarily came from my parents, who owned a large assortment of boring, basic transportation Japanese vehicles throughout my entire young life. But this car isn’t anything like the point-A to point-B Japanese cars I’m used to. The engine burbles like a V8. The steering is as tight as a Porsche 911 or an E36 BMW M3. The car is as stable at high speeds as a Mercedes-Benz. It’s all so well-done that you kind of wonder if, had Nissan brought over this car 25 years ago, people would now associate the Japanese with the kind of purpose-built, high-performance sports cars the Europeans are now famous for. "
10835," Unfortunately, I didn’t really get to investigate the matter further, because I was driving a newly imported right-hand drive automobile with a window-mounted temporary license plate and a kilometers per hour speedometer through Virginia, a state where Jalopnik’s own Patrick George once put his foot down and ended up in jail
    with the kind of people whose primary occupation is convenience store robbery. This meant the odds of getting pulled over were roughly equivalent to the chance that you may, at some point during your life, die. "
10836,Advertisement
10837,
10838,
10839," So I took it easy in Virginia and I used the time to learn several other important details about the car. For example: did you know the R32 GT-R is a 5-speed manual, and not a 6-speed? I certainly didn’t, but I learned it the moment I almost shifted into reverse on the highway. "
10840," Also, I discovered that my Skyline has been surprisingly well maintained, in the sense that everything works, from the mini-disc player to the air conditioning to the power windows, power locks, and mirrors. The only thing that doesn’t work is the clock, but that’s OK, because I don’t really care what time it is in Osaka. "
10841,Advertisement
10842,
10843," Eventually, I reached Washington, D.C., where I was meeting up with a couple of readers for lunch. It was here that I started to discover the Skyline’s biggest flaw: 25-year-old automotive seats aren’t made with the same level of cushion that you get from modern automotive seats. On the contrary, 25-year-old automotive seats sort of feel like giant slabs of stone that were not, in any way, shaped to fit a human rear end. By the time I reached D.C., I was so sore that I pulled up to the first parking garage I could find and paid the attendant – this is true – twenty dollars to park my car for an hour and a half. "
10844," After lunch, I made the mistake of attempting to leave D.C. at 4 p.m., which meant I was stuck in traffic for the better part of early April. Seriously: while you guys were off celebrating Easter by consuming large amounts of bunny-shaped chocolate, I was sitting in traffic behind a guy in a ’99 Accord who had been fired from his job nine weeks earlier and was still trying to commute home. "
10845," But despite its age and its lack of regular use (my Skyline has only 35,000 original miles), the car handled rush hour just fine. Not a hint of overheating. No funny noises. No strange behavior. Just one perfectly cool right-hand drive automobile and one very sore driver who was starting to wonder if maybe the Japanese do not have butts, and this is why they designed the seats to feel like you’re sitting on a piece of brutalist architecture. "
10846,Advertisement
10847,
10848," Eventually, we cleared Baltimore, and the traffic thinned, and I became very excited because I knew I could later describe this experience using automotive journalist metaphors, such as “stretch the car’s legs.” And indeed I did stretch the car’s legs, although what I really wanted to do was stretch my own legs, which were now starting to feel like I had recently decided to take up bicycling and very my first ride was the Tour de France. "
10849, Here’s what I discovered while driving through Maryland and Delaware: 
10850," 1. The Skyline attracts just as much attention as any car I’ve ever driven. JDM enthusiasts come up beside you and ask questions. Old people notice you’re driving on the “wrong side of the car” and do a double-take. People who know the “GT-R” name see the badge, and think you’re just some idiot who stuck it on an old Sentra, until they realize that you’re sitting on the right side of the car. Then they give you a thumbs up. The entire experience is very much like driving the Ferrari, except nobody hates you. "
10851,Advertisement
10852,
10853," 2. The Skyline is incredibly fun to drive. And I don’t mean it’s somewhat fun to drive, and I’ll get tired of it after a few weeks behind the wheel. I mean the steering is tight, the acceleration is top-notch, and the car pulls hard at every speed, in every gear. It was all so exciting that when I finally got to Philadelphia, I wanted to drive the car even more, except that I was only about 50 percent sure my legs were still attached to my body. "
10854," So the Skyline is now here, and I’m pleased to report that I truly couldn’t be happier. It’s fun, it’s fast, the driving experience is everything I hoped for, and I’m legitimately excited every time catch a glimpse of it in my garage. Maybe, just maybe, this thing really does deserve the “Godzilla” moniker. I suspect we’ll find out for sure over the next few months. "

The question I asked myself is, “how can I not care about something which is essentially a baby Civic hatchback?” And I care very much indeed."

11086,"Because it involves the possibility of a child dying, this deceptively simple concept is really difficult to discuss rationally. The act of leaving a kid to sit in a car while a parent does some sort of errand has been around since there’s been cars, parents, and kids. There’s been some real tragedies, but is it always wrong?"
11087,"To be absolutely 100 percent safe, you could make a blanket decision and say that no, it is never, ever okay to leave a kid alone in a car. Some people I respect a great deal have said just that. But I’ll be honest — I’m not so sure it really is always such a horrific idea, and in some cases, the vigilance to find and condemn people for doing this actually make parents and children’s lives much, much worse."
11088,
11089,"Just in case anyone without kids is wondering why this is such a big deal, it’s probably worth explaining some things: kids, as much as we love them, are more often than not tiny lunatics. They have the remarkable ability to make even the simplest of activities into colossal ass-pains, and when multiple kids are involved, the ass-painery increases exponentially."
11090,Advertisement
11091,
11092,"For many kids, sleep time is an important but tenuous thing, and for many parents, if a kid falls asleep in a car, you want to let that sleeping happen no matter what, for the health of the kid, the parent, and probably crucial parts of the Earth’s nitrogen fixation cycle or something."
11093,There’s some real quality-of-life and time management improvements that can happen if a parent is occasionally free to leave a kid in a car for 5-15 minute stretches — situations beyond mere convenience. I think most parents would at least hypothetically agree here.
11094,"Currently, the thinking on leaving a kid in a car is zero-tolerance — there’s even whole groups set up to make sure no one thinks it’s okay to leave a kid alone in a car for any length of time, in any circumstance. There’s even campaigns and pressure for people to call 911 if they see a kid alone in a car, regardless of how aware they are of how long the kid has been in there, or even the condition of the child."
11095,Advertisement
11096,
11097,"Of course, absolutely no one wants kids to die of heatstroke in a hot car. No shit. And if it’s actually hot out, don’t leave your kid in a car — that’s not rocket science. The issue here is that the whole act of letting a kid wait, safely inside a car — where they’re statistically much safer than outside the car — is completely tainted by the idiots who put their kids in real danger."
11098,"The stories about moms leaving kids in cars while they go to a bar or a job interview or gamble?Of course that’s horrible — those are terrible decisions, and they have nothing in common with a responsible parent leaving their kid in a car, on a mild day, windows partially open, as they run a 10-minute errand. It’s just not the same thing."
11099,"The emphasis on all the tragedies and worst-case scenarios is making many good parents who have left a kid in a car feel like monsters — and, I think, pretty needlessly. They wonder “what if” the car was stolen, or if somehow the heat spiked, or if a meteor hit the car, without ever really considering that, if you’re going to fret over bad, random shit happening, that can happen outside a car, or inside a store with a parent, too. All kinds of horrible shit can go down anywhere, anytime — thankfully, it usually doesn’t."

11102,"Sure, the basic players are the same, but it’s like the difference between me taking my kid for a drive in my car and me taking my kid in my car while I drove it in an illegal street race. Same equipment, same players, same fundamental act (driving) but wildly different circumstances. One’s something any parent would do, one is the realm of an idiot who’ll end up killing his kid."
11103,"I was left in cars all the time as a kid, and it was totally fine. And I didn’t have anything nearly as cool as an iPad or something to play with. I think I amused myself watching the blinking red light on the hazard light switch of my dad’s ‘68 Beetle. Sure, it was fun, but I really wanted the Merlin my sister was hogging. Also, I never died in that car."
11104,Advertisement
11105,
11106,"My kid loves being in cars, and there’s times when I’d love to just let him chill in the car while I run into the hardware store or something. Sometimes I need to buy stuff that takes two hands to hold, and going in a store like that, full of actually dangerous tools and sharp, stabby things without a hand on him is way more dangerous than letting him chill in his car seat for 15 minutes."
11107,"If you just use your head, there should be no problem with this. Set some rules — don’t leave them in the car in weather over, say 75 degrees or so, don’t leave them in there for more than 10 or 15 minutes, whatever makes sense — and stick to that. If your errand is taking longer, leave. It’s that easy. Explain you have to get your kid — who’s going to argue? Just don’t use it as a cover for shoplifting."
11108,Advertisement
11109,
11110,"The rabid urge to penalize a parent who’s left their safe, non-heatstroking kid in a car I think helps nobody. If the kid is in danger, if they’ve been there a while, of course, do something, but otherwise, give people some space to parent in ways you might not choose to."
11111,"A few precautions on the parent’s part — say, a little sign you can hang in the window with your cell phone and a reminder that the kid isn’t abandoned could go a long way to making people relax, too."
11112,"I know this is a touchy subject, and rightly so. But I think the trend of blanket condemnation is only hurting many exasperated, otherwise good parents, and there’s far more of those than the idiots locking their kids in cars for way too long in the worst circumstances."

11118,
11119,"You see, there was once a time, way back in 1967, when Ford understood that the absolute essence of motoring pleasure lay in the ability of a driver to have full knowledge of what turns were being indicated without suffering the brutal indignity of tilting their head down and looking on that filthy dashboard for those mocking, blinking green arrows."
11120,"Ford knew there was a better way, and so, in 1967, offered the option to Mustang Buyers known as the Deluxe Hood. The Deluxe Hood, sometimes called the Turn Signal Hood, had a pair of heat extraction vents facing the driver and inset in those vents were two amber lights, connected to the turn indicators."

11137,"Allen Park Police Lt. Dave Williams confirmed that the charges had been dropped against the other motorist, whose name has not been released. "
11138,"Williams said that when the officer was in pursuit of the speeding Challenger on Friday, he lost sight of it, and when traffic became congested near Michigan Avenue, he saw a Challenger pass traffic on the right side and assumed that was his suspect. "

11141,Williams said the other driver admitted to passing on the shoulder but nothing else. He was arrested and later posted bail. 
11142,"“It was a divine mix-up,” Williams said. "

11230,"World Rallycross Championship (RallyCrossRX). It is by far one of the most entertaining racing series in the world. Short sprint format, practically full-contact, mixed surface, cars that are just as insane as GroupB was, world class drivers (Petter Solberg and Mattias Ekstrom for examples), and yet the only place it’s available to watch is beIN Sports. Probably because it’s being intentionally shoved out of market by Global Rallycross Championship, which is a) not global and b) rubbish in comparison."

11258,"There are many cars in this world, and a significant percentage of them are not the BMW 3.0CS. This is somewhat troubling."
11259,"The BMW 3.0CS (called the E9 in BMW’s chassis code) was the Bavarian company’s grand touring car built from the mid ‘60s through the mid ‘70s. If you’re looking for specs, here’s what I can tell you. Barring the early four-cylinder quasi-predecessors, these cars came with overhead cam straight six engines with 120 to 200 horsepower (in this case a 3.0 liter with something around 170). Weight was a bit over 3100 pounds, disc brakes were all around on later cars, and the suspension was all independent with MacPherson struts at the front and somewhat snappy semi trailing arms at the rear. Zero to sixty took around nine seconds and the top speed was supposedly 130mph."

11264,"More than anything else, perhaps, is how BMW basically built the perfect car with the E9 coupes. It did its job perfectly. It was pretty to look at from the outside, pretty to look at from inside. It was engaging to drive and it was comfortable. It was stylish and it was desirable.

They make new driver’s cars a little remote, but they make a technocruiser absolutely perfect. This car, for instance, reads the road ahead with cameras and then adjusts the suspension in preparation for turns and bumps. I don’t want that in a little roadster, but I do very much want that when I’m doing a 300 klicks on the Autobahn."

11348,"A few weeks ago, I got an e-mail from a racing instructor named Ron, asking if I wanted to get some track time in my Nissan Skyline GT-R. So I pondered Ron’s question for several minutes, and I really thought about it, and then a light bulb went off in my head. And this is how I ended up on a race track with a 7,000-pound military vehicle designed to support a machine gun turret."
11349,"You’d know all about my Hummer track day if you followed me on Twitter, because I’ve been excitedly posting pictures all week that show my Hummer with a bunch of race-prepped track cars. But here, today, I’m going to actually tell you what it was like to drive my Hummer on the race track. I’ve also created a video documenting the experience, which I highly suggest you watch, because the entire thing felt like showing up to a rallycross in a dump truck."
11350,
11351,"So here’s what happened. First, I should say that I was expecting a relaxed event, given the rather casual nature of Ron’s e-mails. (At one point, he said: “I love doing stupid things with vehicles.”) But then I showed up, and I realized this event was far from casual. Although this was merely a National Auto Sport Association (NASA) practice day, there were guys with heavily modified, track-only Porsches. Guys with Corvettes that looked like LeMans race cars. Guys with trailers that cost more than a Princeton degree. One guy was using a BMW X5M as his tow vehicle. It was around this time I started to realize that I was going to die, and my place of death was going to be New Jersey Motorsports Park."
11352,"But Ron calmed my nerves by informing me that I wouldn’t be going out on the track with any of those guys. Instead, he said, I’d be going out at lunchtime. This made me happy, because it meant that a) I wouldn’t be taking away track time from anyone, and b) I wouldn’t be killed."
11353,"Unfortunately, my fears returned when I started talking to a few of the other drivers. One instructor, Jordan, gave me a brief overview of what I could expect from the course, before noting that I had picked a great track for my Hummer adventure. “Why’s that?” I asked. “Because,” he replied, “there’s a lot of runoff.”"
11354,"So there wasn’t much faith in the Hummer when we set off a few minutes later with Jordan in my passenger seat as an instructor (“I’m going to wear my fire suit”) and Ron following behind in his Subaru BRZ with a GoPro mounted to the hood. Several other drivers also decided to tag along on the track, because – let’s be honest here – you don’t turn down hot laps with a Hummer in favor of a track day sandwich and a bag of Fritos."

11356,
11357,"So how was the Hummer on the track? I think I can sum it up for you in one word: Slow. Actually, just “slow” doesn’t quite do it. Glacially slow. Pathetically slow. Insanely slow. So slow that I think we could’ve easily been passed by a 9-year-old boy with a Razor scooter and a racing helmet."
11358,"It turned out that the Hummer was going so slowly that everyone’s fears about my safety were largely unfounded. Jordan, my girlfriend, my friends – they were all worried something bad might happen. But the Hummer could hardly muster up enough speed to get into “something bad” territory. Instead, our situation would’ve been more accurately described as “residential speed limit” territory. After I maxed out at 65 miles per hour on the track’s longest straightaway, Jordan amusingly informed me that his BMW M3 race car hits 140 in the same spot."
11359,Advertisement
11360,
11361,"But don’t think for a second that I wasn’t going all-out. You’re going to watch the video and you’re going to think that I slowed down, or I was easing up to protect the Hummer, or I lowered my speed so I wouldn’t die in a giant fireball shaped like a file cabinet. But this is not the case. I was absolutely, 100 percent, balls to the wall, foot on the floor, from the moment we got out on the track. It wasn’t me that was keeping speeds down. It was the fact that the Hummer has the same horsepower as a Jetta, but weighs as much as a bowling alley."
11362,"Of course, the Hummer track experience was about more than just speed. Here’s another thing I learned about driving a Hummer on a race track: it’s absolutely terrifying. You’ve got all these cars buzzing around you, but you have no idea where any of them are, because a) your mirrors are buzzing just as much as the cars, and b) you’re driving a vehicle the size of a rural school district. So you kind of fling it into corners randomly and guess where other vehicles are located based on their sound, which is not unlike how I expect a blind person would drive a Hummer around a race track."
11363,"And then there’s braking. Before we got started, I assumed the Hummer would have so much brake fade that it would only manage about two laps before the wheels began shooting flames the size of a giant redwood. But here’s the thing: when you’re only doing about 40, you don’t really jam on the brakes. You just kind of tap them, and place the Hummer in the proper line, and hope to God you aren’t about to flatten a Miata. By the last lap, Jordan had stopped telling me to brake for most of the turns."
11364,Advertisement
11365,
11366,"Interestingly, however, I do have one piece of praise for the Hummer: cornering. Even though the Hummer has enough suspension travel to climb over a wood-paneled PT Cruiser, the damn thing managed to stay surprisingly flat in the corners. And I don’t mean “oh, the body roll was so mild that I only vomited twice afterwards.” I mean the thing stayed dead freakin’ flat, to the great surprise of me and Jordan. Later, I realized this is probably because we never got up enough speed to cause body roll."
11367,"Unfortunately, my excellent Hummer track day experience ended after only about five laps. Here’s what happened: initially, Jordan told me he could feel things getting hot on his side of the Hummer. At first, I wasn’t sure whether to believe him or infer that he was getting tired of driving around a race track in a vehicle the size of a school bus. But just a few minutes later, coolant started bubbling up over the hood, indicating that, indeed, the Hummer had enough. And so, like so many highly tuned, hugely expensive, track-prepped race cars before me, I steered over into pit lane. “You don’t have to put on your turn signal,” Jordan said."
11368,Advertisement
11369,
11370,"When we opened the hood, we discovered there was no leak, no loose hose, no giant problem with the engine. Instead, the issue was simple: the Hummer had gotten hot after five laps at full throttle, and the coolant’s expansion tank had spit up a little coolant. I breathed a sigh of relief: the Hummer wasn’t broken. It was merely saying: Stop doing this, you giant asshole."
11371,"So we did stop. We let the NASA guys get back to their track day, and we drove home to Philadelphia on the wide open highway at full throttle; pedal to the floor; maximum Hummer velocity. Along the way, we were passed by several semi trucks."
11372,"Thank you to Ron S., Jordan L., and the entire NASA Northeast region crew and participants for letting me on the track for the five most enjoyable “hot laps” of my entire life."

11465,"You might imagine the car known as the ‘Widowmaker’ to be a stripped out race car for the road, but while the 930 indeed started out as a homologation special, it was also Porsche’s top of the line model fitted with the softest carpet and leather, a sunroof, plus air-conditioning as standard."
11466,"That, the massive turbo and the intercooler under the rubber-coated whale tail made it 132 pounds heavier than the naturally-aspirated 911. Porsche tried to cure the problem of having all that extra weight in the back by using a wider rear axle ending in 245 wide tires."
11467,"Despite being a luxury gran tourer with Porsche’s legendary build quality, the Turbo borrowed quite a few bits from the VW Beetle, and its interior layout certainly needs some getting used to.

11475,"Thanks to Millennials being wholly unprepared for the disappointments they currently experience as adults, nostalgia for the 1990s is big right now. But not everything from that decade is so rosy. "
11476,"Last week when he was visiting our New York office, our man Doug DeMuro was apparently adamant that the original Mercedes ML-Class is the best vehicle ever made. He is wrong. I am not sure why a person would make such a claim. I told him to stop buying drugs from strangers on the Northeast Regional Train."
11477,"Anyway, the ML-Class was the right Mercedes for the right time, certainly. Its arrival coincided with America’s then-nascent love affair with SUVs, and helped usher in the age of the luxury SUV. "
11478,"The problem was the ML was a giant piece of shit. It’s a product of that era of Mercedes-Benz where the suits decided the whole “overengineer cars to last forever” thing was bad for business, leading to a period of abysmal quality and reliability. It took years for Mercedes to recover from the bad taste left in buyers’ mouths by the ML- and C-Class. Possibly the worst car from the worst era of Mercedes. "
11479,But maybe not the worst 1990s car. What do you think that was? 
11480,Contact the author at patrick@jalopnik.com.
11481,"I’ve never driven a vehicle in my entire life that attracts as much attention as my Nissan Skyline GT-R. It’s like driving around in the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile, except everyone thinks you’re British."
11482,"Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that’s right: the Skyline gets more attention than my Ferrari did. It gets more attention than a Lamborghini. More attention than a Lotus. More attention than you’d get if you donned a 1970s NASA space suit and took a trip down to your local Burger King in the Lunar Rover."
11483,"You’d know all about the attention my Skyline gets if you followed me on Twitter, because I occasionally send out Tweets describing the latest things people have said to me. For instance: about a month ago, a guy got up next to me in traffic, rolled down his window, and yelled: “Hey Doug, where’s your Hummer?!” This was the moment when I knew I could never again pick my nose at stoplights."
11484,"But the attention isn’t all from Jalopnik readers. When I’m on the road in the Skyline, I hear from everybody. Asian guys. Black women. Old men. Mothers with small children. Hipsters. One time, a guy walking through a historic Philadelphia neighborhood in a powdered wig and a Revolutionary War outfit flagged me down at a red light to tell me about his 240SX."
11485,"So today I’ve decided to create a little video that details exactly what people say to me, when I’m driving around in the Skyline. I’ve also decided to create a column that covers the issue in greater depth, just in case you don’t want to hear me yell “It’s a Nissan Skyline! From Japan!” to dozens of random strangers. So here goes."
11486,
11487,"The majority of people who talk to me have no idea what a Skyline is. They just can’t believe I’m driving around with the steering wheel on the wrong side of the car. What happens is, they look at the car, then they look at me, then they look at the car, then they say: Are you the Royal Baby?"
11488,Advertisement
11489,
11490,"No, I’m just kidding. They don’t always think I’m British. In reality, there are usually three types of reactions from the “Whoa, it’s right hand drive” crowd. Number one: they ask me where I got it. Number two: they want to take a picture. Or number three: they inform me that my steering wheel is on the wrong side of the vehicle. This is always done in a polite, non-intrusive manner, as if it’s an issue I should look into, like when you have something stuck in your teeth. "
11491,These conversations usually go like this:
11492,"Incredulous Person: Sir, did you know your steering wheel is on the wrong side?Me: Yes I did!Incredulous Person: How is that possible?!?Me: It was built this way! I imported it!Incredulous Person: Are you the Royal Baby?"
11493,Advertisement
11494,
11495,"I get one of these “Whoa, it’s right-hand drive” reactions at about half of the traffic lights I pull up to. Here’s what happens: first, the person looks at my car, and they see a boring old silver Nissan with a huge wing on the back, and they probably think I’m just another union longshoreman from New Jersey."
11496,"But then they glance inside, probably to see if they can get a quick SnapChat of my mullet, and they discover the truth: I’m driving on the wrong side of the car. Then they start laughing, and they roll down their window, and the conversation begins. Over the last two months, I have used the word “Japan” more than anyone in human history, including General MacArthur when he commanded the Pacific Fleet."
11497,"But here’s the funny part: it never happens if I have a passenger in the car. When I have a passenger in the car, they never seem to notice I’m on the wrong side of the interior. They just glance over, they see two people in the car, they assume we’re headed to whatever event union longshoremen attend, such as a strip club that allows open handgun carry, and then they move on with their lives."
11498,Advertisement
11499,
11500,"Of course, I’m always very nice to all these people. “It’s a Nissan Skyline!” I say. And then: “From Japan!” And then: “Yes, I imported it!” And then: “Yes, it’s weird to drive around on the wrong side of the car!” And then: “Yes, you can take a picture!”"
11501,And then I roll up my window.
11502,I expected to get a few strange looks from people who were surprised to see someone sitting on the wrong side of the car. I never expected to get noticed by so many car enthusiasts who recognize the Skyline GT-R.
11503,Advertisement
11504,
11505,"I say this because – and I’m trying to be delicate here – the Skyline looks a little dull. What I mean by this is, if I did a video where I put my Skyline next to a four-cylinder Hyundai Tiburon and asked random strangers to pick the cooler car, there would be a lot of happy people on the Hyundai forums."
11506,"But it turns out the Skyline’s bland styling is no barrier at all for enthusiasts to notice the car. On every single drive, I can count on at least a few people recognizing not only that I’m in an unusual car, but that I’m in a Skyline. I get honks from the other side of the street. Thumbs-ups from passing traffic as I sit in a turn lane. People walk up to me at stop lights and tell me they’ve always wanted a Skyline, they’ve driven it in Gran Turismo, they saw it in Fast and the Furious, and they can’t believe I have it here. Paul Walker’s name has been mentioned more than once."
11507,"And then, they all say the same thing: Isn’t that illegal?"
11508,"Yes, ladies and gentlemen: everyone thinks the Skyline is illegal. I’m not sure if they’ve heard the stories about Skylines getting crushed, or if they think it’s illegal to cruise around in a right-hand drive car – but either way, I’m always getting asked if it’s legal, as if I’m some sort of high-profile scofflaw on an NHTSA watch list."
11509,Advertisement
11510,
11511,"The funny thing is, my car is so legal that it’s geeky. We waited until it was exactly 25 years old to import it. I have all the detailed customs documentation in the glovebox. I had to get a VIN verification from a DMV employee in order to register it. I wrote a series of columns about everything you have to do to legally import an automobile. But these people think I’m a badass, so I roll with it. “Yeah, it’s illegal,” I tell them. “But I can do anything I want. I’m the Royal Baby.”"
11512,"And then there’s the camera phone contingent. I don’t always notice these people, but they’re the most common Skyline fans of all, and they come in all shapes and sizes. A bearded guy holding up traffic in a Buick LeSabre to get a picture. Two Asian kids in an Infiniti FX. A teenage boy in his grandparents’ Chevy Suburban. A middle-aged dad in a Toyota Highlander. A few weeks ago, a guy followed me around for ten minutes on a meandering path through central Philadelphia shooting video from the driver’s seat of his Infiniti QX4."
11513,Here’s another interesting surprise: not many people rev their engines at me.
11514,"Initially, I was thinking that every Tom, Dick, and Takumi in a Craigslist Civic, or a lowered Accord, or a modified Camaro would try to entice me into a street race, but it’s only happened once: about a month ago, a guy in a Cobalt SS revved at me before taking off in a glorious burst of Bush-era GM engineering. Stunningly, this took place in New Jersey."
11515,Advertisement
11516,
11517,"Here’s what I’ve learned: Most of the time, when I’m on the street next to a guy in a modified Evo or an STI, they don’t care to see which one is faster. They just want to ask me about the Skyline."
11518,"There’s also one final contingent of people who occasionally approach me: Jalopnik readers. You guys. You. The human being who’s reading this right now. Sometimes you pull up next to me at a traffic light, and you say something like: “What ever happened to that PT Cruiser?” And I get all taken aback, and I think to myself: Edward Snowden warned me about guys like you."
11519,Advertisement
11520,
11521,"No, what I actually think is, what the hell do I say in response? Last week, for instance, a guy in a Volvo XC90 V8 rolled down his window and asked if I was “that guy from Jalopnik.” The answer is, of course, yes, I am that guy from Jalopnik, unless he was referring to the guy who crashed the Camaro, which is one of the other guys from Jalopnik. Possibly Travis. So I said yes, and I laughed, and he took a photo, and we moved on with our lives."
11522,"But what I really wanted to say was that I love the Volvo XC90 V8, and I would kindly trade a drive in that for a drive in the Skyline. But you don’t say this to random people on the street, because some of them have knives."

Still, dat gap!"
11531,"This one is not just longer, but higher too as the ad says that the axles have been flipped. That means that they now sit below the springs instead of above which the ad says makes the climb-in 4-inches harder. Hopefully the pinion angles have been properly set for the added height.

Porsche, Bentley and Bugatti will be grouped together in a single unit under current Porsche boss Matthias Mueller and VW Commercial vehicles will form another division with the Scania and MAN heavy truck brands with former Daimler trucks boss Andreas Renschler in charge, Handelsblatt said."
11587,"The reorganization would overturn former VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech’s strategy of giving individual brands autonomy to encourage competition between them. Many industry watchers said Piech made VW Group difficult to control and slow to react to market changes. The group has 600,000 employees worldwide and 119 factories."
11588,"The new structure is designed to improve efficiency and make decision-making quicker, Handelsblatt said. Each business group would decide which models it sells and which markets they are sold in. The head of each holding company will sit on VW Group’s management board. Group roles such and the groupwide head of sales and marketing position held by Christoph Klingler would be eliminated."

11623,The Lazer 917 was a reasonably popular kit car back in the ‘70s and ‘80s that would let you take that old Beetle your neighbor’s kid rolled and turn it into something that looked like a Porsche 917 built by the Pep Boys while on ketamine. And this one currently for sale on Craigslist may be the best one ever.
11624,"Sure, for many people, the phrase “best Lazer 917 ever” has about as much impact as “best partially-urinated on Arby’s Hot Ham and Cheese ever.” It’s a pretty low bar. But I appreciate the Lazer 917 — if any car (or even kit car) doesn’t take itself too seriously and understands the elusive concept of “fun” the Lazer 917 is it. This particular one takes all the over-the-top ridiculousness of the 917 and then gets it drunk and crazy."
11625,"Here, just read the description of the car from the ad:"
11626,We bought a ‘64 VW with a 1600cc dual port motor and a 12V electrical system that was in amazingly good condition. This became the mechanical basis for the car. Then we added the following features:
11627,"Flame thrower - We developed a propane-based flame thrower that sticks up from the roof at about 45 degrees. While less spectacular than having flames come out the exhaust pipes, it’s also much less dangerous."
11628,"Taser hood ornament - We spotted a guy selling “stun guns” at a Tucson swap meet. Impressed by the 2” spark and the ripping sound it made, we bought one and made a hood ornament out of it."
11629,"Rear view TV camera - Since the back windshield is small, the TV camera lets us keep on eye what’s creeping up behind."
11630,"Fender skirts on all the wheels - Since using stock VW wheels and tires puts them considerably inside the fenders, we can turn the front wheels lock to lock without hitting our front skirts. A great look!"
11631,"Hovercraft look - In addition to the skirts, we hung a fringe of outdoor carpeting totally around the car making it look a bit like a hovercraft. We protect the carpet where it might scrape the road with foam, tubular pipe insulation that can be easily replaced when it becomes too frayed."
11632,"It’s street legal. We often drive it around it with the doors propped open, sort of a “bird of prey look.” Lots of people pass us with their cell phones out the window taking our pictures."

11637,"Air conditioning - Since we live in Arizona, we decided that some sort of AC was necessary. Noticing that there was lots of room under the rear fenders, we mounted a 120V, 2500W, electric generator, connected to the car’s gas tank. That’s connected to a 1 ton standard house AC unit, mounted behind the seats. There’s also a standard 120V electric wall receptacle, inside to cab for hooking up tools, etc."

11643,"They’re asking $5500. For a street-legal, cheap and easy to run and fix hypercar (don’t check) that can tase creeps and shoot flames and let you plug in your belt sander and freeze you into an ice cube as you lay back and try to drive this blue streak of insanity that also sort of resembles a hovercraft."

11649,"Yesterday, Vladimir Markin, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, proposed that an “international probe” be launched into the details of America’s Apollo moon landings. While this sounds like a wet dream for the aluminum-fedora’d set, it actually could be a really great thing for everyone, if done just right."
11650,"First, though, let’s just make a couple of things very clear: the investigation is a ridiculous bit of political hissy-fitting in retaliation for the US-led probe of corruption in FIFA, the international football association. Really. Here’s what he said he was frustrated about:"
11651,“U.S. prosecutors having declared themselves the supreme arbiters of international football affairs.”
11652,"So, as a way to retaliate, Markin suggested an international investigation into “mysteries” of the Apollo moon landings was in order. Because soccer and space exploration are, you know, basically the same thing. Markin was clear to state that the investigation wasn’t about whether or not the moon landings happened, but what happened to certain footage and lunar rocks and other artifacts:"
11653,"“We are not contending that they did not fly [to the moon], and simply made a film about it. But all of these scientific — or perhaps cultural — artifacts are part of the legacy of humanity, and their disappearance without a trace is our common loss. An investigation will reveal what happened.”"

11659,Advertisement
11660,
11661,"What Russia should do is go ahead and broaden the investigation into what everyone’s assuming it is anyway — an investigation to see if the US landed men on the moon at all, period. To finally prove this conclusively (for all the simpletons for whom all the actual proof isn’t enough) they should actually send a manned, lunar-orbiting mission to collect actual photographic evidence from a low lunar orbit of the landing sites."
11662,"This would accomplish several things: it would turn an embarrassing PR stunt into a genuinely status-raising global event. And, since it’s Russia, when they find the evidence of the landing sites, it would finally shut up the deniers — and it has to be a country like Russia to come back with the evidence, since they’d never believe anything from NASA. Finally, it would be a real victory for the Russian Space Agency — a manned translunar mission has been a Soviet/Russian goal since the late 60s, so why not check it off the list?"

11666,The Space Adventures plan uses an existing Russian Soyuz spacecraft — the same ones used to ferry astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station — and docks it with a combination hab module (for a bit of extra living room on the roughly week-long flight) and an auxiliary propulsion module with the power and fuel for a trip to lunar orbit and back.
11667,Advertisement
11668,
11669,"According to Space Adventures’ website, they say they’re ready to launch this year. It’s a viable plan, based on decades of study. It’s not even the only way to accomplish this sort of mission — in fact, in September 1968, a Soviet mission called Zond 5 was the first ever mission to launch a spacecraft around the moon and return it to earth."
11670,"Zond 5 used a reduced-mass Soyuz (they deleted the orbital module) and a more powerful launcher (Proton instead of a Soyuz rocket) to get from earth orbit all the way to the moon. The mission was a success, and even had passengers, with the one minor detail that they were turtles instead of people. People, turtles, same damn thing."
11671,Advertisement
11672,
11673,"Even a Zond-type spacecraft with a solitary cosmonaut and the right surveillance/camera equipment should be easily capable of finding at least one Apollo landing site and taking enough photographs to empirically prove that, yes, all our flags and crap are still there."
11674,"Yes, any number of robotic probes could accomplish this same thing, but that’s not the point. By giving the Russians a chance to show off a bit again and become only the second nation in history to send a person around the moon and return them home (we did it 1968, with Apollo 8) the Russians get a chance to shine in space again, and I think live-streamed commentary and video from the lunar-orbiting craft, finding the old US landing sites, would be fascinating to see."

11676,
11677,"Really, this could be great. We could take a pissy little “investigation” and turn it into something that would have a real, lasting positive impact for both the Russians and the United States. Plus, the benefit of finally being able to shut up the moon-landing deniers (I know, I know, some will always find a way to keep denying) once and for all will be so very satisfying."
11678,"I mean, we can’t all just deck these moon-landing-denying morons like Buzz Aldrin did, though we may as well watch that again, why not?"
11679,

It corners flat. It sounds amazing. It has a fuel pump that whirred merrily on our entire drive: “just put it in, two weeks ago, course it’s too much fuel pump for this little car, and I was like, what the fuck is that noise?

They fed me all day, they had a motorhome, there was a guy in there cooking restaurant-quality food—I’m talking filet mignon, shrimp, all day! And in the afternoon he comes out with a case full of Klondike bars!

11897,"Chris and his CRX were the subject of a recent Petrolicious video, aptly titled “Original Fanboy.” The peanut gallery protested—there was no way this car didn’t receive a 100-point, concours-worthy, budget-defying restoration. No way. Inconceivable."

11900,"“We’ve been up to 14,000 feet!” he defended himself. “We’ve been to Mojave before, etc. It was my daily driver for years. It’s a real car!” Chris has kept it garaged nearly every year he had it, where it shares space with an 18,000-mile 1980 Accord, a 1972 Dodge Charger that was featured in an episode of Mission: Impossible, and a 1983 Civic wagon now serves as his daily. But the CRX stands by, ever-faithful."
11901,"“It’s just ready to go. This is the second time I’ve driven it this year. Certainly too dirty.” We shot up Latigo Canyon behind a trio of snorting Corolla Sprinters, their flat-brimmed drivers going full attack. “Good job, baby,” he said, patting the dashboard. “I mean, it’s still pulling from third. I haven’t driven her this hard in years!”"
11902,"Years ago, I wrote a story reflecting the CRX as mediocrity, how I hadn’t been blown away by its 1980s-esque charms. Not underwhelmed, merely whelmed. Sitting with Chris, I expected to stand trial answering for war crimes."

11906,"But he never yelled, and he never gnashed his teeth, and by the end I got it, Capital G Got It. Both the CRX and the general air of passion throughout. I had always gotten it, I suppose. But there’s something moving about holding onto your first new car and maintaining it ever faithfully, watching other examples get rodded and rotted until they’re dime-a-dozen Craigslist junk—until its rarity becomes evident in its stock simplicity. Pristine and beautiful, forever. Call it Preservation Of The Norm. "

11917," John Williams has owned this red-striped 1972 Datsun 240Z for, oh, about twelve years now. It’s on its third motor. Its drivetrain is nearly entirely 280ZX (L28 block, F54 bottom, P90 head, late five-speed). It has a rare 3.90 limited-slip differential he found in a Nissan Competition box. It’s tail happy. It corners flat. It sounds amazing. It has a fuel pump that whirred merrily on our entire drive: “just put it in, two weeks ago, course it’s too much fuel pump for this little car, and I was like, what the fuck is that noise? But actually,” he laughed, “I’ve gotten used to it!”"
11918,"His Radio Flyer Red Datsun 510 wagon is a prizewinning gem and a crowd favorite. But it wasn’t running. “I just got a new motor for it… shit, it’ll be five years before I finish that crap.”"
11919,"But this Z? “Three motors, painted twice…just never happy with it. But this one I can drive it and not worry about it. I just drive it around, park it in the garage, and don’t do any maintenance…though I should have.”"

11922,"As we neared our final checkpoint, it became evident that perhaps John should have. Through the high, damp mountain passes, the carburetors coughed and sputtered. By the time evening fell, it began to bog in third gear. We pulled over for gas. John apologized. No worries, I said. Yeah, he guessed, it should hold."
11923,"“Few years ago,” he said, “Nissan contacted my club to see if I was stupid enough to drive out to Glendora to do a photo shoot with my car. So I went up there and they hooked my car up to a trailer, on a Nissan Frontier, and they did a whole professional shoot! They fed me all day, they had a motorhome, there was a guy in there cooking restaurant-quality food—I’m talking filet mignon, shrimp, all day! And in the afternoon he comes out with a case full of Klondike bars! So it’s the end of the day, I’m about to go home and they say, wait, wait, wait, and the guy goes into the motorhome and gives me a check for $600! "

11925,
11926,"“So a few months later I go to my Nissan dealer. And I look in the Frontier brochure—they Photoshopped my car! I couldn’t even recognize it anymore. They made it yellow, put 46 on the hood and doors, the only you can tell it’s mine is from the wheels. I told Nissan, look, if you wanted a race car—I have a race car.”"

11935,
11936,"And so, the genial, soft-spoken Vernis bought this 1970 Mazda Luce Rotary Coupe sight unseen from Toronto-based Right Drive to ship it to his native central Ohio. But first: a shakedown run, here in Los Angeles. The Luce is the only front-wheel drive rotary-engined car Mazda ever produced."

11940,"Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t run well. Its 13A triangle-spinner generates more noise than power. It started the rally choking on unkempt carburetors; it finished the rally in noisy, sputtering, fingernail-clenching tension. “How long are we gonna be on here for?” said Right Drive’s Michael Kent, as the Imperial Highway turned into the 105 Freeway."

11948,"The Bertone design, already beguiling on the sedan, is achingly beautiful in coupe form. (Its stylist was a young Giorgetto Giugiaro.) Its seats are upholstered in red velvet, the size and shape of movie theater seats, which is fitting, because one rides shotgun looking over an expansive windshield, across the center lane, tall and bolt upright. The ride is wallowy, cloudlike, nearly reminiscent of the Century’s. Nobody knows what it is, but they guess at it all day long."
11949,"For U.S.-market passengers, the view from the left-hand seat will never not be amusing. "

11954,"That night, Vernis and Mike from Right Drive limped the Luce carefully to the Petersen, up the 405 Freeway."

11956,
11957,"And the next day, at the Petersen Automotive Museum’s Japanese Cruise-In, it earned the “Petersen Perfection” award: “A car so rare and significant, that it would deserve a place on display in the museum.”"
11958,"For now, it’s still in the basement of the Petersen. But soon will come the day when Myron ships it back to Ohio, where it can reside in his eclectic car collection, along the occasional Tatra and his most famous Japanese Nostalgic Car, the Honda Coupe Nine, and continue its reign as Luce, “Lord of the Road.” "

11967,"At the Toyota Automotive Museum that evening, Joe and his son studied a pristine Mark II Supra, brown on brown, as if it was an entrance exam. “The first one I owned had the black roof too,” he mused. “Bought it new!”"
11968,"Mazda PR executive Jacob Brown snuck past the age limitation with a technical classic: a 1990 Mazda Miata, from Irvine’s secret vault, with just 40,000 miles on it. I hadn’t seen Jacob in years. We had worked together in a previous life, and it was good to be reunited: two former auto journalists, two sides of the same coin, driving around in yet another white Miata that proves my fate is sealed."

11971,"And that night, as the sky went dark and the convoy pulled off the 405 Freeway toward the Toyota Museum, Jacob put a foot on the Miata’s clutch and found that it went all the way to the floor. Another clutch casualty. He limped the Miata the remaining mile and a half, in first gear "
11972,"And as we ate dinner and received our prizes, Ben grinned into the microphone: “the newest car on the tour, and it nearly broke down!”"
11973,He gave Jacob a sticker anyway.
