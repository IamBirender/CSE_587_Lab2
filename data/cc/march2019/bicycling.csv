3048,"This small company wants to change not only where, but how, bicycles are made. Its first model—the Allied Alfa—absolutely rips."
3049,The odds have to be against them.
3050,"There are numerous reasons most bicycle manufacturing—especially for carbon-fiber frames—occurs overseas. These include cheaper cost of labor as well as proximity to the rest of the supply chain. But a new company, HIA Velo, has started making and selling high-performance carbon bikes out of Little Rock, Arkansas."
3051,"Domestic carbon fiber manufacturing isn’t unprecedented. Trek manufactures a limited number of its frames (super high-end models) in the States. Smaller builders such as Argonaut make around 100 per year. But HIA (which stands for “Handmade in America”) doesn’t intend to limit itself to boutique bikes. “We started this to get big,” says founder Tony Karklins. “We want to change the industry.”"
3052,"Karklins is qualified to venture such a lofty statement. HIA went from nothing but an idea to delivering our Allied Alfa test bike (HIA is the company, Allied is the brand, and Alfa is the model name) in just under a year, and Karklins was the founder of Orbea USA, which he helmed for 14 years. During that time he witnessed the rise of large-scale carbon-fiber manufacturing and the ensuing collapse of domestic bicycle factories that could only work with metal. “Almost overnight, the big brands weren’t producing their own bicycles anymore. I believe at that moment, the industry lost its soul. That passion for making the best, something that you love, was exchanged for sending your production to Asia for composite expertise and cheaper labor.”"
3053,"To find more expert bike reviews, check out the ."
3054,"That’s why in February 2016, Karklins (who had left Orbea two years prior) gathered a few cycling-passionate investors and purchased the carbon-fiber manufacturing machinery of the bankrupt Canadian bike maker Guru (which won a  award for its Photon road bike in 2010). He moved the equipment to Little Rock, Arkansas, attracted by its central location, budding cycling community, relatively inexpensive labor (thanks to the low cost of living), and grants from a state eager to attract new manufacturing businesses."
3055,He had the financial backing and the assets to start a large-scale domestic composite bicycle manufacturing company. But Karklins was still missing one important thing: an engineering department.
3056,"Just as Karklins was getting organized, Sam Pickman had resigned after 11 years at Specialized. As an R&D; engineering manager, he’d contributed to hugely successful, high-profile projects such as the current Roubaix, with its innovative FutureShock road-suspension system. But he’d grown dissatisfied with the bureaucracy of a big company. “I really started to believe that the best way to produce awesome product was to control the manufacturing,” he says. “That just isn’t the business model for Specialized.”"
3057,"Shortly after leaving, Pickman connected with Karklins through a mutual friend. Karklins says the timing was magical—so much so that after Pickman flew from his home in California to see the nascent HIA facility, he was so excited that he bought a house in Little Rock before he left."
3058,"“My dream has always been to control the manufacturing process,” Pickman says, “to dream something up, make the recipe, pick the ingredients, and cook the thing.” While third-party manufacturers are typically game to try new designs, explains Pickman, it is harder to get them to try new processes that could result in a higher-quality product. He grasped immediately that since HIA could control every step of development and production, engineers would be unconstrained—there’d be no manufacturing vendor to say, “Can’t do it.”"
3059,"Also, with design, development, testing, and production (including painting) under one roof, going from prototype to production can be quicker. “We are hitting production 11 months after starting from scratch,” says Pickman, who adds that it’s about half the two-year cycle common at big brands. The company’s goal is to build 1,500 to 2,000 frames in its first year of production."
3060,"Finally, HIA made business sense. “There are so many hidden costs in developing product overseas,” Pickman says. “You need large teams on the ground which means offices, HR expenses, et cetera. During a development cycle you can spend over $100,000 in travel expenses on one project. On top of those savings, wages are rising in China and Taiwan, considerably narrowing the gap between the cost to produce in the US and Asia.”"
3061,"Our preproduction Alfa was number 15 out of the molds, and the first rideable sample. The layup in production versions (expected to launch in March 2017) will be slightly different, but HIA says the ride will be similar."
3062,"The Alfa is a race bike, with geometry to match, and an emphasis on stiffness over compliance with oversize tubes and beefy junctions. It is a medium-modulus frame, but still light if it hits its expected 875 grams in size 56cm. Two versions of the frame will be available: the Alfa that I tested, and the Alfa i, which will be made with higher-grade carbon and is likely to be lighter, stiffer, and pricier. Both will come in two options, with a 20mm difference in head-tube height. I tested a 56cm; the one with the taller head tube will be called 56+. I prefer a lot of drop from saddle to bar and the fit felt natural."
3063,"The Alfa has a threaded BSA bottom bracket, 27.2mm seatpost, and a stylish and clever badge-style emblem (shaped like an eagle) on the top of the down tube. This emblem is swappable, allowing it to serve as the port for internally routed cables , or simply as a cool design detail in a version without holes if you run electronic shifting."
3064,"The Alfa frameset is $2,500, with complete bikes ranging from $3,900 to $7,500 and up (for add-ons). Bikes will be sold direct to consumer and through a limited number of smaller specialty shops. In addition to custom paint, buyers can choose options and upgrades in stems, bars, saddles, wheels, drivetrains, and power meters. Our tester, with SRAM Red eTap and upgrades such as a Fi’zi:k R1 carbon bar and Mavic Ksyrium Pro Carbon wheels, would cost $8,795—for what you get, competitive with mass-produced bikes from the big brands. (The bike shown in the photographs has the same bar and wheels, but is built with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 and costs $9,320.)"
3065,"Based on about a dozen test rides, I can say that the bike is also competitive in terms of performance with the best in its category. This is no open-mold, cookie-cutter frame with a generic ride. Pickman is a huge fan of the Specialized Tarmac race bike, and its influence can be felt in this bike. The Alfa is quick to change direction, eager to accelerate, and fun to ride aggressively. Stiffness, particularly through the front of the bike, is superb and evident during sprinting and hard cornering. There’s no wind-up when you’re out of the saddle sawing at the handlebar or loading the bike hard at the exit of a sharp corner."
3066,"The biggest surprise compared with other bikes in this class is the muted ride quality. The way the Alfa isolates the rider from the road is contradictory to a typical race bike experience, more similar to how you feel on endurance-focused models. It might be too quiet for riders who relish road feedback, but many will appreciate not being worn down by continual input (particularly on long rides). The resistance to chatter keeps the bike planted and predictable-feeling in corners, even on deteriorated pavement."
3067,"We like the story of HIA, but it wouldn’t mean anything if we hadn’t also liked the bike. That sentiment—it all comes down to the ride—is something Pickman agrees with. “When Tony and I started talking, one thing we agreed on is the ‘made in America’ story doesn’t mean shit if the product doesn’t back it up,” he says. “We truly believe that the way we’re going about this is technologically better than what anyone else is doing.”"
3068,"Price: $8,795 as testedWeight: 15.1 lb (56cm)"

3081,"Finally, HIA made business sense. “There are so many hidden costs in developing product overseas,” Pickman says. “You need large teams on the ground which means offices, HR expenses, et cetera. During a development cycle you can spend over $100,000 in travel expenses on one project. On top of those savings, wages are rising in China and Taiwan, considerably narrowing the gap between the cost to produce in the US and Asia.”"
3082,"Our preproduction Alfa was number 15 out of the molds, and the first rideable sample. The layup in production versions (expected to launch in March 2017) will be slightly different, but HIA says the ride will be similar."
3083,"The Alfa is a race bike, with geometry to match, and an emphasis on stiffness over compliance with oversize tubes and beefy junctions. It is a medium-modulus frame, but still light if it hits its expected 875 grams in size 56cm. Two versions of the frame will be available: the Alfa that I tested, and the Alfa i, which will be made with higher-grade carbon and is likely to be lighter, stiffer, and pricier. Both will come in two options, with a 20mm difference in head-tube height. I tested a 56cm; the one with the taller head tube will be called 56+. I prefer a lot of drop from saddle to bar and the fit felt natural."
3084,"The Alfa has a threaded BSA bottom bracket, 27.2mm seatpost, and a stylish and clever badge-style emblem (shaped like an eagle) on the top of the down tube. This emblem is swappable, allowing it to serve as the port for internally routed cables , or simply as a cool design detail in a version without holes if you run electronic shifting."
3085,"The Alfa frameset is $2,500, with complete bikes ranging from $3,900 to $7,500 and up (for add-ons). Bikes will be sold direct to consumer and through a limited number of smaller specialty shops. In addition to custom paint, buyers can choose options and upgrades in stems, bars, saddles, wheels, drivetrains, and power meters. Our tester, with SRAM Red eTap and upgrades such as a Fi’zi:k R1 carbon bar and Mavic Ksyrium Pro Carbon wheels, would cost $8,795—for what you get, competitive with mass-produced bikes from the big brands. (The bike shown in the photographs has the same bar and wheels, but is built with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 and costs $9,320.)"
3086,"Based on about a dozen test rides, I can say that the bike is also competitive in terms of performance with the best in its category. This is no open-mold, cookie-cutter frame with a generic ride. Pickman is a huge fan of the Specialized Tarmac race bike, and its influence can be felt in this bike. The Alfa is quick to change direction, eager to accelerate, and fun to ride aggressively. Stiffness, particularly through the front of the bike, is superb and evident during sprinting and hard cornering. There’s no wind-up when you’re out of the saddle sawing at the handlebar or loading the bike hard at the exit of a sharp corner."
3087,"The biggest surprise compared with other bikes in this class is the muted ride quality. The way the Alfa isolates the rider from the road is contradictory to a typical race bike experience, more similar to how you feel on endurance-focused models. It might be too quiet for riders who relish road feedback, but many will appreciate not being worn down by continual input (particularly on long rides). The resistance to chatter keeps the bike planted and predictable-feeling in corners, even on deteriorated pavement."
3088,"We like the story of HIA, but it wouldn’t mean anything if we hadn’t also liked the bike. That sentiment—it all comes down to the ride—is something Pickman agrees with. “When Tony and I started talking, one thing we agreed on is the ‘made in America’ story doesn’t mean shit if the product doesn’t back it up,” he says. “We truly believe that the way we’re going about this is technologically better than what anyone else is doing.”"

3093,"The Advanced Disc I tested has a slightly heftier carbon frame than the Advanced SL 0 and sits at the lowest end of the disc line. At 18.5 pounds, and outfitted with Giant Conduct hydraulic disc brakes, it’s no featherweight. Still, the way it jumps, surges, and climbs reminded me how much I once loved racing—before training took a toll and I fizzled out. It accelerated quickly during sprints, like it had more to give. And on climbs, the mixed Shimano Ultegra/105 drivetrain (50/34, 11-32) gave me the gearing I needed to spin uphill at a comfortable cadence. I also gained the confidence to ride more aggressively and take corners hotter than usual—the bike responded well to tiny hip twitches."
3094,"If you’re serious about winning races and have an easy 10 grand to drop, you might want to consider the highest-end Langma. I just want a bike that will inspire me to line up at the start. The Advanced Disc is that bike."

3130,"Due to its low-profile frontal area, Speedplay’s Zero already lays claim to the title of “most aerodynamic pedal system”—an advantage of up to 33 seconds per hour compared with a Look or Shimano road pedal.

3131,"Say goodbye to chain slap, gravel adventurers"
3132,"Shimano’s latest addition to the Ultegra line features a part that might be more familiar to mountain bikers—a clutch mechanism. Originally developed to eliminate chainslap on mountain drivetrains, the new Ultegra RD-RX800/RD-RX805 rear derailleur, first seen at last weekend's Tour of Flanders, brings clutch technology to the road. "
3133,"The clutch mechanism is designed to stop the rear derailleur from bouncing on rough terrain, but can be disengaged with the push of a button to let the derailleur swing freely (useful for wheel changes). The clutch system keeps chain tension consistent, helps mitigate chain slap, and lessens your chance of dropping a chain."
3134,"Some gravel riders have used a combination of road shifters and mountain bike Di2 derailleurs to get the range and chain tension ideal for mixed terrain—but these set ups had to be run with a single front ring. Ultegra RX offers two-by compatibility with an integrated, cleaner look."
3135,"Shimano’s Wayne Stetina described the new derailleur as “specifically designed for gravel and rough pavement use.” The new RD-RX800/RD-RX805 rear derailleurs, for mechanical and Di2 systems respectively, be compatible with cassettes from 11-28 to 11-34, and existing 11-speed shifters. "
3136,"The clutch mechanism adds about 38g to the derailleur, which might decrease the battery life on electronic groups a little. Keep in mind that Shimano’s Di2 groups have a battery life of several months. Like all Di2 derailleurs of the newest generation, the Ultegra RX model also lets riders program how many shifts are actuated with a single button push, as well as which button actuates which derailleur."
3137,"Shimano currently lists the derailleurs as $109.99 for the mechanical model and $284.99 for the Di2 electronic model, an increase of $10 and $20 respectively compared to the standard models. The Ultegra RX and RD derailleurs will be available mid-June."
3138,Get the gear this polar explorer uses to stay ultra-comfortable in the world's harshest environments
3139,"Dog musher, polar explorer, and environmental activist Eric Larsen is a lover of extremes. Known for completing expeditions to the North and South poles, as well as the summit of Everest in under a year, he also briefly held the world record for miles ridden on a bike in Antarctia (355) before it was broken by Daniel Burton (730). Both riders were attempting to reach the South pole from the coast of Antarctica; Larsen had to abort his trip."
3140,"Now Larsen guides select clients on fat bike expeditions around the world, and continues to use his platform to raise awareness of the changing climate in the world's most remote places. We caught up with him between expeditions to talk about how he survives for weeks in the Antarctic on a Fat Bike. "
3141,"The most important lesson Larsen imparts to his clients is how to do the ""Polar Striptease,"" which involves taking layers on and off continuously as you ride, in order to manage perspiration in the punishingly cold temperatures. In Antarctica the mercury usually hovers around -20F in January, when bike expeditions typically take place (and that's before windchill). "
3142,"“If your skin is wet, you lose your ability to insulate, and you get colder much quicker,"" Larsen said. ""In any sort of extreme situation, we have to maintain the equilibrium and balance of being able to move forward and not sweat too much."" That's where the layers come in."
3143,"To stay dry in any weather, Larsen packs multiple pairs of Helly Hansen Baselayers in light and heavy weights, as well as hard and softshell options for his outer layers—similar to what you'd see a mountaineer wearing. Larsen also makes sure to have multiple layers for his hands and feet, including four pairs of socks, glove liners, two-layer mittens, down mittens, and pogies."
3144,"
"
3145,
3146,"The next challenge to pulling off a polar fat bike expedition is managing the weight of your bike and gear. “One of the main factors with fat bikes in winter is the weight,"" Larsen said. A heavy bike not only requires more energy to pedal, but can get bogged down in soft snow. (Most of the traveling surface cyclists encounter in Antarctica has been compacted by the wind, but there can be sustained soft spots, especially if weather moves in.)"
3147,"Unfortunately, as anyone who’s camped in cold weather knows, you need to pack more of everything to survive. On his first attempt to bike to the South Pole, Larsen’s bike weighed 120 pounds. Now he's whittled his setup down to about half that weight, thanks to some key developments in lightweight gear. "
3148,"
"
3149,
3150,"While weight is certainly one of the biggest factors when packing for an arctic fat biking trip, it’s not the only factor, says Larsen. Having a super comfortable camp setup every night is key to putting in the big miles during the day."
3151,"“To [ride] continuously, your clothes need to be dry, and you need to be well rested,"" said Larsen. “These longer-style trips are death by 1,000 cuts... at a certain point, comfort is survival.” "
3152,"
"
3153,
3154,
3155,"“With the carbon bikes and some of the newer technologies, we don’t worry about mechanicals as much,” Larsen says, but he adds that “I’ve always been under the mindset that everything’s gonna break at some point.” To that end he brings a repair kit for clothing, bike tools, and some key spare parts, like a spare chain and derailleur hanger. "
3156,"In cases like the Lauf fork on his expedition rig, he sometimes chooses more analog parts that are less likely to cause problems over long distances in extremely cold temperatures. He's even done things like replace bearing grease with oil, and tubeless tire sealant with tubes, to avoid any complications with freezing."
3157,"One fat-bike specific piece of gear he's always sure to pack: a tire gauge. Because of the huge tires, “the difference of one psi has a big impact on riding ability,” says Larsen. “Take the time [to check], and you'll use less energy, and be traveling faster overall.”"
3158,"
"
3159,
3160,"It might seem like an overwhelming task just to assemble the right gear for a fat bike expedition, but Larsen said that's what he enjoys most: ""it’s kind of a chess game… your layering, your food, how fast you can pedal, those all have a direct impact on the quality of your trip,” Larsen explains. "
3161,"Polar bike packing opens up opportunities to do unique trips to places people might not know about. “In many ways this is exploration in the 21st century,” he said. “The world has been mapped, but trying to find new styles in which to travel poses unique problems to solve.”"
3162,"""I also just love bikes,"" he adds. "

3166,"Probably the only good decision I ever made for my bodily health as a bike messenger was to mount a Wald 157 Giant Delivery Basket to my fixed-gear handlebar to give my spine a little messenger-bag relief. At the time, I worried that adding a basket was a sign of weakness—an admission I should retire from lugging my weight in heavy packages all over town and just start cruising on a recumbent. But the Wald 157 revived my enthusiasm for the job and enabled me to haul more documents than I ever had before. After all, there’s a reason this old-school, metal stalwart has been beloved by bike delivery folks since classic paperboy times: It’s one of the simplest, cheapest, and burliest bike baskets around.  "
3167,"With generous dimensions (20 x 15 x 9 inches) and secure mounts, the Wald 157 is a top option for carting supersize loads on the front of your bike. And the best part is, mounting the basket is easy: It shouldn’t take you more than 10 minutes, with a multitool, to install it. The basket attaches to your handlebar with extended clamps, so it won’t get in the way of your hands. And it uses sturdy, metal legs to connect with your axle or, for bikes with quick-release front hubs, fork eyelets. Two metal holes in the legs offer adjustability.   "

(Plus, there’s nothing like dropping someone on a climb when you’re on a beat-up-basket bike.) Although Wald doesn’t specify a weight for carrying capacity, I recommend adding a rear rack for anything heavier than 15 pounds.   "
3170,"To this day, I’m still rocking the Wald 157 on my commuter bike, though now it’s more often filled with extra layers or a case of beer. Sure, it might not be as stylish as some other basket options, but it has a classic design that brings to mind old-timey newsboys and a certain function-over-fashion coolness. Wald has been making bicycle tools in the US since 1905, so the company knows what it's doing. I have a feeling my 14-year-old basket will outlive me, it’s so bombproof and dependable.   "

3183,"Plump Tires Can up Your Adventures The double-butted, chromoly steel–frame Marin Nicasio RC has a lot going for it, including low-maintenance internal gearing and the necessary mounts to outfit it with front and rear racks, but the one thing that really pushes this bike into multiuse territory is its ability to forgo the easy route for the more exciting one. The smooth-rolling, high-volume, 650x47mm WTB Horizon Road Plus tires are slick down the center, with a herringbone outer tread. The Nicasio RC also accepts 700x40mm tires.  "
3184,"Test Impressions Before I even knew what the Nicasio RC was capable of, I was drawn to it for its aesthetics—that sparkly metallic blue paint, the matching fenders with rubber mudflaps, those retro gumwall tires! An uncomplicated, sturdy, steel frame with a dropped seat stay, skinny tubes, and fat tires. Jaw-dropping!"

3186,"I took the Nicasio RC on road, gravel, and dirt, over an open-grate bridge, down a grassy hill, and up a long, gradual climb. In every instance, the 47mm-wide tires provided a smooth-rolling ride at a steady pace. The swept-back handlebar put me in a comfortable, slightly upright position ideal for casual rolls through town. Yet it was still aggressive enough that I could muscle the bike into turns and up hills. For most situations, the 8-speed drivetrain sufficed, though on one particularly steep climb, I had to sweat pretty hard to reach the top."
3187,"As enjoyable as the bike is to ride, I did experience a few minor or easy to fix issues—more on the order of wearing brown shoes with a black belt, noticeable but not catastrophic. The MircoShift 8-speed thumb shifter felt a bit unnatural in my hand—the more I clicked through gears, though, the less I paid any mind to it. On the contrary, the basket-weave grips grew more painful in my palms as the ride progressed—nothing a grip swap or wearing gloves couldn’t fix. And if this were my bike, I’d splurge for a black DLC Spurcycle bell in favor of the brass one that the bike comes with.  "
3188,"For anyone who wants a bike that’s stylish AF, loves the simplicity of a classic steel frame, wants the benefits of plus-size tires, and appreciates the low maintenance that comes with an internal drivetrain, the Marin Nicasio RC is just the thing to fill that spot in your mudroom."
3189,"Light and nimble, it’s ready for mud—and much more"
3190,"’Cross is a unique beast. The race season is short and intense, and you need a dedicated bike and lots of specialized equipment. It can seem like a money sink unless you can use the bike the rest of the year: gravel rides, all-weather commutes, adventures over varying terrain. "
3191,Enter Trek’s Crockett. 
3192,"Based around a 300-series Alpha alloy frame—Trek’s premium grade aluminum—and full carbon fork paired with an SRAM Force 1 1x11 group, the Crockett felt light and nimble when I had it out on the course. The 40t chainring combined with the 11-32 cassette offers the gearing range for just about any racecourse. The frame shares similar geometry to the Boone, Trek’s full carbon cyclocross bike, with sharp handling that lets the pilot place the bike where it needs to be in slippery, wild terrain. "
3193,"And with gobs of room at the fork and both sets of rear stays, it offers some of the most generous mud clearance on the market. This same clearance allows it to comfortably accept up to 40mm tires for other adventures. The Crockett is finished off with reliable Bontrager alloy components and carbon seatpost."
3194,"About the only upgrade I’d make is swapping out the alloy, tubeless-ready wheels with a set of lighter race wheels for competition if you’re racing at a high level; otherwise the Crockett is ready to go straight off the showroom floor."
3195,"Want a singlespeed? The Crockett can be converted elegantly while maintaining ultraclean lines: Sliding rear Stranglehold dropouts allow chain tensioning. Cable routing is internal through the main triangle, and from the BB shell on to the rear derailleur, it’s external with simple slits in the right chainstay for holding housing to the frame with zip-ties."
3196,"Outside the race tape, the Crockett damps vibrations while offering plenty of power transfer and never feeling flexy; and that big tire clearance allows you to choose among a bevy of dirt-road-worthy tires. You can also fit two water bottles in the frame for extended days in the saddle. Trek’s Crockett is an exceptional value, no matter how you slice it, but perhaps especially if you consider that its range goes well beyond the race season."

3202,"When the glasses are in not in the fog-fighting position, the multifunctional nosepiece causes the frame to sit slightly further out from your face than many sunglasses, which also increases airflow below the lens. Additional padding on the nosepiece makes the Flight Jackets feel more comfortable than similar frames. "
3203,Lots of Style and Features
3204,"At first glance, the Flight Jacket looks like the next generation of Jawbreaker, but it is quite different. Aside from the new nosepiece, there is no frame above the brow, which gives you a larger field of view when your head is tilted down while riding. The overall look is pretty cool, if you’re into that throwback-yet-ironically-futuristic aesthetic. As one of our testers put it: ""You have to wear them like you mean it.""  "
3205,"The consensus on the group rides I tested them on was that they looked good and are nearly indistinguishable from the Jawbreaker to an untrained eye. If you’re into a more classic frame, these may not be for you. And unlike the interchangeable lens of Jawbreaker, the Flight Jacket is designed to allow a lens to be removed but is not optimal for switching them out frequently."
3206,Fit and Lens Options
3207,"The glasses are available with Oakley’s PRIZM lenses, which filter light and fine-tune colors to enhance detail. PRIZM Polarized and photochromic lenses also are available. In total, Oakley offers eight lens and frame combinations to choose from. Flight Jackets also include a set of interchangeable arms in a shorter length, which I opted for to better fit my face and helmet. You have to snap them on and off, so I did this before the ride. It's a good idea to play around with them first because when you pull the nosepiece toggle, the arms shift and may interfere with your helmet. "
3208,"Due to the extra features, these glasses feel slightly heavier than the Jawbreaker and a lot heavier than minimal glasses like the EVZero. That said, the added comfort helps. I tested them on road and gravel where, despite some gnarly terrain, they stayed secure and didn’t bounce up and down on my face. If you regularly ride with a cap, you won't benefit from the extended field of vision. But if not, you'll likely enjoy the the larger lens."
3209,Flight Jacket Ride Testing
3210,"Getting the hang of the fog-prevention switch is a little tricky. I’d recommend practicing it a few times off the bike before attempting to use it on a ride, but once you're acclimated, the switch is easy to operate with one hand while riding. And sure enough, when fog starts to creep up on the lenses, a quick pull clears it away. In the past, I would have been forced to take my glasses off and stow them in my helmet until things cooled down. "
3211,"In addition to the Flight Jacket, Oakley also developed a similar model, the Field Jacket (from $223 at Sportrx.com), which has the same airflow innovation, but with a dual lens for athletes who need a prescription option. "
3212,"Overall, the Flight Jacket works exactly as intended. If you've rarely had to deal with your glasses fogging, then it's probably not worth the investment for you. But if you find that fog is constantly plaguing your rides, you live in an area with unpredictable weather and tough climbs, or you simply love having the latest gear with all the bells and whistles, then the Flight Jacket is a good bet. (And if you roll up to the group ride wearing them, expect all your ride friends to ask to try them on.)"

3214,"The stout Bomber Z1 is a long-travel, single-crown fork for big-mountain riding and enduro racing"
3215,"Price: $699Weight: 5 lb. (160mm 29er, uncut steerer)Use: Trail, enduro"
3216,"In the mid-'90s, a new kind of mountain biker began to emerge. Instead of racing–which up to this point had been seen as the highest level of the sport–these riders were challenging themselves by pushing the limits of what was rideable while adding elements of style and flow reminiscent of skateboarding, surfing, and big-mountain snow sports. They became known as freeriders, and they needed equipment that was different from the race-influenced products that populated the marketplace."
3217,"In 1997, Marzocchi was one of the first companies to respond with a suspension fork it called the Bomber Z1. Compared with other single-crown suspension forks of the time, the Z1 had enormous travel (four inches). It was huge, heavy, overbuilt, and–with its coil springs (1997’s air springs were nothing like today’s smooth, low-friction air springs)  and open-bath oil dampers–absurdly plush. But it worked for the new style of riding (and was, in comparison, extremely durable and reliable) and helped usher in a fundamental change not only to the equipment we use, but also to the way we ride bikes. Today’s trail and enduro products are direct descendants of the movement that the Z1 helped fuel. "
3218,"The other suspension companies were slow to respond–I remember a representative of one telling me that a four-inch single-crown was “impossible”–but eventually, they did. Marzocchi had a few good years, but when the other companies caught up, it couldn’t maintain its momentum. (Fox entering the fork market in 2001 hurt Marzocchi as well.) Things went pear shaped for Marzocchi, which led to the suspension division being acquired by Tenneco in 2008. Under Tenneco, the Marzocchi mountain bike line largely sat dormant, and in 2015 it sold the assets of Marzocchi’s mountain bike product line to Fox. "
3219,"And that’s how we got to the product you see here: a new Marzocchi Bomber Z1, as imagined by Fox."
3220,RELATED: The Best Mountain Bikes of 2018
3221,"The Original Bomber Z1, ReimaginedThe 2019 Bomber Z1 is a spiritual successor to the 1997 version. Built on a healthy 36mm platform, the new Z1 is a long-travel, single-crown fork built for big-mountain trail riding and enduro racing. Technology and rider tastes have changed in the 21 years since the first Z1 appeared, so the new fork uses an air spring (a Float EVOL borrowed from Fox) and a cartridge damper (called GRIP, also borrowed from Fox), and has the controlled ride of a modern, high-performance fork (the 1997 Z1’s ride would likely be considered undersprung and underdamped by today’s standards). Though it relies heavily on Fox technologies, the Z1 isn’t just a different color 36; it has unique lowers and a combination of features not offered in the 36 line, which helps push the cost down a bit. "
3222,"Two Wheel Sizes, Two Colors, Nine Travel OptionsAt this time, the Z1 is available only with the damper and spring combination reviewed here. However, it's offered in  several versions: one for a 27.5-inch wheel in 150 to 180mm of travel (in 10mm increments) and one for a 29-inch wheel in 130 to 170mm of travel (in 10mm increments).  The longest-travel forks for 27.5 and 29 have a gloss-red finish; all other travels are matte black. The fork is offered only with a 1⅛- to 1½-inch tapered steerer and 110x15mm front thru-axle. At this time, a single offset is offered per wheel size: 44mm for 27.5-inch and 51mm for 29-inch. "
3223," Simple Suspension Setup, Excellent PerformanceOn the spring side, the Z1 uses the same Float EVOL (extra volume) air spring with self-charging negative spring that's found on 2018 Fox 34 and 36 forks. Like the spring curves on those forks, the Z1's can be tuned by adding clip-on air-volume spacers–more spacers equals a more progressive feel, fewer means more linear. The Z1 has dedicated air-volume spacers (the ones on the Fox 36 are not compatible)."
3224,"On the damper side, you'll find what Fox calls a GRIP Sweep. The GRIP was designed by Fox to be a lower-cost alternative to its high-end FIT4 damper. Like the FIT4, the GRIP is a cartridge damper, but it uses a spring-backed independent floating piston (IFP) instead of an expandable bladder, has a simpler valve architecture, and is self-bleeding (which speeds up assembly in the factory). Though “simpler” than a FIT4, the GRIP is still an IFP-backed cartridge damper with shim-stack valving, an advanced design that is capable of excellent performance. “Sweep” refers to the detent-free compression-adjustment knob on top of the damper leg that can be set anywhere in its 180-degree rotation range. Turned clockwise, it increases damping, eventually reaching near lockout. "
3225,"Test ImpressionsI installed a 160mm 29er Bomber Z1 on the front of my Trek Slash 9.9, happily noting a seamless color match. Setup was easy, which is one of the benefits to a simpler fork without high- and low-speed, external damping adjustments. The air pressure and rebound settings recommended by Marzocchi for my weight were pretty accurate. I twiddled the compression knob as I rode and found that I preferred to keep it set about a third of a turn from open. I did note that, without detents, it was prone to inadvertent adjustments, such as random twists by trail-side branches."
3226,"From the start, I noticed that the Z1 is a stout fork. As it turns out, the standard chassis meets e-bike certification, which makes it a bit stiffer than a standard Fox 36 (also a stiff fork)."
3227,"Performance of the Float EVOL air spring is as impressive on the Z1 as it is on the latest Fox 34 and 36 forks. Breakaway friction is effectively nonexistent, spring support doesn’t disappear midstroke, and with the clip-on spacers, I was able to tune in progression to my liking."
3228,"The GRIP damper’s performance was also impressive. Though considered simpler than the more intricate FIT4, it always offered excellent control and support in a variety of terrain and conditions. On single hits, the GRIP seems to work as well as a FIT4, though the FIT4 may have a slight advantage in control and support over successive medium to large bumps. The GRIP's sensitivity and front-end traction were especially good, though I suspect the EVOL air spring plays a role in this as well."
3229,"The GRIP works so well that it's hard for me to call the FIT4 a better damper, or even say that the two feel much different. I didn’t have the equipment to do a formal back-to-back comparison, but my sense is that when both forks are set to the lightest compression tune, the GRIP is slightly more sensitive and lively. "
3230,"But this Z1 is so stout, rides so well, and is such a good (comparative) value, that I’d hesitate to encourage anyone to lay out the extra cash for the FIT4 damper and Kashima Coat stanchions of a Fox Factory 36 (the 36 with the GRIP2 damper is another story, however). The 2019 Z1 is certainly not as groundbreaking as the 1997 Z1, but it offers the modern trail and enduro rider excellent performance at a fair price."
3231,New tech makes this one of the best feeling and most adjustable long-travel forks we've tested
3232,"Price: $1,065 (as tested)Weight: 4.6 lb. (160mm, 29-inch version)Use: Trail, enduro"
3233,"Ever since its introduction in 2005, the Fox 36 has been a class-leading fork for riders who want a burly chassis without a massive weight penalty. Over the past few years, Fox has made incremental changes to the platform, updating the damper to improve the ride and most recently adding the Float EVOL air spring. Those tweaks have kept the 36 at the top of the wishlist for enduro and aggressive trail riders. For 2019 Fox is giving the fork an all new FIT GRIP2 damper, which has more adjustability and even better performance on the trail. (Fox will continue to offer a version with the older FIT4 damper.) And for riders who use every millimeter of travel, there’s more good news. The new 36 gets a travel increase up to 170mm for 29-inch wheels and 180mm for 27.5-inch wheels. "
3234,"Versions for All the Wheel SizesThe new 36 with GRIP2 damper doesn’t care what size wheels you run. It comes in versions that fit 29, 27.5, and 26-inch hoops (the GRIP2 damper will also be used in Fox’s dual-crown 40 downhill fork). Fox also makes two versions with the GRIP2 damper. The top-of-the-line Factory fork comes with the extra-slippery Kashima-coated stanchions and costs $1,065. The slightly less expensive ($973) Performance Elite option has black anodized stanchions. The new 36 also has several offset options: For 27.5-inch wheels there are 37 or 44 millimeter versions; offsets for 29-inch wheels are 44 or 51 millimeters. Fox is moving away from its original blue and gray graphic packages and this new fork comes in two color options: black and gloss orange."
3235,"Getting a Handle on the GRIP2 DamperThe big story here is the new FIT GRIP2 cartridge, which features an entirely new design with four-way external adjustment: high- and low-speed compression damping, and high- and low-speed rebound damping."
3236,"Things get really interesting when you look at the rebound side of the damper. The high-speed circuit employs a new patent-pending Variable Valve Control (VCC) design. This valve is essentially a leaf spring, and the external adjuster changes the bending point of the spring. According to Fox, adjusting this valve creates an effect similar to a complete revalve of the shim stack (a pro-level mod that requires tearing apart the fork)–when you turn the adjuster, the damping changes progressively, and the damping force is consistent from the beginning to the end of the stroke. Most riders will feel an improvement over the old design, which produces more initial damping force (to slow the fork’s return rate) but then a gradual increase in speed which creates a sort of a trap-door effect that feels less consistent as the fork returns to its original position. "
3237,"On the compression side, the GRIP2’s basic architecture is similar to the previous version: a shimmed piston (a very common damper design: it’s used in Fox’s Float shocks and other products). However, Fox engineers reduced shaft and seal friction to improve overall smoothness and small-bump performance. The new damper also gets a larger piston and more oil volume, which improves consistency, especially on more demanding terrains where the fork is  getting hammered. The new version also gets a cool little mid-valve—a secondary damper that allows engineers to really fine tune fork performance in certain situations. "
3238,"Finally, users will find a wider range of compression adjustments. That is especially valuable for lighter and heavier riders, who often reported that a fork’s performance declined at the far reaches of its compression-adjustment limits."
3239,"A New Floating Piston Keeps Thing Slippery and ConsistentThe FIT GRIP2 uses a spring-backed internal floating piston, also known as an IFP, as a volume compensator. To understand its value, a quick intro to damper design helps: When you hit a bump, the fork’s damper rod moves into the fork chassis, which is filled with oil to slow the compression. The rod’s movement displaces oil, which needs someplace to go. In the GRIP2, that oil pushes against an IFP, which slows the oil movement for better control, and also prevents air from rushing into the damper to fill the void—fork’s begin to fade if too many air bubbles mix with the oil."
3240,"The previous RC2 used a tightly sealed expanding bladder as a volume compensator, and two different fluids inside the fork leg: one for the damper, and one for the fork’s internal lubrication. But the lubricating fluid could get sucked into the damper over time, altering the makeup of the damping fluid and changing the fork’s performance. With the GRIP2’s IFP design, Fox uses the same fluid for lubrication and damping and designed the fork to recirculate small amounts of fluid from the damper to the lubrication system. You get a more consistent fork movement that requires less regular maintenance."
3241,"Another clever detail: A small teardrop-shaped dimple on the IFP shaft purges excess fluid when the fork reaches the end of its stroke. That prevents the damper from overfilling, which can stop the fork compression before it hits full travel, which you absolutely don’t want when slamming into a rock or landing nose-heavy off a drop. This design allows Fox to use a looser fitting main shaft seal, which further reduces friction so the fork feels more supple on the trail."
3242,"Our Ride ImpressionsIn back-to-back comparisons with a 2018 FOX 36 RC2, the new 36 with a FIT GRIP2 damper was noticeably superior, especially on rocky trails with hard, G-out hits. It felt more composed, plusher, and the front end of the bike was more predictable because of it."
3243,"Overall, the new damper seems to offer a quieter ride with less feedback, which leads to better traction. Test riders also noticed that increasing compression damping seemed to add support, but without increasing harshness, which can happen on some other forks. This allows you to tune in the type of ride you prefer–from plush and comfortable to something more supportive —without sacrificing much sensitivity. "
3244,"For some riders, navigating high- and low-speed rebound adjustments can be a pain because it makes the fork more challenging to set up properly. (Fox does provide recommended base tunes, which, according our testing, are a good starting point). But the benefit comes from the expanded range of rider-adjustable fine tuning. For riders who are willing to put in the work (riding the same section of trail over and over again while making small adjustments) this should result in a better overall ride. This is especially valuable to riders at the higher and lower ends of the weight curve and anyone who likes to tinker with their setup to get their ideal performance. "

With a carbon frame and fork, Shimano 105 components, and dual thru-axles, the Comp Carbon is the fastest, lightest bike in the ultraversatile Haanjo line. As with all Haanjos, the Comp Carbon also has endurance geometry with a relaxed head-tube angle, and plenty of mounts for bike-packing bags and racks, but it can operate as a road bike if you change out the wide, 700x40mm knobby tires.  "
3248,"What’s New for 2018? The entire Haanjo line will be revamped for summer 2018, and the naming convention will change to 1–7, with the Haanjos 1–4 being made from aluminum and Haanjos 5–7 having carbon frames."
3249,"The Great Big Haanjo FamilyWith more than 10 bikes in its line, including commuter bikes, city bikes, gravel racers, and bikes that can do all three with equal talent, the Haanjo family is one of the most versatile in Diamondback’s stable. From a $300 commuter (the Haanjo Metro) to a $2,200 Dirty Kanza–ready race bike (the Haanjo Comp Carbon), all Haanjos share a relaxed geometry, clearance for wider tires, and multiple mounting options. "
3250,"This model has a lightweight carbon frame and Shimano 105 parts and sits at the top of the Haanjo line, just above the offbeat, touring-oriented Carbon EXP ($1,800), in price. Haanjos with aluminum alloy frames come in five different models, from the base-level Haanjo Metro commuter bike, to the Haanjo Tero, the Haanjo Comp, and the Haanjo Trail—all of which are designed to be versatile enough to handle commuting, road riding, and gravel grinding."
3251,"A Carbon Bike That Can Go AnywhereThe lightweight carbon Haanjo Comp Carbon has endurance geometry and a 70-degree relaxed head-tube angle, so it’s surprisingly comfortable for 100-mile gravel rides. The FSA Gossamer Compact crank (46/36T) and Shimano 105 11-speed cassette (11-32T) will help you float to the top of fire roads, and the TRP Spyre mechanical disc brakes bring you to a quick stop on the way down. Dual sealed-cartridge hubs held in with thru-axles add precision to the ride and consistency to your stopping, and the abundance of mounts on the frame and fork give you plenty of options for bottles, racks, and bags."

3254,"For years, road cyclists looking for a new bike at a low price have had to decide which is the better choice: a carbon-frame model with lesser parts or an aluminum bike with higher-quality stuff."
3255,"Neither option is right or wrong, but let's consider a couple trends: The price point at which riders face that conundrum has steadily dropped over the years, and the “lesser parts” aren’t so lesser anymore. Such is the case with the Giant Defy Advanced 3, which pairs a carbon-fiber frame and fork with quality parts and, in a twist, hydraulic disc brakes."
3256,"The result is an affordable recreational road bike that’s made for comfort and control. It’s ideal for fondos, centuries, and other organized rides, or just getting out for that weekend spin.  "
3257,"RELATED: 18 Road Bikes Under $1,500"
3258,"The Defy FamilyGiant introduced its line of endurance road bikes, called Defy, in 2010, and has steadily updated and upgraded them since. The 2018 line features three broad levels—Advanced SL, Advanced Pro, and Advanced—which correspond to the bikes' carbon fiber grades. (Within those three levels are seven models, whose differences are found in parts and price.) "
3259,"The Defy line is marked by stable handling, comfortable ride quality, and more-upright rider position. All of the bikes have disc brakes and Shimano drivetrains. Prices range from $1,685 (the bike you see here) to $9,180 for the top Advanced SL 0 model, which is raced in certain events on cycling’s WorldTour."
3260,"A High-Quality FrameGiant is well-known for its expertise with carbon fiber. It’s one of the few bike companies in the world that controls its own frame production from raw carbon thread and is an esteemed “builder of trust” for a number of other brands. Defy Advanced and Advanced Pro frames come from the same molds; the difference is the grade of carbon fiber used, which affects weight and stiffness, but only slightly."
3261,"The Defy Advanced frame is fully modern, with 12mm thru-axle wheel attachments and flat-mount disc brakes, as well as an oversize, press-fit bottom bracket and a fork with a conical steerer tube, which offers better torsional rigidity when cornering. The tube shapes and layup are designed for comfort and their ability to absorb road vibration and dampen jolts and bumps, but the frames still feel stiff when you really push into the pedals."
3262,"Better Braking, Better PriceMost road bikes at this price use either conventional rim brakes or cable-actuated disc brakes; full hydraulic systems are simply too expensive. Rim brakes work fine, but they suffer in wet conditions and limit tire-size options. Cable-activated discs often lack the power and modulation of a full hydraulic system. Giant gets around this by designing its own cable-to-hydraulic converter, called Conduct. Conduct pairs conventional cable-activated brake levers to a hydraulic caliper with a custom converter box at the handlebar. It adds weight, and its looks are polarizing, but it works as well or better than any other conversion system we’ve tried; the braking control and power are as good as most full hydraulic systems."
3263,"Elsewhere, Giant outfits the Defy Advanced 3 with a Shimano Tiagra 10-speed drivetrain, with a wide gearing range. This system uses much of the same technology and design found on Shimano’s pricier groups, with one less cog in the back and lesser materials that make the group heavier. The rest of the parts are Giant house brand, which we’ve come to find are excellent quality. The wheels use Giant’s SR-2 tubeless rims and 25mm foldable-bead tires."

3265,"Built for Big DaysGiant’s geometry emphasizes comfortable, upright rider positions and stable handling that’s responsive without feeling nervous. Wheelbases are a little longer than on race bikes, which helps with that smooth-ride sensation. Head tubes are tall, with moderate stack and reach numbers that produce a position that’s aerodynamically efficient but not too aggressive."
3266,"Ride ImpressionsWe’d enthusiastically recommend the Defy Advanced 3 for rides in hilly areas, even despite its weight. The combination of the wide gearing range for climbing and the excellent braking for descents makes it ideal for days with long ups and downs."
3267,"The ride is comfortable and smooth even on broken pavement, but the bike carves corners beautifully and is still plenty stiff under hard pedaling. We’re fans of the Tiagra drivetrain, which feels and performs much like Shimano’s pricier groups. And the disc brakes offer consistent, powerful braking in all kinds of weather conditions, so if there’s a summer squall at the top of the pass, you won’t worry about safely getting back down."

3275,"Ride Impressions.After taking the TCR Advanced 1 Disc-KOM on one of our standard lunch ride loops, my feedback was consistent with those of other testers—this is a killer bargain for a fast road bike. One that combines solid handling with those indefinable qualities that make you thirst for long summer rides and fast race efforts. On a long, winding descent, the bike floated around corners and responded smoothly and immediately to subtle nudges to follow the curve of the road. The Conduct hydraulic braking system is sure and reliable and cut stopping distances, especially on one occasion with a car at the four-way stop tucked around a corner at the foot of the hill.  Shimano's Ultegra crankset (34/50) and 11-speed 105 cassette (11-32t) gave me the low gearing to crank up the spirit-crushing climb on the other side."

Our testers raved about the bike’s ability to glide over washboard ruts and eat up road bumps, thanks to the front and rear IsoSpeed decouplers that make up Trek’s built-in road suspension. With comfortable, all-day geometry and unbeatably smooth power, the SL 6 proved itself to be a true winner for not just ride quality but also value.   "
3281,"The Domane SL and SLR FamilyThe Domane SL family starts with the SL 5 (in unisex and women’s versions), with rim brakes and a full Shimano 105 groupset, and tops out at the SLR 9 Disc, a $12,000 bike with full Shimano Dura-Ace, Di2, hydraulic disc brakes, and Aeolus 3 D3 Disc carbon wheels. The SLR models offer additional clearance for up to 32mm tires; all the bikes have front and rear IsoSpeed, which offers the patented road-damping technology that we love so much about this series. The SLR 6 comes in a disc-brake model and a disc-brake gravel version with wider, burlier tires. The SL 6 is a more budget-friendly version in the line, but it still brings the comfortable ride geometry and road suspension these bikes are  known for. And, with a full Shimano Ultegra groupset, it has the distinct component advantage over the SL 5."
3282,"The Secret to Those IsoSpeed DecouplersThe SL 6 has a lightweight carbon frame and a front and rear suspension system, called IsoSpeed, that allows it to effectively soak up road noise. Here’s how it works: The front IsoSpeed decoupler on the bike makes it so the steerer tube can flex independently from the head tube, which allows the bike to reduce road vibration. The rear IsoSpeed decoupler has a slider that lets you adjust the compliance level for terrain and personal preference by up to 14 percent. You might not even need to adjust the rear slider to experience the road-smoothing effects of the two decouplers working together—we found that the all-over effect of the bike was fast and smooth performance equally suited to asphalt and cobbles."

3286,"Ride ImpressionsBringing the Domane SL 6 to a spring group ride feels a bit like cheating—the bike is so fast, smooth, and versatile that it can make you feel stronger than you actually deserve to feel after a long winter of Netflix-enabled sloth. I’ve test-ridden some of the higher-end Domanes in the past (up one of the hardest climbs I’ve ever experienced, Mount Figueroa, in Solvang, California) and had a similarly impressed response, but I reasoned some of my “wow” reaction had to have been tied to how far out of my price range that bike was. To my delight, the Domane SL 6 brings a lot of that same lightweight, road-smoothing magic and X factor to a more affordable price range."
3287,"From the moment I hit the first loose-gravel climb on one of my usual lunch routes, I was sold on the bike’s seamless Ultegra shifting and talent for soaking up road chatter with IsoSpeed suspension. Big bumps in the road still jarred me, but the washboard ruts didn’t throw off my handling or rattle my shoulders too much. The endurance geometry helped with that, too—long rides were as comfortable from beginning to start as you can expect, without any sacrifice in speed. And the Bontrager R2 28mm tires were great on both smooth asphalt and rough gravel."
3288,"The new cranks are stiffer, lighter, and more durable than most carbon options "
3289,"If you’ve ever bashed a carbon crank arm on a rock, you know the cringey feeling that comes next—have you destroyed your crankset? Or created a ticking time bomb with a small crack or chip? Cane Creek has announced its solution to crank durability and stiffness with an all-new titanium crankset, dubbed eeWings."
3290,"The premium cranks are made entirely from high grade titanium, and weigh just 400 grams—comparable to most carbon cranksets. Moreover, the company claims its new cranks are 20-30 percent stiffer than carbon options.   "
3291,"According to product manager Sam Anderson, “eeWings can withstand a lot more abuse than other high-end cranks and not end up structurally compromised or broken. At the same time, they are incredibly stiff.”   "
3292,"The cranks are compatible with BSA73mm, PF92/PF89.5, and 392EVO bottom brackets—as well as PF30 and BB30 bottom brackets with outboard bearing configurations. They are compatible with SRAM direct mount chainrings and are available in 170 and 175mm crankarm lengths. Retail price is $999, with with a 10-year limited warranty. "

3295,"Kona designed the Rove NRB DL as a take on a modern, all-day road bike—something that’s speedy on pavement, but also ready for long hours on a variety of other road surfaces. With thru-axles, hydraulic disc brakes, and room for chunky tires (it comes with WTB Horizon Road Plus TCS 650x47mm), it’s got contemporary component choices that add fun and control on all surfaces. Plus, its sand-colored paint and wide, gumwall tires are sure to turn heads. While not a “true” road bike in the road-race sense of the term, the Kona Rove is still speedy and easily able to keep pace on faster group rides and fondos. But it truly excels when the pavement crumbles and turns to mixed terrain. "
3296,"The FamilyThere are six bikes in the Rove line, ranging from the simply named Rove ($849), a drop-bar all-rounder with rack and fender mounts, to the pretty, robin’s egg–blue Rove LTD ($3,599), which features Reynolds 853 tubing and a full-carbon thru-axle fork. All the Roves are equipped with wide gearing, disc brakes, and clearance for larger tires. "
3297,"Component HighlightsThe Rove NRB DL features a butted aluminum frame with a full carbon fork. Shimano flat-mount hydraulic disc brakes let you stop hard, even after rolling through a knee-deep creek. The drivetrain is a mix of Shimano Ultegra and 105, providing excellent function and value without being too pricey. The cushy WTB Horizon tires (650x47mm) have lots of volume, allowing lower tire pressures to increase grip and decrease rolling resistance for a speedy ride, all of which makes bumpy, broken roads feel a bit softer. Plus, the geometry feels snappy on the road without being too harsh and aggressive on noodly gravel rides."
3298,"The RideTesters lauded the Rove’s snappiness and versatility. “It floats over log obstacles as easily as it rolls on pavement and gravel,” said one. Several called it a natural choice for mountain bikers looking for a drop-bar bike for on-road adventures. Its light build and responsive handling also make it an excellent choice for mixing it up on some group rides."
3299,This cool gadget recommends ideal pressures and provides real-time monitoring
3300,"Price: $199Weight: 10 grams (per wheel)Use: road, trail, mountain, gravel, cyclocrossBattery Life: 300 hours (claimed)"
3301,"Chances are if you bought a new car or truck in the last ten years it has real-time tire pressure monitoring via valve stems that transmit data to your dashboard. Quarq, the electronics division of SRAM that brought us super-reliable power meters and data collection units like the Qollector and ShockWiz, now offers cyclists the same real-time feedback so you can set your ideal tire pressure on your bicycle. "
3302,"Packaged in sets of two, these 10-gram units work on any valve stems—tubeless or inner tube—with removable cores."
3303,"Each TireWiz threads in to the valve core and transmits real-time data on tire pressure in Ant+ or Bluetooth to an attendant smartphone app for both Android and iOS (ready in June 2018) or newer cycling computers from Garmin, with other brands likely to follow. Through the app, TyreWiz suggests tire pressure based on wheel size (700c, 27.5/650b, or 26-inch) and tire width, plus user weight when dressed for riding. Additionally, the app acts as a digital pressure gauge. As you inflate your tires, an image of a tire on your screen turns from red to green so you know exactly when to stop pumping.  "

3305,5 Things You Should Know About Tire Pressure
3306,"Quarq claims the tool is accurate +/- 2 percent with a 0.1psi resolution, and says the small gadgets won't clog up with tire sealant. Our initial test has been good, but we'll keep testing them—clogged valves are a normal part of sealant use. The units carry a IP67 dust and waterproof rating; enough to survive stream crossings and pressure washing on mountain and cyclocross bikes. They are powered by an easily replaceable CR1632 battery that has a claimed 300-hour life according to Quarq. "
3307,"Test ImpressionsThe TyreWiz units are a snap to install. Simply unthread the core from your valve stem (I used it on a set of tubeless road wheels) and thread on the TireWiz in its place, positioning it inline with the spokes. "
3308,"The TyreWiz app was also easy to use. You set your weight and also how much extra kit you have on that day, for example: to account for wearing a mountain bike hydration pack one day and riding without one another time. You also need to input which wheel (or both) you're mounting the units to, all of which you can do in the settings screen."
3309,"After that, attach a pump and air up until the wheels in  your app turn green. Then go ride. The app gives a projected psi range of about +/- 5 psi for a given rider weight and tire size so you can fine tune based on real feel.  Of note: I found that if you have a right-angled pump head, the weight of the head and hose could unthread the unit from the valve stem when installing the pump from the drive side. If that sounds like your setup, inflate from the non-drive side where gravity will help keep the TyreWiz from coming unthreaded. "
3310,"Seeing real-time feedback on tire pressure was interesting. While my pressure didn’t change over the course of a day's ride, having the TireWiz installed let me see that I lost about 15psi overnight and warned me to top up before hitting the road on subsequent days. "
3311,I hardly noticed the TyreWiz once installed. And riding fast descents on the road didn’t produce an unbalanced feel or the speed wobbles I expected. That may have to do with the minuscule 10-gram weight of each TyreWiz or the Zipp 303 NSW wheelset I was using. 
3312,"The jury is still out on whether this is the next big thing. It doesn't yet have any logic to recommend pressure based on your riding style, but it does provide valuable feed back to  help you find and maintain ideal tire pressure. It's not cheap, but it's easy to use and given how important tire pressure is, could be a nice boost for some riders. "

Not only does this significantly decrease the weight (to a claimed 1,250 grams) but the brand says it increases stiffness up to 30 percent for faster acceleration. Each carbon spoke runs completely through the wheel, with a subtle bend around the hub to mitigate any sharp angles. "
3322,"Each spoke is integrated into the rim rather than interfacing with a traditional nipple. When the hub is installed, it pushes the spokes apart laterally, effectively tensioning them for a ride that is a little more ""springy"" than with standard wheel. At $3,500 a pair, these aren't an upgrade to be taken lightly, but Scott claims that they'll never go out of true. "

Simply apply two of the disposable stickers to either side of your nose—they contain small metal caps, which interface with magnets on the sides of the nosepiece. Once in place, you can turn a dial on the bridge of the nose to pull the wings apart further, opening nasal passages for optimal breathing. The concept is new to performance eyewear, but Sagan seems to have no problem wearing them. The sunglasses cost $325, and 20 pairs of nose stickers cost $15."

3326,"When you have $5,000 or $10,000 (or even a fraction of that) worth of bikes hanging over the trunk of your car, you want a rack made of metal—not plastic. That's the premise behind Kuat's Highline, which has a a lot of neat features and one defining one: Its arms and the mechanisms that hold them together are made of extruded aluminum. That makes them less likely than plastic ones to wear down, loosen, and shake."
3327,"The 13-pound rack is easy to install, has rubber-coated hooks to avoid marring your paint, and folds down to a 4-inch high package for easy storage. The Highline comes in a two-bike setup that costs $219 and a three-bike option that runs $232."

3329,
3330,"Continental's mountain tires have remained consistent over the years—but they get some massive changes in tread patterns and construction this year. All tires now feature a lightweight but more-durable (and more flexible) cordura sidewall for easier installation and better slash resistance. The familiar flag patterning is also less recessed into the rubber to stop sealant leakage in tubeless tires (if you've ever watched your Conti's ""cry"" Stans for a day after seating, you'll be psyched on this development)."
3331,"As far as tread, each model saw some changes, from drastic overhauls to slight tweaks. The Race King stays fairly similar, while the Cross King gets shorter knobs (and more of them) for faster rolling in dry conditions. The Trail King morphs into more of an all-arounder with linear sideknobs for consistent cornering and the Mountain King gets slightly beefier and has a new tread that Adidas collaborated on. "

3333,"OneUp makes mountain bike components that solve problems—in this case, the fact that longer-travel dropper posts often put your saddle too high when fully extended. One Up's new 170mm and 150mm posts give you plenty of travel, but are about 20mm shorter than many current options, so they fit more bikes and riders thanks to low-profile saddle rails that reduce the seat height above the post guts. The Dropper also has a thinner collar where the stanchion drops into the post and a shorter actuator where the cable attaches at the bottom of the post."
3334,"If you need a little less drop, Oneup includes an easy-to-install shim (you don't have to remove the post or saddle) that will reduce travel by up to 50mm, letting you customize your setup. The $179 posts come in 30.9 and 31.6 post diameters and work with any cable-actuated remote—or OneUp sells a carbon remote for an additional $49."

3347,"Foam inserts for tubeless tires aren’t a new concept—pro enduro and downhill racers like Aaron Gwin have run them for the past couple seasons, and brands like CushCore and Schwalbe have launched versions for the rest of us. But Vittoria says its new Airliner is easier to install than competing offerings—it comes in one length for you to cut to size, pops onto most rim beds easily, and is secured with a simple zip-tie. "
3348,"The Airliner provides a layer of EVA foam that supports a tubeless tire to prevent burping and bottom-outs on hard impacts, and also allows a rider to roll for some distance after a flat (pro racer Adam Morse was able to finish the final three minutes of an EWS stage on a flat tire thanks to his Airliner, says Ken Avery, Vittoria VP of marketing and product). "
3349,"It’s compatible with all styles of valve stems, and an air channel allows the tire tread to stay supple and grippy. Because it protects against burps and rim hits, the Airliner also allows the rider to run lower tire pressure for more traction—one of Vittoria’s testers went from 25 psi to 16 psi on 2.35-inch wide tires. The Airliner weighs 140 grams, will be available in June, and will retail for $85."

Morrison couldn’t give us details (or allow us to shoot any close-ups), but the profile looks similar to the 140mm-travel Giant Trance, which would means it has less travel than Liv’s 160mm Hail enduro bike. "
3352,"Morrison did say the bike had impressive rolling speed and was capable enough to ride on the (notably flat) Sea Otter downhill course. Her model was decked out with parts that are likely different from what we would see on a stock build: Shimano Di2, a DVO Topaz T3 Air piggyback shock, and a Maxxis DHF front tire and SS rear."

3354,"Short-nosed saddles with cutouts are positioned as the Swiss army knife of the seat world: good for any gender, and any purpose. A shorter nose means less surface to press on the soft-tissue area, and less overall length means less saddle to intrude into the riding cockpit. "
3355,"This versatility is why Prologo has expanded its Dimension short-nose saddle line. The Dimension Space is the widest (153mm) of the line, and also has the thickest padding and the largest cutout. The 143mm wide Dimension NDR (shown) has 3mm thicker padding than the standard Dimension, a more rounded sit-bone area, and scuff protectors on the side of the saddle.

3356,"Titanium crank claimed to be 40 percent stiffer than carbon optionsPrice: $999, available in May Learn More"
3357,"In the late 1990s there was a two-piece, welded steel, mountain bike crank with hybrid cup BB (one internal bearing, one external bearing) called SweetWings (I was lucky enough to own a set). It was lighter, stiffer, and tougher (and more expensive) than anything else on the market. SweetWings disappeared, but its ideas had a profound influence on the crank market. Now Sweetwings are back. They’re called the Cane Creek eeWings, but they are designed by Craig Edwards, the man behind the original SweetWings (and Sweet stem, and eeBrakes). This time around they’re titanium, with a 30mm axle, and compatible with SRAM direct-mount chainrings and spiders. Pitched at aggressive mountain bikers, the $999 eeWings are claimed but are up to 40 percent stiffer, and are much more durable than a carbon crankset, yet weigh about the same (400 grams). "

Designed with input from Ibis’s Enduro World Series (EWS) team, the Ripmo is a do-it-all monster truck, a gravity-oriented ripper that’s capable of climby, high-country adventures, and light and efficient enough to repeatedly climb and descend your favorite loop. "
3366,"One Frame, Lots of OptionsAll Ripmo models use the same carbon frame and come in two colorways: sky blue with orange accents and black with green highlights. Three grand will buy you the frame, but if a complete bike is what you're after, you have five build kits to choose from: SRAM 1x12 GX Eagle ($4,799), XO1 Eagle ($7,099), and XX1 Eagle ($9,399); SRAM 1.11 NX ($4,099); and the only Shimano option, the company's workhorse XT drivetrain in 1x11 ($6,199)."
3367,"The lowest-priced complete bike is equipped with SRAM’s Level brakes (180mm rotors), but all other models are spec’d with Shimano brakes. This makes for a somewhat unique spec on the top-of-the-line bike: SRAM’s cross-country-focused XX1 Eagle drivetrain paired with Shimano’s Saint heavy-duty, downhill race brakes. In a way, though, this spec is exactly what the Ripmo is supposed to be all about: uphill efficiency and downhill speed."
3368,"All models are equipped with 160mm Fox 36 forks: the XX1-, X01-, and XT-equipped bikes have Fox’s top-of-the-line Factory-series forks; the lower-priced models have Fox’s Performance-series forks (with the option to upgrade to Factory series)."
3369,The stock shock on all models is a Fox Performance-series DPX2 piggyback; the company’s Float X2 model is available as an upgrade on all models.
3370,Complete bikes are built with Ibis wheels with wide rims. The top-of-the-line model is equipped with carbon rims built on Industry Nine’s hubset; all other models get aluminum rims built on Ibis’s hubs (with the option to upgrade to carbon).
3371,"All models are equipped with Maxxis tires, Lizard Skins lock-on grips, and a dropper post (Ibis offers drop-length options dependent on rider size and preference)."
3372,"Rider-Friendly Frame DetailsThe Ripmo may be a big bike, but its claimed weights are impressive: The frame with shock weighs 6 pounds; complete bikes are as light as 28 pounds."
3373,"Though it’s a long-travel, full-suspension bike, the Ripmo can–even with a piggyback shock–still carry a water bottle within the main triangle."
3374,"Low-slung top tubes make the Ripmo feel and look more compact, while shorter (and straight for the full length) seat tubes allow riders to run longer-travel (up to 175mm) dropper posts."
3375,"As is the fashion, hoses and housing run internally with full-length tunnels for frustration-free routing."
3376,"Standards info: The Ripmo has a traditional threaded bottom bracket, a Boost 148 rear axle, and ISCG-05 tabs–via a plate that slips over splines machined into the threaded bottom bracket–shell insert–for chain guides. "
3377,"Proven Suspension DesignLike Ibis’s other full-suspension bikes, the Ripmo uses the proven DW-Link dual-link suspension design. The system (also used by Pivot and Turner) has proven to be among the very best, and provides crisp pedaling and well-rounded braking and bump performance. As with all suspension designs, DW-Link is continually evolving, with Ibis describing the version used by the Ripmo as fifth generation."
3378,"The Ripmo’s links are surprisingly small and hidden for such a long-travel bike. The upper link rotates on ball bearings, while the lower link (which rotates less than the upper) uses IGUS bushings, which allowed Ibis’s engineers to make a lighter (by 80 grams), stiffer, and lower-maintenance lower link."
3379,"Long(er), Low(er), Slack(er), Steep(er)Mountain bike geometry is evolving so fast, bikes that were considered long, low, and slack a few months ago now seem short, tall, and steep. The new Ripmo feels modern at the moment; what it will be considered a year from now will depend on how much farther the pendulum swings. For now, at least, the Ripmo has long reach, short chainstays, a slack head angle, steep seat angle, and a low bottom bracket. Overall, however, it’s not radically different than its competition"
3380,"A size medium has a 446mm reach—longer than a Pivot Switchblade (440mm), Santa Cruz Hightower (430mm), Yeti SB5.5 (421mm), and the new Specialized Stumpjumper 29 (425mm). Head-tube angle is 65.9 degrees. Combined with the long reach and front centers, the Ripmo’s wheelbase is generous (1,190mm on a size medium). Chainstays are fairly tidy at 435mm. Unsagged bottom bracket height is 341mm, which is in line with its competition. A 76-degree seat-tube angle helps keep the rider in a good pedaling position."
3381,"Following an emerging trend, Ibis spec’d a shorter-offset, 44mm fork (29ers had largely been using longer-offset, 51mm forks)—a swap that seems to provide better handling characteristics when combined with ever-longer reaches and slacker head tube angles."
3382,"Not the Monster You Might ExpectThe Ripmo’s big wheels, big travel, and EWS pedigree leads one to anticipate a sled-like beast of a bike. But the Ripmo is surprisingly spry and lively enough that it largely hides its shred."
3383,"On steep, smooth climbs, the bike didn't kick me into the backseat and send the front wheel meandering. The position was more centered in the bike and on top of the pedals, keeping the front wheel tracking true. On flatter, flowier trails, the Ripmo is crisp and agile, not spongy and numb. It steers more responsively than expected, and it feels sharp when initiating medium-to-slowspeed turns."
3384,"As always, the DW-Link suspension is efficient, with a firm feel at the pedals and little sensation of movement. Small-bump compliance is good, though it’s a bit less sensitive than we would expect from 145mm travel. Generous mid-stroke support provides a firm platform from which to pop off when navigating obstacles. Big-hit control is very good, with very smooth progression to the end of the travel, though the most aggressive riders may want to add some volume spacers to the Fox shock to help ramp up the end-stroke feel. "
3385,"As speeds open up, the Ripmo feels planted and stable. The big wheels, stability, travel, and well-tuned suspension are ready for most rowdy and technical trails. However, I did walk away from my first ride on the Ripmo feeling like I rode a nice, longer-travel trail bike and not an enduro race sled. For better or worse, this long-travel 29er is crisper, livelier, and rides smaller and lighter than its numbers might telegraph. That said, Ibis’s enduro riders have had great success aboard the Ripmo, so maybe this is a bike that has it all."

That joy—of turning a simple errand into an excuse to connect to the world—is what I experienced riding the Felt Tote’m e-cargo bike. I picked my way through snow-lined alleys to the grocery store, waved to drivers on chilly commutes, hand-delivered Christmas gifts like a pedal-assisted Santa, and rode quiet country roads instead of driving a traffic-choked thoroughfare to my bank."

(The rear rack is compatible with Yepp child seats.) The Shimano STePS system is also one of the smoother motors I’ve tried. There’s a subtle lag before the assist kicks in from a stop, but once moving, it hums along seamlessly through changes in power output.

"
3407,"For years, Scott’s Spark has been its mainstay XC full-suspension bike, the bike a racer would pick for a tough, technical course where its Scale hardtail wasn’t suited. But it was a big jump from the 100mm-travel Spark 29er with its XC-style geometry to the slacker, 130mm-travel Genius trail bike. That’s important because Scott says that some 60 percent of the Spark’s buyers aren’t racers; they want a light, fast, but capable trail bike for all-around riding."
3408,Freedom is being able to fix anything on your bike. Find out how with our course on basic bike maintenance. 
3409,"So with a major redesign for the 2017 model year, Scott turned the new Spark into exactly that, along the way expanding the line from an already broad 17 models to a whopping 39, ranging from $2,000 to $8,600. That includes an expanded RC (Racing Concept) lineup, three new Contessa women’s models, and six plus-size tire versions (four men’s and two Contessa women’s) with meaty 2.8-inch tires."
3410,
3411,
3412,"That sounds like a dizzying array of options, and it is, but much of that stems from Scott offering two wheel sizes for many models. In fact, it breaks down pretty neatly: "
3413,"-The RC line is now three bikes with 29-inch wheels. They’re dedicated racers, with shorter travel (100mm front and rear) and 1x drivetrains; there’s no mount for a front derailleur. Scott had a nice run of luck with the new bikes, winning two Olympic gold medals and World Championships in both the Elite men (Nino Schurter) and U23 women (Jenny Rissveds) this summer."
3414,"-The main Spark line has 10 main models in either 29 or 27.5-inch versions. These feature 120mm of travel front and rear and 1x or 2x drivetrains, depending on the model. Where the 2016 version had conventional posts, the entire new line gets droppers from either Fox or Syncros, depending on the model."
3415,"-The Contessa line, not including the RC model above, grows to four bikes from one. They’re all 27.5 wheel only, 2x drivetrain, with droppers on all but one model."
3416,"-The Plus bikes also grow in number, with four men’s and two women’s models, all in 27-plus tire sizing, with 130mm of fork travel and mostly 2x drivetrains and dropper posts."
3417,      RELATED: The Scott Contessa Solace
3418,"All the new sub-lines have their own geometry, as well as some tweaks to the frame to accommodate 1x versus 2x drivetrains. But they share the same basic design overview and features."
3419,"The biggest change is a new suspension design. For years, The Spark used a single-pivot suspension with the shock mounted horizontally to the top tube. The new model is technically still a single-pivot, but uses a rocker link design that moves all pivots in line with the seat tube and orients the shock vertically, mounted to the down tube at the bottom bracket. "
3420,
3421,
3422,"Scott claims there are multiple benefits to the new design, including: a higher initial leverage ratio improves small-bump sensitivity and offers better support while pedaling (less bobbing) in the middle of the shock stroke; a lighter top tube, since it no longer needs shock mount reinforcement; and more drivetrain stiffness, thanks to the upside-down shock orientation."
3423,"The rocker-link design also freed Scott up to redesign and dramatically lighten the rear triangle. The old version had four distinct pieces with a rear axle pivot and a ton of hardware bolting it all together. The new, pivotless version has two swingarm pieces (in either carbon or aluminum) and dramatically less hardware (some of it moves to the rocker link, but there’s generally less of it, and it’s not as heavy)."
3424,"Scott also switched up the geometry in a major way, moving to the long-low-slack style we’re seeing on ever more trail bikes. Gone is the high/low bottom bracket setting option of the old Spark, replaced with a single orientation that’s slightly higher than the old high position. But the head tube rakes out more than two full degrees slacker than the old bike even in the low setting. Reach bumps out more than 20mm even in the small size, stack drops about 10mm, and seat angles steepen slightly."
3425,
3426,
3427,"With the Boost axle spacing (148mm rear, 110mm front), Scott was able to dramatically shorten the chainstays (10mm) even as the overall wheelbase grows, and preserve tire clearance. These figures are specific to the 29er versions of the regular Spark line, but comparisons in the 27.5-inch versions are broadly similar. There’s no real geometry comparison for the Plus bikes, as Scott didn’t have a Plus version of the Spark in its line last year. "
3428,"The geometry on the Plus versions is similar, with some small-yet-important differences: There's 130mm of fork travel, as opposed to the standard version's 120mm. The seat angle is half a degree slacker, with slightly longer chainstays for tire clearance and a longer wheelbase. Reach is almost identical, but stack height, courtesy in part due to the larger tire volume, increases 25mm even though the head tube is 10mm shorter. "
3429,"Also updated: the venerable Scale hardtail, which trims to just 849 grams (medium) frame-only, in the top-shelf RC trim. The big story here is the move to Boost spacing, which allows Scott to shorten up the chainstays 13mm. Both the existing RC and Plus versions continue, with more models. Scott remedies an oversight with last year’s Plus models, equipping the 710 and 720 Plus with dropper posts. With slack 66.5-degree head angles, 120mm travel forks and meaty 27.5x2.8-inch Maxxis Rekon tires, these are less race-geek rides and more rowdy singletrack play bikes."
3430,"We got to ride the new bikes over two days in Crested Butte in early August, including some lift-served shredding at the Evolution Bike Park at Crested Butte Mountain Resort, and some trail riding on the legendary high-altitude singletrack."
3431,
3432,
3433,"I spent most of my time on the main Spark platform, both the 29er and 27.5 versions. In the park, the Spark seemed a bit undergunned, which was no surprise. On the steep, more technical park-like terrain, the clear pick would be a bike like the Genius LT Plus, with 170mm of travel or even the 130mm travel Genius Plus. Still, I had a fine time on it and never felt it was a bad pick for at least blue trails. (The Spark Plus, with a slacker seat angle and more stack, which position the rider’s weight farther back over the rear wheel, would be a more versatile option.)"
3434,"In its more natural environment, alpine singletrack, the Spark came alive. Sparks have always climbed well, in part thanks to Scott’s Twinloc suspension remote. Twinloc controls front and rear suspension simultaneously, with a three-position lever that toggles the compression damping from open to pedal platform to full lockout. On a bike with two shifters and a dropper remote, the additional two levers and cables make for something of a complicated dashboard. And Scott acknowledges it’s more popular in the European market, where sections of singletrack are often linked by road climbs where lockout is welcome."
3435,"But in Crested Butte, at least, the setup came in handy. Our day started with a partial shuttle up Washington Gulch, but we were still faced with a long fire-road climb to a saddle where we picked up the 403 singletrack and more climbing. But it was where 403 started its precipitous descent that the new Spark suspension really showed its character."
3436,     RELATED: How to Ride Steep Climbs
3437,"Previous Sparks have been stiff in initial travel, a function of the lower leverage rate that requires more force to get the wheel moving. There’s no mistaking you’re on an XC bike. But with Twinloc flipped to the full open setting, the newer Spark felt much more capable as a trail bike."
3438,"The 403 trail is, like a lot of Crested Butte singletrack, an old-school trail. I wasn’t on a Plus version, rather a Spark 700 Premium ($8,000) with Maxxis’s 27.5x2.35 Forekaster tires. Gathering speed off the summit on the narrow singletrack, I dropped in to a series of almost fall-line switchbacks, rutted to a deep V shape and strewn with washboard bumps. I hit the remote for the Fox Transfer dropper post to get my weight back and pointed the front end down the center of the rut."
3439,"The Spark felt totally capable in that kind of terrain; likely far more than the old version would have. The Fox rear shock, a custom Scott tune on the Float series with the EVOL sleeve, soaked up the braking bumps without blowing through its travel, or ramping up to a harsh, locked-out feel you can sometimes find on shorter-travel bikes in very rough terrain. As a slight digression, the larger-volume air cans like the EVOL, or Rock Shox’s Debonair, seem clearly superior to me to their normal-volume counterparts. The suspension feel is markedly better, with improved small-bump sensitivity and solid platform support deeper in the travel. More and more bikes feature these shocks, with good reason."
3440,"Lower down, in long sections of flowy, benching singletrack warped through high alpine meadows thick with wildflowers, the suspension felt agile and responsive, compressing quickly to prejump a water bar, and soaking up the odd rock or log in the trail. Near-daily rain since July, including the morning of our ride, made exposed trail sections almost perfectly tacky, but as we descended through groves of evergreens, tree roots and bony sections of glacial-scoured granite were wet and slick. I’m a decent bike handler, but not a great one. I tend to like the long-low-slack feel of modern trail bikes because they seem to improve my control in such situations and give me more confidence against the chance of endo-ing."
3441,"There, the Spark wasn’t quite on par with some of the best trail bikes I’ve ridden. The head and seat angles are slightly steeper and put me a bit more forward on the bike than I usually prefer. The setup was a marked improvement over the existing Spark; but it also underlined that the Spark is Scott’s attempt to split the difference between XC and full-on trail bike, and it retains a bit of that character."
3442,"In anything less than very technical conditions, though, the bike was admirably balanced: precise in line choice; stout and slack enough to plow through moderate rock gardens and root sections; and efficient for long climbs, even without fully engaging the Twinloc."
3443,"All of which, it turned out, was a good thing. As we hit the bottom of the 403 trail at the Gothic Road trailhead, we turned our bikes north again and began the long fire road and singletrack climb back up to 11,300 feet. We paused a few minutes at the summit to catch our breath, taken away as much by the sweeping views of the Elk Mountains and the backside of the Maroon Bells Wilderness Area as the climb itself. Then we clipped in and began the long, rollercoaster descent down the legendary 401 trail back home."

Launched in January, the F10 is an update to the successful Dogma F8 and features improved aerodynamics and a seven percent increase in the frame’s stiffness-to-weight ratio. Froome rode the F8 X-Light to victory in the 2016 Tour, and in a few weeks, we’ll know if the F10 is also Tour-winning bike.

At the start of the 2017 Tour, we observed that most of Team Sky was aboard the F10 X-Light frame. This bike, which was shot before the start of Stage Four, does not carry Pinarello’s X-Light designation, but we expect that Froome will be on an X-Light in later stages."

Geometry and frame shape are the same as the F10, but the F10 X-Light is likely made with a different resin, fiber blend, and layup to reduce the frame’s weight. The F8 X-Light, which Team Sky used in the 2017 Tour de France, was 80 grams lighter than the standard F8. It was made available to the public in limited numbers (200 total) and carried a frame-only price of $8,499 and a 154lb rider weight limit: we’d expect something similar for the F10 X-Light."

3562,"A Giro Stage 6 winner. We review Campagnolo's long-awaited EPS shifting group
"
3563,"Tullio Campagnolo invented the quick-release skewer in1927, and since then, innovation has been the lifeblood of the company bearing his name. But, like the multicourse lunch served daily in the factory's cafeteria, Campy's new products can't be rushed."
3564, 
3565,"So it was, after years of anticipation, that we rode a new Campagnolo electronic gruppo while in Austin for our Editors' Choice testing. In development for several years (even predating the company's 11-speed gruppos), and road-tested in an unmarked version, the group first appeared in public and officially this year under the Movistar ProTeam. Its first win came courtesy of team member Francisco Ventoso at January's Santos Tour Down Under, in Adelaide, Australia. Dubbed EPS, our test group came on a Movistar-issue Pinarello Dogma, flown from the team service course to Austin."
3566, 
3567,"Like Shimano's Di2 system, the group relies on electronic front and rear derailleurs wired to a down-tube-mounted battery. The levers are identical in shape to Campy's Super Record group, and paddles located in the familiar spots actuate shifting. The The group borrows non electronic components—brakes, crankset, cassette—from the Super Record group."
3568, 
3569,"The best feature is the ability to move the rear derailleur multiple gears up or down by holding the shift levers—this is a marked difference from Di2, which shifts one gear each time you push the lever. Shift action across the cogs feels similar to Super Record, and we anticipate that it will become smoother as the group is refined. Front shifting, though, is as revelatory as shifting on Di2—the chain moves effortlessly and instantaneously between chainrings."
3570, 
3571,"Fausto Pinarello, president of Pinarello, has been involved in testing and hopes to begin selling EPS-equipped bikes this summer. The price for a complete bike has not yet been determined, but, he said, it will be in line with Di2 packages. At an estimated 1,938grams, the Campy group is 200 gram slighter than Di2 and boasts a longer claimed battery life. At this time, Pinarello says there are no plans to develop modular shifters, such as the climber's and sprinter's switches available for Di2, although a time-trial shifter is in the works."
3572, 
3573,"Pinarello notes that Movistar riders and mechanics are receiving frequent updates to the group, which means our test parts were likely outdated by the time they arrived in Austin. With ongoing changes, the prototype aesthetics will likely improve before EPS reaches shops."

3586,"Traditionally, road handlebars were wrapped in white cloth tape. Cork tape arrived in the early 1990’s and with it, color options. From then on, many riders made a point of matching their bar wrap to their team kits or saddles or both.

"
3657,“Is that helmet for testing?” my co-worker asked when she saw the Bern Prescott sitting on my shelf. “It’s super cute!”
3658,“New helmet!” a friend noticed as I pull up for a snowy ride. “That is super cute!” 
3659,"That phrase followed me wherever I wore the new Bern Prescott, the company’s first women’s enduro-oriented helmet. It seems that the female mountain bike community is in agreement about two things: One, that even if we want products that perform, we also appreciate aesthetics; and two, that the Prescott gets some serious style points. The model I tested was a bright teal with contrasting lime green straps. If that combo isn’t your thing, there are four other color options to choose from."
3660,"Rather than simply sizing down its men’s models, Bern shaped the Prescott’s shell differently, with a higher cut in the back to accommodate a ponytail and a softer, attractive profile. Sixteen ergonomically shaped vents provide airflow, and Bern constructed the helmet with its proprietary Zip Mold Plus foam, which the company says is 15 percent lighter than any material it's used previously. "
3661,"After the helmet’s exceeding “cuteness”, the next thing I noticed was the interior. The inside of the Prescott is lined with ultra-soft padding, which made it feel more like a comfy hat than a hard helmet. The Boa closure system is also enclosed in the padding, meaning it doesn’t snag on my hair like the plastic bands inside my other bike helmets."
3662,"The Boa tightened down to fit my head nicely when I put on the helmet. However, it had a tendency to come loose on my head while I was riding. I would be bombing down the trail and notice the Prescott ever-so-gradually slipping down my forehead. This left me struggling to adjust while I rode—not the ideal situation when one is navigating singletrack that is slushy and wet from recent snowmelt. However, the dial was easy to access and operate with one hand whenever I did feel it loosen. "
3663,"I have thick hair that frizzes at the first sign of moisture, so I always pull it back in a braid or bun when I ride. I really appreciated the convenience of the higher, ponytail-accommodating rear cut of the helmet, which gave me some extra real estate to fit a decent bun on the back of my head—not always easy with standard helmets."
3664,"The positioning of the Prescott’s visor was an occasional source of annoyance for me. During a group ride on one of our local trails, which has a lot of swoopy, flowy, up-down-up’s, I felt that I was constantly craning my neck back to see to the top of the next riser. However, the visor is removable, so in the future, I’d lose it for super swoopy trails, and pop it on to protect my face from low branches during brushy backwoods excursions. This could also just be a personal preference—some people love riding with visors. I don’t. "
3665,"One big drawback for me was the lack of the ability to adjust the straps where they meet below the ears. The straps are just sewn together in a “Y” shape, without any clips to adjust for allocation of strap length between the ear and chin straps. This left me with too much slack in front of my ears, making the straps bow out around my face. It didn’t affect the comfort or functionality of the helmet, but it just looked goofy. "
3666,"Overall, while I loved the look and style of the Prescott, there were a few things that would keep me from buying this as my main trail helmet. Since it is the first year for this model, I’m hoping that next year’s version will come with some tweaks, like a tighter retention system and more options for adjustment. If those come, I’d be ready to rock this helmet—and lap up the compliments—on the trail. "

3668,
3669,
3670,"
It’s no longer enough for a race bike to be light and stiff—now it also needs to slice through the wind. Because cyclists use the majority of their power to overcome wind resistance, aero frames are faster in nearly ­every situation,­ leading to a new category for performance bikes. A ­marriage between time-trial bikes and standard road racers, these models are light, efficient, and wind-tunnel certified.
The execution of the aero road bicycle has taken time. Many early models were heavy, not stiff enough, or transmitted too much road noise. But now, ­several generations later, the bikes are more refined, riding with characteristics similar to traditional frames. For our first-­ever Editors’ Choice award in this category, we gathered some of 2012’s best examples. In addition to extensive road evaluations by our test riders—our practice with every bike we test—­we took all five to North Carolina’s A2 Wind Tunnel to evaluate the aerodynamic­ characteristics of each, comparing them with a 2012 Editors’ Choice award-winning race bike, the Specialized Tarmac S-Works SL4. In the tunnel, there was a clear winner, but the differences between bikes were minimal. That means you should base your purchasing decision on ride characteristics and fit rather than on aerodynamics. If you want to go faster, one of these slippery machines will speed up your next competitive ride—be it a race or Strava segment.Jump to the data »"

3694,"Our Testing Protocol. —Matt Phillips
—In the tunnel, everything, no matter now small, makes a difference. Even details like saddle height and the thickness of the bar tape can alter the numbers. Cervélo’s David Kennedy says he has found that even the direction the bar tape is wrapped can affect results. We controlled every variable that we could, but our data may not match that collected in other tests.
—We tested each bike two ways: with the wheels you’ll get when buying the bike, and also with a control set of wheels—Zipp Firecrest 404 tubulars shod with Vittoria EVO CX 23mm tires. Every bike (all were size 54cm) was tested with a Fi’zi:k Arione saddle set to the same height and setback. We also cut steerer tubes to the same height and installed the stem at the same angle. While testing the frames with matching components may have yielded different results, we believe that this method let us better test the bikes you will buy. 
—We tested without bottles or cages. While these items definitely affect overall drag numbers, we chose to test without them in order to eliminate a large variable.  
—Some manufacturers claim their aerodynamics are optimized to work with a rider, but we tested the bikes without a rider or dummy. A human isn’t consistent enough to maintain the same position on each of six bikes; even a subtle shift in the saddle or head tilt could skew the data.  
—We tested the bikes with a straight-on headwind, and with the wind coming from five-degree increments up to 20 degrees on both sides of the bikes. In the real world, the effective wind angle is a combination of both the speed and direction of your travel, and the wind’s speed and direction. If you’re traveling at 20 mph and there is a 20-mph wind blowing from 20 degrees, the effective wind angle is 10 degrees. If a rider is traveling at 20 mph and there is a 5 mph wind blowing from 30 degrees, the effective wind angle is TK. Engineers disagree on the question of which is the average effective wind angle that most riders experience, but most believe that it’s between five and 15 degrees. "
3695,"When it comes to cyclocross tire pressure, you may be surprised how low you can go. "
3696,"Experience and research tell us that running lower pressure can offer two big benefits, especially when it comes to cyclocross. First, a tire that can spread out more on the ground offers a bigger contact patch, which increases traction. And second, there's also growing research to show that lower pressure actually reduces rolling resistance, since your tire can absorb small bumps rather than transferring micro-resistances back to you and your legs on varied terrain. "
3697,Keep your muscles warm when temps drop with our signature Vanilla Coconut Embro!
3698,"But don't get overzealous with your presta valve just yet—lower pressures need to be balanced with skill level and terrain, as low pressures can increase the likelihood of pinch flats, or, in the case of tubeless setups, “burping” (when the bead of the tire momentarily releases from the rim, allowing air to escape) if you’re riding clumsiliy over rough ground. "
3699,The good news: You can train yourself to ride faster at lower pressures over time. Here is a simple roadmap to help you progress toward your optimal tire pressure for cyclocross. 
3700,"To figure out what pressure works best for you, it’s best to start practicing on a repeatable course. Look for a local park, a good gravel bike path, or a local 'cross venue where you can do multiple laps."
3701,     RELATED: 5 Things You Didn't Know About Tire Pressure
3702,Gear You’ll Need
3703,"Find your base
	Start with a pressure range of 25 to 40psi (pounds per square inch). Lighter riders can err on the low side to start, and heavier riders to the higher side. Write down your starting pressure. Remember to be careful when you detach the pump from the valve so as to not inadvertently let out extra pressure."
3704,"Front and rear tire pressures don’t need to be the same, but start with them at the same pressure until you get a feel for where your weight is usually distributed and how your bike moves. "
3705,Ride
3706,"Once you start pedaling, pay attention to whether your tires ever bottom out or feel like they're diving or folding over sideways in the corners. (A folding or diving tire feels like the bike is trying to wash out from under you, and is often accompanied by a sound similar to opening Velcro.) Similarly, note if there's no bounce to the tires, or if they feel skittery or like they're sliding over the ground without gripping. "
3707,"As for technique, the goal is to “ride light.” You don't want to get lazy like you might on a road bike, or whomp the bike around like you would on a mountain bike. On a cross bike, you want to float above the bike with your arms and legs relaxed, which lets you compensate for the roughness of the terrain. It helps to think of your tires as your suspension: You have just 30mm of movement under you before the suspension bottoms out (i.e., the rim hits the ground) so keep your arms and legs loose to absorb the bumps your tires can't. 
	 
	Also, look as far ahead of you as you can, rather than focusing on what's right in front of you. This will give you time to anticipate any terrain shifts, bumps, or obstacles in your way."
3708,     RELATED: 4 Ways Your Tire Pressure Is Wrong
3709,"Adjust
	Once you get back to your start point, note in your journal how your tires felt. If you were worried you were going to roll them off you rims, add a couple psi and write down that new number. they felt skittery, let out a psi or two. Remember, with low-volume tires like you have on your cyclocross bike, small changes in tire pressure can have big results. It’s best to keep changes to the 1 to 2psi range to start and then, once you get comfortable riding low, play with smaller adjustments (0.5 to 1psi changes)."
3710,"Go ride some more
	Keep doing laps and adding or subtracting pressure until you get to the point where the tires absorb small roots and uneven terrain, and there is no tendency for them to squirm under you when driving through hard corners. Consider changing conditions—you may want a lower pressure than usual for a muddy course, or a higher one if there's a big pavement section, or the course is very dry and hard-packed. Finally, continue to practice riding light, and anticipating the terrain—the lighter you can ride, the lower you'll be able to drop your pressure, and the better traction and efficiency you'll find you can get. With practice you'll get more stable, more efficient, and ultimately have more fun on your 'cross bike."
3711,"Mid-cage rear derailleur brings 11-32 cassettes to eTap
"
3712,"When SRAM officially launched the Red eTap wireless electronic group in 2015, it was decidedly pavement-oriented: rim brakes and close-ratio 2x gearing. This was a reflection of the heavy involvement of road racers in the group’s development, but not a reflection of prevailing trends in the industry like disc brakes, wide range gearing, and 1x drivetrains—trends SRAM had aggressively championed. "
3713,"At eTap’s launch, representatives made no secret that the primer technologies found in SRAM’s other drop bar groups–like hydraulic disc brakes, WiFLi wide-range gearing, and clutch-rear derailleurs with straight parallelograms for 1x drivetrains–would eventually make their way into eTap. "
3714,     RELATED: First Ride: SRAM Red eTap HRD 
3715,"They backed up that statement in late August when hydraulic disc brakes were added to the roster. And late last week, SRAM officially announced a WiFLi rear derailleur option for eTap. "
3716,"WiFLi is SRAM’s name for a 2x drivetrain with wide-range cassette. The short cage eTap rear derailleur officially maxes out with a 28-tooth cog; the eTap WiFLi rear derailleur can take up to a 32-tooth cog. This provides lower gears—for higher cadences and easier hill climbing—than a traditional 2x drivetrain, without needing to sign up for a triple-chainring drivetrain. "
3717,"WiFLi predates SRAM’s foray into 1x drivetrains. In significant ways, SRAM’s 1x is an extension of WiFLi’s core concept: Instead of adding chainrings to increase range, add larger cogs to the cassette, and reduce the number of chainrings. This is desirable because rear derailleurs shift faster and more precisely than front derailleurs. "
3718,"Claimed weight for the eTap WiFLi rear derailleur is 243g with battery, which is just four grams heavier than the short-cage eTap RD. Factor in the extra weight of the Red 11-32 cassette (196g claimed, about 30g heavier than the 11-28), and a few extra chain links and you’re looking at about a 50 gram hit for eTap WiFLi versus the short-cage rear derailleur with 11-28 cassette. The price hit for the eTap WiFLi rear derailleur is $610, $20 more than the short cage. "
3719,     RELATED: SRAM Red eTap is a Step Forward for Electronic Shifting 
3720,"The only technology still not available in Red eTap is a straight parallelogram rear derailleur with clutch (and matching shift-button-less brake levers for cable and hydraulic braking) for 1x drivetrains. In fact, straight-parallelogram/clutch derailleurs for 1x are not available for any Red group: mechanical or electronic. They’re only found at SRAM’s Force and Rival levels."
3721,"So here’s a wild theory: SRAM might skip 11-speed, and (taking a lesson from the company’s Eagle) go straight to 12-speed with 10-50 cassette with its eventual eTap 1x drivetrain. Should that happen, SRAM’s Red eTap would be the most advanced, most versatile, and most diverse, group on the planet."
3722,"Road disc and rim brakes battle it out in the Specialized wind tunnel
"
3723,"As disc brakes have gotten more popular on road bikes, the industry is slowly answering questions about their relevance for skinny-tire riders in terms of reliability, safety, power and, for performance-minded riders, aerodynamics."
3724,"Specialized, currently the only bike company with its own wind tunnel, attempted to answer that last question in the newest video in its “Wind Tunnel” series. "
3725,The company ran two identically equipped 2015 Tarmacs through its wind tunnel: one with conventional rim brakes and one with Shimano’s new R785 hydraulic brakes. The results may surprise you.
3726,"Head-on, there was no quantifiable difference in drag. Only when the bike was angled 10 degrees to simulate a sidewind did Specialized see a split. In this scenario, disc brakes are slightly slower. "
3727,"How much? About eight seconds over a 26-mile course, the company estimates, based on an analysis that takes into account a wider variety of speeds than the standard 30mph wind-tunnel fan speed."
3728,"One interesting quirk: Since discs are only on the non-drive side of the bike, the aero deficit is most significant when the sidewind comes from the rider’s left. Chris Yu, Specialized’s aerodynamics engineer, said they found that when testing yaw on the drive side, the spinning wheels effectively shielded the brakes and minimized the difference. "
3729,"So in the real world, where yaw angle (the direction of a sidewind) shifts dynamically depending on weather and terrain, the aero gap from rim to disc brakes may be even less. And, Yu reminds us in the video, the speed boost from being able to brake later, ride with more confidence, and better modulate speed could make up for the rest of the time difference."

3733,"Silca's owner Josh Poertner defends—and exalts—his $450 SuperPista Ultimate
"
3734, 
3735,Bill Strickland: $450?!
3736,"Josh Poertner: In all honesty, we just optimized every component individually and figured out the price at the end, and it was a bit shocking even to us at the time. The pump began as an experiment: In a modern era, how can you make a forever product, and can inflating your tires become not some mindless chore, but part of the pleasure and enjoyment of being a bicycle rider?BS: So, part of the justification is that this is the last floor pump I'll ever buy?
JP: It really is a forever product. At every step we had to remind ourselves of this, because stuff tends not to be made that way anymore. For instance, one of the few ways to kill one of the good, old Silcas—before they were cheapened to meet a $100 price point—was to dent it. When we told our aluminum-tubing vendors the thickness we wanted—to prevent dents—they said that pump walls don't need to be that thick, that we were throwing our money away. But we weren't—we were building in forever. And we went through this with pretty much every one of the 60-plus subcomponents of this pump.BS: Not all of the cost is about durability. You spent more to make it beautiful too, right?
JP: Well, to me, the foreverness is part of its beauty. You're right, I wanted it to look stunning. But a cool thing about the human brain is that things that are ergonomically brilliant tend to be visually beautiful to us. For instance, we spent so much time on just the bulge of the handle—moving the bulge in and out, changing its diameter, and comparing it with other objects of beauty people touch, like knife handles and guitar necks. The radius where the rosewood meets the stainless-steel knuckle and curves up, that's directly from a Shun Bob Kramer knife, and it fits the index finger exactly, and feels great on the pad of the thumb. There is beauty in sublime usability.
We did dive deep into pure function, too. Shop guys and pro mechanics all told us that pump hoses aren't durable enough—that aside from all the usual bending and twisting, hoses need to withstand being run over by racers and even cars. But all the really durable hoses didn't flex easily enough. On the continuum of available hoses, not one was durable enough and flexible enough. There was no answer! To me, that's where engineering and design get exciting. You have to go someplace new, somewhere completely different. We finally realized the flex of the durable hose wasn't the problem, but its flex to the fittings. So we ended up with custom-machined parts that allow 360-degree movement at each end. Unknown to us at the time, that increased the cost of the hose by a factor of eight.
There were some surprises, like our traditional leather washer turning out to be the best thing for the job of moving air inside the barrel. I assumed we'd need to go high tech for this pump—some better version of the O-ring every modern pump uses. But if you blind test 10 pumps, you'll choose the one that has a leather washer every time. It just feels better. And it lasts. As soon as a grain of sand or grit gets in a barrel, it will nick an O-ring, air starts to leak, and the ring begins to cleave. Pro-team mechanics said the sand at the Tour of Qatar can kill an O-ring pump in a day. They begged us to keep the leather washer."
3737,"BS: You make a pretty good case for the worth of the materials and the pump's function, but it seems you're also assuming there's a high value that's related to using the pump, which not everyone is going to appreciate.
JP: There's an element of cycling I love, when you've done some work on your bike and you go out, and it's just silent. Sometimes I talk to people about that experience, and they look at me like, 'What the hell are you talking about?' I ache for them. With time and effort and learning and attention, you can tune your bike to a point at which when you roll out, all you hear is wind, and that experience is unbelievable. Eventually, once you know that you're creating the possibility of having such a moment on your bike, the work becomes fulfilling in itself. That's an example of how ritual and tools intersect the experience. We want the ritual of pumping your tires to mean something, to be important to you.BS: It seems to me that you might also be trying to make a loud and audacious statement that Silca, which once was legendary for its longevity and quality, is back.
JP: This was not some planned marketing goal or a deliberate expression of some articulated belief I have about the company. But you might be right. I'm a passionate and emotional person, maybe uncommonly so for someone whose background is purely in technical fields. This was a brand that meant something to me, and that emotional connection is shared by a lot of people. They send us pictures of Silca pumps they've owned for years, for decades, and tell us stories about their pumps. The pump becomes for them a representation of trips they've taken, and the people they've taken them with. The pump ages and in some way improves with age, and in that way it accrues its real value—all the stories. That is important to me."
3738,"BS: I believe you. Still, a helluva lot of people aren't going to buy it.
JP: Whenever we can put the pump in people's hands, they instantly get it. I don't mean that they all spend the money to own one, but even people who come in so skeptical about the pump that they think we're doing something evil, when they put their hands on it, there's this moment: ""I get it. I might not buy one, but I get it."""
3739,"High-end, mountain bike apparel maker goes urban 
"
3740,Not too long ago there was an inside joke among cycling journalists that went something like this:
3741,Q: How can you spot a bike journalist just by looking at them?A: They’re wearing Kitsbow.
3742,"Like most jokes, this one had some truth to it. Relative to most other brands, Kitsbow is so incredibly expensive that in its youth, journalists reviewing the goods were the few riders you’d see wearing it. That has changed as the brand has become established, and you now occasionally see it in the wild."
3743,"It's also true that journalists wore plenty of Kitsbow for one simple reason: It rocks. The brand really raised the bar for off-road apparel with its attention to detail, function, and styling. I’ve personally given stellar reviews to a few pieces such as Kitsbow’s shorts and liners. I am still using them today and have yet to wear anything out, even though they’re the most-used pieces of apparel in my collection. They’ve been crashed in, clawed by aggressive brush, and abused in the dryer, and they’ve held up well through it all."
3744,"When Kitsbow announced the release of its new Drifter Jean yesterday, it officially threw its hat into the urban bikewear arena. This comes as little surprise, really. In terms of styling, fit, and materials, the company’s current line is not all that far off from city-friendly lines like Giro’s New Road. And the recently introduced Kitsbow Icon flannel shirt, made with genuine Pendleton wool fabric, already had “urban” written all over it."
3745,"The Drifter has classic five-pocket-jean styling with built-in, cycling-specific function. A four-piece curved waistband creates an ideal fit on the bike, as does a crescent-shaped seam around the knee for easy articulation while pedaling. A blend of 80 percent cotton, 17 percent Cordura nylon, and 3 percent Lycra is durable with a bit of built-in stretch for even more on-bike comfort. Reflective print on the inside of the left leg provides visibility after dark. High-end details such as an interior gusset and fully finished waistband should bring these jeans up to Kitsbow's mountain bike-gear standard—and the $230 price tag."
3746,"​The 2018 version gets more tire clearance, new bar-stem adjustability, and asymmetric design"
3747,"Cannondale’s Synapse first debuted in 2006. Since then, there have been several updates to this endurance road bike. The Synapse has appeared in numerous WorldTour level races, and Cannondale’s professional teams have relied on it for the rough and demanding Spring Classic races. In its latest iteration, Cannondale has made substantial improvements across the board to an already great all-around endurance race machine. While the 2018 version of the bike carries forward features from its predecessor, such as the 25.4mm seatpost and Power Pyramid design at the seat tube and bottom bracket junction; it also boasts a few changes and new features."
3748,RELATED: Best Road Bikes of 2017
3749,"Cannondale re-engineered the Synapse’s SAVE micro-suspension system, a series of flex zones designed into the frame, to give it even more compliance. In that process, the frame and fork both shed a noticeable amount of weight (220 grams and 116 grams, respectively, in the Hi Mod). The Synapse is also intentionally asymmetric from front to the back; it’s very noticeable when you look at the fork blades, chain stays, and the seat tube. The asymmetrical design is stiffer and better accommodates disc braking and pedaling forces. The head tube is also said to be 9.4% stiffer than the one on the previous Synapse."
3750,How to take care of your bike after a big adventure:
3751,"According to its “Size Optimized Engineering” approach, the Synapse has three different fork offsets along with three different head tube diameters and bearing sizes, based on frame size. In making the Synapse, Cannondale uses different carbon lay ups and tubing diameters depending on the size of the bike. This gives the bike consistent handling characteristics no matter what size the bike is."
3752,"Tire clearance has been increased to 32mm, suitable for a bike in this category, and Cannondale included discreet mounts for riders to add full coverage fenders on the inside of the fork blades and seat stays. The Synapse comes with thru-axles for the front and rear. "
3753,
3754,
3755,"One of the more noticeable updates to the new Synapse is its cockpit, including Cannondale’s own SAVE SystemBar bar-stem combination. Aerodynamic and clean-looking, the SystemBar has the aesthetics of a one-piece bar and stem but is a two-piece construction with an aluminum stem and carbon bar. This allows for interchangeable bar and stem widths and lengths along with eight degrees of pitch adjust. The SystemBar also has an integrated computer mount compatible with Garmin and Wahoo Systems and an integrated light mount for Fabric’s Lumaray light. Cable routing is optimized for Shimano Di2, SRAM eTap, and mechanical cables with a port in the down tube providing access to and holding the Di2 junction box neatly out of sight and out of the way. The seat post clamp is also now easily accessed from under the top tube."
3756,How it rides
3757,"I had the opportunity to ride the new Synapse around the hills of Lake Como, Italy, where I checked out the updates firsthand in June. I encountered a variety of road surfaces, long climbs, and fast descents, along with incredible scenery to match. (Need Bucket list ride inspiration? Check out our book full of ideas for your next unforgettable ride!)"
3758,"The bike was stable and balanced front to back. The stiffness of the bike was apparent to me; I felt pedal energy transmitted directly to the ground. As stout as the bike was while climbing and descending through the mountains, it was noticeably forgiving and smooth. A lot of this could be attributed to the 28mm Vittoria Corsa tires that were on the bike, but the quality of the ride extended well beyond that – it was comfortable and predictable. When descending, the Synapse held its own and felt confident at high speeds in tight turns."
3759,
3760,
3761,"Some bikes take a little getting used to, but this one did not. A telling sign of a great bike is when you can ride it without thinking about it being under you so that you can be more involved in the experience of the ride, where you are and who you are with. I was happy to be able to do that on the new Cannondale Synapse."
3762,"The Synapse will be available in two levels of carbon fiber (Hi-mod and Carbon) and both women's and men's models. Both genders models use the same frame and dimensions with only colors and touch-points (saddles and handlebar width in this case) to differentiate. The frames are disc brake compatible only with no rim brake version available. Prices start at $2,499 on the Carbon frame in your choice of Sram Apex or Shimano 105. Ultegra builds start at $2,999 and go to $4,199. The top Carbon models are available with Dura Ace mechanical ($4,999) and SRAM E-tap ($5,999).  Hi-Mod models are available in three trims: unisex Dura Ace Di2 ($9,999) and Dura Ace mechanical ($6,499) and women's and men's SRAM E-tap models ($7,999). Availability is slated for this summer. For more information visit Cannondale.com. "
3763,"Your kid can tear it up for years on the well-crafted Cleary Owl
"
3764,"The rider in front of me stands to pedal up the grade, his body moving in the supple rhythm of comfortable climbing. I look approvingly at the clean lines of his bike, painted a muted sky blue, with a classic faux-leather saddle. I would love a bike like that."
3765,"He carves a turn, slows, and stops carefully at the light."
3766,"""How do you like it?"" I ask."
3767,"""I love it,"" he says, smiling. ""It's so easy to climb, and it's fast. The bigger wheels help with the bumps and riding over things."" Then his attention turns. ""Hey, the light's changing."""
3768,"The rider, my not-quite-six-year-old son, Isaac, looks up at me, waiting for my permission to cross the street. I smile and say, ""Let's go."" Riding next to him, watching my little boy on his new 20-inch Cleary Owl, I'm thinking the two are a beautiful combination."
3769,"In looking for a bike for our son, my wife and I had this conversation with a lot of other parents who are cyclists: Too many kids' bikes are heavy and built to be scrapped within a couple of years. I wouldn't enjoy riding a low-quality bike that weighed nearly as much as I do, so why would my kid?"
3770,That's why we were delighted when we found the Cleary Owl.
3771,"Light and designed for responsive, stable handling, the singlespeed Owl is crafted from steel and features a level of componentry that you don't normally see on kids' bikes: front and rear V-brakes, internal cable routing (yes, really), a three-piece crank, and a quality bottom bracket and headset."
3772,"While by no means inexpensive, $325 is a bargain for a bike this well thought out. All the lightweight parts are sized for kids, and offer enough adjustability that the bike can grow with your little one for a few seasons. Horizontal dropouts allow you to change the gears as your kid gets stronger, and a threadless stem means you can adjust sizing with easy-to-source parts as he or she shoots up in height. Alloy rims are outfitted with smooth pavement tires that offer enough grip and bite for minor off-road excursions. But a quick swap to a set of knobby BMX tires turns the Owl into a very capable first trail bike, too. The front wheel is also fitted with a quick release for easy racking on top of the car."
3773,"For younger children, Cleary also offers a range of bikes that starts with the 12-inch Starfish balance bike ($199 at Competitive Cyclist), and graduates to the 12-inch Gecko ($250 at Competitive Cyclist), with both hand and coaster brakes. Next up is the 16-inch Hedgehog ($310 at Competitive Cyclist) with hand brakes only, and finally the Owl, with hand brakes and a freewheel."
3774,"Who crafts kids' bikes with this much care and thought? Company founder Jeff Cleary left his desk job as a lawyer to pour all of his energy into his recently launched, eponymous bike brand, which just began shipping product this summer. Slim from a life of movement, with hair just going salt and pepper, Cleary is also the guy that every cycling community has—the one you call when you have a question about a repair or are considering a new purchase. That says a lot, given that he lives in Marin County, California, a community already known for its bike inventors and gurus."
3775,"The tortoise-shell eyeglasses perched on Cleary's nose couldn't quite hide the twinkle of excitement in his eyes when I asked him at the Interbike trade show about his motivation to start a new brand in a crowded marketplace—and one aimed at kids, to boot. He smiled and told a story of friends like my wife and me, looking for quality bikes for their kids that were lovingly imbued with the kind of details they cherished on their own bikes. Bikes he wanted his own two kids to ride—that are durable, look good, ride better, and weigh little."
3776,"I'd say he hit a home run. More important, Isaac would agree. As I watch my son pop the front wheel of the Owl up over low curbs and flick the bike up onto grassy banks, I think that it's no wonder he wants to ride his bike to school every day. And to get ice cream. And to kung fu class. And to the library. ""I'm going to ride this everywhere,"" he says, and I believe him."
3777,"After Isaac outgrows his beloved Owl, we'll pass it along in the neighborhood, knowing that it will introduce the joy of a really good bike to many other kids too. Like any well-crafted machine, this bike will keep rolling for many miles—and a lot of smiles."
3778,"The Parlee Z-Zero resolves our test director's every obsessive, neurotic, dangnabbity idiosyncratic demand—including not being flawless
"
3779,"This bicycle does not make me a better, faster rider. It does not bless me with a fit I couldn't achieve with a stock bike and any number of fitting services available in many shops. On a bicycle that costs as much as the wheelset of this one, I could ride happily and well for years.
The simplest way to explain what I wanted is to say that my dream bike rides like a steel bike but is as light as a composite bike and looks right to my eye.
I like the way light bikes feel. I don't think they make me any faster, but I find them more enjoyable to ride because they feel so reactive and alive. My ideal bike would feel like a nervous impala, ready to bolt at the slightest provocation. And I love the sensations of a steel bike, the bit of give and snapback as the bike rocks underneath me. I like the singing hum, I like the flex, and I like my bikes to feel mostly compliant and a little bit damped (rather than the opposite, as many carbon bikes do).
The problem is that steel bikes that ride like steel bikes aren't light. The few times I've tried a ""superlight"" model—usually built with thin-walled, hardened, oversize tubing—I've found the ride jagged and almost grating. And freakishly light build kits—to make a sweet-riding steel frame into a featherweight—end up causing compromises to reliability and functionality I won't accept.
Production composite bikes—especially the light ones—are designed to take advantage of the material's low weight and high stiffness. The better ones are smooth riding and light, but they don't have any spring, and they're more damped than compliant. They're race bikes, designed for ruthless efficiency, and to be unyielding under the tremendous power of pros.
And, without getting into too much minutia, some of the handling traits I most prize have been compromised in stock bikes by a confluence of factors around my particular combination of height and preferred fit, mainstream race bike geometry, and some government regulations that production bikes must abide by."
3780,"Almost as important to me as the ride is how a bike looks. See how the seatpost on this one is drawn out of the frame a moderate amount? How the saddle is clamped slightly rearward of center on an offset post? How there's just one, 10mm spacer between the headset cap and stem? All of that makes me happy. I can get my touch points in the right places on just about any stock bike in my size, but the setup never quite looks perfect to me. A few stock bikes, when set up to fit me, look right to me. But none of them—and I've ridden a lot of stock bikes—also have the feel I want.
The Z-Zero is a great platform for the bike I wanted. Unlike Parlee's previous custom models, the tubing is molded in-house, allowing the company, it says, finer control of the finished frame's qualities. Those tubes are joined by a refined, tube-to-tube construction process that Parlee is hesitant to discuss in depth. The main advantage, according to Parlee, is a decrease in redundant material at the joints, which adds weight and can deaden the ride. The Z-Zero is a better riding bike and—because of the construction method and the elimination of almost all metal from the frame—5- to 10-percent lighter than Parlee's previous top-of-the-line model, the Z1.
My frame weighed 960 grams (with a 320g fork)—and with the lavish paint you see here. Not just one more black-white-and-red bike—you're welcome—its colors are inspired by my favorite racer, Mr. Eddy Merckx, in a scheme I basically ripped off from Speedvagen. Mindful of the paint, and the round tubes, I outfitted the bike like a modern interpretation of a classic race bike. The drivetrain is Campagnolo, because that's what Eddy used, but in an electronic version because it's better than mechanical. I stuck 23mm Challenge silk tubulars to shallow, 1,025-gram carbon Xentis Squad 2.5 wheels. The saddle, a Selle San Marco Regale, is an updated version of the classic Regale. I went with a Ritchey WCS carbon bar, stem, and post because I know they're light and practically flawless. Bottle cages are King Cage Titanium: none are better. With Garmin Vector power pedals, the whole bike is a shade under 14 pounds, 8 ounces.
It's not the best bike I've ever ridden, because I don't think there is a such a thing. This is probably my favorite bike, however. And the bike that makes me happiest. It is not perfect. I've never ridden a perfect bike, and I imagine if I did it would be boring. I hate boring bikes. My Parlee, while compliant, is a little buzzy on marred tarmac and rougher surfaces like fresh chip seal. Torsionally, the bike is a touch on the soft side. While I prefer something springier than today's average super bike—and in fact asked Parlee to appease that desire—I found the bike slightly vague when cornering aggressively and descending at speeds in excess of 45mph. These aren't screw-ups or failures. All bikes, even ones that are custom to the nth like mine, are a flood of compromises, and will never be exactly what we imagined. This one is closer than any other I've ridden. And that's enough for a dream."
3781,"We like the $12,000 BMC teammachine SLR01—but we love the $2,300 SLR03 version
"
3782,"On the last day of Bicycling's Editors' Choice testing this year, I embarked on a long ride that took me into the curving mountain roads of North Carolina. The bike I rode was one of the year's top models, but it left an unusual impression: Compared with the other two finalists in the race bike category, it was surprisingly bland."
3783,"I was so struck by this that I brought the BMC teammachine SLR01 home with me to test it on my home roads in Durango, Colorado.
My opinion didn't change.
By any of the standards I typically use to evaluate a bike, the $12,000 SLR01, equipped with Dura-Ace Di2, was excellent. It did everything right and nothing wrong. Yet I couldn't pinpoint any standout traits. So when the time came to review BMC's less-expensive Teammachine SLR03 105, I expected a similarly uninspring ride.
Happily, I was wrong. Even as a gear snob who loves superlight bikes, I find the SLR03105 to be far more entertaining than its pro-team predecessor. And, it's $9,700 cheaper.
BMC didn't sacrifice aesthetics to lower the cost. With nearly identical paint jobs and tube shaping, the SLR03 and SLR01 look so much alike that it takes a longer look to tell them apart. One giveaway is the external cable routing on the 03, versus internal on the 01. This isn't necessarily a drawback—cables outside the tubes are much easier to work on, so your mechanic may buy you beer for a change.
Similar frame geometry—the 51cm and 54cm SLR01 and SLR03 frames are identical in terms of angles—means that value-oriented buyers of the 03 experience the same handling as 01-riding pros on the BMC Racing Team. That said, BMCs are among the steadiest of race bikes, more suited to descending mountain passes at frightening velocities than battling in a criterium."
3784,"More significant differences hide beneath the surface. At 1,230 grams (claimed), the SLR03 frame outweighs the SLR01's by 440 grams. This is primarily because the 03 uses heavier carbon and resins, says BMC spokesman Peter Nicholson. The 03 also lacks some of the weight-saving details of the premium bike—it has aluminum dropouts instead of carbon ones, for example. Despite using less-expensive composites, the 03 frame is nearly as stiff and compliant as the 01's.
Still, the bikes rode very differently. When I mashed the pedals on the 18.5-pound SLR03, it didn't jump as quickly as the 13.1-pound SLR01. But once awakened, the 03 sprinted well—I just had to kick a beat before my friends on their 13-pound wonder bikes.
The SLR03's Shimano 105 5800 11-speed drivetrain was also a thing of beauty, shifting with more smoothness and precision than any of the Dura-Ace 9000 groups I've tried. The Shimano RS010 wheels and Continental Ultra Sport 2 tires performed well too.
Not all the parts were dreamy, however. Though comfortable to use, the Shimano R561 brakes felt low on power, requiring a heroic lever squeeze to stop me quickly. The excellent Shimano 105 crankset had my test bike shifting crisply, but production bikes will come with a lower-end, Shimano RS500 crankset.
Where the 03 eclipses the 01 is ride feel. The SLR03 is a beautiful-riding bike. Even on its 23mm tires, I didn't feel the need to dart and weave around holes and lumps in the pavement. The effects of unavoidable bumps were mitigated compared with riding on the less-damped SLR01.
If the 03 were any more compliant, it might feel lifeless and slow. Instead, it strikes an excellent balance of stiffness and damping. It is smooth and feels fluid, allowing just enough of the right kind of sensations to pulse through at just the right frequencies. This sweet balance eludes a lot of bikes, including the 01. On my last ride on the 03, I covered 20 miles of dirt road with juddering bumps and fresh-laid gravel. I've ridden many bikes on that road, and the SLR03 was among the smoothest, most composed, and most fun.
After many satisfying miles on the SLR03, I think back to that day I pedaled the beautiful roads of North Carolina on BMC's premier bike. I'd like to do that ride again. But this time, I'd leave the $13,000 bike at home and take this $2,300 bike, which is filled with character."

Remennik brings all that knowledge and experience to Vanhawks."
3789,"The concept is simple: the Valour marries aerodynamics, functionality, and technology to create a bicycle perfectly adapted for urban riding. A gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, speed sensor, and GPS receiver are built right into the Valour’s carbon fiber frame, creating a bike that keeps track of where and how you ride. In other words, the Valour actually “learns” about your tendencies as a rider by tracking data including your routes, distance, speed, and time in real time and sending it back to your phone via Bluetooth."
3790,"Rider and bike safety were key considerations when designing the Valour. Each bike gathers route information as you ride—where potholes are located, which roads are closed, which aren’t safe for cyclists, and so on. That information is uploaded to the Valour network so other riders can have the same data in real time. LED handlebar indicators connect to your smartphone’s GPS navigation system and give you turn-by-turn instructions toward safer routes. This reduces the distractions that come from having to look at your smartphone screen for directions. The Valour also includes the industry’s first sensor-driven blind-spot detector: The bike’s grips vibrate to alert you about possible unseen objects before you turn or drift into either direction—a handy feature for an urban commuter. And the Valour’s electronic network also serves as an anti-theft feature. When one goes missing, other Valour owners are alerted, and sensors aid in its recovery."

3807,"The first generation of Giant’s Propel aero road frame was launched in 2013, and has remained in the brand’s line largely unchanged. For a top end race frame from a major brand–with a Pro Tour race team–that’s a very long time. But it looks like Giant is about ready to unveil the first major revision to the Propel. At the 2017 Tour de France we spotted this a new Propel with disc brakes under Australian sprinter Michael Matthews.

By using disc brakes, Giant’s frame design team was able to clean up and minimize the shape of the fork, and the seat stays, potentially reducing drag in those areas. The Propel Disc is designed for flat mount brake calipers. Which is good, because team sponsor Shimano’s new Dura Ace calipers are only offered for flat mount."

But there are come changes to the headtube and top tube which hint at a laterally/torsionally stiffer frame. And because it’s a carbon frame, there could be loads of unseen changes that can significantly change the way the new Propel performs in comparison to the outgoing model.

3862,"Like we’ve seen with fat bikes, a wider rim allows for a lower tire pressure, thanks to the increased surface area. This lower PSI increases the contact area of the tire, allowing more knobs to grip the ground in the direction of the cornering force to improve grip. A wider rim also lends better support to the tire, creating a more square profile. This all but eliminates the risk of tire roll when cornering and traversing, improving control no matter the trail conditions."
3863,RELATED: These are the best mountain bikes of 2017
3864,"The wider tires also build taller, and have room to give when rolling over rocks and roots. This allows you to run lower pressures while riding more aggressively, since it takes a much bigger impact to go through the tires and cause damage to the rim."

No, what drew us in is the claimed +/- 1 percent accuracy and its low range. Kappius makes three versions of the Digital Pressure Gauge: a mountain bike version that measures 0–50 psi; a cyclocross/low-pressure mountain bike version that tops out at 30 psi; and even a fat bike–specific version with a max readout of 15 psi. These narrow ranges offer higher resolution, or precision, to the pressure reading, so it’s easier to fine-tune your tire pressure in situations like cyclocross or snow biking where only a handful of psi makes a big difference."

3925,"Nearly ubiquitous on trail bikes, dropper posts are now headed to drop bar bikes
"
3926,"Take a look around any popular mountain bike trailhead, and you will see a sizable number of bikes equipped with a dropper, or height-adjust, seatpost. With the push of a button or flip of lever, a mechanism unlocks and, using the rider’s weight on the saddle, allows the inner post to slide into the outer post, lowering the saddle height. Weight off the saddle, another push or flip triggers an air spring to return the post to full height."
3927,"What’s the point? A dropper allows the rider to lower their center of gravity for better cornering, and gets the saddle out of the way for more confident maneuvering on technical terrain. But, when it’s time to hammer smooth trails and climbs, a quick push puts the saddle back to full height for pedaling efficiency. Moving the saddle up and down sounds like a small thing, but a dropper post can transform a mountain bike ride; the rider feels more in control, rides faster, and has more fun. Really."
3928,"And now these posts are coming to drop-bar road, or road-ish, bikes. The Specialized Diverge Carbon Di2 adventure/gravel/all-road (whatever you want to call this category that merges characteristics of cyclocross and classic bikes) comes with the company’s Command Post XCP dropper. "
3929,"I asked Chris Wehan, product manager for the Diverge, what he thought the advantages of a dropper on a road-ish bike were. “By lowering the saddle, the rider can lower their center of gravity and hopefully descend better,"" he said. ""With the seat only lowering 35mm, the rider can still use his or her legs to help control the bike. Another added benefit is that when a rider hits a bump, especially while descending, the saddle will not hit them in the butt and force more of their weight forward.”"
3930,"I’m such a believer in dropper posts that it’s now hard for me to imagine riding a mountain bike without one, so I’m excited and curious to see how a dropper feels on a drop bar bike. Just guessing, I’d expect it to be pretty wonderful for cyclocross racing, sketchy gravel road riding, and some of the light singletrack riding that is so fun on a disc-equipped gravel or cross bike. For pure pavement riding, I’m not quite sure, though I would presume that for high-speed descents and aggressive cornering on pavement, a dropper would offer most of the same advantages it does off-road."
3931,"Specialized says the XCP dropper weighs, without remote, 395 grams in its 350mm length and 415 grams in its 400mm length. Compare that to 215 grams for the Specialized Pro Carbon 2-Bolt rigid post—droppers drop saddles, not weight. The XCP post has a 27.2mm frame insert, however the post widens significantly midway up, which limits the saddle height adjustment range to about 60mm."
3932,"The XCP post features 35mm of drop (a typical mountain bike dropper has 125mm of drop), a handlebar remote, and internal cable routing. Today’s mid- to high-end full-suspension mountain bikes typically have provisions for internally routed dropper posts, but no drop bar frames that I’m aware of are designed to accept a dropper post. The Diverge Carbon Di2’s internal routing is somewhat pirated, explains Wehan: “If the bike is set up [with] electronic [shifting], then we have an open cable port that allows a rider to use the dropper post. If the bike is a full mechanical bike, then that hole is full and we do not have room for the dropper cable and housing.”"
3933,"Unlike mountain droppers, which can have multiple positions within their range, the XCP has two: extended and dropped 35mm. Specialized’s dropper posts are on the simpler end of the spectrum: they use shift cable and housing for the remote, and a basic mechanical release system. Many dropper posts use hydraulic release mechanisms; the RockShox Reverb uses a hydraulic remote. The remote on the Diverge is road specific, with a lever that is “easier to engage from a normal road position,” says Wehan."
3934,"The downside of droppers, besides weight, is their extreme unreliability. They have a lot going on in a confined space, and they’re subjected to a lot punishment from the constant bouncing of a rider’s mass. Problems range from excess play to bigger issues like hydraulic failures, air spring failures, and broken metal pieces—just a fact of life for most dropper-equipped mountain bikers. Reliability has been improving, but in general, it's a “not if, but when” question. Still, most mountain bikers I know are willing to put up with questionable reliability to enjoy the benefits of a dropper."
3935,"Before you go sticking a dropper on any old road bike, be aware that a long-drop post designed for mountain bikes can only slide so far into the frame before it is stopped by a seal collar at the top of the outer post. Also be aware that a post with an internally routed remote will likely require drilling a hole in the frame: buh-bye, warranty. There are droppers with external remote routing, but the remote line will need to be taped or zip-tied to the frame. Some posts do not have a remote and instead have a toggle on the post itself, but this requires the rider to take a hand off the bars and reach between their legs to drop or raise the post. Because most performance mountain bikes today use larger diameter seat tubes, most dropper posts are offered in 31.6 and 30.9mm diameters; 27.2mm options are more limited."
3936,"Will road droppers become a thing? The additional weight, complication, and unreliability of the category will make their acceptance challenging. Mountain bikers have found the increased speed and control is worth the hassle, but the benefits might not be quite as clear-cut on smoother and less technical terrain. But hey, everyone loves going faster and feeling more in control, even guys with drop bars."

3943,"Maybe he likes it, maybe he doesn't. But it doesn’t matter because there’s no shutting the doors and turning off the lights on this party. We’re here. And we keep coming. Sixty two of us in all, for the inaugural D&L Fat Epic, a 200K (or half-distance 100K for those who aren’t so sure about the whole enchilada) race that runs along the D&L Trail, a historic 165-mile old coal-carrying trail that winds along the banks of the Delaware and Lehigh rivers in Pennsylvania. There isn’t a flake of snow to be found, but nobody seems to mind, as they squeeze each other’s giant tires and debate the merits of running double-digit pressure on what is going to be a fast-rolling ride."
3944,"An action cam drone buzzes over us during staging, and we all grin and wave and hoot and holler, anxious to put our fat tires in motion. They say, “Go!” and we’re off. It’s probably the slowest rolling start I’ve been party to. But it doesn’t take long before we’re humming along at a brisk clip of over 17mph, and riders start falling off the back of the pack."
3945,"I laugh again. It’s basically a fat bike road race. It’s so dumb, it’s fun. After about 3.5 hours, the pack whittles away until there were are six of us at the turnaround. I get shelled at mile 92 and catch up with another guy who gets spit off the back shortly after. The race comes down to a sprint finish (seriously) at seven hours and change. "

3948,"As we pull into the lot a short stretch later, it dawns on me that just a year ago, this race probably wouldn’t have been possible. Definitely not two years ago. Tom Dunn, who runs Hilltop Bicycles in Summit, New Jersey, says, “Last year we sold four [fat bikes] and nobody had stock to meet the demand, so we couldn’t get more. This year we’ve sold 16. We literally can’t keep them in stock.” "
3949,"It’s not just mountain bikers who are buying fat bikes, Dunn says, but also roadies and triathletes who want to stay active in the outdoors over the winter. Dunn is also seeing fat bike buyers upgrading their bikes with custom parts, as prices come down and options expand."
3950,"Dunn’s talking about folks like Jake Wade, the winner of the D&L Fat Epic, who bought his first fat bike last year, quickly upgraded it months later, and is now eyeing up a top-of-the-line fat bike for next season. Wade says his bike is around 31 pounds, while top-end bikes can be 25 and under. He says, “I’m definitely going to get another, higher-end fat bike. I am completely sold on them. I ride it everywhere and will probably race it as much as I can. I just really love riding them.”"
3951,"It’s a sentiment I hear over and over. People are actually making fat bikes their rig of choice for off-road riding. And not just in places where it seems logical like Alaska, Minnesota, and Michigan, but in New England, too, where the singletrack is skinny, rooty, and most importantly, hilly. Fat bike races, like the D&L Fat Epic seem to be popping up in every market—snow or no snow. And in a move that has many non-fat-bikers shaking their heads, USA Cycling has added a fat bike national championship race to its 2015 calendar, meaning there will be a stars-and-stripes jersey for the fatty set. Seeing an opportunity to tap into this market, Carmichael Training Systems is even having a fat bike training camp in Breckenridge, Colorado this year. "
3952,
3953,
3954,"In a sport that can sometimes be slow and cautious to adopt change (how long did it take us to accept 29ers?), fat bikes seem to have steamrolled in overnight. Specialized even introduced 20- and 24-inch fat bikes for kids earlier this year."
3955,"“It’s crazy how big it got in a short period of time,” says Nic Sims, US marketing manager at Scott Bikes, which Sims says is completely cleaned out of fat bike inventory. “Everything that is coming in is already pre-sold. We even sold off our demo fleet. I think the appeal is the simplicity. Nobody is trying to convince them the fat bike does anything better than something else. It’s just, ‘Get out on your bike and ride and explore and have fun.’”"
3956,"I think Sims is onto something there. When you hop aboard a fat bike, there’s no question that you’re out for play. They inspire adventure. When I look in my garage, I can see the “evolution toward adventure” as viewed by tire width: from my tri bike to my road bike to my cross bike, then my mountain bike, and now the fat bikes I’m testing. Where the road and trails end, the fat bike comes in."
3957,"“It extends the season,” says Jake Schuppe, a coach with CTS, who is helping to run the company’s first fat bike training camp. “It helps you stay fresh, because it’s fun. You can just go out and explore places without skis. They’re not about being fast, but they’re not necessarily slow either.”"
3958,"They’re not, as I have discovered firsthand, but they are definitely slower—I’d argue, in a not-so-fun way in some situations—like in the kind of snow you need a thinner tire to knife into rather than slip and skate around the top of. And because they carry nearly all their weight in those giant hoops, they can be difficult to push up steep climbs. There’s also a learning curve because they handle very differently than a typical mountain bike. Those big tires have fast rebound even at low pressure and I found myself bouncing like a giant, out-of-control basketball once or twice."
3959,"Which is why you’re now seeing the evolution of suspension for fat bikes, including the Rock Shox Bluto fork and the full-suspension Salsa Bucksaw. Riders are now taking these bikes on rough, technical terrain where suspension can complement the fat tires for added stability, control, and fun."
3960,"Fat bikes have always been best where they are fastest—where there’s no trail. But as increased demand meets rapidly improving technology, where fat bikes are fastest could change just as quickly as their popularity has risen."
3961,"While I won’t be trading in my regular mountain bike anytime soon, I definitely look forward to coming along for the ride and seeing where these fat tires end up going."

3963,Editor's Note: This review first published in the October 2016 print edition of Bicycling.
3964,"Wonderfully unscripted. That’s what I like about a ride on a bike as capable as the Gan GR-S. It plays to pointing the wheels in any direction you please, confident that you’ll be able to conquer whatever pops up."
3965,"The Gan GR-S spans multiple genres. It has similar tube shaping as the Dogma K8-S used by Team Sky in the European Spring Classics, and the same elastomer bumper in the seatstays and Pinarello’s Flexstays chainstays that combine to deliver a centimeter of travel that can be tuned to rider preference and weight. It also has aero shaping, down to the Kamm tail on the Pinarello house-brand Tiger stem, and the signature comfortable Onda fork with curved blades, which have so long existed in the canon of Pinarello we could easily forget how radical they looked when they were introduced."
3966,     RELATED: Pinarello's 2017 Line Features Some Totally Crazy Bikes
3967,"But the Gan GR-S also has a helping of adventurous capability. The geometry is dialed for off-road riding, with slacker head and seat angles than the K8-S. With clearance for 38mm tires (even though our tester was outfitted with Vittoria Adventure 32mm rubber), and fittings for racks and fenders, it’s poised for light bikepacking, gravel racing, and alternative-road wandering."
3968,"It’s also one of the best-riding Pinarellos I’ve ever been on. This Gan feels as if it were designed and built with more allegiance to compliance and rider comfort than to pursuing the ultimate in stiffness and lightness. Sculpted to hug the road and wail over less-than-stellar terrain, and built with a full complement of Shimano Ultegra components (including hydraulic disc brakes) and wheels held by 12mm thru-axles, the Gan GR-S is a thoroughly modern gravelraceradventuretouringlightbikepacking son of a gun. But it’s one with WorldTour-ready heritage in its DNA, and a huge helping of Italian flair."
3969,"Company becomes first bike brand to control its own aero testing facility
"
3970,"Specialized’s latest aero innovation is not a bike, a wheel, a skin suit, shoe cover, or helmet; it’s a wind tunnel at the company’s Morgan Hill campus. The visually striking new facility will immediately become central to the company’s ongoing mission of improving aerodynamics across a broad range of its products, and makes the company the only bike brand with full control over its own aero testing.
In the past, like other bike companies interested in measuring their bikes’ aerodynamics, Specialized engineers traveled with their prototypes to test facilities including the A2 Wind Tunnel in North Carolina. To build a tunnel that could match A2’s precision, Specialized recruited Chris Yu, a PhD candidate at Stanford University in the field of High Fidelity Flow Simulation. Yu worked with longer-tenured Specialized employees Mark Cote, Chris D’Aluisio, and Chuck Teixeira to design and develop the tunnel. Between them, the four brought more than 20,000 hours of wind tunnel experience to the project.
Housed in a part of a warehouse that was once used to mold water bottles (and still houses a facility for screen printing them), the tunnel is about 100 feet long, with a test chamber that’s 30 feet long, 16 feet wide, and 10 feet tall—large enough, says Specialized, to test four or five riders in a team time trial formation. Like some other low-speed wind tunnels, Specialized’s facility has a “pull” design that uses six 75 horsepower fans positioned at the back of the tunnel to suck air through the horn-shaped inlet. Once inside the tunnel, air flows through an 8-inch thick hexagonal honeycomb that smoothes out turbulence as it accelerates toward the test chamber. Finally, before hitting the test subject, air passes through a mesh screen for further smoothing.
Specialized said it has tested air speeds as fast as 62 mph, and that the tunnel is capable of even higher speeds—and of speeds as slow as 5 mph. At the back end of the tunnel, a series of eye-catching carbon forms help to speed air out of the tunnel to avoid a build up of pressure against the back of the tunnel, which can distort data and has proven problematic in other tunnels with relatively small test chambers (aerospace tunnels have a much larger test chamber).
Like most wind tunnels, there’s a platform in the center of the test chamber, to which fixtures are mounted for securing subjects. Specialized’s platform can rotate through 360 degrees to facilitate data collection at different yaw angles. Underneath the platform is a complex balance that works in a similar manner to your bathroom scale; the only difference being that instead of measuring downward pressure, it measures forces pushing against the test subject. Yu’s algorithm then uses that metric to calculate drag figures.
The company is tight lipped on the balance, which was designed by Chuck Teixeira, but said that they believe it will be as accurate as the system in place in the best wind tunnels currently used for cycling, and will exceed others.
The company plans to use the tunnel in two ways: First, product engineers will be able to quickly evaluate new designs—and the company hinted that anything from road bikes to downhill rigs would go into the tunnel. Second, Specialized will use tunnel data in conjunction with Computational Fluid Dynamics software, Specialized Racing Data Acquisition System (a bike-mounted telemetry collection unit), and Body Geometry Fit tools to help sponsored athletes achieve a position that’s both aerodynamically efficient and practical in real-world situations."

3976,The latest version of Super 2R contains a 360fly camera for maximum recording
3977,"Bell will offer its Super 2R helmet with an integrated 360fly camera in a package so sleek it’s hard to tell there’s even a camera involved. Unlike most action cameras that attach to and stick out from the helmet, this system maintains the smooth lines of the helmet with a slight protrusion from the top for the 360fly’s lens. A standard 360fly is about the size and shape of a tennis ball, but engineers have figured out a way to flatten and integrate this into a Super 2R."
3978,     RELATED: Review: Bell Super 2 and 2R
3979,"As a standalone camera, the 360fly’s technology is unique. It records video in 360 degrees, as its name suggests, and it does so with a single lens and sensor. After recording, a user can rotate the video to see different perspectives—even straight up above the rider. The 360fly captures HD 4K-quality video at 30 frames per second. The WiFi- and Bluetooth-enabled device has an integrated GPS sensor, accelerometer, and barometer; the battery and 16-gigabyte memory are integrated into the standard, non-helmet 360fly camera to keep it waterproof, so this one is likely similar since it has the same two-hour battery life. Even though it’s built into the helmet, the camera can be removed and used in capacities otherthan riding. "
3980,

3982,"In addition to the Super 2R, Bell will also offer the integrated 360fly in its Star street motorbike helmet, Moto 9 Flex motocross helmet, and Edit snowsport helmet. Details such as pricing and weight are not yet offered, but Bell expects availability around fall of this year. Although this technology is integrated into a gravity-oriented full-face helmet, it could plausibly spread to other models at some point as well. Thanks to the 360fly’s ability to record 360 degrees, advances could turn this into a safety device for road and urban riding, so it’s quite possible we could see similar integration into all helmet models in the future. Bell alludes to that possibility with the development of Collision Avoidance Alert that can sense and alert riders to dangers outside of their peripheral vision. Other technologies still in development include AutoPilot action tracking, which will allow users to track and follow main subjects in videos, as well as live streaming, so there’s much more to come."

3984,1x takes one more step toward being a basic human right
3985,"Although SRAM has steadily trickled down the technology from its top-of-the-line, XX1 one-by-eleven (1x11) mountain group since 2012, a 1x drivetrain—a single chainring with a wide-range cassette to provide a similar gear range to a 2x system—was still a premium offering unless you wanted to hack it with a conversion kit. But when SRAM released its GX group last spring, it slashed the minimum buy-in to $564, and as low as $3,500 for a complete bike with GX. And just like that, more of us could dream of one day owning a clean-looking bike with simpler shifting and more handlebar real estate."
3986,"GX is almost identical to SRAM's higher-end X1 and X01 groups, primarily differing in materials and manufacturing. The biggest saving: The X01 and XX1 10-42 cassettes are machined from a single piece of steel, while the GX version is held together by stainless steel pins. More affordable materials are also used in the crankset, crankarms, chain, and the derailleur—which otherwise share the same features as their X1/X01 counterparts. The weight penalty: 221 grams over the $1,335 X01 group."
3987,     RELATED: Should You Get a 1x Drivetrain on Your Road Bike?
3988,"Tested on my Scott Contessa Genius 710, GX shifting felt clean and responded to the same light, quick touch as its premium counterparts. When the terrain really undulated and I was toggling gears often, the shifting was just slightly less refined compared with the X1/X01-equipped bike I'd also been recently riding. But GX was still accurate and reliable, and I could swiftly dump two to three gears when needed. The derailleur is designed to keep the chain taut and quiet, and it does, and the chainring's alternating narrow and wide teeth prevent chain drop. GX is compatible with SRAM's higher-end 1x11 groups so you can save on replacement parts. And it's also available as a 2x with the 10-42 cassette for a monstrous gear range."

4003,"Three years into belt-drive development, Gates latest iteration is less finicky and a whole lot smoother"
4004,"If you’re into belt drives, you probably already know Gates has a new belt and pulley design to address the drawbacks of the original Carbon Drive. If you’re not paying attention to all things belt drive: Hey, guess what? Gates has a new belt and pulley design to address the drawbacks of the original Carbon Drive. It’s called CenterTrack—so named because the pulleys have a center ridge which mates to a belt with bifurcated teeth."
4005, 
4006,"There are two primary advantages of the CT system over the original Carbon Drive. First, the system is more tolerant of misalignment and the ridge prevents the belt from walking off the pulleys. And, second, the pulleys are narrower, making packaging, particularly with internally geared hubs, easier. Though original Carbon Drive was already quite good in mud and snow, Gates claims CenterTrack is more impervious because the pulleys don’t have “sides” and debris can just fall away. Another benefit: The pulleys don’t look like hamster wheels anymore. Gates bumped up the width of the CT belt 2mm to 12mm, which strengthens and stiffens the belt and doesn’t require as much tension, says Gates."
4007, 
4008,"I’ve been riding an original Carbon Drive equipped bike for about three years. I love it because not only is it maintenance free—no lube required, and the belt lasts longer than a chain—but it takes the purity of the single-speed experience and amplifies it. Properly set up, a belt is much smoother and quieter than a chain. It’s difficult to convey how much more exactly, but trust me: If you ride a belt, you’ll immediately notice the difference. No, it doesn’t feel stretchy or rubbery. It feels as direct and positive as a chain, which Gates attributes to carbon cords inside the belt."
4009, 
4010,"There’s no doubt, however, that original Carbon Drive can be finicky. I worked through belt tension issues (too loose and it skipped; too tight and there was unwanted drag) and belt movement issues (not just static alignment, but it seemed like frame flex, either from rough terrain or hard pedaling, could cause the belt to walk also)."
4011, 
4012,"The new CenterTrack design is much easier to live with. It’s as tolerant of misalignment as a chain and will not walk. Combined with the lower tension requirements and narrower pulley profile, it’s much easier to install and set up as well. My CT system was also noticeably smoother and quieter than the original Carbon Drive I pulled off my Spot Rocker. I’m told that I am feeling the absence of the “friction spray” coating that adorns original Carbon Drive pulleys. CT doesn’t need it, so the system runs more smoothly. Gates also switched from aluminum to stainless steel for CT’s the rear pulleys, which they claim is, “barely heavier… yet far more robust.”"
4013, 
4014,
4015,
4016, 
4017,"Like the original Carbon Drive, CT belts are not repairable—the only way to “fix” a broken belt is to replace it—and must be handled somewhat carefully when not installed. Bending or twisting the belt too aggressively will damage the carbon cords inside, and can lead to failure. So far, I haven’t broken a belt (a few riders in my area have broken original Carbon Drive belts), and I’ve had more than a few rocks and sticks jam into the drivetrain. Still, I’d suggest carrying a spare belt if you’re headed out on an epic backcountry adventure."
4018, 
4019,"Front CenterTrack pulleys will cost $56 to $78 (the bigger the pulley, the more they cost). Rears will sell for $85 plus-or-minus a few bucks depending on size. CT belts will sell for $69 to $91 depending on length. Weights, according to my scale: 46T front pulley, 92g; 28T rear pulley, 93g; belt 88g."

4021,"Bontrager RLX Thermal Long Sleeve Jersey
I knew Bontrager’s RLX thermal long sleeve jersey was a winner the minute I zipped it up because it felt awkwardly uncomfortable. The front felt short and the chest area tight and constrictive—while worn in a normal standing position. But that’s often the sign of a great fit while in the cycling position. And once I got on the bike, this great jersey seemed to disappear. Bontrager’s Fitted cut is perfect for my 6-foot-tall, 165-pound frame, offering a close fit without bunching at the zipper or leaving excess material flapping in the wind. Sleeve length is on the long side, but that’s a plus since it guarantees there won’t be exposed skin at the glove – one of my biggest pet peeves. A tall collar helps keep the neck warm, too.
Bontrager’s Profila thermal fabric is soft, fuzzy, and warm on the inside yet breathable enough not to get soaked during anaerobic efforts. I’ve worn it by itself in temperatures as low as the 60s, paired it with a long-sleeve base layer in the 50s, and with the addition of a vest or light windbreaker, worn it comfortably in the high 40s. Because of its form fit, I’ve also been able to use it as an insulating layer under a winter jacket.
A full-length zipper allows for easy temperature regulation: Zip it all the way up when you're cold, or keep it open and your jersey flapping in the wind during hard, sweaty climbs. Plus, the zipper features an internal draft flap that keeps cold air from passing through – it’s a small but appreciated detail. Three roomy open back pockets and one zippered security pocket offer generous storage for additional cold-weather gear and ride supplies. Reflective logos and trim add evening visibility. The jersey is available in black, blue, red, and hi-viz yellow.—Ron KochPrice: $110Info: bontrager.com"

4024,"Nalini Cunevo Lady Thermal Long Sleeve Jersey
As an endurance-oriented cyclist, I am fussy about my winter cycling jerseys. If I’m going to be on the road, paths, or trails for three-plus hours on a damp, gray Mid-Atlantic day, I want a jersey that is warm, functional, and visible. I also want it to look good because it lifts my mood a little to roll out feeling sharp and stylish instead of bulky and blah. Nalini’s new Cunevo thermal jersey checks all these boxes and then some.
First off, I love that it has three pockets. Far too many winter pieces try to get away with one large, zippered cargo pocket. Granted, some of those jerseys and jackets have sewn-in inner compartments, but you try fishing anything out of them with lobster mitts on. Three distinct, easy-to-reach pockets are a blessing for sure. The sleeves extend well past my wrists, so there’s zero exposed flesh—another winter-jersey pet peeve—in the riding position. The microfleece interior and honeycomb-pattern exterior make this sleek, midweight jersey surprisingly warm. It’s likely too thin to be worn by itself in states that kiss the Canadian border, but it’s good for temps far lower than its rating of 54 to 64 degrees. I would cook in the Cunevo at anything above 50. Worn over a long-sleeve base layer, I found it perfectly comfortable in the mid to upper 40s.
Though it’s available in basic black and white options, the fluorescent pink was a very welcome—and highly visible—ray of sunshine against the dreary backdrop of oppressive overcast skies and brine-coated pavement. The soft outer shell seems to snag a bit easily, so I’ll have to take care when venturing off road, but this beauty is sure to see some heavy rotation as I roll through another winter on the road.—Selene YeagerPrice: $149Info: nalini.com"

I keep pulling this jersey out of my crowded closet. Its look is reminiscent of a retro track jacket—my tester is a deep purple with a white stripe running up each sleeve, and a burnt orange storm flap under the full-length zipper adds a bit of “pop” and keeps out the wind.
But it isn’t just the casual, classic aesthetics that make this my favorite long-sleeve jersey. The De Marchi keeps me warm and comfortable in a variety of conditions. Made of soft microfiber fleece, the Thermal Racing Jersey was more than sufficient with just a long-sleeve base layer and a wind vest during one six-hour ride in mid-30 temps. And layered under a windproof shell, the thermal provided the insulation needed for a four-hour ride in the high 20s. I never overheated or turned into a sweaty mess, even when I went overboard with the layers.
Three pockets in the back allowed me to keep food, tools, credit card, and phone sorted and easy to access. And I actually appreciated the lack of a silicone gripper along the waistband—it made for a soft and comfortable fit that was more similar to my favorite hoodie than a bike jersey. Quality materials and Italian construction have helped this piece withstand countless machine wash-and-dry cycles (don’t judge me).

4028,Zipp's newest wheel uses whale technology to improve stability and aerodynamics
4029,"Will whales make cyclists faster? That’s the question posed by Zipp’s newest wheelset, the 454 NSW."
4030,"The attention-grabbing shape of the 454 NSW road wheel—Zipp calls the nodes HyperFoils, and yes that is trademarked—was inspired by whale flippers, and is claimed to improve stability in crosswinds."
4031,
4032,
4033,"The short version of the 454 NSW Carbon Clincher’s story is this: It's lighter (the claimed wheelset weight is 1,525g), stiffer, and more aerodynamic than a 404 NSW, but with the crosswind stability of a 303. At $4,000, they’re also Zipp’s most expensive wheelset, offered only in a carbon clincher (not tubeless-compatible) and only for rim brakes (for now), but available to buy immediately."
4034,"Zipp’s wheel category manager Jason Fowler led off the 454’s launch presentation by laying out a fundamental aero-wheel compromise: A low-drag (faster) wheel will have more side force, which is less stable; a low side-force wheel is more stable, but will have more drag, therefore being slower."
4035,
4036,
4037,While aero wheels as a category have become more stable—and Zipp deserves credit for helping lead the way with the Firecrest wide and blunt-nosed rim shape introduced in 2010—there’s still a fundamental trade-off.
4038,Zipp wanted a way around the trade-off: a simultaneous reduction of aero drag and side force.
4039,And they found it in whale flippers. 
4040,     RELATED: First Look: Zipp 404 NSW Wheels
4041,"Biomimicry is a trend in engineering that, according to Michael Hall, Zipp director of advanced development, “look[s] to nature to solve complex engineering problems.” A well-known example would be the drag-reducing surface texture of Olympic swimmers’ suits: It was inspired by shark skin."
4042,"A 45-foot-long, 30-ton humpback whale seems like a strange source to find solutions for making cyclists faster, but Hall explained that a whale is more agile than you might expect. Its feeding method—rounding up a lot of small animals and gulping them down—requires swimming in very tight circles. “It’s as big as a city bus; it can swim at twenty-four, twenty-five miles per hour (fast for any group ride), and… it can actually turn in a five-foot radius.”"
4043,
4044,
4045,"Part of what allows the humpback to turn so quickly are the lumps—""tubercles""—on the whale’s flippers. Hall explained that these act like vortex generators, and aid the whale’s turning by keeping water flow attached to the flippers."
4046,"The tubercles inspired Zipp’s engineers to develop an undulating rim shape that improves stability. Fowler explained that in a crosswind, air collects on the windward-side of the rim before it flows off, or sheds. This is called vortex shedding, and the vortex shedding frequency is the rate at which the air comes off the rim."
4047,"The instability you feel when riding a deep wheel in a crosswind is thanks to those concepts: vortex shedding, the shedding frequency, and your physical reaction to both. The shedding causes the bike to move around; the rider then tries to counteract this movement with handlebar inputs. The more abrupt and inconsistent the vortex shedding, the more abrupt and inconsistent the rider’s counter-movements. Put the vortex shedding and the rider’s counter movements together, and there is a lot of motion, which makes riders feel unstable and unsafe."
4048,
4049,
4050,"Zipp engineers haven’t eliminated vortex shedding—because it can’t be fully eliminated—but they have retuned its frequency. Roun Trouw, Zipp’s advanced development engineer, explained that the HyperFoil generates a vortex which is smaller and faster-moving than it can be with a traditional rim shape, and these smaller, faster vortexes shed more frequently."
4051,"“What we are doing is minimizing the amount of air that collects prior to shedding by increasing the shedding frequency,” said Fowler, a technique that helps the wheel feel more stable.  "
4052,"Hall also stated that the HyperFoils help the engineers to confine the vortex shedding to a narrower range of frequencies, which provides a more consistent, less variable feel."
4053,"If this all works as claimed, riders in a crosswind should experience a noticeable change how the bike moves: It should be less abrupt, more stable, and more consistent. In turn, the rider would not need to make such drastic counter movements, which allows him or her to be more relaxed."
4054,
4055,
4056,Zipp representatives claim that the HyperFoil nodes get more advantageous as the wind angle increases. This would mean that they provide the most benefit in the worst conditions.
4057,     RELATED: First Look: Zipp’s Newest Wheels
4058,"Zipp’s trademark dimples are still present in the 454, though they take on a new form, called HexFin ALBC. They’re hexagonal now, which increases their effectiveness. And there are fewer of them: They were removed from areas where the HyperFoils “do the work.” According to Hall, the HyperFoils and the HexFins work together: The Foils are the big tool and do most of the work, while the Fins provide a bit of polish and fine-tuning."
4059,"Putting numbers to the claims, Zipp representatives say the 454 offers a five-percent reduction in side force, and a fifteen percent reduction in crosswind feedback, compared to a competing 60mm-deep wheel (although representatives refused to disclose exactly which wheel). "
4060,
4061,
4062,"Ignoring the aerodynamic benefits of the 454 for a moment, Zipp argues that simply making the wheel more stable will make you faster, because you will be more relaxed. The bike will feel more predictable, and will move around less in windy conditions, and that lets you ride a deeper wheel than you might normally choose; ride in a more aerodynamic position; and expend less mental and physical energy on keeping the bike straight, which lets you commit more energy to pedaling harder."
4063,"Potentially, these are huge gains, especially for riders who tend to sit up when the wind starts affecting the bike. Hall said, “We did a test not too long ago where we [compared] riders on the tops; riders on the hoods; riders in the drops. It was on the order of 65 to 70 watts' difference between a rider on the tops and a rider in the drops. If we can provide a platform that allows you to spend more time in the drops, or more time in the aero position, you’re going to be a faster rider on race day, or group ride, or whatever.”"
4064,"But the 454 is also more aerodynamic than the 404, itself a class leader, saving up to five watts, despite a shallower average depth. (The 454’s undulating rim varies from 58 to 53 millimeters; a 404 is 58mm deep)."
4065,"Along with its unique features, the 454 has the same “faster” features found in Zipp’s other NSW wheels: the Showstopper textured brake track topped with silicone carbide for better braking in more conditions; and the Cognition hub, which uses magnets to disengage the driver mechanism for reduced coasting friction."
4066,
4067,
4068,"With a retail price of $4,000, the 454 NSW is Zipp’s most expensive wheelset. At least some of the price reflects the complexity of building the wheel. Fowler claims it takes 12 hours to build one 454 NSW. (Like other Zipp wheels, the rim is manufactured in Indianapolis). "
4069,"Though Zipp’s presenters didn’t get into details, the 454 NSW utilizes some new rim construction ideas developed by Trouw. These advanced technologies help the 454 beat the 404 NSW in stiffness and strength, while also reducing the weight—the 454 wheelset is 30 grams lighter than the 404. I would expect these ideas will eventually find their way into Zipp’s other products."
4070,"And the price also reflects the engineering time in the wheel: Hall stated that the 454 took four years to develop, required 36 prototypes, 252 hours in the wind tunnel, and many hours of CPU time running CFD simulations. (Hall said one of their CPU simulations could take “68 days on a top consumer-level quad-core laptop.”)"
4071,     RELATED: Zipp's New NSW 808 Carbon Clincher Wheelset
4072,I think Zipp has put itself into a challenging position with the 454. Aero wheels have become significantly more stable in recent years. And Zipp deserves a lot of credit for helping aero wheels get where they are today.
4073,
4074,
4075,"But while Zipp’s engineers have done a ton of work to quantify the 454’s performance—and they have lots of data, graphs, and animations to back up their claims—the main performance benefits of this product boil down to feel. And feel is about as subjective as it gets."
4076,"Zipp’s current 404 is a pretty damn stable aero wheel. The challenge for the 454 is that it must feel more-stable enough (super subjective) to convince people that it’s worth its stratospheric price—$900 more than the proven (and already very expensive) 404—and that the weird-looking rim shape is more than just a gimmick. And it better be super-duper convincing, because the 454 is not much more aerodynamic than the 404."
4077,"I can’t answer those questions yet. The 454’s product launch took place at night, on a boat. There was no opportunity for me, or any of the media in attendance, to ride the new wheel. But I hope to have an answer soon: A review wheelset is on the way to me. "
4078,The new e-bike offering from Specialized is lighter and more intuitive than ever
4079,"When Specialized first debuted their Turbo family of electric-assist bikes several years ago, they were some of the best performing e-bikes on the market. Specialized has been quick to update and develop new models, with 2016 seeing them be one of the first major companies to expand into the e-MTB market with the Turbo Levo 6Fattie."
4080,RELATED: The Turbo Levo 6Fattie Might Just Change Your Mind About E-Bikes
4081,"The Levo is offered in both FSR full suspension and hardtail models. The original Turbo Levo FSR is a capable bike that rode well, but Specialized felt there was still room for improvement and there was only an aluminum offering. In the time since last year’s debut of the Levo, the team at Specialized has been in the lab working on improving on an already solid bike by adding carbon frames to the mix and updating the electric system and motor to provide better power, heat management and smoother engagement. "
4082,
4083,
4084,New Carbon Frame
4085,"Dominik Geyer is head of the Turbo brand and a human encyclopedia regarding the development of the carbon Levo and how Specialized’s e-bikes work. Geyer said the hardest part about manufacturing the carbon frame was achieving the same geometry and build as the current aluminum model to allow for complete parts interchangeability between the aluminum and carbon bikes. With the placement of the battery in the down tube, this was an engineering challenge. In the end, they successfully achieved the same geometry and frame shape while increasing stiffness by 20% and saving 650g of weight in the full carbon S-Works model. (Expert and Comp carbon have an aluminum rear end.) "
4086,Motor and Software Updates
4087,"The motor in the new Levo is similar to the current one. Specialized claims a 15% increase in power, along with better heat management than the current motor. In the carbon bike, the motor bolts into a specially-engineered motor mount that fits into the sub-frame assembly of the shell, while the alloy models retain the same mounting from the previous year. "
4088,
4089,
4090,"Geyer said that the development of the software that manages the motor was as much of a project as the new motor itself. The software is refined to make power transfer smoother than before, which is important since the motor directly responds to pedal inputs. This helps to even out any uneven pedaling, which is often noticeably amplified with an electric-assist bike. The new software is compatible with all current Levo bikes, which is nice to see in an era of seemingly planned obsolescence. "
4091,RELATED: Your E-Bike Questions Answered
4092,"Other updates include a new walk-assist mode, handy when it gets too steep to pedal (it’s still a bike after all), and a major overhaul of Specialized’s Mission Control smartphone app. The new feature in the app, called Infinitune, allows users to adjust the assist level as well as the maximum motor current that the bike will put out. For example, as Geyer explained, with 100% assist the motor current is 530 watts. If the motor current is limited to 50% then the bike will put out no more than 265 watts, no matter how hard you pedal. "
4093,Ask Bicycling: Do e-bikes still give you a workout?
4094,"This was done to not only give greater control over range optimization (changes to output will affect how long the battery lasts over the course of a ride) but also to allow users to control how hard of a workout they get. To ensure riders can make it the full length of a planed route, Specialized also includes a ""smart control"" feature in the app that allows users to enter their route, how far, or how long (in hours) they want to ride, and what percentage of battery life they want left at the end— the motor will self-adjust the output to cater to that ride. This should help cut down on the anxiety of ending up far from home lacking the appropriate battery reserves to make it back."

4096,"The top of the line S-works model sports a full carbon frame and is outfitted with Ohlins suspension at both ends. The Expert and Comp Carbon models receive a carbon front triangle and aluminum rear end. All bikes also now have a 150mm fork (up from 140mm on the previous years models). SRAM’s Code brakes handle stopping on the S-Works and Expert with Guide RD’s on the Comp and Comp Carbon. Tire spec has been updated to Specialized's new 27.5 x 2.8-inch gripton Butcher, replacing the less aggressive tires of the past model."

4098,
4099,The Ride
4100,"I spent an afternoon on the new S-Works Levo this spring at Mountain Creek Resort in Vernon, New Jersey. With a long history of mountain biking and a network of trails ranging from smooth flow trails to steep and rocky World Cup level DH trails the resort proved to be a great testing ground for the Turbo Levo. There’s around 900 feet of elevation, which was more than enough to get some good climbing and descending in with multiple laps."
4101,"The Levo made climbing a breeze. The power transfer was noticeably smoother than the 2017 model and that was especially nice when pedaling up steeper stretches of trail or shifting gears. Once pointed downhill, the Levo rode just about as any other mountain bike would; the motor was an afterthought. The extra weight of the battery and motor was noticeable, but it is well placed and it didn’t cause problems with handling."
4102,"When not pedaling (descending), the motor decouples from the drivetrain and the trails all rode just as they would on a regular trail bike. Jumps, rocks, roots, steep technical bits were all standard fare, and the bike ate them all up. After completing several top-to-bottom laps and a couple hours of riding on a variety of trails, the bike had nearly 50% of the battery left. Impressive, given how steep the climbing was and that I left the bike in the highest power Turbo setting for most of the ride. Having the mode controls on the handlebar at the left grip (rather than just on the side of the battery as on the older model) also meant that when I did want to change power settings there was no need to take my hand from the bar and avert my eyes from the trail, something I found to be much safer. The ""Walk"" feature is a nice touch we are seeing crop up on a lot of e-bikes. At the touch of a button it drove the Levo along at just enough of a boost to overcome the added weight of the system, about 23 pounds in all over a standard Stumpjumper FSR for instance, making time on foot less of a hassle. Fear not, the ""walk assist"" only works when there is no pressure on the pedals and can't be mistaken for any kind of throttle. "
4103,RELATED: The Place for E-Bikes
4104,"There’s no avoiding the fact that e-mountain bikes are one of the most hotly-debated subjects in American cycling culture currently. While they are much more widely accepted in Europe, there are different hurdles with land access and ownership, legislation, and different perceptions of the bikes in the US. While they aren’t my first choice for a ride, I think that they are a great option to ride where they are allowed, and feel they have the potential to help bring more people onto bikes, creating a new way to experience trails, where they are allowed."
4105,"The new Turbo Levo aluminum base and Comp models will hit dealers floors this summer with carbon models arriving in September. Prices start at $4,500 for the updated M5 aluminum Levo FSR, $6,000 for the Comp Carbon, and top out at $9,500 for the full carbon S-works model."

"
4109,Two weeks into parenthood I started thinking that I had made a big mistake. 
4110,"No, not about fatherhood! What kind of a person do you think I am?"
4111,"I’m talking about my diaper bag. There are several diaper bag options for dads, all of which are designed to help men look “cool” while wiping snot, vomit, pee, and other substances from their children and themselves. I thought I had found one that suited me; I was wrong."
4112,"You see, I’ve long been a (self-proclaimed) connoisseur of “things to carry things” and the diaper bag I had fell far short of my standards: it was too small, offered too few pockets, and was styled in such a way as to say, “Here’s a dad who’s trying too hard.” "
4113,"So I was happy to learn that San Francisco’s Timbuk2—a longtime purveyor of good-looking, well-designed, and American-made messenger and commuter bags—had added the Stork Diaper Messenger Bag to its arsenal in 2012. And better yet, the Stork is now customizable, meaning it’s easier than ever to build a bag that that suits your style. It took me about half an hour to settle on a design for my test bag on Timbuk2’s easy-to-navigate bag-builder web tool, and when it arrived less than two weeks later, I promptly set about loading it with all of my daddy-gear."
4114,"Which leads me to my first piece of praise for the Stork: it holds a lot of stuff. Diapers, wipes, pacifiers, board books, toys, spare clothes, a bottle, blankets—everything a parent (and baby) could need for a day away from home fits easily into this bag. "
4115,"The Stork’s main purpose is served thanks to what I’ve come to affectionately call the “Command Center,” a removable, folding changing pad/organizer that fits neatly inside the thinner of the Stork’s two main compartments. With two large, mesh pouches to hold essentials like diapers and wipes; a clear zippered pocket for ointments, lotions, or dirty clothes; and an external stretchy pocket for small incidentals, the “Command Center” carries everything you need for a quick and easy diaper change. It’s soft, covers a large amount of surface area, and is easily cleaned. And perhaps most importantly, it’s easy to unfold, refold, and stow using only one hand—a key characteristic any new parent can appreciate."
4116,"The Stork’s larger main compartment is where I pack everything else I need: extra clothes, board books (Goodnight Moon and Harold and the Purple Crayon are my son’s current favorites), a few small toys, and a blanket. Two mesh pockets sewn into the bottom corners of this compartment are great for holding onto anything too small or important to risk losing among all that other stuff. They’re also ideal for holding a bottle, although the removable, insulated bottle sleeve is probably a better choice for carrying your baby’s beverage of choice. "
4117,"The rest of the custom Stork comes loaded with internal and external organizer pockets including a long, zippered pouch along the inside of the bag and an outer, side-entry “Napoleon” pocket that allows you to grab something without lifting the flap. It’s the perfect place to store a spare pacifier or two."
4118,"And of course, it’s a bag designed for riding as well. As is the case with all of Timbuk2’s messenger bags, the custom Stork is comfortable to wear and easy to adjust thanks to Timbuk2’s intuitive cam buckle. Like the rest of Timbuk2’s messenger bags, the Stork comes with loop for attaching your favorite blinky tail light and an extra strap for cinching everything down across your chest. This strap keeps the bag secured right where it needs to be: on the center of your back, without sliding around and getting in the way while you’re pedaling. Both the shoulder and chest straps are comfortable and easy to adjust with one hand, so there’s no stopping and getting off the bike to tighten things down. "
4119,"The waxed canvas I chose for my Stork resisted road spray well enough—although Timbuk2’s Cordura nylon is probably a better choice for folks craving water resistance and durability. I’m envisioning lots of summer rides once my son is old enough for a bike trailer with everything we need comfortably slung across my back in my custom Stork. And on days when he doesn’t feel like coming along, the bag will work just fine for me too. A small laptop, an iPad, a few folders of work—it all fits—making the Stork an option for commuters who also happen to be new parents. "
4120,"The best part? Once your tyke is potty-trained, you can convert the Stork into a stylish, practical messenger bag, as none of the bag’s features restrict its use. "
4121,"The Stork comes in custom (from $184) and stock ($149) options, with some key functional differences. The stock version comes with an insulated bottle pocket sewn into the main compartment, a strap pad, and a zippered pocket on the side of the bag that would come in handy when reaching for something on-the-go. I don’t miss these as much on my custom version, but I do miss the weatherproof boot that protects the bottom of the stock model. Public restrooms aren’t the cleanest places and most changing tables don’t have enough room for both my son and the diaper bag, so the bag often ends up on the men’s room floor. The stock model’s boot adds an extra layer of easy-to-clean protection."
4122,"Which one is right for you? It depends what matters more to you: customization options or the differences in each bag’s features. But no matter which one you do choose, remember that both bags are designed to be used long after your baby is potty-trained, which means that while he or she might grow out of it, you won’t."

4276,"In the time since Giant launched Liv as a standalone women’s brand two and a half years ago, mountain bikes across categories have become notably more capable, encouraging more riders to gravitate toward more challenging terrain. The demand for women’s bikes that make no compromises in performance is increasingly visible, too. (Fun fact: Liv says its top-end, $9,000 carbon-fiber Lust Advanced 0 mountain bike was the highest-selling off-road bike in all of Giant’s line last year). 
	 
	For 2017, Liv has overhauled its full-suspension off-road line to better serve the entire, evolving range of female riders, who are embracing the trend toward more technical and challenging terrain in XC and all-mountain riding. Gone are the 100mm-travel Lust and the 140mm-travel Intrigue. In their place are all-new models, including the super-light, XC race-oriented, 120mm-travel Pique; and the Hail, which Liv says is the first 160mm-travel enduro bike designed specifically for women. (Get all the info you need to be your strongest cycling self yet in the Bicycling Big Book of Cycling for Women!)"
4277,Updated Suspension Design and Boost
4278,
4279,
4280,"Maestro is a rear-wheel suspension design that features four pivot points—two above the shock, two below—and two linkages, which creates a “floating” or virtual pivot point behind the seat tube. This floating pivot, Giant claims, helps the suspension to pedal more efficiently, to remain active when the rider is braking, and enables both small-bump sensitivity as well as the ability to take big hits."
4281,"There are two key changes to Maestro in 2017, which Liv says improve the suspension’s ability to do all three things. A new trunnion mount now attaches the shock, mounting the shock to the upper linkage directly through the shock body. This lets Giant run a longer shock for lower air pressures and thus lower leverage ratios, enabling the suspension to be more sensitive to small bumps and helping it “float” over that type of terrain. It also enables better rebound control, and lets Giant lower the top tube for more standover on the Hail and the Pique."
4282,     RELATED: The Best Women's Mountain Bikes of 2016
4283,"The Hail and the Pique also feature a stronger and lighter carbon-fiber, single-piece upper rocker that provides more torsional stiffness, allowing the front and back wheel to better track together in corners, says Liv. "
4284,"Like most new trail bike releases for 2017, Liv’s entire off-road line also now features wider Boost hub spacing (148mm instead of traditional 142mm hubs in the back and 110mm instead of 100mm in the front), which provides additional lateral (side-to-side) stiffness to the wheels and also enables engineers to use shorter chainstays for a bike that handles more nimbly and is easier to loft in the front. "
4285,"Both the Hail and Pique also feature lighter carbon frames than their 2016 predecessors, says Liv, though comparative weights were not provided. All of Liv’s off-road models roll on 27.5-inch wheels and will be offered in carbon and aluminum frames."
4286,
4287,
4288,"The Hail is a new all-mountain/enduro bike with women’s specific geometry and 160mm of front- and rear-wheel travel. Liv says the Hail was a response to a growing demand for a high-performance, big bike that is women’s specific and can handle very aggressive terrain. While Liv doesn’t like to compare its bikes to Giant models—it wants to emphasize that they were designed from the ground up for women rather than tweaking a standard bike’s geometry—the Hail is Liv’s equivalent to the Giant Reign, the bike of choice for Giant’s Enduro World Series (EWS) racers in 2016."
4289,"Liv designed the Hail using data from its global survey set of women riders to account for not only average proportional differences in women and men, but also differences in where women derive their strengths and hold their weight. Liv’s pro riders, Lindsey Voreis and Leigh Donovan (a former downhill world and nine-time national champion) were also deeply involved, and provided feedback that guided the bike through four iterations."
4290,"This is why, for example, the Hail sports a 66-degree head tube angle compared to the 65-degree head angle on the Giant Reign: a steeper head tube puts the front wheel slightly closer to the rider, making it easier to lift the front end for women who hold more of their strength in their lower body, says Donovan. (It’s also still a very slack head angle, and on par with bikes like the 150mm-travel Juliana Roubion by Santa Cruz.) "
4291,     RELATED: 8 Badass Women's Mountain Bike Shorts
4292,"Liv says the Hail also has a slightly higher bottom bracket compared to its all-mountain peers, to give women extra pedaling clearance. In technical terrain, Donovan said this gives the rider the ability to take an extra half or full pedal stroke without worrying about pedal striking."
4293,"The Hail is offered in two Advanced versions with carbon front triangles and aluminum rear triangles, as well as two versions with aluminum frames (just called the Hail). Pricing ranges from $3,250 for the aluminum Hail 2 with a SRAM NX 1x11 drivetrain, to the $8,250 carbon Hail Advanced 0 with SRAM X01 Eagle."
4294,"How It Rides
	We took the Hail on a test ride at Liv’s global launch in Sedona, Arizona, last week. The Hail is a bike that’s capable enough for EWS racing, says Liv; the brand reps admitted that most of the terrain we were able to access on this short test loop wouldn’t come close to the steeps, gnar, and opportunities for air that this bike was built to handle. "
4295,"Though my impressions of the Hail are thus limited, I had a lot of fun on this bike. We’ll start with rider position. I’m 5’6” and typically in between a small and a medium depending on the bike. The Hail’s longer reach (a roomy 16.5 inches on a size small) enabled me to get the long and low riding position I prefer without having to size up to a medium as I do on some models."
4296,"The Maestro delivered on its promise to resist bobbing when I was climbing or pedaling on flats, so much that I never thought twice about leaving the shock wide open. I also tried riding with the RockShox Lyric RCT3 Dual Position fork in its 130mm-travel configuration on some gradual climbs, which did slightly improve the sense of efficiency in the front. But either way, the bike provides a firm pedaling platform for such a long-travel bike, and though I don’t have a claimed weight on the $5,350 Advanced 1 version I rode, it rode lighter than many of its all-mountain peers in its price range, and the top-of-the-line Advanced 0 model weighs a claimed 27.75 pounds in a size small—impressive for such a long-travel bike. The bike also handles nimbly and feels like a smaller-trail bike in corners, without feeling long or “trucky.” "
4297,"But in terms of travel and spec, this is a big bike. The suspension has the very plush feel of some enduro-specific, almost “mini-DH” models I’ve ridden. While descending an armored-up, rocky chute, and ripping faster through a dry creekbed that alternated between loose sections littered with babyheads and smooth berms, the Hail remained very composed and gave the overarching impression of flowing through this constantly changing terrain. When I hit a larger loose rock that pinged out from under a tire, the Hail didn’t get knocked off line and maintained straight-ahead momentum. "
4298,     RELATED: Juliana Reveals Its 2017 Mountain Bikes
4299,"In general, the front wheel felt very easy to pick up for such a big bike, and when technical climbing involved lifting the front end to get up a large step, traction was good and the light weight of the bike made muscling it over the top feel easy. It did provide some peace of mind to know the bike had extra BB clearance—indeed, I got over numerous step-ups with zero pedal strikes."
4300,"From my short test ride, my two general impressions are that this is definitely a bike that will light up for a woman who rides fast, often in rough terrain, and likes jumps and drops. But if you could only have one bike, it would not feel like too much of a handful just riding around, like some other 150mm- to 160mm-travel models I’ve tested. A lot of our day was spent on flowier trail and at slower speeds, but the Hail was still fun on these trails. And the tire combo—a Schwalbe Magic Mary in front and a Schwalbe Hans Dampf in the back—rolls respectably for such aggressive tires. I do think the bike should come with a longer-travel dropper post than the 100mm Giant Contact it is spec’d with across the board—125mm to 150mm is more common on bikes like this, and would give me the maneuverability I’m now more accustomed to having in very steep terrain."
4301,"Certainly riding this bike got me excited to get a test bike for long-term testing on steeper, faster, and rougher trails."
4302,
4303,
4304,"Liv positions the Pique as its top-end cross-country race bike that is also trail-capable; the closest thing on the Giant side would be the new Anthem. Like the Anthem, the Pique has more travel (120mm of travel front and rear) than many pure XC bikes, and is 27.5-only. Where it does show its XC roots is in its 70-degree head angle, which is definitely steeper than many short-travel trail bikes that claim to also be XC-capable; and in its light weight—a size small top-of-the-line Advanced 0 carbon model weighs an impressive claimed 23.5 pounds. "
4305,How It Rides
4306,"This light weight, and that efficient-pedaling Maestro suspension, make this bike a great climber (I was on the $4,950 Advanced 1, which is a step down from the top-end Advanced 0). If you don’t like climbing, the Pique will make it feel easier; if you do like it, you’ll find climbing to be fun and pleasant on this bike. "
4307,"A steeper head angle is often associated with quicker handling and a “twitchy” personality, but despite its positioning as an XC racer, the Pique is actually a very easy-riding bike, meaning that I think almost any rider at any level could hop on it and find it easy to handle. On a couple tricky sections, where precision was key to make it over a little rock bridge or up ledgy climbs, the bike hit the necessary line precisely and offered good traction to crawl over square edges, too. "
4308,"On descents, the extra travel also made the Pique ride more like a short-travel trail bike than a stereotypical XC bike, allowing the bike to shoot down sandstone ledges with stability, and to inspire confidence through flat and downhill rock gardens. It has a wider bar than more traditional XC race bikes, which provides trail bike-like stability. The Pique's longer stem is appropriate for the bike’s cross-country nature, putting your weight just a little more over the front end for better front-end tracking and pedaling."
4309,"One note on fit: This bike does have a shorter reach than the Hail, so being between sizes, I sized up to a medium and found the longer reach I like. One smaller tester in our group, who usually rides smalls, commented that the reach was longer than she was accustomed to in a short-travel bike like this."
4310,"The Hail may get more attention since it’s such an aggressive bike, but I was actually very impressed by the Pique. With its unique mix of light weight, more travel, and smaller wheels, and being offered down to $2,375 for the aluminum Pique 3 as well as in the more descent-capable SX versions; this bike is a great option for an everyday trail bike, with good parts, for a lot riders, even if you don’t race cross-country. I recently tested another higher-end, 650b, 120mm-travel women’s trail bike that was a little slacker, but positioned toward riders who may be looking for their first full-suspension bike. The Pique climbed better, descended just as well, and was just as easy to ride. If you want a pure XC race bike, you may still consider other models that have 29-inch wheels. But for something a little more versatile that will just be fun to bang around on with friends, get to the top easier, and will be capable in a race, too, the Pique is a solid choice with good value."

A lot of our day was spent on flowier trail and at slower speeds, but the Hail was still fun on these trails. And the tire combo—a Schwalbe Magic Mary in front and a Schwalbe Hans Dampf in the back—rolls respectably for such aggressive tires. I do think the bike should come with a longer-travel dropper post than the 100mm Giant Contact it is spec’d with across the board—125mm to 150mm is more common on bikes like this, and would give me the maneuverability I’m now more accustomed to having in very steep terrain."
4337,"Certainly riding this bike got me excited to get a test bike for long-term testing on steeper, faster, and rougher trails."
4338,
4339,
4340,"Liv positions the Pique as its top-end cross-country race bike that is also trail-capable; the closest thing on the Giant side would be the new Anthem. Like the Anthem, the Pique has more travel (120mm of travel front and rear) than many pure XC bikes, and is 27.5-only. Where it does show its XC roots is in its 70-degree head angle, which is definitely steeper than many short-travel trail bikes that claim to also be XC-capable; and in its light weight—a size small top-of-the-line Advanced 0 carbon model weighs an impressive claimed 23.5 pounds. "
4341,How It Rides
4342,"This light weight, and that efficient-pedaling Maestro suspension, make this bike a great climber (I was on the $4,950 Advanced 1, which is a step down from the top-end Advanced 0). If you don’t like climbing, the Pique will make it feel easier; if you do like it, you’ll find climbing to be fun and pleasant on this bike. "
4343,"A steeper head angle is often associated with quicker handling and a “twitchy” personality, but despite its positioning as an XC racer, the Pique is actually a very easy-riding bike, meaning that I think almost any rider at any level could hop on it and find it easy to handle. On a couple tricky sections, where precision was key to make it over a little rock bridge or up ledgy climbs, the bike hit the necessary line precisely and offered good traction to crawl over square edges, too. "
4344,"On descents, the extra travel also made the Pique ride more like a short-travel trail bike than a stereotypical XC bike, allowing the bike to shoot down sandstone ledges with stability, and to inspire confidence through flat and downhill rock gardens. It has a wider bar than more traditional XC race bikes, which provides trail bike-like stability. The Pique's longer stem is appropriate for the bike’s cross-country nature, putting your weight just a little more over the front end for better front-end tracking and pedaling."
4345,"One note on fit: This bike does have a shorter reach than the Hail, so being between sizes, I sized up to a medium and found the longer reach I like. One smaller tester in our group, who usually rides smalls, commented that the reach was longer than she was accustomed to in a short-travel bike like this."
4346,"The Hail may get more attention since it’s such an aggressive bike, but I was actually very impressed by the Pique. With its unique mix of light weight, more travel, and smaller wheels, and being offered down to $2,375 for the aluminum Pique 3 as well as in the more descent-capable SX versions; this bike is a great option for an everyday trail bike, with good parts, for a lot riders, even if you don’t race cross-country. I recently tested another higher-end, 650b, 120mm-travel women’s trail bike that was a little slacker, but positioned toward riders who may be looking for their first full-suspension bike. The Pique climbed better, descended just as well, and was just as easy to ride. If you want a pure XC race bike, you may still consider other models that have 29-inch wheels. But for something a little more versatile that will just be fun to bang around on with friends, get to the top easier, and will be capable in a race, too, the Pique is a solid choice with good value."
4347,An aluminum racer with an indescribably pleasant ride
4348,"""So a former bull rider and a kitchenware salesman team up to make bicycles in Oregon, give the brand a Flemish name, and use Godzilla as their mascot…"""
4349,"It sounds like the start of a joke, but it’s not. It’s Stoemper."
4350,
4351,
4352,"The former bull rider is Todd Gardner, who builds and paints Stoemper bikes in Springfield, Oregon. (Dropouts and head tubes are machined out-of-house.) A welder for more than 20 years and frame builder for more than 12, Gardner worked at Burley—when the company made tandem and single frames—before starting Stoemper and mountain bike sister brand Bronto Bikes. Gardner may not have widespread name recognition, but many frame builders I’ve spoken with have expressed admiration for his work."
4353,
4354,
4355,"Gardner’s partner is Belgium-based David Alvarez, who handles the business side. He's been in the bike industry for a while—he worked in marketing and sales capacities at brands like Ridley Bikes and Speedplay—but now has a “real job” selling kitchenware. It was Alvarez who came up with the idea to ride five of the spring classics—Gent-Wevelgem, Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix, Amstel Gold, Liège-Bastogne-Liège—in seven days as a way of launching the brand in 2012, an idea so bad it became known as Stoepid Week. Bicycling’s Bill Strickland took part and wrote an account called ""The Best Worst Day,"" which should be found and read."
4356,
4357,
4358,"The Darrell is Stoemper’s aluminum-frame road bike that is, according to the website, “Designed to be raced the shit out of.” The head badge is Godzilla roaring, and the frame is a spare design stripped of almost all filigree. No trademarked shaping, no “revolutionary” technologies—it's a bike that looks built only for speed and all the compromises that come with that. But as has been proven to me over and over, never guess: Let the bike tell you its story on the road."
4359,     RELATED: Aluminum Frames: Back and Better Than Ever
4360,"I put over 1,000 miles on the Darrell before I handed it to my co-workers to ride. I knew the bike well and had worked through all the surprises it offered, so it was fun to observe everyone else going through the same."
4361,
4362,
4363,"One tester took the Darrell out immediately after riding a comparable steel road bike. Returning from the ride with a puzzled expression, he looked back and forth between the aluminum Darrell and the steel bike. “This bike,” he said, pointing to the Darrell, “rides more like a steel bike than the steel bike.”"
4364,"The mellowness of the Darrell is what is so surprising. Everything about it would suggest it should be an uncompromising beast, with a roar as loud as Godzilla’s. But it’s more teddy bear than rampaging reptile."
4365,
4366,
4367,"The ride is damped and even a bit smooth, though the road surface buzzes through the frame more than the average carbon bike. A muffled ‘thud’ telegraphs the larger bumps: The Darrell is not harsh, but it’s not quite compliant, either. It is a mash-up of the stereotypical ride qualities of steel, titanium, and carbon; a sensation that’s particular to aluminum bikes. It doesn’t feel as springy/lively/bouncy as a steel frame, but it’s lighter/quicker/more reactive than a steel frame. Overall, I’d say it feels more like a “race bike” than my steel Rock Lobster, and is just as comfortable, but in a different way."
4368,
4369,
4370,"The handling is spirited, not edgy, and the numbers are pretty standard. The 54cm review bike had a 73-degree head tube with a 43mm offset fork, and 408mm stays; its movements are middle of the road for a race-style bike. It’s one of those bikes that's quick enough to feel quick, stable enough to feel stable, and without any standout traits, but that still seems to be everything the rider needs in the moment."
4371,
4372,
4373,"Frame stiffness is adequate: I use the word because most testers didn’t comment on it one way or the other. No one was inspired enough to fill their logs with epic odes to efficiency, but nobody said it wasn’t stiff, either. The only conversation we had about stiffness was that the Darrell is less stiff than the stiffest carbon race bikes, a perspective held even by the lightest of our test riders. But even this wasn’t a ""good versus bad"" conversation."
4374,
4375,
4376,"Though unremarkably stiff, the Darrell still feels snappy and efficient on the climbs. I rode it through the Dolomites, climbing the Porodi, Sella, and Valparola among others, and had some of the best climbing experience of my life. Part of this was due to an unusual spike in my cycling fitness, but, crucially, the Stoemper let me make the most of what I was capable of at that time. I never felt like I was slowed or handicapped, and I never wished for a stiffer or lighter rig (as pictured, it’s 16.7 pounds with pedals, bottle cages, and a Powertap wheelset)."
4377,     RELATED: The Biggest Mistakes You're Making on Climbs
4378,"At home enjoying this same wave of fitness, I decided to join the weekly group ride and go for some town line sprints. I felt the Darrell jump, I felt it accelerate, I felt the rush, but I never felt it limiting me. In fact, it was always the opposite."
4379,
4380,
4381,"But if you were to ask me what its standout traits are; what makes the Darrell special or remarkable; or what makes it better, I don’t know if I could come up with a convincing response."
4382,"In the aluminum realm, the Gaulzetti is stiffer and more ferocious; the Cannondale CAAD12 and Specialized Allez Sprint are less expensive and objectively as good as the Darrell. In mainstream carbon, performance keeps improving while prices keep falling. Steel and titanium bikes evoke passion that aluminum does not."
4383,
4384,
4385,"But here’s the other surprising thing about the Darrell: It’s a standout bike without any standout traits. It’s one of those rare bikes that’s just ""more."" More than you expect; more than the sum of it’s parts. Quicker, faster, more comfortable, and better than it seemingly should be. And a joy to look at. And thrashable. A bike that makes every ride fun. A bike that I never had a bad day on. A bike that makes me say, “why can’t more bikes be like this?” A bike I’d never want to let go of."
4386,
4387,

Custom paint, geometry, and more, is also available."
4389,"It’s possible to find gear that fits well—you just have to know where to look
"
4390,"If you fall into the Clydesdale category (typically defined as a male rider who weighs more than 200 pounds), finding clothing that fits can be tough. The dimensions of larger riders vary greatly, and many manufacturers tap out after a generic XL size that fits only the smallest of the large. As cycling grows in popularity, the need for bigger and better clothing is becoming apparent, and companies are beginning to improve their offerings. We investigated a few companies making strides in the realm beyond XL to find the best-fitting options for your cycling wardrobe.
	The problem with most cycling clothing for bigger men is that it’s made by adding length and width to the original patterns, and in the case of shorts, keeping the chamois pad the same size. But most men aren’t both big and tall; rather, they’re wider or taller than average. Aero Tech Designs addresses this issue, offering a Big and Tall section for men that includes clothes designed specifically for each of those proportions. Big riders can choose from a range of items that won’t be too long in the legs, arms, and torso; and tall riders can find options that are long enough without being too baggy. The company also offers a full line of plus-size items for women.
	“At Aero Tech Designs, we don’t think about big and tall as anything different,” explains marketing director Steve Ewing. “When we design a new product, it’s assumed it will go to at least 4XL. We really have become the leaders in providing every body type with a wide variety of comfortable cycling apparel, and we maintain a very reasonable price while accommodating all fitness levels.” Admittedly, you can’t be shy about your Clydesdale status when ordering—there’s no surreptitious click of the 3XL button when you’re opting for pieces with names like the Colossal jersey (reasonably priced at $49.99), Ewing explains, “This jersey adds extra width in the mid region, which allows for a loose-fitting jersey that doesn’t flap in the wind, and is available to 5XL. But we also have a bigger jersey. The Big Man’s Tailored Jersey goes up to 6XL.”
	And for those who opted out of basketball in favor of riding, the options are just as specific. In the Tall section, jerseys come with three extra inches in the torso, plus extra-long sleeves. Tall shorts have 11-inch inseams, and the bibs have extra-long shoulder straps.
	Well-fitting shorts can be an especially tricky item to find in larger sizes, and this is where Aero Tech Designs excels. The company offers 14 styles designed for bigger men, with 11 different chamois, all scaled to fit. Performance Bicycle has also been expanding its size range in recent years and just launched a more casual line aimed at bigger riders. The CHCB Lifestyle line will be “semi-fitted” and include sizes up to 3XL for men and 2XL for women. While Performance doesn’t offer products in sizes larger than 4XL, Apparel Product Developer Alicia Landis says the company’s larger sizes will accommodate most big and tall riders.
	Unlike Aero Tech Designs, Performance Cycle opts for the same chamois across the size range. Landis says, “Research has told us the main function of the chamois is to provide support and cushion to the sit bones, as well as help the sit bones interface with a size-specific saddle width that accommodates the rider’s needs.” The sit bones don’t change in width depending on a person’s weight. As riders rotate forward into more aggressive positions, the area in contact with the saddle will narrow due to the rotation of the pelvis, so the construction of shorts ensures the chamois will be wide enough no matter what riding position the cyclist is in, says Landis. She did note that if Performance noticed a demand for a larger chamois, the company would respond to it, but said the company hasn't received requests for different chamois options so far.
	Performance does alter the cut of its 3XL line of jerseys and shorts, however. “As the size increases, we go longer/taller and wider with the construction and scaling of panels, leg bands, bib mesh uppers, etc.,"" says Landis. ""Our scaling isn’t as significant as a true casual big-and-tall manufacturer would have, but there is a definite increase overall.”
	Other brands like Voler and Louis Garneau have been expanding their larger-size offerings in recent years, and many inexpensive private-label brands, such as Nashbar, carry jerseys in larger sizes. Many cycling clubs and other organizations that sell “sponsored” bike wear (e.g. beer companies) offer jerseys for riders in all sizes and shapes. Bike shorts, tights, and bibs are typically the hardest items to find in larger sizes, as well as jackets and other outerwear. Aero Tech Designs is one of the few companies currently making cycling outerwear in big-and-tall sizes.
	One suggestion when shopping for big-and-tall cycling gear is to keep a close eye on the measurement charts, especially for outerwear such as jackets. Because jacket fabrics are less stretchy than those used for jerseys and shorts, size and shape are crucial, so consider calling customer service if you’re not sure something will fit. And if you do order something you love and find that it’s a bit too small, too big, or too long, consider asking a tailor to fix it before you return it.
	If you’re willing to handle overseas shipping costs and have the moxie to carry off a playful name, UK-based Fat Lad at the Back (FLAB for short) offers larger sizes with handsome styling. Its Spare Tyre Range fits chest measurements up to 58 inches and includes jackets, bibs, and tights as well as shorts and jerseys.
	Larger cyclists are likely to find their options improving in the next few years. “Our sales of XL clothing are definitely growing year after year, and we’re seeing a small increase in 3XL,” says Performance’s Landis. “Cycling-specific apparel is equipment, and it’s as important as the components on your bicycle. The more people we can get into cycling, the better it is for the entire industry as a whole.”"

4413,"Best known for leather and metal saddles, Brooks breaks new ground with a lightweight saddle made of rubber and carbon "
4414,"After announcing a public test program in the middle of 2015, Brooks is formally launching the final version of its Cambium C13 saddle ($220) to the public."
4415,"Brooks is best known for metal and leather saddles made in England, but the Cambium C13 takes the brand in a new direction."
4416,
4417,
4418,"The Cambium is made in Italy, with a vulcanized rubber shell top and textured cotton seating surface. When first launched in 2013, the Cambium used metal rails and Brooks’ signature rivets. With the introduction of the carbon-railed C13, Brooks now has a saddle that breaks almost completely with the company’s heritage. The only vestige: rivets."
4419,     RELATED: Brooks Releases Limited-Edition Recycled Denim Saddle
4420,
4421,
4422,"The carbon rail and aluminum rivets help bring the C13’s weight down to 259 grams (claimed): practically weightless for a Brooks saddle, and 150 grams lighter than the metal-railed Cambium C15. Brooks was able to take more weight out by reducing the C13’s width. The C13 is 132mm wide (for comparison, a Selle Italia SLR is 131mm wide), 8mm narrower than the C15."
4423,"The rails are one piece, looping at the nose and tail of the saddle. The continuous rail design was inspired by the Mobius carbon rails found on sister-brand Fizik’s highest-end saddles. The rails are 7mm-by-9mm ovals that may require different clamp parts when used with some seatposts."
4424,     RELATED: Get to Know Your Saddle's Anatomy

4426,
4427,
4428,"This ain’t your daddy’s Brooks: The C13 is firm, narrow, and feels like a modern, uncompromising, racing saddle. It looks and feels at home on a modern carbon racing bike, but we suspect most C13 saddles will be found on bikes like the Dura Ace Di2-equipped Breadwinner Lolo."
4429,"Though softer than a new leather-topped Brooks saddle, the C13 is “surprisingly hard” and harder than a C15. The nose is especially firm, though the wings are soft and compliant, and the flat tail offers good support. Testers reported the C13 feels even firmer when the temperatures drop below freezing."
4430,
4431,
4432,"One tester who rides primarily on a Selle Italia SLR said the C13 “feels narrower and sits narrower than the SLR.” At present, there is no other width available with carbon rails, though there are wider options in Cambiums with metal rails."

4438,"The new high-end brake promises handfuls of power with excellent modulation.
"
4439,"Just days after SRAM unveiled its Type 2 clutch-driven derailleur, the company has lifted the lid on its next trail-friendly offering. The Avid X0 Trail brake, available in mid-July ($310 per wheel), is a four-piston disc brake that slots between the two-piston X0 and the gravity-oriented Code, a four-piston brake so monstrously powerful that it’s overkill for most mountain bikers. Even Avid’s sponsored downhill riders largely skipped the Code in favor of the lighter X0."
4440, 
4441,"The new brake offers the best of both worlds with a claimed weight of 340 grams per wheel with a 160mm rotor. That’s 25 grams heavier than an X0 two-piston, but 25 grams lighter than Shimano’s XTR Trail brake and 70 grams lighter than a Code."
4442, 
4443,"Avid freely admits the X0 Trail (abbreviated XO-T) is not as powerful as the Code, in part because it has smaller pistons—14mm and 16mm versus 15mm and 16mm. But, no surprise, Avid claims the X0-T is more powerful than an X0 two piston (let’s call it X0 XC) and Shimano’s XTR Trail brake."
4444, 
4445,
4446,
4447, 
4448,"On the subject of power, Avid provides a hall pass to run rotors from 140 to 200mm with the X0-T (hear that, downhillers?). Avid’s also developed a new 170mm rotor. It’s the Goldilocks option for riders who felt the 160mm was too weak and a 180mm was too grabby. Plus, with the myriad wheel sizes, bike styles and rider weights out there, the 170mm-option will help fine tune braking power and front to rear balance."
4449, 
4450,"If you’re curious about the numbers, it works out like this:"
4451, 
4452,"• X0 Trail vs. X0 XC, both with 160mm rotor: XO-T is roughly13 percent more powerful, 25 grams heavier and $50 more."
4453,• 180mm vs. 160mm rotor: 180mm is about 14 percent more powerful and 40 grams heavier.
4454,• 170mm rotor vs. 160mm rotor: 170mm is about 7 percent more powerful and 20 grams heavier.
4455,• 180mm rotor vs. 170mm rotor: 180mm is about 6 percent more powerful and 20 grams heavier.
4456, 
4457, 
4458,
4459, 
4460,"So, the X0 XC, with 180mm rotors is heavier, cheaper and about as powerful at the X0-T with 160mm rotors. But, smaller rotors offer better modulation than larger rotors. If you’re concerned about power and modulation, the Trail is the way to go; if you’re concerned about weight, go X0 XC."
4461, 
4462,"The X0 Trail incorporates features from across the Avid line. Beyond the number of pistons, the X0-T also borrows the sealed-bearing lever pivot from Code. From the Elixir 9 comes the updated Taperbore system (the bleed port has been moved from the contact point adjuster to the master cylinder body and the Airtrap feature draws fluid from the bottom of the reservoir away from any air bubbles floating up top). And it uses the same direct-mount caliper (read: not Avid’s Tri-Align Caliper Positioning System, which it is phasing out on higher-end brakes) as the lightweight XX World Cup brake."
4463, 
4464,"The X0-T also comes stocked with Avid’s high-end details: Matchmaker X compatibility, an adjustable banjo, tool-free contact-point adjustment, and tool-free reach adjustment (a GripShift-compatible tooled-reach adjust is optional). Levers and calipers are available in silver or anodized black. Also, the brake pads are longer than those used on XO XC and are not compatible with current Avid calipers."
4465, 
4466,
4467,
4468, 
4469,"I tested the X0-T on the swoopy, tacky trails near Santa Cruz, California. If you’re used to current Avid models, the new brake immediately will feel familiar. The master cylinder and lever have the same shape and dimensions as current XX/X0/Elixir brakes and, initially, the power builds as smoothly as an X0 XC. But, there are noticeable differences. Because the Trail is more powerful than the XC, a lighter touch is required. And I noticed a big difference when the brake was hot and near lockup—under those conditions, the X0-T provides better modulation and control than the XC, allowing more precise riding in tight, steep, technical terrain."
4470, 
4471,"With the introduction of the X0 Trail, Avid put the X0 XC on a diet. It now weighs 315 grams, 17 grams less than last year’s model. Most of the weight savings came from eliminating the CPS hardware and contact point adjustment.

4479,Sick of those hefty airline bike fees? One New Zealand-based transportation company has come up with an alternative: Just strap the bikes on under the wings!
4480,"The idea originated out of necessity for Adventure Flights Golden Bay, an air transportation company that specializes in returning mountain bikers from the end of the 78k Heaphy Trail to their parked cars. Mit Brereton was struggling to fit mountain bikes into his small, 53-year-old Cessna 185 (a six-seater). That’s when he came up with the idea to the mount the bikes under the wings. His design can accommodate any bike, but Brereton says carrying a unicycle might be a challenge."
4481,"In case you were wondering if it’s legal, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand has approved the design."
4482,E-bike maker Bosch claims that the market will expand rapidly in the next few years
4483,"One of the fastest-growing segments of the bike industry is the e-bike, but total numbers are still low – particularly in the United States. That may change rapidly, according to Claus Fleischer, head of Bosch’s eBike Systems. Citing research from German industry group ZIV, Fleischer claims that fully a third of all bikes sold in Europe in 2023 will be e-bikes."
4484,"Before you get excited (or alarmed), note a couple of things. First, the source here is a maker of e-bike systems; according to realtors, it’s always a great time to buy/sell a house, right? Second, even ZIV’s research notes that growth in North America will be a bit slower—ZIV suggests that sales in Asia and North America could increase as much as 27 percent in the medium-term. That’s a lot, but it won’t get us anywhere close to a third of all bike sales being e-bikes, partly because we’re starting from a lower base."
4485,"No industry group reliably tracks e-bike sales in the US, but some of the best estimates we’ve found indicate a ballpark figure of around 190,000 units sold in the US in 2014. That sounds like a lot, but consider that Germany alone sold more than 500,000 e-bikes last year."
4486,"But, e-bikes are definitely expanding. Even a year or two ago, most major brands didn’t carry e-bike lines. Now, brands like Trek and Specialized are stepping in with multiple models. City bikes and other utilitarian models dominate, but we’re also seeing a slow rise in road and even full-suspension mountain bike offerings."
4487,"No April Fool's joke— the 135mm Tallboy LT, available in carbon and aluminum, is for real!
"
4488,"Santa Cruz hit a homerun with its first full-suspension 29er, the Tallboy. But the company has been working hard on a longer-travel version and unveiled the new model—available in both carbon and aluminum frames—earlier this month in Sedona, Arizona, where it also introduced two other value-oriented niners."
4489, 
4490,"Both versions of the new 135mm-travel Tallboy LT use the same geometry and VPP suspension. According to Santa Cruz engineering director Joe Graney, the company toyed with several travel options on early prototypes, but 135mm “just felt right.” Compared to the company’s 26-inch bikes, the Tallboy LT has unique anti-squat characteristics that work with the increased inertia of larger wheels. Both test bikes we rode came with a 140mm travel Fox 34 and ISCG chainguide tabs. To accommodate the tabs, Santa Cruz offset the lower link. While it was messing around with the links, engineers also further recessed the grease fittings to protect them from trail debris.  Like other VPP bikes, the new models use angular contact bearings. They also include dropper post cable guides under the top tube."
4491, 
4492,"While many newer long-travel 29ers have benefited from improved geometry, Joe Graney says headtube height is still “the elephant in the room.” So he made the Tallboy’s as short as possible At just 3.9 inches tall on a size large frame, it’s as much as an inch shorter than others in the category. The 69.5-degree head angle and 17.9-inch chainstays offer well-balanced handling. The bikes come in three sizes: M, L, and XL, but don’t hold your breath for a small size. “We could make the bike, but it will ride like shit,” says Graney. “It’s time to recognize that not all bikes fit all people.”"
4493, 
4494,"The Tallboy LTc is lighter for its wheel travel than any other 29er, says Santa Cruz. At just 5.3 pounds for a large frame with shock, it’s hard to argue. That’s 1.2 pounds lighter than the aluminum version and, remarkably, .3 pounds lighter than the 26-inch Santa Cruz Blur LTc. To shed weight, the company molded in more carbon pieces and removed some aluminum bits from the frame. To stiffen the rear triangle, the company added a bridge, playfully called MUT (for mega upright technology) that connects the two pivots in the rear triangle."

4502,"The carbon frame features a DT Swiss142mm axle with clocking handle while the aluminum model features a standard QR. Graney said that they used the142 axle to open the door for more wheel choices, not to increase rigidity because the rear end was already plenty stiff. Santa Cruz will also offer a dropout that’s compatible with Shimano’s new direct-mount standard, which creates a straighter path for the 142mm axle while also stiffening the derailleur mounting point for better shifting. Shimano’s 2013-model-year Shadow derailleurs will feature a removable B-tension knuckle allowing it to bolt on."
4503, 
4504,"My first ride on the Tallboy LT lasted four hours and spanned some of Sedona’s best cross-country trails, including Lower Shades, Broken Arrow, Hog Wash, Hangover and others. It quickly became clear that the LT has an incredibly wide range of abilities. Its big wheels, ample travel and rigid frame made easy work of chunky trails, but what most impressed me was how easily it climbed in the big ring. I’ve ridden many bikes across Sedona’s diverse trail network, but none have performed as well as the LT."
4505, 
4506,"After five days of hard riding on the aluminum model, I jumped on the carbon version. For a full report on that lighter, stiffer bike (hint: it didn’t suck) check out the June issue of our sister publication, Bicycling magazine."
4507, 
4508,"The aluminum LT frame will cost about $2,000 with a Fox shock and complete bikes start at $3,200. It begins shipping to retailers this week. The carbon frame runs $2,700 with complete bikes beginning at $4,400. Riders will have to wait another six weeks to get their hands on that model, however. From our experience, it will be worth the wait.

4512,"Cannondale's CAAD 10 reminds us of everything we love about aluminum road bikes
"
4513,"""You were cooking! We carved those last few turns so fast."" We'd just dropped down the last half of the descent of Mount Lemmon outside of Tucson, Arizona. The ride was part of our annual Editors' Choice trip, and now the group was sitting at a coffee shop under vine-wrapped vigas, bench racing, unwinding, enjoying a postride nosh, and contemplating the rest of the day's riding. I'd scored the Cannondale CAAD10 for the last five miles off the mountain. The climb up had been interesting while not mind-blowing in terms of what the bikes could do, but the blazing descent back to town really gave us a feel for the mettle of the machines. The CAAD10 was intuitive—an able dance partner as the road dropped and the turns linked together faster and sooner. Even through the high-speed saddle about halfway down, with a blazing-hot crosswind, the bike was a steady roller, staying on course."
4514,"The Cannondale CAAD10 won that round in the Editors' Choice competition in one of my favorite categories: recreational road, a catchall term we use for jack-of-all-trades bikes, ones that offer fantastic rides and excellent handling with work-a-day pricing and components. These bikes offer great value, without being cheap in any way."
4515,"On that trip, the CAAD10 had done something else that was remarkable: It changed a few riders' perceptions of what an aluminum bike could be. All of the testers passed the bike off to the next with their own way of saying, ""Holy mackerel, I can't believe this is aluminum."" (The CAAD10 does have a carbon fork.) It upended the common belief that oversize aluminum is harsh, chattery, and stiff. The CAAD10 was and is refined and elegant, ushering in a new appreciation of the material."
4516,"The CAAD10 we loved in 2012 has been through a few updates since. For instance, it's now Di2-compatible, so the same frame can run mechanical (like on my tester) or electronic drive-trains. But it remains one of the best bargains around. The CAAD10 I tested is outfitted with SRAM Force 22 components, Cannondale's Hollowgram Si crank, and FSA Energy wheels. Yet the price jumped only $800 over the SRAM Rival-equipped bike we tested in Tucson. Taking into account inflation, the update to an 11-speed drivetrain, and better cranks, this CAAD10 is an even better value than the last."
4517,"The ride is top-notch: The CAAD10 smoothed rough pavement, cornered crisply, and transferred power efficiently. When I rode it on my home roads in eastern Pennsylvania—a patchwork of farm roads, rolling hills, and the valleys in between, with dirt and broken pavement galore—I was even more impressed with this version than the last. The massive front end provides a solid platform from which to launch a sprint. Cannondale's SAVE seatstays soak up chatter, keeping me fresh rather than letting road imperfections beat me to hell."
4518,"I like to hand my test bikes around for feedback from different riders. In this instance, the CAAD10 found its way to a few of my most trusted evaluators, and also a relatively new rider looking for an entry into the sport. As on that Arizona trip, all of the testers responded favorably to the ride, likening it to higher-end models, including carbon offerings. The newbie said that he probably wouldn't have considered aluminum as an option, but is not ruling it out anymore. Weight-wise, there are no concessions: At 16.1 pounds for a 54cm, the CAAD10 is in the same realm as higher-priced bikes. And it's versatile enough to evolve with your riding style. To make it an all-rounder, there is clearance for 25mm tires; it can also serve as an affordable and durable race bike."
4519,"The CAAD10 is available in men's and women's geometries, and there are disc versions, too. Prices range from entry level to the blinged-out CAAD10 Black Inc. Disc at $4,330. Whichever model you choose, be assured that you're getting a great ride and saving some serious dough."

4523,How to find strong cycling gear made for big riders.
4524,"In the arms race to produce ever lighter bikes and equipment, it seems brands sometimes think every rider is as lithe as Emily Batty or a twig like Chris Froome. You don’t have to look hard to find bikes with weight limits topping out at 150 or 200 pounds. But there’s also a lot of great gear out there for riders who need stronger gear and who feel more comfortable in clothes that aren’t cut to fit road racers in an aero tuck. "
4525," The brands who get it right are creating thoughtful designs that don’t sacrifice any performance. They, and their customers, know that simply adding material to a jersey or layering some extra carbon onto a wheel doesn’t cut it. Below are our picks for the best frames, wheels, apparel and other gear made for larger riders and what you should look for (and avoid) when shopping."
4526,"While carbon frames keep getting better (and stronger) many still have limits so check with the manufacturer or retailer before handing over cash.  For heavier or taller riders, metal can be a better option. Steel is strong and relatively affordable. But it can be heavier than the other frame materials. Titanium is pricier but gives you the option to fine-tune the ride quality with non-standard tubes sizes and shapes, adding incredible strength with minimal weight penalty. "
4527,"Shorter riders will have more options with frame material, but as you get into the taller sizes, over 61cm, aluminum frames can become very flexy. If you are north of 6”5” and having trouble finding bikes that feel sturdy, a custom bike might be your best option. Some brands, like Zize, make sturdy, affordable everyday bikes for riders over 400 and 500 pounds. Day 6 makes regular and e-bikes for riders with weight limits up to 400 pounds.  "
4528,Related video: How to Make a DIY Bike-Tube Wallet
4529,"As with frames, metal wheels will likely have higher weight limits than carbon ones. Also look at the spokes and lacing pattern. More spokes can equal a stronger wheel. Go with something with 32 double-butted steel spokes in a three-cross pattern (each spoke crosses over three others). Custom wheels can be a good way to go. Many shops or online retailers like wheelbuilder.com can help you find the right pair for your needs.   "
4530,"There are a few key components that you’ll want to pay special attention to – handlebars, stems, and seat posts. There are some carbon bars, like the Enve SES Aero Road Handlebar, that are safe for heavy riders but be sure to double check with them before making that purchase. Aluminum bars width a wide diameter (>31.8mm) at the clamp are going to be the safest bet because of the additional strength provided by large diameter tubes. Fortunately, this is a very standard size and widely available. Also pay close attention to the width of your bars. Narrow bars can feel restrictive and uncomfortable over longer rides and can make the bike harder to control. As a rule, drop bars should be as wide as your shoulders. For broad shoulders, the Zipp Service Course SL-80 is available up to a width of 46cm. "
4531,"More than any other part of your bike, picking the right saddle will make the difference between a comfortable, enjoyable ride and pain and discomfort. The right saddle will properly support your sit bones – and a wide backside doesn’t necessarily mean wide sit bones. Your local bike shop can help measure your sit bones to find the right size range for you. Let comfort be your guide, and feel free to go wider if you aren’t planning on going too fast. According to Paula Dyba from Terry Bicycles, “the rule of thumb is enough width and saddle padding to support the sit bones, with a shared balance of weight distribution on handlebars, seat, and pedals."""

4566,"As we’ve come to expect from Norco’s bikes, the low-slung Shinobi is aggressive and smooth-handling, primed to rocket down wide-open, fast descents as you ace ledges and drops. It’s not unique in being a fun bike to point downhill, but it does stand out from other all-mountain bikes with a keener than average taste for climbing."
4567, 
4568,"Climbing chops come courtesy of Specialized’s FSR suspension design, which Norco licenses. The design gets modified with the Canadian company’s Advanced Ride Technology. The tweaks mean that the rear suspension reacts quickly to bumps, a hallmark of FSR, and minimizes pedal-induced feedback to the suspension. Both traits help the Shinobi stick to the trail."
4569, 
4570,"Don’t let the climbing skills fool you, though: 30 pounds of heft, 120mm of rear travel, and 140mm on the RockShox Reba RLT fork let you know that this is an all-mountain bike, capable of flowing over big hits. The ride is stable, thanks to the low bottom bracket, but you need to watch out for pedal strikes in rock gardens."
4571, 
4572,"Norco’s new one-piece upper link and a thru-axle at the rear wheel go a long way to help alleviate a frequent issue faced by 29ers—lateral frame flex. The Shinobi still flexes a little in hard corners, but it’s rigid enough that you can adapt to work with the flex."
4573, 
4574,"One additional challenge encountered by 29ers, and especially longer travel bikes, is getting the bars low enough for an aggressive position. Norco’s solution is to use a short, tapered headtube, which also helps to eliminate front-end flex."
4575, 
4576,"Norco’s hydroformed aluminum frame contains a plethora of well-designed extras. Because the frame’s Syntace’s X12 rear axle system uses a breakaway bolt to mount the derailleur, a spare bolt comes conveniently threaded into the frame, potentially helping to minimize long walks back to the trailhead. You also get guides for a dropper post’s cables, and riders looking to use a single ring and chain guide will be happy to see an ISCG 05 tab on the bottom bracket shell."

4578,"Test riders were all impressed by this bike’s ability to hold the trail—both going downhill or up. It’s also a versatile bike that can be adapted to better-suit varied terrain: To bring out a more aggressive XC feel, shorten the front travel to 120, bump up suspension pressure, and add a longer, lower stem for a set-up that results in fewer pedal strikes through the rocks but still soaks up the large hits.

"
4587,"It's been a while since a bike gave me goosebumps, but that's just what the Salsa Bucksaw did. I was on a fast and rough trail—not typical fat-bike territory—and I launched off the top of a seven-foot-high rise. That jump comes after a loose, off-camber turn that slows me down, so I usually have to work hard to get off the ground. But on this day, it felt easy. Something was different."
4588,"So I tried it again. When I laid the Bucksaw hard into the turn before the jump, I noticed that the extra traction provided by the fat tires allowed me to brake later and corner harder than on any other bike I've ridden. Carrying even more speed than last time, I hucked it so far that my helmet hit a tree branch. As I pulled pine needles out of my visor, hair standing on end, it hit me: This is not a typical fat bike."
4589,"Salsa developed the Bucksaw to shred primarily on normal trails, not just to float over snow and sand. Its 100mm-travel Split Pivot suspension system is the same as that found on Salsa's Horsethief and Spearfish trail bikes. And while the rest of the industry is going wider on rims, Salsa went the other direction, for weight savings and better handling on hard surfaces. The bike is built with 3.8-inch Surly Nate tires and 65mm-wide Surly Marge Lite rims that are narrower than most in their category, though still about twice as wide as those on conventional bikes."
4590,"The suspension and squish from the fat tires makes the Bucksaw feel like it has 120mm or more of travel. The bike transformed descents with drops and ledges into cakewalks, and I mowed over fist- to head-size rocks that I usually have to pay careful attention to. I even cleaned technical climbs I often have to walk."
4591,"I ventured on bigger rides on the Bucksaw, searching for its limits. I found a few. The bike's 33.6 pounds checked my climbing speed. SRAM's 1x11 group is fantastic, but the traction provided by the big tires allowed the bike to climb very steep pitches that my legs couldn't actually sustain for very long; I'd prefer a double-chainring setup. And although the Bucksaw performs way better on soft surfaces than a regular mountain bike, its narrower tires don't float across sand or snow as easily as those on a traditional fat bike, which are 4.5 to 5 inches wide."
4592,"Still, this unusual model surprised me. Until now, I thought fat bikes were good only on snow and sand. The Bucksaw fills a gap between normal mountain bikes and fat bikes—one that I didn't know existed before this. It turns out to be a sweet spot, but to understand why, you need to ride this bike. Just don't be surprised if it gives you goosebumps in July."
4593,"More than just aero
"
4594,"Aero road bikes ask you to make a leap of faith—to believe that their wind-cheating benefits will make you faster, despite the fact that those benefits are hard to feel. Even riders who obsess over their power output have to diligently review the data to quantify the difference. Additionally, aerodynamic frames often weigh more, flex more, feel rougher, handle more vaguely, and are less predictable in crosswinds than standard road bikes. That's a lot of compromise for gains that are hard to detect. The Cervélo S5 attempts to achieve a better balance, and in many succeeds."
4595,"Since the S5 was launched at the 2012 Tour de France, it has remained one of the most aerodynamic bikes in its category, which made Cervélo's job a little easier. To improve, the S5 didn't need to become more slippery, but the company could work on making it a stiffer, sharper-handling bike. Cervélo can claim success in these regards: The 2015 S5 frame is 35 percent torsionally stiffer, with 17 percent more lateral fork stiffness. These improvements, says Cervélo, were done without adding weight or affecting aerodynamics."
4596,"Save for a slightly shorter stack, the bike's geometry stayed the same—but the new S5 feels totally different on the road. Compared with its predecessor, which I've ridden extensively, it feels like a quicker-handling and more accurate bike. I'd have no qualms about racing this in a crit or diving into a technical descent at full speed. I thought the old S5 handled well enough, but I was always aware that I was on an aero bike when carving challenging descents. No such reservations on the new S5."
4597,"Cervélo also claims the bottom-bracket area is 6 percent stiffer than the previous version. I didn't sense the change, but I did note that before testing the new S5, I was riding a 2015 Specialized S-Works Tarmac—and the S5 didn't feel like a step backward in stiffness. Given the extra rigidity, I was surprised that the S5 is also reasonably compliant. On one section of rough pavement that I cross with almost all my test bikes, the S5 was actually one of the more forgiving frames I've ridden."
4598,The updates aren't relegated to performance only. Other smaller changes make the new S5 more user-friendly: The cable routing is set up for mechanical and electronic drivetrains and hydraulic brakes. The frame and fork got extra clearance and can now fit a 25mm-wide tire.
4599,"The S5 does still makes some trade-offs. At 1,060 grams, the S5 frame is one of the lightest aero road bikes, but is half a pound heavier than many top race bikes (Cervélo's R5 frame weighs a claimed 808 grams). It also gets pushed around in the wind more than lower-profile bikes and is noticeably loud: Road noise, pebble strikes, and shifting all seem to be amplified by the frame, and the wheels are quite loud as well. The ride is a bit numb, lacking the sweet, lively, and connected feel that my favorite race bikes have."
4600,"With the S5, Cervélo has narrowed the gap between aero bikes and traditional race models, but it hasn't eliminated the difference. Still, that doesn't detract from what the company has accomplished here: It made one of the fastest— if not the fastest—aero road bikes stiffer, better handling, and more rewarding to ride. While traditional road bikes might be lighter and livelier, the S5 is almost certainly faster. And if that's your priority, the S5 offers a rare blend of wind-beating speed with fewer compromises."

4614,"Cyclocross racer Femke van den Driessche has become famous, and put bike racing in the news, for all the wrong reasons. The Belgian athlete has the dubious distinction of being the first rider accused of “technological fraud,” or mechanical doping, after a hidden motor was discovered in one of her spare bikes at the 2016 UCI Cyclocross World Championships."
4615,"Van den Driessche's fraud pulled attention away from her event—the first-ever Women's Under-23 race, which was supposed to be historic in its own right— as well as solid cycling performances by Kaitie Antonneau (8th, Elite Women), Gage Hecht (12th, Junior Men), and Logan Owen (13th, U23 Men)."

4617,"Rumors and serious accusations of racers using hidden motor systems have been around the sport since 2010, when Fabian Cancellara accelerated away from the field to win the Tour of Flanders, and Italian journalist and ex-pro Davide Cassani later demonstrated a system for RAI TV."
4618,But what is mechanical doping? How does it work? And is it really a major problem?
4619,"E-bikes are not exactly new, but most of the time they’re readily recognizable with large motors and battery systems. The hidden versions are far more subtle. The most popular and widely known is from German company Vivax Assist; it’s small enough to go unnoticed on a normal road bike, but powerful enough to change a race."
4620,"The Vivax Assist system requires a careful retrofit to an existing frame. The crankset’s bottom bracket spindle is fitted with a notch-toothed gear ring. A cylindrical electric motor, inserted in the seat tube, has a splined drive gear that meshes perpendicularly with the teeth on the BB ring. A horizontal hole is drilled in the seat tube for a fixing pin, so the motor doesn’t just spin inside the tube. Careful patching would be necessary to conceal the hole, and a minimum seat-tube diameter (30.9mm) is required, which rules out some bikes. "
4621,"A wiring system runs to a remote on-off button concealed under the handlebar tape, which could be retrofitted to a remote shifter button. On the normal Vivax Assist system, the battery sits in a seatpack or water bottle. Either might be noticeable to keen eyes, but if a rider is willing to sacrifice some power or run time, a smaller battery could be concealed inside the frame. That would also reduce total system weight from the 1.8 kilograms (3.96 pounds) Vivax claims for its standard setup."
4622,
4623,
4624,"But is that weight worth it? It depends. In a hidden system like this, the battery isn’t large enough to provide power for an entire road race, although it could for most of a cyclocross race, which runs an hour for elite men and 45 minutes for elite women. Most of the time, it would be up to the rider to decide when to turn the system on and off—for crucial climbs or attacks, for instance. The systems are said to be very quiet—possibly undetectable against crowd noise or even nearby cars and motorcycles in the race caravan."
4625,"Vivax claims its stock system provides 200 watts of additional power to the crankshaft, but due to efficiency losses, actual power at the wheel is anywhere from 40 to 100 additional watts depending on the rider’s own cadence. Burn time is 40 to 100 minutes, according to Vivax’s charts. At slower cadences, the motor helps more than it does at faster RPMs. Depending on the version, once above 75 or 90 RPM, the power assist drops dramatically because the rider’s own pedaling rate is faster than the motor’s."
4626,     RELATED: UCI Admits Possibility of Past Mechanized Doping
4627,"That’s for the stock system; a custom system could be tuned to work at higher cadences, or to provide power over a shorter period of time. Even a modest boost of 20 to 30 watts could make a significant difference on a long climb in a stage race like the Tour de France."
4628,"But all of that is freely available information. The question, for years, has been simple: Is anyone actually using these things in races? Until Saturday, there were rumors and accusations, but no proof. Van den Driessche and her father deny any intent to cheat and say that the situation was a mix-up: A friend’s bike outfitted with a motor was mistakenly brought to the pits. Van den Driessche never rode the bike, which was confiscated from the pits after just one lap of the U23 women’s race in which van den Driessche competed."

By accounts from the World Championships, they have new, more portable technology available. "

But—partly because it would be almost impossible for a rider to cheat like this on his own, without team knowledge—the ban also can apply to a rider’s entire team, essentially creating a death sentence for any pro cycling team found to employ motors."

4655,Zipp gives the skunkworks treatment to its most popular wheel
4656,"Back in October, Zipp unveiled its Nest Speed Weaponry (NSW) program with the launch of the 808 NSW wheels. ‘Nest’ is the nickname of the research and development area inside Zipp’s factory in Indianapolis. It’s where all the new products get imagined and developed, which is why I’m not allowed within 10 feet of the door when I visit. The NSW label is applied to products with Zipp’s latest features and technologies, which may, or may not, trickle down to the company’s standard products."
4657,
4658,
4659,"The latest wheelset to get the NSW treatment is Zipp’s most popular wheelset: the 404 clincher. In a way, it was a 404 wheelset that kicked off this whole NSW program. In June of 2014, the company released the 404 Firestrike. It sat beside the standard 404 Firecrest, but introduced new features and technologies to the Zipp line. In May 2015, the 404 Firestrike was updated, and turned into a limited product run (404 sets were made). NSW formalizes and clarifies the tinkering Zipp was doing with the 404 Firestrike: Essentially, these are Zipp’s skunkworks products, available to the public."
4660,     RELATED: Zipp Factory Tour
4661,"The 404 NSW replaces 404 Firestrike. The rim depth is 58mm, but was tweaked to reduce the NSW’s side force—how much it's affected by crosswinds—by 34 percent compared to the Firecrest. Reducing the side force means the wheel feels less twitchy and more predictable."
4662,
4663,
4664,"Some of the reduction in side force comes, surprisingly, from the graphics. The NSW’s graphics are not stickers, but printed on the rim. Zipp has always touted the benefits of its dimpled rim surface, which is why it was curious that the stickers the company was using covered and filled in many of those dimples. The printed graphics don’t mess with the indentations, which, “help allow the dimples to do what they were designed to do,” and save a bit of weight also."
4665,"The arrangement of the dimples is called ABLC Sawtooth, and it’s where Zipp really unleashes the jargony-jargon. To sum it up, short and simple: Improved dimple design and placement reduce drag and improve stability."
4666,
4667,
4668,"Zipp’s Showstopper brake track debuted with the 404 Firestrike, so it’s no surprise they're found on the 404 NSW. In an effort to improve wet-weather braking, Zipp molds in a scalloped pattern, then tops it with silicon carbide."
4669,
4670,
4671,"Carried over from the 808 NSW is the Cognition hub set. The showpiece here is what Zipp calls the Axial Clutch: When coasting, the magnetic drive mechanism disengages to reduce drag, which potentially results in some free speed. It’s also very quiet (more on this below). Pedal, and 36 points engage—“there isn’t a more secure freehub mechanism on the market,” Zipp’s propaganda claims. Zipp will offer three driver bodies: Shimano/SRAM 11-speed (10-speed compatible), SRAM XD for 10-42 cassettes, and Campagnolo."
4672,
4673,
4674,"Both the front and rear hubs use 17mm axles, and flange shapes are claimed to improve bearing fit so that, “bearings quietly stay in place, roll faster, last longer, and provide a laterally stiffer hub.” The bearings are stainless steel, and preload is factory set and not adjustable. Claimed hub weights are 110 grams up front, and 225 grams rear."
4675,
4676,
4677,"The 404s are never going to be climbing-wheel light, but Zipp was able to carve out a bit of weight compared to the 404 Firestrike. On my scale, the NSWs came in at 1558 grams (claimed weight is 1555 grams), 86 grams less than the 404 Firestrike (also on my scale)."
4678,"The 404 NSW is available this month, and sells for $3100. It's an expensive wheel set, but $500 less expensive than the 404 Firestrike, though the Firestrike comes with CeramicSpeed bearings. The 404 Firecrest ($2100) remains in Zipp’s line alongside the 404 NSW. The 404 Firestrike is still shown on Zipp's website, but is no longer available."
4679,
4680,
4681,The 404 NSW is not a limited edition; Zipp will make as many as they can sell. Only a clincher version is available for now.
4682,     RELATED: Float Up Climbs with ENVE’s New Carbon Road Hubs and Clincher Rims
4683,"Zipp sent me a set of the 404 NSW a few days before the announcement, and I was able to get some limited miles on the new wheels."
4684,"The clutch is immediately noticeable because it’s nearly silent when coasting, though the deep carbon rims still whoosh loud enough to be heard over the wind. There may be a drag reduction, but I found the effect was hardly evident. I did ride flatter terrain, however; maybe when the snow clears and I can get on the high passes near me it will be more obvious."
4685,
4686,
4687,"The brake track is fantastic: I was riding through a good amount of snow runoff, and the braking power was excellent, though a bit of modulation seems to have been sacrificed. The brake track is also loud: There's no squeal, but there is a lot of friction noise. The rear hub may be quieter, but it is more than made up by brake noise."
4688,
4689,
4690,"I found the wheels were very stable and predictable; so much that I never thought about them, or noticed them in the wind. However, I ride with deep wheels a lot, and often with deeper wheels than these, so I’m used to the feel. However, my sense is that the NSW is one of the least-dramatic deep wheels you can ride in the wind."
4691,
4692,
4693,"As stated, this wheel will never be a weight champion, so you don't experience the ethereality of a climbing wheel. The NSWs feel reasonably quick; enough that they don’t deaden a nice lively bike. It’s dangerous to comment on aerodynamics based on seat-of-the-pants observations, but riding these wheels on sections of road I’ve traversed on many wheel sets, they do have that ‘a little bit faster, a little bit more easily’ feel. At the very least, you feel like you’re getting some aerodynamic gain from these wheels."
4694,
4695,
4696,"Lateral stiffness is very good, though I’m no brute. As I’ve experienced from the current crop of Zipp wheels, the NSW rides great: compliant and smooth enough that it makes bikes ride more nicely."
4697,"Like the 404 Firestrike, the 404 NSW is high end wheelset that claims exceptional performance, but its most exceptional trait may be how good it is as an everyday wheel set."

After a few runs on the path, I found it best to keep the Xtracycle on the roads—it is meant to replace a car, after all. I felt like drivers gave me more respect and space than they typically do when I am on a standard bike, possibly because of the 10E's size and ability to trot along at a good clip."
4778,"The Bosch system blends cleanly into the frame, replacing the traditional bottom-bracket shell with an integrated motor and crank. It's the slickest-operating assist I've used. Just turn it on and pedal. The motor adds, depending on selected mode, a 50 to 275 percent boost to the power you generate. It also reduces power briefly when you change gears, to avoid shifting under load. I wish the motor operated a little smoother—there's a brief lag before the power kicks in, and when it does it comes on quickly. You feel a similarly abrupt change when you hit 20mph and the power cuts off. This makes the 10E feel jerky sometimes, especially when stopping, starting, attempting to negotiate tight spaces, and conducting slower-speed maneuvers—especially in turbo mode."
4779,"	A multifunction handlebar display lets you select the assist mode and see how many miles are remaining on the charge. Though Xtracycle provides a claimed range—20 to 100 miles, depending on assist level and conditions—actual mileage off a single charge varies significantly based on how much weight you're carrying, how hilly your area is, and even the air temperature. I got in about 20 miles of start-and-stop errand running in turbo mode on fairly flat terrain, on a 40-degree day, while carrying an extremely heavy load.

I hauled bikes to the shop, picked up some new furniture, and loaded a week's worth of groceries onto the bike.

4800,This sale on Smith’s Forefront mountain bike helmet offers a lot of helmet for the money
4801,"Smith’s Forefront mountain bike helmet offers a great fit and unique styling, thanks to its use of Koroyd material. Koroyd is made up of thermowelded plastic straws, which make a honeycomb-like structure. It absorbs the same impacts as EPS foam with less material, so the Forefront is smaller and less bulky than most helmets."
4802,"The only real downside is that Koroyd limits airflow somewhat, which becomes noticeable on scorching hot rides. Smith’s Route and Rover address the issue with deep internal air channeling. Even so, I often use the Forefront on rides under 90 degrees because the fit is fantactic, I love the looks, the groove across the front offers a great place to stow eyewear on climbs and the Koroyd stops stinging bugs from getting to your head."

4806,"Is the replacement for the Tallboy LT a 27.5+ or 29er? Well, yes, it is."
4807,"Remember how quickly 26” wheels were replaced by 27.5” versions? Well, it seems a similarly fast change is about to happen to the trail 29er, and Santa Cruz’s all-new Hightower is an excellent example of why it’s destined to happen. This new forward-thinking, 135mm-travel 29er with boost spacing front and rear is not only compatible with 29” wheels, but will also work with 27.5+ versions. That’s pretty unusual—the problem with fitting a 27.5+ tire and wheel combo in a 29er is that the  27.5+ versions are slightly smaller in diameter, which lowers the bottom bracket by roughly a half inch depending on what tires are used. On some bikes that’s a big deal, or at the very least a compromise. The Hightower avoids this pitfall by including a flip chip in its upper suspension linkage that, along with a 10mm-longer-travel fork, effectively gives the Hightower an almost identical geometry. In the future, the modern trail 29er will be compatible with both wheel sizes and go either way without compromise—and the Hightower is that bike."
4808,
4809,
4810,"Beyond the wheel size, the Hightower is a modernized version of the Tallboy LT—a bike that quietly disappeared from Santa Cruz’s line in July. Although suspension travel is the same at 135mm, the Hightower essentially received all the updates that the Nomad, Bronson, and 5010 got, such as third-generation VPP suspension, an internal dropper post line, internal shift cable tunnels, and updated geometry. The standout geometry change is that the head angle now comes in at 67 degrees—that’s a whopping 2.5 degrees more relaxed than the Tallboy LT. Another significant change is the bike’s 15mm shorter chainstays that now measure at 435mm. The Hightower is only 1x-compatible and has no front derailleur mount. The Hightower frame will be offered in carbon only, using Santa Cruz’s C and higher-grade CC builds. Colors are either Sriracha Red or Matte Carbon & Mint. A size large CC frame weighs in at 5.88 pounds with rear shock and hardware."
4811,     RELATED: First Ride: 2016 Santa Cruz Bronson
4812,"Since plus-sized tires and wheels effectively drop a 29er’s bottom-bracket height, raising it back up with an adjustable linkage and longer fork makes perfect sense. Although close, the adjustment does not make the geometry exactly the same. The angles are 0.2 degrees more relaxed and the bottom bracket is 2mm lower. Santa Cruz could have made it exact or much closer, but doing so would have changed the shock rate more than its engineers were comfortable with. As is, there is a small change in shock rate, making it less progressive—roughly the equivalent of removing a single volume spacer to the shock, which Santa Cruz says is a factor most riders won’t even notice."
4813,
4814,
4815,"Santa Cruz chose to outfit its plus-size Hightower models with 2.8-inch-wide tires; in testing, almost all of its riders found them to be more responsive, with the 3.0” size being a bit floaty and bouncy. Santa Cruz says that 3.0” tires are the maximum that will fit and I confirmed this by mounting up a wheel with a 45mm-wide rim and 3.0” Specialized Ground Control—it fit, but just barely. The Hightower will be offered in compete builds as a 29er or 27.5+ and as a frameset. At this time, Santa Cruz will not offer a kit with fork and wheels to change the bike to the opposite size configuration—it’s up to you to switch it up. If you don’t want to buy two forks, Santa Cruz recommends swapping air shafts internally to change travel or going with the longer 150mm-travel version, which will work better in 29er mode than running a 140mm fork in 27.5+ mode. "
4816,"I rode the Hightower CC XX1 AM 29 complete with Enve M Series 60 Forty/HV carbon rim upgrade on my home trails, where I’ve tested countless bikes, including two excellent benchmarks: the Santa Cruz Nomad and the Specialized Enduro 29. The bike came with a 27.5+ wheel setup and 150mm-travel Rockshox Pike so I could test it in plus mode, too. "

4819,     RELATED: First Ride: 2016 Juliana Roubion and Furtado
4820,"I started testing with the bike in 29er mode with a 140mm fork and the flip chip in its lowest 29er setting. I’ve spent some time on the Tallboy LT; the biggest difference I felt between it and the Hightower is the geometry. The head angle alone gives the bike a whole new attitude that makes it way more predictable at speed and on the steeps or both at the same time. Shorter chainstays really tuck the rear wheel underneath you so it doesn’t feel like its along for the ride. It’s still a long-feeling bike in general, but that’s a good thing because it’s incredibly stable. The front end also has a lengthy feel to it that puts the front wheel pretty far out in front of the rider. As crazy as it sounds, the front-center on the Hightower feels even longer than the Nomad even though it’s actually shorter—that big front wheel really adds a sensation of length and stability. "
4821,
4822,
4823,"Another standout difference on the new bike is its improved suspension. Pretty much every bike has benefitted from the new higher-volume Fox EVOL and Rockshox Debonair air cans, but I’ve noticed the biggest improvement on the VPP bikes. Between the supple initial stroke of these shocks and the more linear suspension curve of the latest third generation VPP, they’re more reactive to smaller-frequency bumps, yet still take bigger hits like a champ. As with prior generations, the newer VPP still pedals really well with a nice supportive feel while the shock is in its open mode, but now it’s more supple and that really helps with climbing traction. "
4824,"Santa Cruz says that some of its EWS Enduro team members will race the Hightower at select events, and I can see why: Like most good trail 29ers, this one carries an amazing amount of momentum. The speed generated in a few key corners allowed me to easily connect a couple of small natural-terrain double jumps that are usually a stretch for me and require a lot of effort on most other bikes. "
4825,"El Niño has been the real deal here in Southern California for most of my test period, making for hero dirt conditions and near perfect traction—not really where plus tires shine. As a result, I spent about 75 percent of the time on the 29er setup and loved it. Over the last few days of testing, things dried out and traction started becoming scarce, so I put the Hightower in 27.5+ mode. While swapping wheels, I noticed something many may find a bit surprising—even though the 29er and 27.5+ wheels were built with identical hubs, cassettes, and rotors, the 27.5+ setup only weighed 58 grams more than the 29er. And that was even with Enve M Series 60 Forty/HV carbon rims, versus Easton aluminum ARC 40 27.5 rims. "
4826,
4827,
4828,"As one might expect, traction improved on the looser dry trail conditions with the plus-size tires. Acceleration seemed down just a touch—more than the handful of grams would suggest—which meant to me that I was feeling the added rolling resistance. The bike felt more planted and predictable but less snappy in the turns. This setup worked best on steep climbs and on more primitive trails or those hammered by summer floods. The suspension felt a touch stiffer and rode higher in its stroke due to the rate change. It seemed to play right into the hands of the softer tires though, and still worked great. Long-term testing will include playing with different shock settings to compensate, but it’s certainly not necessary."
4829,"If I were racing or just wanting to ride a fast, flickable bike, the Hightower’s 29er version would get the nod. Those who put an emphasis on more traction, control, and comfort will enjoy the Hightower in its monster-truck 27.5+ build. In both configurations, the Hightower felt like a modern, aggressive trail bike that satisfies the need for speed—its dual personality is just icing on the cake.

"
4847,"The Domane Disc 6.9 has its quirks. But I also think it may be the smartest, friendliest bike I've ridden."
4848,"I'll start with the quirks—namely, the signature IsoSpeed decoupler pivot, which allows the seatmast to flex farther and more easily than if it were rigidly attached to the top tube. Other reviewers, and my BICYCLING colleagues, seem to agree that IsoSpeed has amazing bump-swallowing capabilities. For the most part, I find the Domane more compliant and smoother-riding than most road bikes. In the saddle, I notice striking overtones of stillness and efficiency—with two asterisks."
4849,"The first is that the IsoSpeed cushions only my butt. The ride feels a bit disjointed because the front of the bike diffuses impacts less than the rear does. The Domane's front end still feels more compliant than most (and the squishy-but-not-bulky Bontrager IsoZone foam padding under the Bontrager bar tape helps), but it's not as forgiving as the rear end."
4850,"Asterisk two: IsoSpeed does its thing only when I am seated. When I am out of the saddle, the front and rear smooth the road in a more synchronized way. That is good, but the bike feels noticeably different from when I am sitting. This is generally true to various degrees on almost all bikes, but the change is more pronounced here."
4851,"Still, the IsoSpeed works. And it is part of the reason the Domane became a favorite bike to take on longer rides and rougher roads: because it is so damn smooth and—though I usually dislike the word—comfortable."
4852,"Now to the other characteristics that make the Domane a high-performance, yet practical and easy-to-ride bike."
4853,"I'm used to $8,000 road bikes being efficient and blindingly quick. And the Domane Disc 6.9 does feel even stiffer to me than Trek's Madone 7 race series—it should feel quick on the climbs. But the the handlebar seems heavy, and I'd estimate that the discs add a weight penalty of at least half a pound. I never felt slow climbing on the Domane Disc, but I never felt fast either. The bike does have low enough gearing that spinning up hills doesn't require God's own quads, and it's coupled with the best shifting in the road market, Shimano Di2."
4854,"And going down, oh my. Here's an anecdote that summarizes my experience: Coming off a high mountain pass in Colorado, I saw that I was closing in on a slower-moving car in my lane, and sat up to have a drink. I casually glanced at my bike computer and noticed that I was moving at nearly 60 mph—with just one hand on the bar, the bike still brilliantly composed."
4855,"Feedback and accuracy are also exceptional in fast corners. Coupled with Shimano's tremendous R785 hydraulic disc brakes, the Domane is my number one with a bullet for any road descent. The IsoSpeed could play a role here as well, theoretically keeping the bike more connected to the road."
4856,"The Domane Disc is one of the first road bikes available with thru-axles front and rear. These improve steering precision because they stiffen the frame/wheel interface, says Michael Mayer, Trek's road brand manager, and they also ensure that the wheel is properly aligned in the dropout, reducing the chance of disc-rotor rub."
4857,"And if you're a fan of big tires, the Domane's 25mm Bontrager R3 Hard-Case Lites will make you smile, as will the clearance for tires that are much wider. The bike easily accommodated the 29s I later installed, and I think I could have gone up to 32mm. The wheels are also tubeless-ready."
4858,"The Domane has the best brakes, the best shifting, stability at speed, precise handling, a smooth ride, the ability to take wide tires, tubeless-compatible wheels, thru-axles, fender mounts, mortal-friendly gearing, low weight, and a lifetime frame warranty. This bike offers so much that despite its quirks, I can't deny it: The Domane Disc is one of the best road bikes available."

"
4863,"After four years of development, Garmin introduced its highly anticipated pedal-based power meter, Vector, to a select group of media this week. While the company had two high-profile false starts, the Vector is no longer vaporware; it’s on sale immediately.
	Vector separately measures each leg’s power output, and boasts what may be the easiest installation process of any direct-measurement power meter on the market. Unlike crank-based devices, the users can easily share the pedals between multiple bikes.
	The ability to separately measure left and right legs’ power (and to see it in real-time on your ANT+ head unit) could open up a whole range of new ways to quantify and improve your riding, said Vector Product Manager Clark Foy, co-founder of the startup which invented the prototype Vector system four years ago (MetriGear) before selling to Garmin and continuing his work there.
	“We’ve had a number of academics, fitters, and coaches approach us and say they want to work with us,” said Foy, adding that the potential benefits from the additional data could include everything from changes in bike fit to different training programs to make riders more efficient.
	The Vector isn’t the first power meter to offer separate left-right power measurement. In fact, it’s not even the first pedal-based system to offer that (the joint Look/Polar Keo Power debuted almost two years ago).
	But the Look/Polar system uses Polar’s dedicated W.I.N.D. wireless transfer protocol, which means it only works with Polar head units. Garmin’s Vector is ANT+ (Garmin owns ANT), so the pedals are compatible with any of the dozen or so ANT+ wireless head units available. Via firmware updates, Garmin’s popular Edge series GPS computers (except the 200), and the Forerunner 910XT offer the ability to see real-time power balance data.
	It’s also more affordable than the $2,500 Look/Polar system, although still not cheap at $1,700. That price includes the pedals, sensors, and Look Keo-compatible cleats, but does not include a head unit.
	Our test pedals weigh 305 grams per pair—about 80g more than a pair of titanium-spindled Keo Blades, and 55g more than Shimano’s Dura-Ace SPD-SL pedals. The sensor unit pods weigh 22.5g each."

4868,"If there were any doubts that the emerging 27.5+ wheel platform is for real, Fox just erased those thoughts with the introduction of an all-new fork dedicated to the size. For those not familiar with the 29+ and 27.5+ sizes, the wider rim and tire basically splits the difference between a fat bike tire and a regular mountain bike tire. One benefit of the 27.5+ size is that it fits in some existing 29er frames because the outer diameters are very similar–but only if there is enough clearance for the wider tire. More importantly, there is a lot of insider buzz and rumors about dedicated 27.5+ bikes coming from major manufacturers. This Fox 27.5+ fork supports those rumors in a big way."
4869,"The all-new 2016 Fox Factory 34 Float 27.5+ fork has enough built-in width to fit tire sizes up to 27.5” X 3.25” mounted on wide rims. A new wider crown and lower leg casting makes room for the bigger tire. There is also a new dedicated 110mm wide hub spacing to go with the new design that attaches with a 15QR axle. The wider hub moves the spoke flanges outward 5mm on each side, improving bracing angle and wheel stiffness. With the added traction of the larger-sized tire, a stiffer wheel should be a tangible benefit.
This 34 Float 27.5+ chassis will feature a 51mm offset with travel ranging from 110mm to 150mm. Also new is a 4th generation FIT4 closed cartridge damper and Float air spring. Details on these new technologies, and price and weight information for all new products are not yet available. Fox product for the 2016 model year, including this fork, is expected to start arriving in shops by the end of May so stay tuned for more details."

"
4883,"""A bike share owned by the people, for the people—the first fully sustainable bike share model of its kind.” At least, that's Spinlister's goal with its latest initiative, announced today at SXSW in Austin, Texas.
Spinlister, already known as a peer-to-peer global bike share (think AirBNB for your bike), has unveiled its idea for what the company calls a ""revolutionary new decentralized bike-share model.""
“It will take the traditional system of a central hub or station, and turn it on its head. From a renter's perspective, they can simply use the Spinlister app to locate a bike, book it, unlock it, and ride away,” explains Spinlister CMO, Andrew Batey. “From an owner's perspective, they're able to conveniently make money, help people, and participate in the world's first sustainable bike-share model. This model requires no sponsorship from private companies or allocation of tax resources from governments into a model known to be flawed. Spinlister is simply here to support and nurture this winning opportunity for all parties involved.”
     Related: Learn to Bike Share
The first users for the program will be in the bike-loving city of Portland, Oregon, late this summer. We sat down with Spinlister's public relations manager, Benny Cruikshank of PR firm True Overdrive to get the scoop on how this bike share differs from anything else available—and when we can expect to see it in action.Bicycling: What's Spinlister's backstory?
Cruikshank: It's been around for a couple years, and until this point, what it's been—for lack of a better term—has been AirBNB for bicycles. Say you have a cyclocross bike that you only ride during the cyclocross season. During the months where you're not riding it, you can take some photos, set a price, and list it on Spinlister. Then, if I came to town and wanted to ride a bike, I could go on Spinlister and search the area and find your bike, and contact you to rent it! Then, most of the rent goes to you and a bit goes to Spinlister as a transaction fee.So what's the new concept?
It's an added feature, but the original use will remain. It's a broad concept, this new idea. To use New York City as an example, they already have the CitiBike program, but there are some problems with that traditional model. It uses a hub or bike station, so if you decide you want to rent a bike, you have to go to a bike station, put in your card, get the bike, and then you have to ride it to another station so you can park it. Sometimes tracking down those stations is really time consuming and they aren't near where you need to be. Or you may go to a station and there aren't any bikes. So Spinlister has taken the idea of bike sharing and their model of peer-to-peer sharing and melded them. So if you live in NYC, you could own one of their VanMoof bikes. You would invest in the bike and own it, and once you have it, it's put into the Spinlister app. It's equipped with GPS and a Bluetooth lock, plus everything you'd expect to see on a traditional bike-share bike. You lock it up anywhere in the city, and the app knows where the bike is. Then, say I'm in NYC and want to rent a bike. I'd go on Spinlister and see that one of the VanMoof bikes is locked up right near me. Then, I could go to it and via the app, I could rent it and unlock it. Then, I could ride it as long as I needed it. I'd lock it wherever I ended up, indicate on my app that my rental was done, and the bike reappears on the map as an available rental.So the owner likely won't ride the bike much?
Essentially. I see it as almost an investment—it's like Uber mixed with AirBNB. If you truly needed the bike, you could take it off the market on the app, though you won't make money while it's out of use. But when it's on the market, you can be making money. Does the owner have to go find their bike if someone left it somewhere?
Exactly.Thinking about that, it seems like a huge hassle and a big potential risk. How do they keep people from taking the bike, say, way far out of the city by car and leaving it somewhere really far away?
Fair question. Because the bike has wireless tracking, the bicycle could easily be located. But, realistically, the only thing stopping people from doing that is integrity.How much does one cost?
The price isn't truly set yet on the bikes. But what Spinlister is doing, since they realize it could impede people from doing this, is subsidizing the cost of the bike. So you can buy it and pay it back through the rentals. Then, once it's paid off, it's yours. The rough estimate on bike cost is the $600 to $700 range.Do they have an estimate on how much someone might make?
We haven't set prices on what the rental fee would be.Where will the sharing start?
They're starting in Portland in late summer this year. It's such a bike-friendly city and Spinlister has a huge user base. They see it as a city that's ready for a bike-share program like this and doesn't have a city-wide program already. "
4884,"What happens if a bicycle is stolen during a rental?
The bicycle is equipped with wireless anti-theft tracking. If a bicycle is stolen, the customer can activate the tracking by emailing Spinlister. Spinlister will track the bicycle and communicate the location to the customer. It's a heavy, rugged, utilitarian commuter bike though, so it hopefully won't be that tempting to bike thieves.Who's financially responsible for stolen bike recovery?
Because Spinlister subsidizes the cost of the bike, the financial risk is on Spinlister.Who is liable if a renter is injured or hurt during a rental?
The renter signs terms and conditions waiving liability against the lister and Spinlister. It's the same process Spinlister employs now, only these bicycles are available instantly. On top of that, Spinlister carries a $1 million liability policy.Does the policy cover the lister/owner of the bike if they get hurt while riding it?
Yes.How will the bike be maintained?
In any city that they go to, they identify a partner bike shop. The bike will ship to the partner shop so it will be assembled by a real mechanic. Then, for maintenance, like the CitiBikes in NYC (if it has a flat, you can push a button on the station to indicate that it has a problem) with Spinlister you can indicate that with the mobile app. The owner and the partner bike shop will get notified. The shop will then pull the bike out of circulation and fix it. The idea is that they would come to the bike, fix it, and get it back into circulation. In theory, in the long-term, the initial plan will be for listers to get discounted pricing and service from these shops.What is the expansion plan for the project?
Spinlister has over 2,000 bicycles listed in Brooklyn alone, making them the largest bike share in the area. The company has users from 120 countries and bicycles listed in 63 countries to date. The focus in 2015 will be building significant supply density and liquidity in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, and Portland."

It's a one-size-fits-all aluminum alloy frame and fork with two or eight speeds, but it's fairly high-tech. It has a Bluetooth wireless lock, wireless anti-theft tracking, an on-board computer and integrated electronics, easily adjustable anti-theft seat post, and a front light and taillight. All models will have a front basket and some will have rear fenders and carriers."
4888,"New crank- and pedal-based power meters, and updated G3 disc hub, from one of the original power pioneers
"
4889,"When compared with truly venerable technologies like the wheel or indoor plumbing, the history of measuring power on bicycles isn’t really very storied—but for what it’s worth, PowerTap has been there since the beginning. PowerTap’s hub-based system has been popular and it continues to be one of the industry’s benchmarks. Despite certain user-friendliness issues, PowerTap has doggedly stuck with their hub-based power meters for over 15 years.
	Until now.
	Advancements in measurement technology and accuracy finally caught up with PowerTap, so it was time to kick the hornet’s nest. Not content to constrain itself to any particular type of power measurement device, PowerTap just went ahead and made one of everything. So now, to go with a revamped, disc-brake-ready hub-centric power meter, PowerTap has released a crank based system and power meter pedals.
	That’s right, one of everything.
	Rolling out three new products at the same time wasn’t intentional. PowerTap engineers, in conjunction with cycling’s super-nerd Allen Lim, were working on the different platforms concurrently and they just happened to all come together at the same time.
	The pedals, dubbed P1, are based on the near-ubiquitous Look Keo platform and contain all the required hardware without the need for any kind of external dangly bit. They are bulkier, harkening back to the original Look pedals, but everything is strategically placed so that the battery compartment is protected and cornering clearance is maintained."
4890,
4891,
4892,"The P1 pedals are truly plug-and-play. Gone are cumbersome setup procedures like calibration and install angle settings; now, you just need to screw the pedals into cranks, sync to an ANT+ or Bluetooth device, and go ride. They even automatically detect crank length and are obviously a double-sided measurement. The pedals weigh 398 grams and run an easily changed AAA battery that can be expected to last about 60 hours. The battery life is definitely shorter than what we’ve come to expect, but AAA batteries are cheap and available everywhere.
	PowerTap’s C1 crank-based power meter is definitely an attention grabber due to the fact that it is not integrated into an actual crank. The system is a dual-ring spider carriage that attaches to any 110BCD five-bolt crank. This is a brilliant innovation, enabling riders to utilize their existing cranks and not have to mess around with a new crank setup. The C1 attaches in minutes, is easy to set up, and once again is dual-sided. As the most affordable of the three options, and with a respectable weight penalty of just 150 grams, this is by far one of the most interesting power meter developments of the last five years. Chainring combinations are 50/36, 52/36, and 53/39."
4893,
4894,
4895,
4896,
4897,"As if that’s not enough, the new Joule GPS+ computer ties it all together. Whatever your data collection device, PowerTap’s updated computer can handle it. Bluetooth SMART provides wireless connectivity to smartphones for updates, downloads, and device configuration. At a glance, the computer seems to be intuitive to use and reasonably light with added features and upgrades from the Joule GPS."
4898,
4899,
4900,"Sadly, none of these products were available for testing. But if these power meters work as advertised, things are about to get interesting in the power space. If you’re having trouble deciding which system is best for you, price and availability might be a determining factor. The G3 hub will be first to hit the market in early April, and will set you back $989. The P1 pedals are next on the shelves later this spring and will cost $1,199. The C1 chainring system will bring up the rear at the beginning of summer, and is the best-priced option by far, at $699."
4901,"A classic shoe with all-around performance
"
4902,"Rapha, the 11-year old company that likes to pretend it’s been around for a century, continues to expand its line of products. The theme for the bulk of the company’s products seems to be modern materials and manufacturing methods, classic style. I’ve met people who can’t stand the whole Rapha thing, but I think there’s little doubt that it has one of the best looking clothing lines in the industry. For 2015, it's added a third shoe to its line called the Climber’s Shoe."
4903,"The outer is perforated. You might think that is to save weight (it might, but only a tiny bit) or increase ventilation (meh), but it’s mostly for other reasons. Instead, they are meant as an homage: to both the Tour de France’s polka-dot King of the Mountains jersey and to the once-popular practice of drilling out parts to save weight. I mean, it wouldn’t be a Rapha product if it weren’t inspired by, or an homage to, or recalling some moment in a race long forgotten, now would it? Personally, the perforations remind me of the shoes my dad raced in when I was a kid like Duegi, Detto-Pietro, and Maressi."
4904,"And, yes, surprisingly those perforations don’t seem to do much to increase ventilation, perhaps because the mesh underneath the outer is so tightly woven. Better than average, yes, but not full-on turbo cooling like the Mavic Huez (a well-ventilated shoe with issues)."
4905,"I’ll get to my thoughts on the Climber’s Shoe’s performance, but first I’ll say I am a bit confused by the price. Rapha makes no secret that their Climber’s Shoe uses a Giro EC90 SLXII carbon sole and Giro’s footbeds. The similarities go deeper: Rapha confirmed that the upper material is the same as Giro’s Prolight SLX II shoe, which sells for $50 less and is exactly the same weight as the Rapha on my scale. It comes down to personal style, I suppose. The Giro is bold and modern; Rapha is more subtle."
4906,"While I’m comparing these shoes, the Rapha felt slightly roomier, and the upper is a bit softer and more compliant than the Giro: a more luxurious-feeling fit. This is a bit surprising, because besides using the same materials, I confirmed that both shoes are built on the same last. But my experience tells me you might get a better fit in the Rapha if you have meaty feet. My tiny and low volume feet fit a bit better in the Giro, however."
4907,"Performance: These are great shoes. They’re comfortable, with a smooth interior free of annoying seams or hard edges. They feel good right away; they’re quite supple when brand new and, once warmed up, conform to the foot well. Nothing fancy about the three strap closure, but the straps are well positioned and away from the boniest bits of the foot, something that a surprising number of shoes get wrong. Strong Velcro allows a very tight fit if desired and the straps don’t seem to creep much over the course of a long ride."
4908,"In general, l much prefer a shoe with three Velcro straps or laces, because I find they usually (not always) fit better and feel better than shoes with mechanical closures. The reinforcements necessary to put those closures on a shoe seem to me to create pressure points and don’t allow the uppers to be as flexible. Yes, they can be tighter, but tighter doesn’t necessarily mean a better fit: A shoe that fits well doesn’t need to be super tight to hold the foot securely. And that’s what I found with the Climber’s shoes: They can’t be cranked as tightly as a shoe with a mechanical buckle, but I found the fit, heel retention and stability of the upper good enough that my foot was secure with a moderate pull on the straps. These are climber’s shoes and not sprinter’s shoes, however, so the uppers are not as supportive as a heavier shoe with a mechanical closure like a Shimano R321. Keep that in mind if you know you pull up heavily on the pedals or have a powerful kick."
4909,"The soles are quite stiff: 90th percentile stiff. Not as stiff, in my opinion, as a Specialized S-Works or Shimano R321 shoe, but then not much is. The Climber’s Shoes are probably stiff enough for most people. They have a flatter sole, and I find it effective at comfort as well. I pulled these shoes out of their box, installed cleats and wore them the first time for about 9 hours straight during a bike-testing session and had no pain, hotspots, or pressure points."
4910,"The cleat attachment is in a pretty standard position, and fixed. I have a somewhat finicky Achilles tendon and so prefer getting my cleats as rearward as possible, so I’ve been liking the sliding cleat attachments that are turning up in shoes from Lake, Shimano, Pearl Izumi and others. This isn’t a make or break, but besides my own situation, I’ve been seeing cleat positions drifting rearward overall and it would be nice if more shoes offered the option to get back if desired."
4911,"As I mentioned above, these shoes do breathe and vent very well—well enough that you’ll definitely want to have covers handy for shoulder season rides—but not as well as you might think with all the holes in them. But, this is one area where they slightly exceed the otherwise similar Giro Prolight."
4912,"The stock Giro insoles, with swappable inserts for different arch heights, are one of the best stock insoles in cycling shoes today in my opinion. And by that I mean I’ll actually ride with these and won’t automatically launch them into the trash and replace them with some Sidas or Superfeet like I do so with many shoes."
4913,"I’ve got several hundred spring miles in the shoes and they’re holding up well. I’ve gotten them dirty with mud and grease, and a bit of Dawn and some scrubbing cleaned them up nicely. Sadly, I can’t say the same for the tire scrubs on the toes, but that’s hardly the shoe’s fault. I hesitate to estimate longevity because environmental conditions and care of a shoe will alter its life exponentially either way. I’ve had excellent luck with Giro’s shoes, which hints at good durability for the Rapha. On Instagram, Team Sky rider Ian Boswell claimed to have nearly 20,000 kilometers and counting on a pair of still-fresh looking Climber’s Shoes."
4914,"But are these truly climber’s shoes? A 408 gram pair of shoes is very light, but lighter shoes do exist. If you’re really looking for a “climber’s shoe,” Giro’s 60g lighter (per pair, my scale) Empire SLX is probably more appropriate—and $50 cheaper."
4915,"My only issue with these shoes is you’re paying a bit extra for style—but it’s your money and your fashion sense, not mine. Despite their name, I think these are very good all-around shoes. I suppose calling them ""Rapha Shoes"" doesn’t quite have the same ring, but they’re comfortable, light, attractive, and classy—and you don’t need to be a grimpeur to appreciate that."

The shorts achieve that: They perform under pressure and stand up to dozens of double-rinse cycles while maintaining their ‘like-new’ look. The fit is super-comfortable, which is crucial for long hours in the saddle."
4930,"I gravitate towards neutrals—even the slightest hint of color can be a turn-off when it comes to my sartorial cycling style—but these shorts made my favorites list because of their detailing. Despite being all black, a shiny embossed skull detail on the back makes them decidedly badass, not boring. Despite having a big pile of shorts to choose from, these simple shorts have become one of my go-to pairs. —Molly Hurford"

4942,"These shorts are the most compressive that the brand offers, but you won't feel like a sausage—you’ll just notice the solid support through your quads. The chamois is easily the most comfortable I’ve owned, and whenever there’s a long ride, this is the pair of shorts that I turn to.

4953,"The Core bib shorts utilize the same chamois pad as the higher-end Classic bibs, and are constructed of plush, thick Lycra meant to survive high-mileage use. My pair has maintained the same level of support for more than a year of riding. I find myself choosing these bibs regularly for long days in the saddle because the padding provides plenty of coverage to keep you cushioned and comfortable as you adjust your riding position."
4954,"The bib straps provide enough stretch to fit riders of all heights, but are tight enough to stay in place without constricting. The leg grippers are wide to provide a snug fit and secure the shorts, without the ""bite"" of a silicone strip (meaning you won't end up with an imprint on your thigh). The flatlock seams give the bibs a solid construction while keeping a low-profile to reduce friction and potential hot spots.—Pat Heine"

4962,"They have nice wide leg grippers and a yoga-style waistband, so there’s no binding anywhere, and you get a nice silhouette. The women’s chamois is the ideal density and size to be super-comfortable without being at all obtrusive, while staying securely in place. The Lycra is thick and compressive, so you get that energizing feeling of your muscles being supported and protected from vibrational fatigue. And the details are classy and feminine without being too flowery. —Selene Yeager"

I wore them under baggies, in cold rain, and in sweltering heat. I left them lying in the hamper wet for a few days and then washed them on “hot,” and after that, tossed them in a hot dryer. Torture testing might be an understatement."
4972,"Through it all they have remained comfortable, and never chafed despite all that friction. The grippers on the legs have not given out, the fabric still retains its slight compressive hold, and the bib straps still lie flat and stay put under hard efforts. But most importantly, the chamois never bunched, rode up, or frayed. It’s still pliable and comfortable even after all that abuse.

That’s why I like Giro’s dropper bibs. Rather than use two shoulder straps, they have one that goes around the back of your neck. Taking them off is simple: The strap stretches enough that you don’t even have to take off your helmet to slide it over your head and down the front of your jersey."
4981,"I’ve found halters to be irritating in the past on other garments (wearing a swimsuit for more than a few hours gives me back pain), but these bibs have a mesh panel that circles your torso up to mid-chest—it keeps the bibs in place, letting the neck strap be loose and comfortable. Plus, the other features are excellent as well: They fall at a great mid-quad length, and the wide, slightly tacky leg bands hold them in place without pinching or unduly sticking to your skin. And the chamois is plush and comfortable.—Taylor Rojek"

4993,"A scalloped elastic leg band terminates before it reaches the fleshy inner thigh to prevent squeezing and causing sausage leg, and a highly compressive fit in the legs feels good from the moment you pull the shorts on. A Y-shaped yoke is made of very soft, stretchy, and seamless material that doesn’t rub or chafe, and while the design isn’t particularly potty-friendly (you still have to take off your helmet and unzip your jersey to go to the bathroom), the magnetic clasp makes it super-easy to re-attach once you’re done.—Gloria Liu"

It’s not too puffy and the right size to avoid chafing, while also providing coverage where you need it most."

5010,"That’s not the case with the Specialized SL Pro Torch bibs. Not only do they fit and look great, but they have little elements that prove that they were designed for women’s bodies."
5011,"First, the cut. The wide silicone leg bands eliminate binding while staying in place, and the seaming is super flattering. They also have a cute and comfortable crossover waistband and my favorite feature: a genius clip-closure bib strap."

So Specialized made your nature break a bit more convenient with a minimalist clip between the shorts and the back of your bibs. It’s easy to unclip with one hand, and it’s magnetized to make it easy to clip back together by feel."

5019,"With design input from 7-time world champion Nico Vouilloz, the French company develops its first full-suspension 29er.
"
5020,"While many Americans may be unfamiliar with Lapierre, the company is a well-respected, mid-size French bike company, not unlike Cannondale in North America, that is steeped in racing history. Its current roster includes rising downhiller Sam Blenkinsop and 2011 women’s U23 World Cup series champion Pauline Ferrand-Prevot. And there’s also that certain employee named Nico Vouilloz."
5021,"Building off that go-fast heritage, Lapierredeveloped the XR Team, a full-suspension carbon 29er race bike with 100mm of rear-wheel travel. The single-pivot model uses chainstays that flex up to 5mm, eliminating a rear pivot, which saves weight. The design is similar to the one used on the company’s aluminum 26-inch X-Race bike, which is now five years old."
5022,"“We wanted to update that bike, but in a carbon 29er model,” says Gilles Lapierre, the company’s managing director. The all-carbon bike features internal cable routing, a short headtube, press-fit 90 bottom bracket, a 142x12 rear axle and sealed cartridge bearings at the pivots."
5023,"Vouilloz, the 7-time World Cup champion, said the geometry was designed to be quick and racy. The bike features a short, 69.5-degree tapered headtube to keep the front end low. Tight 17.6-inch chainstays should make it maneuverable, while a relaxed 72.5-degree seat tube angle creates a roomy cockpit that allows riders to use shorter stems for more control—something that’s possible on 29ers because the front end doesn’t flop around on steep climbs like it would on a 26-inch bike."
5024,"Lapierre unveiled the XR Team at Roc d’ Azur, one of the world’s largest mountain bike festivals, in Frejus on France’s Mediterranean coast. The show bike was equipped with SRAM’s XX drivetrain, Easton EC90 carbon wheels, Fox suspension and Formula brakes. While the company didn’t have a frame weight, the complete bike weighed a claimed 21.8 pounds. Lapierre will offer three models when the bike becomes available next spring, but has yet to set pricing."
5025,"Because of possible patent infringement with Specialized’s Horst Link rear suspension, many Lapierre mountain bikes are unavailable in the United States. The single-pivot XR Team, however, should be conflict-free, so La Pierre would be free to sell it here if it chooses. But even if you can’t buy it here, it will surely be seen under some of the fastest cross-country, marathon and enduro racers next season."
5026,We put the lighting functions on this successful Kickstarter helmet to the test
5027,"Now that the daylight hours are getting fewer in number, and the sun seems to give up around 4pm, bike-light season is officially upon us. But as important as lights are to rider visibility around this time of year, it’s all too easy to lose them, forget to charge them, or leave them out on a locked bike to tempt passing thieves."
5028,"Lumos, the “Next Generation Bicycle Helmet,” as billed on its wildly successful 2015 Kickstarter, aims to solve these problems—and many more. Lights might be hard to keep track of, but your helmet likely is not. With more than 60 LEDs on the front and back of the helmet, not only does Lumos make it simple to bring the requisite number of lumens with every ride, but it also has a few fun, next-level features integrated as well. The most novel of these is the incorporation of turn signals. After all, even if you’re using your arms to dutifully signal all your turns at every intersection, how visible are your gloved hands to drivers at night?"
5029,"I wanted to see how effective Lumos would be in city traffic, so I charged up the helmet (via USB for two hours) and had a coworker drive behind me as I wove through town after dark. First, the pros: My coworker reported that the lights were bright and could be seen from 50 meters away as I rode toward and away from him. The lights were also higher and larger than traditional bike lights—and more visible from eye level in his truck."
5030,"As for the turn signal function, it was simple to use and operated through a two-button remote that unobtrusively mounts to your handlebars. Synchronized with the helmet through an app and your phone’s Bluetooth, the turn signal blinks on when you hit the left or right button and stops when you hit the button again. You can adjust the settings so the helmet beeps to let you know the signal is working. When you want to stop, a built-in accelerometer causes the helmet to replicate brake lights. Pretty cool, right?"
5031,"The turn signals could be seen clearly from about 20 meters, according to my coworker. But here’s where the helmet’s cons come in: Even if drivers notice one side of your helmet rhythmically flashing out your intentions, they aren’t necessarily going to immediately grasp what that means unless they’re paying attention closely. (And have we often known them to do that?) My coworker said he didn’t put together that I was signaling turns until he had followed me over the course of several of them—and that’s from someone who was on the road specifically to pay attention to my helmet. And the brake light mode—even when set to the most sensitive calibration on the app—wasn't always reliable, even when I stopped completely instead of just scrubbing speed. When it did work, there was a lag, meaning that I was sometimes stopped before the lights activated. That didn't communicate anything meaningful to my coworker: For brake light functionality to work optimally with bikes, the lights would have to be attuned to the squeezing of brakes to slow down, and not just the immediate stopping of the entire bike. On the other hand, both turn signals and brake lights are cool ideas that could catch on if drivers begin to expect this kind of light messaging from our heads. And the helmet is simple in appearance and comfortable, so even if the turn signal isn’t a function you plan to use, the lights are pretty useful."
5032,"At 442g, the helmet is on the heavy side, so you’ll probably only want to use it for city commutes and keep a separate one for road rides. And that’s precisely what it’s intended for. According to the Boston-based engineers behind Lumos, who are cyclists themselves, the light was designed for the average 30-45 minute bike commute, and the battery lasts approximately 3 hours when the lights are on solid mode or 6 hours on blinking mode. The helmet currently only comes in one size and three colors—pearl white, charcoal black, and cobalt blue. You can pre-order now for $164 at lumoshelmet.co. Oh, and if it helps sway you—Bill Nye (of Science Guy fame) is a big fan!"
5033,SRAM brings 1x11 performance to new levels of affordability with this mountain bike drivetrain
5034,"As the 1x drivetrain has increasingly become the top choice for many mountain bike riders, one big barrier still remains: price. SRAM is ready to change that with the introduction of its new NX 1x drivetrain. "
5035,"Trickle-down technology from its higher-end XX1, X01, and GX groups is set to make NX function nearly as well is its pricier family members. Plus, every NX piece is compatible with SRAM’s other 1x-group parts, meaning a manufacturer can mix and match to hit certain price points, or a rider can still stay under a budget."
5036,
5037,
5038,"Like SRAM’s other 1x groups, NX is 11-speed with both trigger and GripShift options. Key shared technologies include X-Sync chainrings with narrow/wide tooth profiles that lock into the chain for retention, X-Horizon rear derailleur geometry, and a roller-bearing clutch. Major differences include an NX-level PG-1130 11-42 cassette that uses a standard cassette driver body—not the 10-42 cassette’s XD driver that’s utilized in all of SRAM’s other 1x groups. Giving up the 10-tooth cog limits range, but standard driver compatibility means NX will work with more wheels—especially less expensive and older ones. Another key difference: NX’s trigger shifter has its bar clamp integrated, so it’s not compatible with Matchmaker mounts that combine brake and shift levers."

5046,"I had a really good Saturday several weeks ago. In the morning, I went mountain biking, wearing the new Skyline Trail Short by Troy Lee. In the evening, I went to a friend’s birthday party at a trampoline park wearing Lisa-Frank-themed zebra tights. Basically, I spent an entire day wearing rainbow-colored animal prints, which made me incredibly happy. That’s what the Skyline Short—in Speeda—will do for you.
When I got these shorts in the mail, I couldn’t wait to try them. Beyond the awesome print, I like moto-inspired shorts, and that influence definitely shows up in the Skylines, with their longer, wider leg, wide waistband with two-button closure, and ribbed, front and back spandex stretch panels. The fabric itself is also 2-way stretch, and it feels tough enough to stand up to the rigors of downhill or trail riding.
When I got home, I eagerly pulled the shorts on, and if there was a moment that my enthusiasm was dampened, it was this. The fit seemed funny at first: more fitted around the abdomen than I’d prefer, yet flared out more than I would’ve liked around the knee. Another, petite tester observed the same thing in her pair, and I still noticed this when I sized up to a medium, too. However, this effect seemed mostly aesthetic—the shorts didn’t feel constrictive, they just looked tighter around the belly than I expected, though this was less noticeable in the busier Speeda pattern than it was with the black version of the shorts that I also received. And you should keep reading, because…

...as with a lot of cycling clothes, the fit made more sense once I was actually on the bike. When I was riding, I was impressed with how secure the waistband of the shorts stayed while I was pedaling in and out of the saddle. The shorts never got pulled down in the back; nor did they slide from side to side, or ride up and rub against my hips. The surprising fit in the mirror seemed to translate to a good, and comfortable, fit on the bike. The fabric also offers some water resistance—during one wintry ride, I sat down in the snow for a few minutes, and got up with a dry butt. I also pedaled through streets that were wet with snowmelt and stayed dry. I do wish the shorts had front pockets for putting my hands in when I’m standing around. But to me, the joy-stoking print and fierce-looking overall design of these shorts override these minor drawbacks—and that’s why the Skylines will continue to be a go-to when I feel like having another wild and colorful Saturday.Price: $75Info: troyleedesigns.com"
5047,"Packed with safety technology and performance features for the city cyclist
"
5048,"The first helmet I bought was a BMX helmet so heavy it gave me chronic neck pain just to keep my eyes on the road. At the time I was just starting to ramble around town on an old mountain bike, and I was too insecure in my newfound cycling endeavors to wear a road helmet and risk being perceived as an actual athletic person. "
5049,"Although I've long since traded in that bobbleheaded monstrosity for a series of lighter and more aerodynamic models, I now recognize that the Giro Sutton MIPS, had it existed at the time, would have been the perfect helmet for my formerly spandex-averse lifestyle."
5050,"With a removable soft visor and almost equestrian vibe, the Sutton MIPS is comfortable, it's casual, it’s cute—but even more incredibly, it's as sleek and light as my similarly shaped BMX helmet was bulbous and heavy. It feels as light as my current road helmet, in fact—which isn’t the only performance-oriented feature the Sutton brings to the commuter crowd."
5051,"If you haven’t stumbled across the term MIPS before, you’re probably wondering why those four letters are invading helmet titles this year. MIPS—Multidirectional Impact Protection System—is a relatively new technology used to reduce the rotational forces from an impact through a pair of liners that rotate slightly independently of each other so that your brain isn’t forced to a complete stop in a crash. If you’d like a more thorough explanation, check out this video of the physics behind it all. "
5052,"Before the Sutton, MIPS was primarily reserved for dirt and road helmet models. Now the technology is spreading to more helmet styles, and it’s a perfect example of how Giro’s urban cycling gear targets commuters without sacrificing performance, comfort, or even weight."
5053,"The Sutton also includes an integrated clip for lights, a reinforced U-lock port so you can easily lock it to your bike, and vents—unlike my old BMX helmet, which was really more like the snap-on hair on a Lego person."
5054,"For a subtle look, get the Sutton in matte black or navy—but if you want to be completely unmistakable in traffic, the Matte Glowing Red is really more of a bright, high-visibility orange. Sure, it’s a bold color choice—but when else have you seen a helmet so cool you want to plan your outfit around it?"

"
5057,"Build it and they will come. It seems that Trek might have done just that with the Boost 148 rear hub-spacing standard used on this year’s Remedy 29er line. SRAM has just launched a supporting line of Boost components. However, SRAM didn’t stop with a Boost 148 rear hub—the line also includes Boost Roam 40 wheels, a matching Boost-compatible crank, wider Boost 110 front hubs, and new wider RockShox fork models to fit this hub and 27.5+ tires as wide as 3.0”. "
5058,"Boost 148 is essentially a 6mm increase in the width of the rear hub and spoke bracing angle. According to Trek and SRAM, this seemingly small change increases the lateral stiffness of the 29” wheel enough to bring it to stiffness levels similar to that found on a smaller 27.5” wheel. This increase in width also requires the chainring—a single chainring in the case of SRAM’s 1X11 drivetrain—be moved outboard 3mm to keep the chain line within specifications. That chain line move allows frame engineers to tuck the rear wheel in tighter and make room for fatter tires such as 27.5+. This 3mm move is achieved in the chainring’s spider so it does not affect Q-factor. In addition to offering a Boost 148 X0 rear hub, lower cost MTH-700 series rear hub, and Roam 40 wheel, SRAM is also offering Boost XX1 and X1-1400 cranks to match. "
5059,"SRAM doesn’t stop at the back of the bike though. The company also developed a new Boost 110 front hub and paired it to new Boost RockShox forks. The Boost hub moves the spoke flanges out 5mm on each side for an increase in lateral stiffness just like the Boost 148 rear hub does. RockShox also developed a new hub end cap with increased surface area dubbed Torque Cap. All RockShox Boost 110 forks are Torque Cap compatible. This end cap may keep these hubs from being used with other 110mm wide forks such as the newly launched Fox 34 27.5+ model, but this remains to be seen. And unlike that Fox 27.5+ model, RockShox Boost-compatible forks are being marketed as a wider, stiffer option for regular sized mountain bike tires.

RockShox’s Boost compatible forks will land in shops by June with the exception of the Pike models, which have the nebulous arrival date of “summer.” Since there is only one theoretically compatible bike at this point, the Trek Remedy 29, it begs the question: Where are the bikes? With the combination of this news, the newly released Fox 27.5+ fork, and WTB’s 27.5+ product, it seems that they’re right around the corner. Trek is the only brand currently using the Boost 148 rear hub standard but it’s not patented technology and is open for the entire industry to use. So, any brand can take advantage of these stiffer and wider 27.5+ friendly Boost technologies. Given the advantages, I expect many will."

With the combination of this news, the newly released Fox 27.5+ fork, and WTB’s 27.5+ product, it seems that they’re right around the corner. Trek is the only brand currently using the Boost 148 rear hub standard but it’s not patented technology and is open for the entire industry to use. So, any brand can take advantage of these stiffer and wider 27.5+ friendly Boost technologies. Given the advantages, I expect many will."

5082,"If you’ve spent any time shopping for a helmet, you know that the options are seemingly endless, the product descriptions all sound the same, and at a certain point the helmets appear to be almost indistinguishable from one another. They all claim to be the best for you—and your safety. For a product that appears to be so simple, deciding which one to spend your money on can quickly become overwhelming. To clear up the confusion, here is a basic guide to helmets, along with some of our personal favorites."
5083,"The first step in buying a helmet is determining how you will use it. If you like rowdy trails and big air, consider either a trail or enduro model, which will have greater protection for the back of your head than a road-style helmet, which tends to prioritize ventilation and weight over added side and back protection. Downhill helmets have chin bars—some of which are removable—for even more protection. Road and XC helmets are light and extremely well-ventilated, but may lack the added protection of trail helmets. They typically do not have a visor or are designed to accommodate goggles. "
5084,"Some helmets are designed with commuters in mind. They tend to be a little tougher, to stand up to the rough and tumble use that typifies urban use, and often have features like light clips, or even built-in lighting. They also tend to have slightly less ventilation than road helmets."
5085,"Many helmets now offer accessory integration, which can save you from clunky helmet mounts. Many mountain bike helmets come with camera/light mounts, some of which are even designed with a breakaway feature to prevent additional injuries in the event of a crash. Commuters and riders who train after dark will appreciate helmets with integrated lights, and built-in crash sensors are also becoming more popular."
5086,"On one end of the broad spectrum of ventilation sits the road helmet, which tends to let the most air pass through; on the other end is the commuter helmet, which isn’t necessarily designed with the goal of keeping your head cool. Somewhere in the middle is the trail helmet, whose vents tend to be smaller than those of a road helmet to allow room for more impact-absorbing foam. A full-face helmet is designed with additional protection to withstand a wide variety of impacts, and therefore feels a little warmer. If you frequent bike parks and tend to measure your rides in feet descended rather than feet ascended, you may consider going full face. If you do—and you don’t want to invest in more than one—look for a model with a removable chin bar."
5087,"Road and XC helmets are the flyweights of the helmet world. They are the lightest and most-ventilated helmets out there, and in some cases not only vent well but actually enhance cooling over wearing no helmet at all by directing air flow through the helmet and over your head."
5088,"Don’t be fooled by the “more is always better” mantra. You can’t judge a helmet’s cooling ability simply by how many vents it has. The Giro Synthe, for example, has only 19 vents but is widely regarded as a well-ventilated helmet, while the Kask Valegro has a whopping 37 vents. "
5089,"Nearly every company has its own patented retention system. A very common feature is a dial in the back of the helmet, easily operated by one hand, that adjusts the tension. A height adjustment on these retention systems is also very common. This is helpful to make the retention system wrap around your head in a way that’s most comfortable for you. Not all height adjustments are the same, and everyone’s head is different, so it’s best to try on every option that you’re considering before you settle on one."
5090,"We can’t talk about retention systems without mentioning safety standards and fit. While there are other voluntary testing standards floating around, the mandatory standard is the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) label, which is required for all helmets sold in the USA. The CSPC standard is old, and there is much debate about whether it is adequate."
5091,"A group from Virginia Tech, in conjunction with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) has created a new way of testing helmets for safety performance. While the CPSC label states whether a helmet has met a minimum level of protection, this group aims to quantify the actual performance of helmets. “The helmet ratings are important because right now there’s no available information to consumers when purchasing helmets,” Steve Rowson, director of the Virginia Tech Helmet Lab, said in a press release. “There are differences in performance, and some helmets better reduce risk than others.”"
5092,"No matter the safety certification, no helmet will protect you without the proper fit. “A helmet will only protect you if it fits correctly,” says John Thompson, Scott’s helmet product manager. Sizes vary by company, but most offer a suggestion for what head sizes each will accommodate. Measure the circumference of your head to determine the best size; if you fall between sizes, go by comfort."
5093,"The correct size helmet will sit low and straight on your forehead. The retention system should take up some of the slack so the helmet sits securely on your head—you shouldn't be relying on cinching down the chin strap to hold the helmet in place. Also, the helmet should be large enough that the foam shell doesn’t squeeze or pinch your head in any way. While it may take a moment to adjust straps (loose enough that you don’t feel restricted but not so much that you can’t fit more than a few fingers between the strap and your chin), the correct size helmet will fit comfortably onto your head, and the retention system will easily snug up the fit."
5094,"You may have noticed that many helmets now carry the MIPS logo. MIPS (Multi-Directional Impact System), created by the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, is aimed at reducing the forces that are transmitted to the brain during certain kinds of impacts. Helmets with the MIPS system have a liner inside the helmet that allows your head and helmet to move relative to each other in the event of a crash. Upon impact, the helmet can move a little without pulling on your head, which is claimed to reduce brain trauma. Because the lining of a MIPS-equipped helmet is so integral to the safety design, it can feel very different than the same helmet without the MIPS system. Many helmet models now come in MIPS and non-MIPS options. POC has come up with its own version of the MIPS technology it calls SPIN (Shearing Pads Inside), which accomplishes the same thing."
5095,"With all of that in mind, we have ridden many miles in many different conditions in a lot of helmets. Here are 17 of our favorites. "
5096,An electronic sensor alerts contacts in an emergencyFull Review More Images
5097,"Specialized has refreshed its helmet line to include an increased level of safety. A tiny new electronic sensor called ANGi can direct your phone to send out a call for help in the event of a crash. In addition to ANGi, the Prevail also integrates a new, more comfortable MIPS system. Larger vents and exhaust ports increase ventilation, and an updated micro-dial system lets you adjust the helmet’s height for a more dialed improved fit. Its more streamlined profile keeps the Prevail II locked in as one of Specialized’s top-performing helmets. It also solves that annoying ponytail issue and includes a Gutter Action brow pad that keeps sweat from dripping into your eyes. "
5098,Extremely lightweight and with massive vents
5099,"The Ventral Air SPIN offers the performance we expect from a high-end road helmet. It’s light and has excellent ventilation. The fit system is wispy, and doesn’t have any hard or protruding angles. It’s height adjustable, and features easy one-handed diameter adjustment. The forward strap anchors on POC’s helmets are on the rim, which requires pulling the chin strap tight to prevent an annoying buzz millimeters from the rider’s ear. The company has largely replaced MIPS with SPIN (Shearing Pad Inside) padding, which mimics the advantages of MIPS—reduced force on the brain in some impacts—without the use of a MIPS liner. Overall, the Ventral Air is a very good road helmet for the rider who prioritizes weight and ventilation over aerodynamic performance. "
5100,New and proprietary take on the MIPS systemFull Review More Images
5101,"With increased ventilation and improved aerodynamics over the Synthe, the Aether would already be a top-performer if it stopped right there. But the real gold in this helmet is the proprietary MIPS system. Instead of the sliding layer inside the helmet, the shell and outer layer can move independently, thus getting rid of the sometimes annoying plastic liner from the traditional MIPS system and providing, according to Giro, even more protection from impacts. The updated Roc Loc 5+ Air retention system is minimalist and easy to adjust, making the helmet feel as good as it looks. "
5102,Retention system connected to MIPS liner for better fitFull Review More Images 
5103,"One of two MIPS-equipped aero road helmets from Scott, the Centric Plus has a low-profile shape with large vents across the front that blend aerodynamics with the sort of ventilation we expect in a road helmet. The MIPS layer rests directly on the rider’s head—which spreads pressure across a wide area—and minimalist padding helps with cooling. If you are looking for a light, aero helmet with good ventilation and a focus on safety, the Centric Plus could be what you need."
5104,Light and well-ventilated with interchangeable cheek pads 
5105,"The 2019 Stage Stealth by Troy Lee Designs is the featherweight full-face helmet you won’t need to take off as soon as you’re done descending. Ours weighed 702 grams, although the exact weight will change as you swap out interchangeable liners and cheek pads of varying thickness. The foam liner attaches to the helmet via Velcro patches on the MIPS lining; behind it, there’s EPS and EPP foam for high- and low-speed crash protection. Numerous air intakes and exhaust ports promote airflow, keeping your head cool on climbs, and the magnetic buckle is easy to manipulate with thick gloves on. Enduro enthusiasts and trailhead Darth Vader impressionists: We’ve found your helmet. "
5106,Removable chin bar for casual days on the trail
5107," Built for rides with major terrain changes, the Bell Super 3R MIPS features a removable chin bar that lets you easily switch between half-lid mountain bike helmet and full-face helmet—quickly snap it on or off tool-free. The helmet itself is super comfy—in full-face mode, big, soft pads cushion your face without squishing your cheeks like some other similar helmets. And as a half-lid, it feels snug and fairly well-ventilated. Plus, the MIPS system offers extra peace of mind in the event of a crash. The biggest drawback for me is that carrying the chin bar around isn’t the most convenient—it would be great if it came with a way to securely attach it to a pack. But all in all, it’s a great helmet that I wear frequently in both modes."
5108,"Cool, comfy helmet with pro features"
5109,"Bell’s latest road helmet is its best yet. Fit is always subjective, but this helmet has everything needed for a secure and comfy ride. It’s sleek, compact, light (though not the lightest at 305 grams), and has a ton of airy vents that help keep you cool when you’re redlining on swampy summer rides. You also get the extra protection of MIPS, sunglass guides that help your shades stay put, and aero shaping to help you more easily slip through the wind. The hits of contrasting accents inside make even the neutral colors pop. For women, Bell makes the Z20 Joy Ride version, which is the same design in a different color."
5110,"Inexpensive, all-around helmet for road ridesFull Review More Images"
5111,"For $90 it’s really hard to ask for much more in a helmet. The Tailwind is sharp-looking, and with LEM being a fairly new player in the helmet game, it carries a little cache because, in the short term, you’ll likely be the only person in your group with one. The Tailwind fits well and uses a simple dial to adjust fit. The straps are very easy to move around to get your desired fit, and the ratcheting retention system allows for good height adjustability. Front-facing vents are backed with mesh, which keeps bugs from entering but also reduces airflow a bit. The straps have built-in reflectivity and adjustable dividers, and the closure is a standard side-release buckle. "
5112,Low-cost helmet with high-end chopsFull Review More Images 
5113,"A low-priced helmet with high-end chops, the Echelon II is the latest incarnation of the tried-and-true Echelon, which has been a staple of the Specialized helmet line for years. Although it’s labeled as a road helmet—in Specialized speak that means there is no visor—it’s perfectly suited to trail riding as well. Like it’s more expensive brother, the Prevail II, with the advent of the Hairport fit system the Echelon II now comes in a unisex model so ponytails and bronytails alike will fit comfortably in the updated retention system. The Tri-Fix web splitters aren’t adjustable, but the straps stay well away from the ears, and reflective details are found in the webbing and in stickers on the helmets surface."
5114,Ponytail-friendly and comes in nine color combinations
5115,"Modeled after the wildly popular Synthe, the Ember takes the same technology and styling and packages it into a less expensive model for women. But don’t think unsafe when you think less expensive. The MIPS liner offers the same great protection as it does in more expensive helmets. And since this helmet is designed for women, the dial retention system is ponytail compatible. Ample ventilation comes courtesy of 26 vents, and nine color options means there’s something for everyone."
5116,High-end protection and aesthetics at a discount price
5117,"The Smith Route is based upon its high-end road helmet, the Overtake, giving it a slight makeover to soften the blow to your wallet and appeal to a broad range of users. A standout feature is the material Smith calls Koroyd, which looks very similar to honeycomb and provides protection that exceeds the capabilities of the standard EPS foam typical in most helmets. To keep the price low, the Route has less of the Koroyd than the company’s high-end helmets but still maintains a higher level (claimed) of protection than a standard EPS construction. The helmet’s neutral aesthetics make it more appealing to a broad range of uses, and 18 massive vents make it a great option for summer riding."
5118,Downhill ready and pedal friendlyFull Review More Images
5119," There have been various attempts at hybrid helmets with removable chin bars over the years in an attempt to package the best attributes of a full-face in a pedal-friendly helmet, but the Giro Swichblade is the best yet. The chin bar is easy to remove and install without tools and is small enough to stuff into a pack or hook over the waistband of your shorts. Without the chin bar, the Switchblade is light enough for all-day trail riding, and though it has thicker padding and straps, and covers the rider’s ears, air flows remarkably well through it even at climbing speeds. But when you do snap in the chin bar, you’ll feel a bit better knowing it meets the standards set out by the ASTM 1952 downhill helmet tests (not all chin bars do). "
5120,The features you need at a price you’ll love
5121,"We love the Fixture for what it is—a great looking, ventilated mountain bike helmet with great protective coverage and MIPS, the protective system that can help reduce rotational forces during a crash. The helmet works for ripping down singletrack and for more enduro-style runs. But we also love the Fixture for what it’s not—expensive. At $65 this is one of the lowest-priced helmets you can find with MIPS. It comes in one size only, so check the sizing guide before buying. But it comes in six colors, so there’s definitely one to fit your style."
5122,Lightweight trail helmet in 21 color combinations
5123,
5124,"Building off the popularity of the A1, the A2 MIPS adds the protective qualities of the MIPS liner and increases ventilation by a massive 25 percent over the A1. Made for trail days that don’t require the added protection of a full-face helmet, the A2 still provides extended coverage for the back of your head and temples. It also features a removable and washable liner to guard against stinky pads, a visor, and a three-position retention system to dial in the perfect fit. And since style counts, Troy Lee Designs offers the A2 in 21 different color schemes."
5125,Simplified entry-level mountain bike helmet
5126,"Bell introduces this entry-level mountain bike helmet at a lower price than its previous comparable models. Meant to be as beginner and budget-friendly as possible, the Spark is made with a single layer of EPS foam and uses a MIPS system. It comes in two universal sizes—adult and youth/women’s (same size range but different colors). The visor is fixed in a functional, low position to minimize adjustment distractions. Built to be simple and affordable but long lasting, the edges of the helmet aren’t coated with the hard outer shell that covers the rest of it. But the contact points where it touches the ground (also where the chin strap attaches) are reinforced with rubber bumpers to protect the exposed EPS foam from cracking or wearing down."
5127,High-end tech and style at an affordable price
5128,"Like higher-end Giro helmets, the $100 Syntax features an integrated MIPS liner that is built into the retention system, enabling a more comfortable fit. It also features the Roc Loc Air system that Giro originally developed for its Air Attack aero lid, which holds the helmet off the head for more airflow. These features are a solid find on a helmet at this price point. With the Syntax, Giro is bringing top-tier safety and comfort technologies down to entry-level prices. The integrated MIPS system was originally developed for the Synthe, Giro’s top-tier road racing helmet. “We wanted to bring the look and feel of our professional-level offerings to a wider audience,” said Giro marketing director Dain Zaffke. "
5129,Giro’s top trail helmet has MIPS and is ready for anything
5130,"The Montaro is a high-end, trail-ready helmet. Anti-odor pads minimize dreaded helmet stink, and 16 vents help keep you cool on hot days. The MIPS liner adds great protection against impacts, and Giro’s Roc Loc retention system is a snap to use. Giro also added its P.O.V. Plus visor adjustment system, which allows you to reposition the visor to accommodate goggles, and strap grippers on the back of the helmet help keep goggles in place while bouncing over rough terrain. The integrated camera mount has a breakaway design to let you easily film the action. "
5131,"2013 road components improve weight, function, and durability"
5132,"For the 2013 model year, Shimano is launching its latest high-end road-racing group, the Shimano Dura-Ace 9000. Along with a jump up to 11 speeds, from 10, next year’s mechanical group is 77 grams lighter than the current generation, Dura-Ace 7900, and makes shifts easier to trigger while improving lever ergonomics."
5133,"The shifters were a focal point of the redesign. Feeling that the shift action on the 7900 group wasn’t up to par, Shimano engineers looked back to their 7800 group to establish a benchmark for shifter performance. The company claims the new group reduces rear shift effort by 47 percent and front shift effort by 43 percent. Lever throw—the distance you need to move each lever in order to actuate a shift—has also been reduced by 30 percent. The shifter click and feedback were also improved and made consistent across the entire range of gears by using the company’s Vivid Index technology, which it first developed for XTR mountain bike shifters."
5134,"Because most riders spend the majority of the time riding on the lever hoods—as much as 90 percent, says Shimano—the new shifters’ lever blades are shaped to give rider a better grip when braking from the hoods. Lever reach is also adjustable by 10mm, and the hoods use a dual rubber compound to improve grip."
5135,"
Compare the 7900 hoods (left) with the new 9000 brake hoods (right)."
5136,"
Dura-Ace 9000 will start to appear in shops around September. A complete kit will cost $2,699. In addition to the drivetrain, Shimano expanded its quiver of top-end wheels, and is in the process of releasing Dura-Ace Di2 9070, an update to the company’s original electronic group."
5137,New Dura-Ace Wheel Lineup
5138,"The change to 11-speed required a new hub design, with a freehub that’s 1.85mm wider than 10-speed hubs. (No, your new 11-speed cassette will not fit on 10-speed hubs.) Since the drive-side flange was moved inward to make room for the freehub, Shimano moved the non-drive flange outward 7mm to ensure that wheels with 9000-series hubs wouldn’t lose any lateral stiffness. The new rear hub is 137 grams lighter than comparable 7000-series hubs. The 11-speed wheels will be reverse compatible, via a 1.85mm spacer, with 10-speed cassettes."
5139,"The 9000 series includes seven wheels, which fall into two categories: Blade carbon aero wheels, and lower-profile Accelerating Speed carbon wheels.  The Blade is available in either a 50mm (clincher and tubular) or 75mm depth (only tubular). The Accelerating Speed lineup optimizes power transfer and comes in 24mm (clincher and road tubeless) and 35mm (clincher and tubular)."
5140,"
Crankset Loses an Arm"
5141,"The new 9000 crank is 52 grams lighter than the previous Dura-Ace version. Most of the savings come courtesy of a new four-arm design, instead of the five arms found on earlier groups. Shimano says the 9000 is as stiff as the old crank, thanks to a design that counteracts the naturally uneven power of the pedal stroke: It’s reinforced where peak power is produced (the down stroke), and lightened at the dead points, where stress on the crank is minimal. Both the standard and compact cranks use a 110 BCD bolt pattern and Shimano adds two new climbing-friendly mid-compact chainring combos: 52/36T and 52/38T."
5142, 
5143,7900 Brakes Boost Power
5144,"Shimano says the new brake system is 20-percent more powerful than Dura-Ace 7900. The improvement comes first from the caliper design, which uses a shorter arm and a symmetric, dual axle to pivot the pads toward the brake surface. The new polymer-coated brake pad and improved ergonomics further increase power. The calipers are designed for wider, 23mm rims, which are becoming more common. For the widest rims commonly found on road bikes—28mm—Shimano will sell thinner pads as an aftermarket accessory. The new group also includes a direct-mount caliper, designed to be mounted under the chainstays, for bikes that prioritize aerodynamics."
5145,Pedals Get a Facelift and Fit Options
5146,"The PD-9000 pedal is functionally the same as the current Dura-Ace pedal, but offers new graphics and fit options. For riders who require a wider stance on the bike, Shimano will sell axles that are 4mm wider. Shim kits to adjust cleat angle will also be available."
5147,"Shimano updated its cleat to pivot from the nose, instead of the center like the existing yellow cleat. The new cleat will eliminate the lateral movement that the yellow cleat allows, and will have one degree of float, instead of three."
5148,More Durable Chain and New Cassettes
5149,"The new 11-speed chain uses PTFE plating to reduce friction and increase the chain’s life by 20 percent. There are no longer cutouts or perforations in the link sideplates, which increases the chain’s strength. Unlike the 7900 group, it can be mounted in either direction."
5150,"The cassette is now 11-speed and available in the following configurations: 11-23, 25, or 28 and 12-25 or 28."
5151,"
Designed for pro racers, this bar-end shifter option only changes the rear derailleur."
5152,Updated Dura-Ace 9070 Di2 Sheds Weight
5153,"Shimano’s electronic system also gets a serious makeover, with a revised lever shape centered around shift buttons that are 8mm wider than previous Di2 levers—a criticism of the original Di2 group was difficulty in differentiating between the two shift buttons. 9070 adopts Ultegra Di2’s E-tube wiring, which uses narrower wires and waterproof plugs, and drops the total weight for the wiring harness from 120 to 90 grams. The new three-port junction box includes a charging port, which means you no longer need to remove the battery from your bike to charge it. This is an especially welcome feature for cyclists who will choose to use Shimano’s new internal battery option, which mounts inside the seat post. An optional five-port junction box lets riders add remote, ""satellite"" shifters. The whole system works with a new ANT+ compatible Flight Deck computer from Shimano."
5154,"Dura-Ace Di2 will still have an optional satellite shifter that sits on the bar tops. Called the “Roubaix shifter,” (formerly, the ""climbers' switch"") it’s also compatible with Ultegra Di2. Shimano will release aero bar shifters later this summer, which will also work with Ultegra Di2 systems. An additional TT shifter option was designed at the request of Shimano-sponsored WorldTour racers—instead of two buttons on each bar-end shifter, there will be just one, and both will control rear shifts—one button will handle up shifts, the other downshifts. With those shifter, the rider would shift the front derailleur from the left base-bar shifter."
5155,"You can now install firmware that will allow you to shift multiple gears by holding the buttons down, as on Campy’s EPS system. You can also program in different shift speeds and the number of gears you have on the bike, or swap the function of the various buttons."
5156,"The new electronic components are 172 grams lighter than the current group. When used with the internal battery, Shimano claims that Dura-Ace Di2 is now lighter than mechanical Dura Ace—the company says the electronic system weighs 2,047 grams, compared to mechanical’s 2,072-gram weight. Shimano adds that Dura-Ace 9070 Di2 wont be available until January 2013, and is expected to cost for $4,139.

Though they lacked the full range of a 2x10 system, the advantages outweighed what was lost. 1x11 was such a hit, it has even influenced mountain bike design, with a number of companies eliminating front-derailleur compatibility from their frames."

5300,"Campagnolo officially unveiled its production electronic shifting groups, and provided reasons for the extraordinarily long development process"
5301,"Sicily (Bicycling.com) — Campagnolo officially unveiled its production electronic shifting groups, a project that began in 1992 as an 8-speed group. Over the years, Campy has been asked many times, ""When can we buy your electric group?"""
5302,Campagnolo provided many reasons for the extraordinarily long development process: the technology wasn't available to support its vision; it wanted the group to be perfect; its racers asked for improved performance; it kept adding speeds to its mechanical groups and so the electronic group had to be on par.
5303,"Perhaps the most revelatory: In 2005 the group was ready to be put into production but a freak occurrence stopped everything. Cars with team bikes were driving home from the Giro d'Italia and encountered a powerful rainstorm. The combination of the sheer volume of water and the 150kph speed the cars were traveling at was enough to drive water into the electronics. The systems quit. And even though the systems began working again a day or so later, Campy decided it needed to rework the sealing."
5304,"As you might imagine, Campy claims the production EPS system is waterproof—even team MoviStar mechanics’ pressure washers didn't breach the seals. (The team raced pre-production EPS systems for the whole 2011 season.)"
5305,"When the group finally gets into people’s hands, it will be 2012, 20 years after the project began. No other product in modern memory has had as long a development. And though it began its road to electronics well before Shimano, Campagnolo enters a market in which its Japanese competitor has laid the groundwork."
5306,"The market is still dominated by mechanical shifting, but people have heard of electronic shifting. They may have touched it, or one of their buddies has it. Maybe they know it took all three spots on the Tour de France podium this year."
5307,"Electric shifting is not a mysterious novelty that Campy needs to explain: It just needs to prove its stuff was worth waiting for. Beyond the expected claims of ""benchmark performance"" and ""reliability in any condition,"" there were these two nuggets: EPS will shift under higher torque loads, and it will shift faster than its mechanical brethren."
5308,"Perhaps the biggest surprise in the unveiling was that the company is hitting the market with two new groups out of the gate: Super Record 11 EPS (Electric Power Shift) and Record 11 EPS. Though prices have not been set yet, the company says the latter will be priced on par with Shimano's Dura Ace Di2 (about $4,000 for a complete group); Super Record EPS, naturally, will be more expensive. Availability: It'll probably be spring 2012 before you can get your hands on it. Like Shimano's Di2, the EPS group's cranks, brakes, chains and cassettes are shared with their mechanical siblings."
5309,"Compared to the mechanical groups, taking the electric-shifting route incurs a weight penalty, a bit over 200 grams, according to Campy's claimed weights. Super Record EPS comes in at 2,098 grams versus 1,875 for mechanical. Record EPS tips the scales at 2,184 grams versus 1,974. Both are lighter than Dura Ace Di2, the company claims."
5310,"In fact, if Campy's weights are accurate, Record EPS may be lighter than Dura Ace mechanical. It's interesting, however, that Shimano's Di2 penalty—DA Di2 versus DA mechanical; Ultegra Di2 versus Ultegra mechanical—is less than 100 grams. Campy's EPS penalty is more than 200."
5311,"The lever layout is the same as Campagnolo's mechanical groups—one lever, one function. One lever upshifts, one lever downshifts, and one lever brakes. A somewhat significant update: The position of the thumb lever (Campy calls it ""Lever 2"") has been lowered, so it's easier to actuate from the drops. Unlike Shimano's electric shifting, where every cog requires an individual push of the lever, you can shift all the way up or down the entire cassette simply by holding the lever."
5312," Another difference from Shimano's Di2: The EPS levers have a bit more throw and a distinct ""click."" While shifting Di2 is akin to pressing a lever on a computer keyboard, EPS shifting is more like the switchgear on an expensive sports car. Behind Lever 2 are mode switches: These are used to check battery life and enter the set up and adjustment modes. The levers are provisioned to accept accessory switches, and it was hinted that Tri/TT levers, at least, are on the way."
5313,"The ""Power Unit"" is attached to a bracket that resides under the water bottle. It contains the battery and the ""brains"" of the system. The Battery/Power Unit may be located anywhere; it uses the same bolt spacing as the Di2 ""short"" mount. The EPS Power Unit is larger than the Di2 battery, though, which may make locating more difficult. Some frame companies are working on internal mount solutions for the Power Unit."
5314,"Because the Power Unit also contains the brains (Di2's brains are located in the front derailleur), any battery hacks would also require a brain hack, which might complicate matters. However, on the hack front, EPS does have updatable firmware, so not only can Campy improve, update or provide customized shifting profiles, enterprising programmers can have all sorts of fun."
5315,"The power unit has an additional role as the diagnostic center of the system and will report problems with a buzzer and a colored LED: The color indicates the sick component. White, power unit; yellow, front derailleur; green, rear derailleur; red, interface. If you see a purple (front derailleur) or blue (rear derailleur) light, you're probably in an adjustment mode."
5316,"The battery is not removable from the bike: To charge the system, you must run a lead to the bicycle. Campagnolo's description of battery life is somewhat complicated. The system draws power at rest (you can turn the system off for storage by inserting a magnetic key into the power unit), so you'll get more miles between recharges if you ride more often. If you ride 500km a month, you can expect 1,552km of range or 3.1 months between charges. Ride 1000km a month and it jumps to 1,841km range but drops to 1.8 months between charges. Ride 2000km a month, and your range is 2,029km but only 1 month between charges. The battery is good for 500 charge cycles, but when it's done, the whole power unit must be replaced."
5317,"A quick push of one of the mode buttons and the EPS Interface (which can be attached to the stem, or to the brake housing) indicates battery charge with a green/yellow/red system. When 6% charge remains, there is an additional acoustic warning."
5318,"In the event of a crash the rear derailleur will ""uncouple"" itself when it receives a hard enough impact to protect the actuator. A tug on the derailleur will ""lock"" the derailleur again. In the case of more catastrophic damage, the rider may uncouple the derailleur and manually position it in any cog—Campy calls this the ""Back Home"" function."
5319,"On the setup front, Campy describes two settings. “Zero Setting” is the initial setup to align everything and dial in the shifting. Interestingly, there is only one limit screw in the whole system: It prevents the rear derailleur from overshifting into the spokes. Then, there's “Riding Setting.” This is used to tweak the shifting on the fly if you discover that you didn't nail it in the Zero Setting or if, for instance, you get a flat and take a wheel change mid-race."
5320,"We get a short ride on EPS in the coming days, and will follow up with initial impressions. Look for a full review in an upcoming issue of Bicycling magazine. (The timing is dependent on the arrival of our test group.)"
5321,"With the arrival of EPS, there are now four electric shifting options on the market. Mr. Valentino Campagnolo himself gave every indication that these two groups are only the beginning of Campagnolo's investment in electric shifting, a sentiment we've heard echoed in Shimano's hallways. SRAM, thus far, has not ruled out electric shifting but has not committed to it either."
5322,"At this moment, only time will tell if electric will replace some or all mechanical shifting, or remain an alternative."
5323,All men's and women's road models will have a disc brake option for the brand's upcoming American launch

Jump ahead ten years and Canyon is back at it with disc brake equipped models across its complete road product line. "
5327,"For consumers it means road models are available in both men's and women's versions, including the Aeroad CF SLX, Ultimate CF SLX, Ultimate CF SL, Endurace CF SLX, and Endurace CF SL. "
5328,Get a good look at the super-snappy Endurace CF SLX:
5329,Each new version has been specifically engineered to take advantage of the disc brakes' ability to increase stopping power and control. The change also allows Canyon to tune the frames for a more comfortable ride and increase the frame and fork's clearance to allow for larger tires. Testing of the frames' aerodynamics shows that the disc brakes add a 1.5 percent penalty over the non-disc version—something the average rider probably won’t ever notice. Two 12mm thru-axles stiffen the connection of the wheel to the frame for repeatable wheel and rotor positioning and a unified structure. Canyon claims a 70gram weight difference between rim and disc model frames.
5330,All of the frames will accept Flat Mount-style caliper fastening for the lightest and stiffest connection to the frame and fork.  Rotors will be 160mm front and rear on all but the smallest size frames.

5333,"Athleta Double Dare Bra
I seriously have an impossible time finding bras that fit (I’m size 32 DDD), and sports bras are a whole other ring of hell. I’ve spent a lot of time in stretchy sports bras with no structure. They work—if I wear two of them.
With the Double Dare, however, I didn’t have to double up. The size medium fit me well. It prevented uncomfortable jiggling while climbing or sprinting, but wasn’t so constricting that it hampered my breathing. The tight band kept the bra from sliding up.
Removable cups offered extra coverage: I could wear the bra all day under a T-shirt and then throw on a jersey when it was time for training. The only issue with the cups is that they tend to move around when you put them in the dryer so I had to spend some time repositioning them every time I washed it.
The bra’s high neck made it a great choice for warm-weather or indoor riding. Some low-cut jerseys tend to bare all when you’re crunched over the bars, but with the Double Dare, I could unzip my jersey without being too revealing.
The major drawback to this bra is its soft polyester fabric, which trapped sweat (leaving me feeling pretty gross at the end of a hard workout) and took a long time to dry.
Although no one will see it, the back cutouts are cute and add unexpected detail to the design. The Double Dare also comes in a variety of colors, including yellow and purple. —Elspeth HuyettPrice: $50Info: athleta.gap.com"

"
5344,"Bike races over cobbles are great to watch on TV, but I always wonder how bad that has to hurt, especially on a stiff bike that's built for speed. It seems that the Classics aren't only races of attrition, but also contests to see who can be the least comfortable the longest."
5345,"At this weekend’s Tour of Flanders, Team Sky's top riders won't have to worry about that. They'll be debuting Pinarello’s new Dogma K8-S, a yearlong joint project between Team Sky and its sponsor Jaguar. The bike includes the new Dogma Suspension System 1.0, a lightweight suspension system in the rear triangle with 10mm travel, as well as super flexible carbon chainstays."
5346,"The new model builds on the Dogma F8, which was introduced last year at this time. To improve upon it, Sky and Jaguar relied on research that went into making Jaguars and Land Rovers smooth and comfortable. The tubing of the K8-S has the same aerodynamics of the F8, including the same downtube, seattube, and fork."
5347,"“We took the same aerodynamics of the F8 and just added a more comfortable rear triangle,” says Pinarello designer Paolo Visenten. The K8-S also gets a new seatpost, along with two sets of bottle cage mounts on the down tube and the seat tube—one on each tube for a lower mounted bottle cage, which is more aerodynamic, and another that is higher and more comfort-oriented for the recreational rider."
5348,"The K8-S looks like it's going to be a smooth ride. I could make the chainstays flex with my hands, and I am not that strong of a person. “The chainstays are small near the dropout to increase the flexibility of the chainstays and they are bent to work together with the suspension,” Pinarello designer Paolo Visenten explained."
5349,"The pivot suspension system in the rear looks just like it came off a mountain bike, but in typical Pinarello fashion, it's clean and stylish. An elastometer-based shock is located in between the seatstays and the seat tube, and is not glaringly noticeable. Riders have said that they don’t feel the shock while riding on flat surfaces, which is a good sign showing that the suspension engages when it is needed, but does not drastically affect power transfer."
5350,Geraint Thomas was checking out the suspension on his bike and could easily engage it by pushing on the saddle with his hands.
5351,"To accommodate the rear shock, Pinarello equipped the bike with direct-mount rim brake calipers. This addition also increases tire clearance for the thick tires needed to battle the cobbles and provides improved stopping performance."
5352,"Like the F8, the K8-S includes Pinarello’s asymmetric frame design. Pinarello says that because the chainrings, chain, and cassette are located on the right side, drivetrain forces on a symmetrical frame cause the left and right side of the bike do react differently when the rider pedals. By making the frame asymmetrical, Pinarello claims the frame deflection from the left pedal and right pedal is more evenly balanced. The frame has Think2 internal cable routing, so it's compatible with both mechanical and electronic shifting systems. There are 10 frame sizes: 44, 46.5, 50, 51.5, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.5, and 59.5cm."
5353,"Compared to the F8, the K8-S has slightly longer head tubes, but not as much as the typical difference between a race and Classics-style bike (think Specialized Tarmac vs. the Specialized Roubaix, for instance). It also has slightly slacker head tube angles and more fork offset compared to the F8. This is interesting because it does make the front center longer, but it also makes trail slightly shorter. It’s only a millimeter or two, but the front-end responsiveness on both bikes should feel pretty similar. However, the increased fork offset and longer chainstays (about 1cm) do increase wheelbase (and tire clearance), so the K8s should be more stable overall, but might not feel more sluggish. Pinarello bikes do have longer trail geometry in general, so their handling tends to be calmer than bikes designed with ""American"" crit-style geometry. Because of the longer head tube and slacker head angle, reach is shorter and stack is taller on a K8-S versus an F8."
5354,"Journalists attending the launch rode in follow cars behind Thomas, Luke Rowe, and Elia Vivani as they tested out the bikes on the course for this Sunday’s Tour of Flanders. I’m sure these three would look like they’re flying up the cobbles on any bike, but they insist that the K8 does make a difference. “When you hit the cobbles, every little bit of difference, however small, makes a massive amount of difference in the long run,” says Rowe. “It’s definitely a big advantage we have over our rivals before the race has even started.”"
5355,"Those gains have been quantified, Pinarello says. According to its website, data from Jaguar and Land Rover showed ""that after repeated runs on the cobble sectors, with both bikes [F8 and K8-S], the new Dogma K8-S allowed an 8% increase in speed, while expending 10% less energy."" Pinarello also says that the bike reduces vibration transmission by 50 percent compared to the F8."
5356,"“When you’re going over [the cobbles] at speed, you can tell it’s just taking that edge off,"" Thomas said. ""The comfier you are the more efficient the bike is, and you can go that much faster.” The suspension does add a small amount of weight (95 grams, claimed; total frame weight including suspension is 990 grams); however the gains are almost negated by the fact that riders can ride higher tire pressure over the cobbles, which will aid them when the road evens out."
5357,"“You have to consider that when you’re adding in the suspension, you don’t just have all the carbon parts, but also the metal parts of the system,” explained Visenten. “It’s not the lightest bike possible, so if you have to just climb a road I do not suggest this bike, I suggest the F8. But for example, if you have a flat race this bike would be good because by increasing the comfort you spend less energy.”"
5358,"Personally, I’d gladly take the few extra grams of weight on the bike (it might add some motivation to drop a few winter pounds) and a smoother ride. The frameset (including the rear brake) will be available in the US in June for $6,250. The first bikes will be red and black, with additional colors available at a later date.

5359,Ten tried and true tips to help you find the right bike
5360,"We get bike-buying questions from hundreds of people each year—readers, family members, friends, friends of friends, complete strangers who call us out of the blue. To help you find the right bike, we compiled this bike-buying guide with 10 of the most common queries."
5361,"1. Which is a better bike, a Trek or a Specialized?
	Or Cannondale or Orbea or Scott or Schwinn or Cervelo. We're asked ""Which brand is better?"" almost daily. While each brand has its diehard fans, we can't answer the question. It's not because of any political reason, but because it's not the right question to ask--you're buying a bicycle, not a brand. If you shop by brand first, then you're making a style decision, not a performance one. When deciding which bike is better suited to you, it's the model that counts. To find the best bike, pick your price range, identify the ride feel and features you're after, and then look for models from various brands that meet those criteria. From there, a winner will emerge."
5362,"What about custom bikes? We get this one, too: Which is best, a Serotta Meivici, Parlee Z1 or Seven V-II? The answer: Write the names on a note card, blindfold yourself and throw a dart--you'll end up with a bike you adore. The United States is home to the best custom builders in the world. An established custom builder has the knowledge and experience to build a bike that suits you as long as you fully communicate what you want. Still, every custom house has its flavor. Give the same data to two companies, and the fit and ride quality of the bikes will differ. To find the taste that's best for you, read our reviews for an idea of how the maker interpreted our needs. Then, interview the builders, asking about the theories they use to interpret fit, handling and ride-feel requests. From here, you'll learn a builder's tendencies and be able to choose."
5363,"2. When do bike shops have sales?
	Bikes are like cars: New models arrive on the bike-shop sales floor each year, typically in the fall as the riding season winds down. This is the best time to look for deals, because shops don't want soon-to-be-year-old inventory lingering through the slower winter months. While hot models in popular sizes will sell out over the summer, you may get lucky and find last year's model at a discount, but do your homework before buying: A model often gets a dramatic redesign only every few years, so if the new model has only different paint and minor parts tweaks, you'll save on last year's bike. But if the new model has big frame changes or parts upgrades, then it can be worth paying for the new model. Beware of bikes that are more than a few seasons old. Advances in carbon fiber and component technology happen quickly, so a seemingly great deal may be only an average one."
5364,"3. Can I haggle with the shop over price?
	You can try, but don't expect dealers to be flexible on current-year models. Profit margins on bike sales are razor thin. It's not uncommon for a shop to net more money on the extras--helmet, pedals, computer, and so on--than on the bike sale itself. For this reason, dealers are often more willing to throw in a free seat bag or bottle cage than to give a deal on the bike. Service is an area where you can seek out value: It's common for shops to provide a year of free basic adjustments on your new bike, so it's worth asking for this if your shop offers less."
5365,"If you don't like the deal offered by a shop, then quietly go elsewhere. You may find a better price in a nearby town, but it's not worth driving an hour to save a few bucks. Having a good ?local bike shop will save you time and money in the end with service and any warranty issues. Shops tend to go the extra mile for you if they know you bought the bike there."
5366,"4. Should I buy a carbon-fiber bike?
	Absolutely. Maybe. Unless you shouldn't. Carbon is generally lighter than other materials, can be constructed to provide specific ride qualities in ways that metal tubes can't, and offers unlimited tube shapes--aero or just freaky cool. If you race and want a superstiff frame, carbon offers the best mix of low weight, aerodynamics and drivetrain stiffness without a buckboard ride. But it's also expensive. And not all carbon is equal: Less expensive frames use lower grades of fiber, which are heavier and less stiff, and often have a dead ride quality when compared with higher-grade carbon."
5367,"If you're on a budget, there are many racy bikes made of high-tech aluminum or a mix of alloy and carbon, which are stiff and light but will ride a bit more harshly than their all-?carbon brethren. If you prize a smooth, refined ride feel, carbon can deliver--but so can steel and titanium, both of which continue to advance as frame materials. Ultimately, you should decide based on what you're willing to spend and whether you're a carbon person. Did you stand in line to buy the iPhone? Carbon's cutting-edge tech will appeal to you. But if you're restoring a 1952 MGTD in your garage, then a ti or steel bike from a small builder may be just right."
5368,
5369,"5. Do I need a women's bike?
	Standard bikes are built based on male physiology. Women's bikes are proportioned to suit the general female population, and most have components to suit women's anatomical needs, such as shorter-reach levers for smaller hands. A few companies even tune frame tubing to suit women's generally lighter bodies. All of this leads to a significant if obvious benefit--improved fit--but it also makes you a better, more confident rider."
5370,"The longer cockpit of a standard bike often causes female riders to stretch their torsos and arms, as well as move forward on the saddle. This makes getting a secure grip on the levers more difficult, but it also moves a rider's center of gravity too far forward, compromising balance, mitigating power output and removing some rear-wheel traction. None of this is good."
5371,"To know if you're better off on a women's bike, find a shop with a selection of women's models. Take a test ride on a women's bike, then on a comparable men's model; go fast, brake hard, sit up, get aero--make all the moves you make when riding. Chances are you'll feel more in control on the women's bike."
5372,"6. What components are best--Shimano, Campagnolo or SRAM?
	All three companies make several tiers of well-functioning, dependable component groups. (A group is typically defined to include brake and shift levers, brakes, derailleurs, crankset, bottom bracket, cassette and chain.) Among similarly priced groups, shifting and braking performance as well as weight are close enough that the real deciding factors are style and ergonomics. Be sure to put your hands on all three brands before buying."
5373,"Shimano shifts with a lever nestled inside a swinging brake lever. Shifting action feels smooth on your first ride, with uniformly positive and distinct ratchets. Its cassette bodies and wheels are compatible with SRAM (and vice versa), which gives you a greater choice when buying new wheels. Shimano is the most available, too, if you're ever stuck needing replacement parts, and its 105 group more or less rules midpriced bikes."
5374,"Campagnolo uses a swing lever and a thumb button to shift. Shifting feels stiff initially, then wears in and operates so smoothly that some find the minimal action disconcerting. Of all the groups, it's the easiest to repair. While top groups from all three companies allow multiple shifts with a single action, Campy's highest-end Record and Chorus let you dump the chain--shift it all the way down the cassette with a single punch of the button."
5375,SRAM accomplishes shifts with either a single- or double-length tap of a swing lever nestled against the brake lever. Its levers are praised for their ergonomics and tend to be the most accommodating for small hands. Shifting action lies somewhere between Campy's fluidity and Shimano's precision. Its Rival group is fast becoming popular on midrange bikes.
5376,"7. Is it worth the money to go the next level up in components?
	In terms of performance, the gap between Shimano Dura-Ace and Ultegra is smallest, followed by that of SRAM Red to Force, and then Campagnolo Record to Chorus. Top-level parts use bearings instead of bushings, and have better finishing and materials. Dura-Ace, Red and Record offer lighter weight and fractionally faster shifts, with better feel at the lever."
5377,"Often, in a company's line of bikes the price difference between the top two or even three models reflects upgraded components, wheels and other parts--the frame may be exactly the same. Because parts wear out before frames, we generally advise investing in a quality frame first, and then picking a component level. Will you be putting in 300 miles a week? Then spend to have the best components. But if saving scratch is a priority, go with the nice frame and second-tier parts. Ultegra, Force and Chorus will last as long and work almost as well as top-shelf parts."
5378,"The gap between second- and third-tier groups is more substantial. Shimano 105, SRAM Rival and Campy Centaur are solid and reliable for recreational riding but lack the performance of top-level parts. Below that, Shimano's Tiagra and Sora, and Campy's Veloce are a big step down, aimed at the occasional rider. Compared with even 105 and Centaur, they shift slowly and feel notchy."
5379,
5380,"8. Do I need standard, compact or triple gearing on my road bike?
	Gearing is a small choice that has a big impact. There are three typical options: standard (often chainrings with 53 and 39 teeth up front, paired with a 12-25 tooth-range 10-gear cassette), triple (three chainrings, with granny gears, often 50/40/30 or 52/42/30) or the increasingly popular compact (50/36 or 50/34 chainrings)."
5381,"Which is best depends on how you ride. If you ride only a few miles a week or live near killer hills, then a triple may be best. But if you ride regularly over varied terrain, we recommend a compact. The smaller gear ratios enable nearly the same climbing prowess as a triple, but without the weight and added mechanical complexity of the extra chainring. Compacts also tend to cross-chain well; you can stay in the big chainring and gear down to the easiest cog to power up rises. Standard gearing makes cross-chaining a challenge unless you're a racer or big-wattage masher."
5382,"9. Can't I save a bundle buying online?
	Just as with books, cat litter and everything else, bikes are sold online at reduced prices. But you might not get a bargain. Many reputable sellers offer new and secondhand bikes online, along with other new and used cycling gear, but steer clear of ads that are vague or downright shady, like one we saw on eBay that read, ""not recommended for the Pittsburgh area,"" presumably because that's where the bike had been stolen. When you venture online, you're on your own. If you know your preferred frame angles, top-tube length, and stem and handlebar sizes, you might find a barely used dream ride and save hundreds. We've seen it happen. But if those measurement terms mean nothing to you, visit a bike shop for help. Otherwise, you'll get a bargain online but spend twice the savings trying to make the bike fit, and it may never feel right. We see that happen all the time."
5383,"10. Should I buy a full-suspension mountain bike or a hardtail?
	If you're not sure then you've just revealed yourself as a trail-riding newbie--what a wonderful thing. Go with the hardtail. Without a rear suspension the bike will be lighter and less forgiving, which will help you feel the bumps, pick lines and correct mistakes without the hand-holding of a shock. Think of it this way: Kids who learn to drive on a standard transmission can drive anything, but those who learn on an automatic are spoiled forever."
5384,"Then, there's value. For $1,000, you can buy a quality hardtail with good spec. Full-suspension bikes in this range have low-quality parts. If your heart is set on full suspension, be ready to spend more than a grand for decent tech, and at least $2,500 for a true performance bike."

5411,"Testing out the Fitbit fitness tracker's new bike mode
"
5412,"First, a confession: I didn’t trust the Fitbit Surge when I first strapped it onto my wrist. As one of those pitiable sorts who rides circles around a parking lot until her GPS hits a nice, round number, I was certain the mileage and step counter would be woefully inaccurate and consequentially useless for my obsessive quantifying needs."
5413,"Previous experiences with a Fitbit One had confirmed my suspicions—the step counter seemed to accurately tally walking distance but never the distance I ran. And cycling? I might as well have skipped my 50-mile ride and stayed in watching Netflix as far as my disinterested One was concerned. After two fanatical weeks wearing the wristband, it quickly fell into disuse."
5414,     Related: Do You Need the Apple Watch?
5415,"Luckily, the Surge offers a huge leap in functionality over the One, which is reflected in both the higher price and the fact that they’re targeted at different audiences. With the Surge, active mileage is tracked through the unit’s built-in GPS and not just some vaguely defined stepping distance. Not only can you see how fast you’re running (and now riding), but you can also see your mileage and heart rate. The new “bike” mode expands that functionality even further when you pull up the app on your phone and desktop."
5416,"After a ride, the Surge’s app summaries will graph your route, distance, duration, average speed, heart rate, calories burned, active minutes, and the ride’s impact on your daily stats. Using your web dashboard, you can check out the elevation profile, a second-by-second look at your heart rate, and more thorough maps and graphs of your route."
5417,     Related: 5 Great Fitness Trackers for Cyclists
5418,"The only drawback is the battery life on a ride—right now the Surge’s battery will last up to seven days when on step-counter and heart rate mode, but when you switch into GPS mode, you only get about five hours of power. That’s not nearly enough for a really long ride, but it’s something Fitbit says it’s working to address."
5419,     Related: You Can Now Sync Your Strava Workouts with Fitbit
5420,"When I started out testing the Surge I was rocking a super-cool dual-watch look with a Garmin on one wrist and the Surge on the other because, like I said, I just didn’t trust the Surge’s shiny new GPS. But at some point, after witnessing both watches report the same mileage time and time again, my trust grew and I switched to all Surge, all the time. I like that the small-sized band actually fits my wrist, unlike my giant Garmin 405. And I like keeping track of all my stats throughout the day, whether riding, running, walking, spinning, hiking, lifting weights, doing yoga—or just watching terrifying horror movies to see how my heart rate responds. For multisport athletes—or those of us concerned that despite our riding and running we don’t walk enough throughout the day—the Surge is a definite win."
5421,Price: $250Info: fitbit.com/surge
5422,"Note: If you had the Surge before Fitbit added the “bike” functionality, you need to click on the firmware update (the pink circle with an “!”) and follow these steps to add it:"
5423,"1. Go to your account tab on the Fitbit smartphone app, click on Surge, then on Exercise Shortcuts,  +Exercise, and then add “Bike.”
	2. Do the same on the web dashboard.
	3. Sync, and “Bike” should show up on your device as an exercise mode you can record."
5424,A multitalented road bike that’s really fun to ride
5425,"During the time I test rode the Marin Gestalt 2, I took it on the following surfaces and scenarios: the alternating butter-smooth and crappy pavement of northeast Pennsylvania; riverside towpath (a mixture of cinder, rutted dirt, and cavernous washouts); groomed singletrack; slippery, leaf-covered concrete rubble; gravel roads; muddy lanes; the parking garage of a local casino (don’t ask). I climbed a ton, and bombed down twisty descents. And I sought out new places to ride, getting lost intentionally a few times, just to see what the bike would do."
5426,"And the Gestalt was like, “Dude. That all you got?”"
5427,"When product managers at Marin—a company best known for making great mountain bikes—were developing the Gestalt, their goal was to design the kind of road bike a mountain bike brand would make. “We built in the most capability with the least amount of concessions,” says Chris Holmes, global brand director. “It’s not just okay at everything, it’s really good at a lot of tasks.” "
5428,"What makes it so? You could get intensely granular trying to pinpoint how each attribute of a bike affects the way it moves through the air, across a surface, around a corner, or works with or against gravity. But consider the bike’s name: Gestalt—a word for the philosophical notion that the whole of something is greater than the total of its parts. "
5429,"So disregard the Gestalt’s 1x drivetrain with an 11-42 cassette. Ignore the tubeless-ready rims and Schwalbe’s G-One 30mm tires with a speedy pebble tread. Never mind its butted aluminum frame with clearance for burly rubber (up to 35mm). Pay no heed to the carbon fork, mechanical disc brakes, and rack and fender mounts. And try not to fixate on the budget-friendly $1,209 price tag (if you can)."
5430,"Just get on the damn bike. Because when you do, you’ll discover that the ride it delivers is exactly what you need: a complete diversion and a total blast. You’ll notice that autumn colors include shades nuanced beyond red, yellow, and brown. You’ll be tempted down a lumpy, leaf-covered path into the woods (note to self: knobbies next time), but will be rewarded with a view of the river you can’t believe you haven’t seen in the 20 years you’ve lived nearby. And because you’ll spin almost effortlessly on that two-mile climb that’s usually a grind, you’ll notice a random nutmeg-colored sheep in a familiar flock of white ones, a dirt road you’ve somehow missed until now—and, hold on, is this the top already?"

5434,What You Need to Know

5436,
5437,This racy road bike doesn't just turn—it carves
5438,"Snow was my first love, actually. First it was snowboards and then skis, but all the same, I was intoxicated by the feel of rushing through the air, leaning and feeling that thin metal edge dig into the side of the mountain so hard it carved swoopy S’s deep into the snow. I used to stop at the bottom and try to pick out my line afterwards. I liked that out of all the possible ways to descend this mountain, this was the way that only I had seen."
5439,"Not surprisingly, when I started riding bikes, it was on the descents that I felt most euphoric. So it makes sense that I enjoyed riding the Ritte Ace. The Ace was built to be as close as possible to Ritte owner and longtime bike racer Spencer Canon’s perfect bike—and Canon’s litmus test is the kind of technical, twisting descending that can be found in the mountains above his home in Los Angeles. As he explains it, that’s when a bike has the most stress put on it. And: “I love descending. I think it’s one of the most enjoyable feelings on a bike. Can you be more free?”"
5440,"Canon maintains that the best race bike is not an aero bike. “I’d much rather give the 99 percent [of buyers] what they need to be as fast as possible. In my mind, that is great power transfer and stable bikes.” So Canon designed the Ace with a longer rear center than many modern race bikes, offering more stability at speed. Like Ritte’s other, recent carbon models, the Ace was first modeled in clay (Canon has a design and sculpting background) and then rendered by engineers into 3D modeling software. Tube shaping prioritizes stiffness, but balances it with aesthetics. These are no wispy, vibration-killing seatstays; they are square-edged and have some meat to them. The fork legs are chiseled and stout. The chainstays, down tube, and seat tube start at a modest diameter, but swell as they approach a massive bottom bracket area. Other edges and folds are molded to target rigidity without overbuilding the tubes—Canon doesn’t like it when a bike looks “disproportionately inflated.”"
5441,"And the Ace feels very fast, particularly on descents. It’s not just a sensation: While cruising, I pulled ahead of heavier riders on several short, fast descents, the bike giving me that same free-speed feel that I’ve come to associate with some aero bikes. It could be that I’m off the brakes more, by virtue of feeling so stable—as another tester noted, “I’m usually a little cautious on a new test bike, but I felt immediately confident on fast descents on the Ace.” It could also be positioning, which is unapologetically racy. My size small tester has a 52.6cm top tube, and the stack is relatively short even for a race-style road bike. On very steep descents in the drops, my weight felt lower and farther forward than I’m accustomed to even on other performance-oriented models. But there’s no denying that it makes the Ace go fast: Tuck and straightline, and the bike starts chomping at the bit almost immediately. And true to Canon’s intention, this bike is planted, holding a bombproof line and allowing me to feel relaxed shooting downhill. "
5442,"The Ace is stiff, particularly in the front end: There’s zero flex when I am throwing the handlebar around, standing up out of the saddle to grunt up a steep climb, or chasing a playful sprint with my head down. All energy is channeled into moving this bike forward. It’s also light—built with a SRAM Red 22 group and Hermes wheels, my size small tester is 14.5 pounds. The combination of the two qualities makes for quick, lively acceleration coming out of corners, rolling off from stop signs, or leaping ahead to close gaps. On punchy climbs, the bike responded eagerly to every out-of-the-saddle pedal stroke, making it easier to hang with fast groups despite the fact that I had to muscle 53/39 chainrings (I usually prefer a compact or mid-compact)."
5443,"There were many moments over the course of my testing during which the Ace made me feel fast. But I think this one stood out most: The eight of us came screaming down a hill into a 90-degree right-hander, and before we hit the entrance, Ryan turned to me and warned me that a week before, a friend had skidded on his side all the way across the road, so I feathered the brakes. But by now I had also learned to trust the Ace. So I set up on the outside, pointed my knee, and leaned the bike over as hard as I dared. Weighted shifted, and the Ace bit into the tarmac. It didn’t corner, it carved. We slingshotted out the other side, holding on to so much speed that the bend was behind us before I could think much more about it. But I like to believe that in a hard turn on some quiet country road in eastern Pennsylvania, my line is still there."

5448,Raleigh is bringing class to your commute with two new “Urban Heritage” bikes that mix retro styling and modern brake performance. (Looking for more adventures by bike? Read our Cyclist's Bucket List for inspiration.)
5449,"The Raleigh Preston is built around 700c wheels with a steel frame and steel fork. It floats on 45mm Kenda tires, with Tektro mechanical, cable-actuated disc brakes confidently slowing the roll in any weather."
5450,Make sure you're dressed for any weather with a great waterproof jacket:
5451,"While the disc brakes are a more modern touch, the Preston is built more retro than futuristic for the most part, with a significant springer saddle, quill stem, copper-colored bars swept handlebars, and brown tires. The bike has rack and fender mounts if you want the option."
5452,Buy Now: $599.99 RaleighUSA.com
5453,"The Preston is a less-expensive bicycle, but still flaunts nice detailing. Touches like the elegant chain guard, and the heron cut into the chainring (a detail found on Raleigh’s bikes from the 60s and perhaps earlier), and embossed in the saddle, and the lugged fork crown, class up this simple bike. There’s no kickstand, though."

5457,"The Tourist builds has all the features of the Preston and most of the same parts, but adds painted fenders, a bell, and a three-speed internally geared rear hub from Sturmey Archer, for an easier ride on those hilly commutes."
5458,"Both bikes are offered in three sizes–small, medium, and large–which, according to Raleigh’s materials, cover riders from 5’3” to 6’0”. Both bikes are offered in one color: turquoise for the Preston and dark green for the Tourist. The bikes are available direct from Raleigh and may be ordered today."

5460,"The days of manually changing modes on your fork and shock might be numbered. Here are two new systems that charged our curiosity.
"
5461,"1 Accelerometer
The brain of the eLECT is an accelerometer that detects motion and the bike's tilt, so it knows if you're going up or down, or if you're on the flats. It can also sense a sprint or if the front end is freefalling during a jump or manual.2 Lock/Unlock Valve
If the system senses that you're climbing, a small valve locks the fork; when the bike levels out, the fork unlocks. In these situations, the system changes modes in a little more than a second. The delay prevents it from getting confused by, for example, a rolling section of trail, and also increases battery life by reducing the number of lock/unlock cycles. If the system senses that you're sprinting, it will lock out in two-tenths of a second and remain locked for six seconds. If it detects a free fall, it opens in a half second to soften touchdown.3 Preferences
You can set a preferred threshold gradient, such as five degrees. If eLECT senses that a climb is steeper than that, the fork locks; below it, the fork opens. This threshold is set by tilting the bike to the preferred gradient, then calibrating the accelerometer—it took a bit of fiddling during testing to find our ideal threshold.4 Batteries
The batteries are rechargeable with a USB cable, and are claimed to last 40 hours in automatic mode and 60 hours in manual mode (using the remote).5 Remote (not shown) You can override automatic control with a wireless handlebar remote. Magura offers an eLECT rear shock too, and when both fork and shock are installed, you can control the entire system with a three-button remote."

5464,"1 Accelerometers
Accelerometers on the fork leg and stem measure the speed and amplitude of a bump or bumps.2 Processor
This control center processes information from the accelerometer and tells the motor to switch the compression damping from lockout to platform or open.3 Cadence Sensor
When cadence drops below 35 rpm, an internal sensor tells the system that the rider is coasting, and the system switches to open. When you start pedaling, the magnets pick up crank arm movement in one-tenth of a second to switch the compression to lockout, unless you're on bumpy terrain.4 Computer
One button enables you to switch between automatic and three manual compression settings: lockout, pedal, and open. In automatic, you can select from three levels of sensitivity to bump size. An LED light indicates mode and low battery. The system will switch compression damping in one-tenth of a second, swapping as many times a minute as needed, which is dictated by terrain.5 Motor
Mounted on the shock, the motor relay switches compression settings. If the battery dies, the motor uses the last of its power to switch to open.6 Battery
The battery is roughly the size of a C02 cartridge, and removable for recharging. Lapierre says it's good for 25 hours."

5476,This trail bike is as big on value as it is on fun
5477,"By now I should know better than to judge a bike by its looks or weight. But that’s exactly what I did with the new GT Verb Expert. At a glance, the 120mm-travel trail bike looks like a rewarmed I-Drive bike from a decade ago, with 27.5-inch wheels. And the first time I picked it up, I felt every ounce of its 32.4-pound heft. But if there was ever an example of why actual ride tests are more important than first impressions the GT Verb is it, because once I got it on the trail all I noticed was how well it worked. Then I remembered the reasonable $1,630 price and quickly started reforming my opinions."
5478,"Geometry is something that can make or break a bike, and it’s one area where the Verb excels. Like seemingly every modern trail bike, it has a long-ish front center, paired with a short stem and wide handlebar. This stance puts you farther behind the front wheel and makes driving hard into corners and dropping into steeper terrain much easier. GT didn’t go as long with the front center as it does on its Sensor trail bike because it takes a more experienced rider to take advantage of it. The Verb's in-between geometry is better suited for the novice to intermediate rider."
5479,"GT utilized an updated version of its Independent Drivetrain suspension design on the Verb. Independent Drivetrain is based on GT’s original I-Drive design that made its first appearance way back in 1999. In basic terms, Independent Drive has a high main pivot (a few inches above the bottom bracket) with a floating bottom bracket shell designed to control chain growth as the suspension compresses. (Chain growth causes suspension stiffening and feedback felt through the pedals.) Now in the latest version, the main pivot and bottom bracket link pivot are much closer to each other, and the front dogbone link (a small dog-bone-shaped linkage that attaches the bottom bracket shell to the front triangle) is shorter. Not only does this increase stiffness because the pivots are closer together, but GT also claims that it enhances small-bump compliance, which helps with traction and adds plushness to the ride. The system’s bushings and bearings have been updated as well in an effort to ease service and keep costs down for both the rider and manufacturer."
5480,     RELATED: The Liv Lust Is the Mountain Bike You Gotta Check Out
5481,"The suspension is good—really good. Right away I got that super-efficient feeling I experienced on older I-Drive bikes: Each pedal stroke drives the bike forward, striking a seemingly perfect balance between preventing unwanted movement and maintaining just enough freedom for the rear wheel to track over rough surfaces. Plus, I never felt any tugging or jerking through the pedals as I hit bumps. I think that Independent Drive is still one of the best-pedaling suspension designs out there."
5482,"Although the Verb’s X-Fusion shock has a lockout, I used it only while riding pavement to get to the trailhead. And that shock has a rather clunky top out as the suspension rebounds to the end of its stroke, but you can’t really feel it while riding on the trail. RockShox’s Recon Silver fork is surprisingly capable given its value positioning. It’s coil sprung and features a lockout that I did find useful on smoother climbs, especially while pedaling out of the saddle. Suspension action on the downhills is another pleasant surprise, with a plush yet controlled feel that doesn’t rebound violently on sharp, high-speed hits, or wallow with a too-soft feel under braking or in rolling g-outs. The bike feels planted and predictable, likely due in part to its weight. Only at high speed in really hacky terrain does the suspension start losing its composure—but that's not unexpected for a bike with just 120mm of travel."
5483,"Complementing the suspension and geometry is a solid build with parts that work. Yes, it weighs a lot, but so do most bikes in this price range. Some may wish for a 1x drivetrain, but the Shimano Deore 2x is a smart choice for a bike at this weight. I found myself using the small ring a lot on steeper climbs, and never wished for a single-ring setup. Shimano’s BR-M445 brakes offer superb power and control just like the higher-cost models though the lever is rather large and looks gangly in comparison. Another key spec is the WTB STP i32 rims: They’re tubeless compatible, so with the simple addition of rim tape and a valve stem, one could convert them for even better performance."
5484,"I often chastise bikes for the lack of a dropper post, but in this case I’m okay with a good, old-fashioned quick-release. That’s because a bike in this price range would likely come with an inexpensive-model dropper of questionable quality. I’d rather pick my own when I'm ready to pay for one of the better options."
5485,"Value and performance do not usually go hand in hand, but GT’s new Verb is an exception. Like all good bikes, regardless of price, the Verb rides lighter than it actually is—so remember, don’t judge it until you ride it."

5498,"Based on World Health Organization science, the formula is engineered for optimum hydration—and it works!"
5499,"Hydration equals power. Starting a ride or race fully hydrated means you have all the blood volume you need to feed your muscles, keep your core temperature in check, and sweat enough to keep your skin cool while you’re working hard. Maintaining hydration is important to keep cranking those watts. Your muscles produce up to 100 times more heat when you’re hammering away than when you’re sitting around, and you can easily sweat out 48 ounces an hour when it’s hot. Once you dip into dehydration territory, your heart rate rises and your power declines."
5500,RELATED: 16 Things You Didn't Know About Sweat
5501,"It can be a struggle to stay on top of hydration when you’re racing—especially mountain bike races, where taking your hands off the bars is a challenge, or for cyclocross races where you may not have a bottle at all. So when Liquid I.V. came across my desk, I was intrigued. The company claims that drinking one bottle spiked with Liquid I.V. can provide the same hydration as drinking two to three bottles of water, which isn’t hard to believe as water can be slow to enter your bloodstream. I was impressed, however, with how quickly Liquid I.V. perked me up during a hot, hard mountain bike race and how little I needed to feel really great."
5502,"The company credits its trademarked “Cellular Transport Technology” (CTT), which uses a specific ratio of potassium, sodium, and glucose based on World Health Organization science to create an osmotic force that allows fluids to be absorbed from the upper digestive tract, which is twice as fast as water and faster than sugary, more carb-heavy commercial sports drinks, which have relatively high osmolalities and can get stalled out in the gut. This isn’t new science. But it’s one of the newer applications in the sports hydration market."
5503,Hydrate the right way by avoiding these three common mistakes:
5504,"With 500 milligrams of sodium and 370 milligrams of potassium (the same amount in a small banana), Liquid I.V. has one of the higher electrolyte concentrations of the newer generation of low-carb hydration products. It’s also lower in carbs than most, delivering 12 grams, mostly in the form of beet sugar and dextrose."
5505,"On the bike, it’s been nothing short of amazing. I used it during a multi-day 550 mile charity bike ride and never once felt the tell-tale power drain of dehydration. More impressive was how well it performed during a 25-mile mountain bike race, where there are only a few stretches each lap where drinking is an option. This time I chugged several ounces on each straightaway as I always do, and was pleasantly surprised to feel instantly energized. My belly felt light, my legs felt strong, and my last lap was faster than my first. Even though the race was long for XC, I didn’t finish feeling depleted. I'll definitely be packing some to pour into my system before 'cross races. (To properly train for your next big effort, check out our Big Book of Training.)"

The powder is gluten free, soy free, dairy free, vegan, and completely free from preservatives and artificial flavors, sweeteners, and colors. Along with the electrolytes, the product also delivers 110 percent of your daily value for vitamin C, as well as energy producing vitamins B3, B5, B6, and B12. The single-use satchels are super light, so it’s easy to stash enough for a full day out in a jersey pocket (the product also comes in a 16-serving pouch). It’s also handy to have on-hand during travel and after a long night out where you’ve had one too many.

Beyond these standard features, the Fly12 also has some additional perks that are worth checking out. "
5510,     RELATED: The Best USB-Rechargeable Bike Lights
5511,"The Fly12 starts recording the moment you power it on. As the microSD card fills up, the camera will start to overwrite the oldest footage, ensuring you don’t ever run out of space. It offers variable frame rates—30 and 45fps in 1080p, or 30 & 60fps in 720p—which will allow you to either get a more film-like look (if you’re going for cinema) or extra frames per second to more clearly see details of your ride (like say, a passing car’s license plate). While higher frame rates will fill up your microSD card more quickly, the Fly12 also has a “do not erase” button, so if there’s a moment you want to ensure you keep, the camera won’t erase that clip once it starts overwriting older footage. Additionally, if the camera senses you’ve been in a crash (meaning it is rotated more than 60 degrees for over five seconds) it activates “Incident Protection mode” where it will automatically save the last two clips and continue recording for another 30 minutes. The Fly12 comes with a 16MB microSD card pre-installed, but can work with up to 64MB cards if you want more storage."

5513,"The Fly12 is weather-proof but not waterproof, meaning it can withstand rain, mud, snow, and grime on your ride, but full-on submersion isn’t a good idea. It’s Strava-compatible, which means users can add HUD-like graphics to show speed, gradient, and elevation data over footage. It’s also got a neat little alarm feature: Turn it on via the iPhone/Android app, and if someone starts moving your bike around, the Fly12 will start beeping and flashing its light. The app is really the heart of the whole system, allowing you to set the brightness and flashing modes, change recording settings, review footage, and add Strava data. Finally, it has a pretty decent battery life: Cycliq claims up to 10 hours, but on the settings I was using it seemed to be closer to six or seven (flashing light set to middle brightness, camera recording 1080p at 45fps). However, in colder weather (below 45F), battery life drops pretty rapidly, with recording only lasting about three hours on the same settings. Keep in mind that if/when the camera stops recording due to a low battery (indicated by an audible beeping pattern) the light will continue to function for up to another hour so you can finish your ride. It’s probably best to not store the camera on your bike in a cold garage or shed during the winter months."
5514,"I've come to really appreciate the Fly12's safety features—to the point where I don't really want to ride without it now. It gives me and my wife some peace of mind should anything happen while I'm on the road. And I've been able to use to effectively already: On a recent ride, a school bus cut dangerously close to our group. I was able to share the footage with the bus company, who assured me they would speak to their driver about it. In any other case, they would have had to rely on my word. "

Yet the tubes look comparatively tiny and plain next to its peers; the paint and graphics are fine, but not eye-catching; the parts picks are conservative; hell, this frame even has external cable routing. It doesn’t look fast, it’s not beautiful, it’s just…there."
5518,"But this bike is a sleeper. There are few bikes on the road that perform as well, or are as balanced. It’s almost everything it looks like it’s not."
5519,"This bike is so good, it’s difficult to know where to start. I choose…stiffness. Stomp on it, throw it around, pitch it daringly into corners, and the frame reveals that it is very stiff. And, unlike some frames which seem to have disparate zones of stiffness, the Izalco Max feels balanced, like the overall feel of the bike was taken into consideration and not just hitting a lab-test benchmark for the BB, for the fork, etc. It's stiffness that doesn’t seem possible from those small tubes, and the payoff is a frame that seems to be every bit as competent sprinting for signs as it is during high-cadence climbing as it is bombing alpine passes."
5520,"But this bike is also smooth and compliant. It damps out most road noise, but leaves just enough feedback to give the ride character, avoiding a flat feel. Over bigger stuff like bumps, dips, and broken pavement, the Izlaco Max is very compliant; there aren’t many, perhaps any, race frames that are smoother, and it’s better than a long list of “endurance” bikes. Noteworthy context: The frame I rode immediately before beginning my test on the Izalco Max was a classic, small-diameter, lugged steel model. And even against that benchmark, the Izalco felt smooth."
5521,"It’s stiff, it’s smooth, and it’s more. Claimed average weight for all frame sizes is 760 grams, with a 295-gram fork. That’s very light, and helps bring the weight down for the Ultegra model I tested, the least expensive in the line, to just 15.6 pounds. Put stiff, smooth, and light together and the result is almost always a lively bike that’s a joy on climbs. When a bike is as smooth and stiff and light (for the money) as the Izalco Max Ultegra, it might make you buy a house at the bottom of the Stelvio just so you can go climb it every day."
5522,"This bike handles very well too. The light weight makes it reactive, the stiffness helps with accuracy, and the smoothness keeps the bike tracking well. And with a low-profile frame and wheels, it is quite stable in the wind. This is a bike for the mountains: It dances up climbs and charges down descents."
5523,"One thing did perplex me. While it felt stable and predictable in corners, on straighter sections the bar felt very light, and the front end very quickly demanded more of my attention than usual. I was predicting aggressive front-end geometry numbers, but upon checking the numbers after the test period was over—I check bike weight and geometry after testing so it doesn’t influence my opinions—the Izalco Max actually has rather generous trail, which usually means more relaxed handling and stability. I now believe the feeling of quickness was due to how I have to set up the Izalco to get my fit—the frame is longer-reach and shorter-stack, and my fit is more compatible with shorter-reach and taller-stack frames—and not any quirk in the geometry."
5524,"The parts? Excellent. Shimano’s Ultegra 6800 11-speed shifts well, the brakes are fantastic (it’s almost impossible to tell the difference between a Dura-Ace and Ultegra group), and it runs very quietly. In fact, this bike is among the quietest I’ve ever tested. It’s a full Ultegra group too, right down to the cassette and chain, which is rare. I do think the shift levers could use more feedback and shorter lever throws, however."
5525,"Focus specs 52x36 chainrings and an 11-28 cassette, which splits the difference between a compact drivetrain and the big gears of a standard drivetrain. For a high-performance bike like this, it’s a good balance: decent climbing gears and less chance of spinning out when descending. The tubeless-ready DT Swiss wheels are light (claimed weight 1,520 grams) and spin up easily, have very good lateral stiffness and a smooth ride, and, because they use aluminum rims, work with the excellent Ultegra brakes to provide very consistent braking. The Focus ships with Schwalbe’s great, tubeless-ready 25mm One tires, so the conversion is just a splash of sealant away. It comes with a carbon stem and a nice Fi'zi:k saddle and handlebar; the Focus CPX carbon see-through seatpost is funky, but functions well. The external cable routing may not be as sleek as internal, but it makes routine maintenance much easier."
5526,"There were a few things I didn’t love about the Izalco Max. Focus builds dedicated electronic or mechanical framesets, not one frame that’s compatible with both, as most brands do now. Electronic drivetrains can still be fitted to this mechanical frame, but the wires will need to be zip-tied down (SRAM’s wireless eTap is no problem, of course). Electronic frames are electronic-only, and forever. The frame is built with a PF30 BB shell, but uses a press-in plastic adapter to fit the Shimano Ultegra threaded BB. I’d prefer skipping a step and using an all-in-one solution like Praxis Works’s conversion BB."
5527,"As noted above, geometry is pro race: long top tubes and short head tubes for the limber and lean. The rest of us may have challenges. A fit with a shorter saddle-to-bar drop will be tough to achieve on this frame without an ugly (and potentially unsafe) skyscraper of a spacer stack, or an upturned stem. Shorter-reach fits will need either a short stem (which can goof up the handling) or a smaller frame, with a tall spacer stack or upturned stem, to get the correct stack."
5528,"The Focus Izalco Max does not look stiff or fast, and it’s not particularly dramatic or sexy. But there are few bikes that can offer the same performance and rewarding experience."

5530,"Former Tour de France winner starts with road bikes, looks to expand"
5531,"After several years away from the bike industry, Greg LeMond is back. The three-time Tour de France winner used the first day of the annual Interbike trade show to announce his return to making bikes with a series of commemorative designs made by Time."
5532,"The bikes themselves are, LeMond said, just the start. “I’m really excited to be back in the bike industry,” he said, adding that he has “a number of new projects next year,” including more road, cyclocross, and possibly gravel-road models."
5533,"In many ways, the biggest news was the return of LeMond himself. The LeMond Bikes brand endured struggles early in its life including a near-death experience in its first iteration. It found stability with a 15-year license to Trek and grew to be a major line, but the partnership began to go bad when LeMond first questioned whether Trek-sponsored Lance Armstrong was racing clean."
5534,"LeMond alluded to that when he said he’d waited to come back because he was “a little burned out by some battles I had in the bike industry. ” These included an acrimonious battle with Trek, which stemmed from Armstrong and LeMond’s soured relationship. In 2010, Trek announced it would cease producing the LeMond bike line, and LeMond’s presence in the bike industry was limited to a separate line of wind trainers."
5535,"Now, LeMond has revived his eponymous brand and the hyperkinetic ex-racer is clearly pouring his energy into the new venture. Time isn’t just the company making Greg’s bikes; he purchased Time Sport USA and will take over US distribution of that company’s line of frames, bikes, and components, rekindling a relationship that goes back decades to when one of Time’s founders, Jean Marc Geaugneaud, was an engineer at Look, the bike sponsor for LeMond’s la Vie Claire team."
5536,"The bikes themselves are a kind of road-race hybrid, using the existing front end of Time’s NXS model, an endurance gran fondo-style frame, with a rear triangle that emphasizes some of LeMond’s signature preferences in frame design, like a geometry that puts the rider in a long, relatively low position."
5537,"The Tour 90 is made by Time, one of the few bike makers in the world to control its carbon frame production from raw thread to finished product. (Joe Lindsey)"
5538,"The three new models are limited editions and different only in cosmetics. Each honors one of LeMond’s three Tour wins (they’re called, fittingly, the Tour 86, Tour 89, and Tour 90), with graphics that recall his teams from those years, especially the Piet Mondrian-inspired La Vie Claire team of 1986."
5539,"Pricing is commensurate with a limited-edition model. Framesets (frame, fork, headset, seatpost) sell for $4,500, and complete bikes (all with Campagnolo components) sell for $7,500 (Chorus); $10,000 (Record); $11,000 (Record 80th Anniversary group); and $12,000 (Record EPS). There are six sizes, from XXS–XL."
5540,Interview: LeMond on His New Bikes
5541,  
5542,This women’s cross-country bike has an understated personality that helps you ride your best
5543,"When someone asked what I thought of the Lust after my first ride, I was surprised to find that I didn’t have much of an inital impression. “Well,” I said, feeling foolish, “It was definitely a mountain bike.” With that brilliant observation made, I scurried away, mumbling some excuse about important work deadlines. I was determined to get a better feel for the bike on my next ride. "
5544,"But a strange thing happened when I rode the Lust again—I just didn’t notice it all that much. The Lust had the desirable capability to get out of my way on the trail and enable me to ride fast on a wide range of terrain. While none of its individual characteristics immediately astonished me, they added up to a well-balanced bike that helped me forget about the bike I was on, and simply ride my best. And there must have been something else, too—I set several Strava PRs during my test period on the Lust. With that kind of attainable performance, it’s easy to see how this bike is Liv’s number-one–selling full-suspension model. "
5545,"The Lust Advanced 1 features a carbon frame with an aluminum rear triangle. The bike’s geometry and carbon layup are designed specifically for female riders who might enjoy XC-style racing on the weekends, says Janette Sherman, global marketing manager for Liv. The bike gets 100mm of Giant/Liv’s dual-linkage Maestro suspension in the rear, with a RockShox Monarch R Float shock; and a 120mm RockShox SID RL fork up front. SRAM GX 1x11 shifting provides admirable performance at a reasonable price. "
5546,     RELATED: The Liv Intrigue 1 May Inspire Enduro Greatness
5547,"After several rides on the Lust, I started to detect what was making the bike so easy to ride. It has a swoopy maneuverability that I felt rolling through turns. Combined with the surprisingly grippy Schwalbe Racing Ralph tires, the Lust really shone on twisty, techy sections of trail. I found myself whooping out loud on one solo ride as I dove through a series of tight corners that comprise the last section of singletrack on my home trails. "
5548,"The Giant Contact SL Switch dropper post is a great, though maybe surprising, addition to this XC-style bike. On one downhill where slick roots criss-crossed the length of the trail, moving the seat down gave me enough confidence to ride instead of walk. It got me thinking that dropper posts are actually appropriate for XC bikes—on the Lust in particular, the bike’s geometry, light weight, and short travel make it an excellent choice for racing, but those attributes also made the bike feel a little squirrelly on technical downhills. The dropper post allowed me to get in a more stable position to ride those sections. Throughout the test, the Contact SL Switch post worked smoothly and dependably. "
5549,"The Lust’s light weight (25.1 pounds for our XS tester) and efficient suspension helped it to climb well, though not as superbly as some other full-suspension XC bikes I’ve tested. I usually prefer to use a trail mode or lockout on long climbs, and it would have been helpful here to counteract the bob I detected when I stood out of the saddle to climb. However, the shock only had on setting—wide open. "
5550,"It was odd, then, to find that the fork does have a cable-actuated lockout with a handlebar remote; I tend to want to lock out my rear suspension more often than my front. But according to Liv, I’m in the minority—that rear lockout wasn’t a priority to the women they surveyed when designing the bike. The company says that the bike’s efficient rear suspension makes the lockout unnecessary, while the front suspension lockout provides just enough stiffness to improve performance on road sections and long climbs. Also, the fork defaults to being locked—you have to press the button to activate the suspension (though not every time you ride—it will stay in that mode until you press it again). This generally didn’t bother me, but it did become a problem when the cable stretched, making it impossible to unlock the fork in the middle of one ride that involved some fast, steep descending. Luckily, a few turns of an Allen key were all it needed to get it to work fine again."
5551,"It took me a while to get to know the Lust, but once I did, I appreciated all it offers. On tricky trails, the bike gets out of your way so you can shine and it’s a blast rip through corners—that’s the kind of bike I want to have on my side.  "
5552,What You Need to Know
5553,"Go ahead, grab those KOMs with this aggressive enduro bike"
5554,"In the right situations, Giant’s Reign Advanced SL 0 is an excellent bike. Those situations are: going very fast downhill on rough trails, on very steep roll-ins, and in bike parks."
5555,But I spent most of my time on this bike outside of those conditions. Here’s what I learned: The Reign Advanced SL 0 has traded versatility for focused performance.
5556,"It’s almost entirely due to the geometry. The top tube on this bike is long (24.4 inches on the size medium tester, with a 73-degree seat angle), the front end is slack (65 degrees with a custom 46mm offset fork); the bottom bracket is low (13.1 inches unsagged); and the 47-inch wheelbase is just an inch shorter than Giant’s 8-inch-travel downhill race bike."
5557,"The cranks kiss the trail with regularity. The front wheel is in another zip code, so if you try to sit in the saddle and steer this bike, it understeers; and tight switchbacks require a considered plan of action. High-speed stability, yes, but also low-speed instability: If you’re lazy, the bike will wobble though slow turns. The front wheel is constantly trying to flop over, challenging your arms to hold it straight."
5558,"The fork is travel adjust. I understand the thought process: This bike is long and slack, travel adjust shortens the fork, which steepens the head angle and reduces the wheelbase. This should help in slower-speed terrain and when climbing. But travel-adjust forks do something else: They lower the bottom bracket. The Reign’s BB is already very low; drop the fork, and good luck in any situation outside of a road climb. I learned my lesson on the first ride and didn’t use this feature for the rest of my time on the Reign."
5559,"But while it struggles in some situations, the Reign makes complete sense in its element. It’s great at blasting descents—it feels lighter and more agile at speed, but remains stable. Cornering, it demands the rider to drive the bike from the front end: Get forward, and push into the turn. If you do so, and the Reign will drive though and slingshot out. It’s so low, long, and slack, it’s freakishly composed when other bikes are pinballing their puckered riders all over the trail. Just be very careful about pedaling when you’re hauling: that low BB, remember? The stays are short (17.1 inches), so picking up that long front end is easy. I often found that picking up the front end to reset my line was easier than trying to steer the Reign at slower speeds."
5560,
5561,
5562,"The suspension is pretty quiet and crisp when pedaling, though it’s not as efficient-feeling as some dual-link designs. On climbs, the suspension feels good, and the bike is quite light; it’s just mated to geometry that’s not uphill-friendly."
5563,"The rear suspension is sensitive and absorbs smaller chatter well. It doesn’t lose much sensitivity under braking, so the back end stays planted. About halfway into the travel, there’s a pretty abrupt ramp—enough that the rear end feels slightly harsh hitting some midsize bumps. But that progression helps the bike stay quiet and stable when hitting bigger stuff hard. I actually thought, given the speeds the Reign goaded me into, it should be a bit more progressive. If this were my bike, I’d take advantage of the Monarch Plus RC3 DebonAir shock’s tuning options and decrease the air volume to make it more progressive, a change I'd make to the Pike fork also."
5564,"The chassis is stiff enough, and the carbon frame adds a nice measure of damped smoothness. The system is not overly stiff, so I didn’t feel like the bike was chattering when laid over. The rear end is aluminum; it would be nice to have full carbon for this price, but Giant says it gets a lighter, stiffer rear end from aluminum."
5565,     RELATED: Redesigned Giant Defy Is a Racer for the Real World
5566,"This bike is the top of the Reign line, and gets the sweet stuff. It comes in at 27.5 pounds, which is light for so much bike. It gets there, in part, because of some light parts. The 800mm-wide handlebar is carbon, as are the rails on the road-looking saddle. The DT Swiss tubeless-ready wheelset weighs 1,580 grams (claimed), but is stiff and seems reasonably robust, though the rims are a bit narrow (22.5mm internal) compared with the current wide-rim rage. The drivetrain is SRAM’s top-end XX1 with carbon cranks; the brakes are SRAM Guide Ultimate with carbon levers. For committed enduro enthusiasts, these parts may be a bit too light and a bit too carbon: If you’re racing, you’re not always picking the smoothest line, and you will be crashing and sending the bike tumbling through the rocks. The rest of the parts aren’t weight savers, but are proven performers: a 130/160mm travel-adjust RockShox Pike fork with the RCT3 damper, which offers adjustable low-speed compression damping tuning; a piggyback Monarch Plus RC3 shock with DebonAir sleeve; and a RockShox Reverb Stealth dropper. The tubeless-ready Schwalbe tires—a chunky Magic Mary on the front and a lower-profile Hans Dampf on the rear—have Snakeskin sidewall protection, which this sort of bike should have, though the committed enduro racers will probably add Schwalbe’s ProCore system for more flat protection."
5567,"Not that it's the most important thing, but the Reign is a looker, with obvious thought put into the details."
5568,"The Reign Advanced SL 0 is an easy bike to not recommend to most riders. It’s a challenging bike to ride, and frankly not that exciting to ride on average trails or through slower-speed technical terrain. It needs high speeds, rough trails, steeps, and a strong, aggressive rider. If this describes you and your riding, it's one of the best options you can buy."
5569,What You Need to Know:
5570,"The steeper and rougher the trail, the better the 2018 Spartan seems to work"
5571,"When I tested the Spartan XP way back in late 2014, I was really impressed by the suspension and handling of the value-priced aluminum version of Devinci’s enduro bike. Fast-forward to spring of this year: Devinci gave me a sneak peek (and ride) on its second generation carbon Spartan, and I was pretty much blown away."
5572,"What impressed me most was the bike’s nimble, responsive feel, even though the new Spartan is longer and slacker. In a world full of enduro bikes that are starting to feel like mini downhill bikes, the new Spartan was a revelation. It’s a bike that worked everywhere on the trail in a range of situations—not just pointing straight downhill—and even there, it was impressive."
5573,"The second-generation Spartan frame is 310 grams lighter than its predecessor, with 150 grams coming out of the front triangle and 160 from the new Boost-width carbon swingarm. Devinci still utilizes Split-Pivot suspension to get 165mm of rear wheel travel, but it now utilizes a Rockshox metric trunion mount style shock and is also coil-shock friendly. "
5574,
5575,
5576,It is also now matched to a 170mm-travel fork instead of the previous model's 160mm. A lower seat tube now allows for the use of up to a 170mm travel dropper post on frame sizes medium through x-large. Under the downtube is a new Kevlar reinforced bashplate that hides a Shimano Di2 battery holder (or your spares and small tools). All frame sizes allow for a water bottle cage inside the triangle.
5577,Watch how to set up your shock sag for a smooth ride:
5578,"Geometry is still adjustable via an offset chip at the upper chainstay mount. Updates include a slacker 65-degree headtube (low mode) versus this year's 65.8-degree angle, while the seat tube angle steepens from 72.4 degrees to 74.5 degrees. Reach gets much longer, stretching from 432mm (low mode, size large) to 465mm. Chainstay length shrinks 3mm to 430mm, but bottom bracket height stays the same at 337mm."
5579,
5580,
5581,"Devinci didn’t tell me what bike I was riding or seeing before our meeting, but said it was a special model that worked best on steeper terrain. Armed with that info, I chose the Just Outstanding route to Keysville—a long, point-to-point ride with lots of descents and a few good climbs. I ended up riding the model equipped with X01 Eagle that costs just $8,069."
5582,"Having ridden the current Spartan, I figured this one would descend really well, and it certainly didn’t disappoint. The bike ate up the faster, open upper portions of Just Outstanding with excellent stability and buttery-smooth suspension. It was also here that I noticed how well the new bike changed direction and popped off the little natural terrain double jumps. (Celebrate a great ride with our shower beer pint glass, available in the Bicycling shop.)"
5583,
5584,
5585,"The next few trails that connect Just Outstanding with the Dutch Flat descent to Keysville revealed just how well this bike climbs. It feels more like a trail bike than an enduro bike, with a firm feel that’s still active enough to respond to bumps of all sizes, so traction is also superb. The longer front-center and steeper seat angle really make for an efficient body position on the climbs, too, making it one of the better-climbing enduro bikes I’ve ever ridden."
5586,"It was the final Dutch Flat descent into Keysville that really showed the Spartan’s enduro mettle. It’s steep, rutted and rocky in places (the trail typically sees more motorcycle use than mountain bikes), but it’s one of my favorite descents because it constantly keeps you on your toes. And the steeper and rougher the trail, the better the Spartan seemed to work. The long front center and slack seat angle combined with the plush-yet-controlled suspension made even hard parts of the trail a point-and-shoot affair. I easily cleaned a couple of steep, rutted rock gardens that usually give me problems."
5587,
5588,
5589,"By the bottom of the trail, I was already thinking about what I could sell to buy a new Spartan. The metal flake purple and green paint job just added to my desire to own one. It was just one ride, but I came away mighty impressed with the new Spartan. Stay tuned for a long-term review, because this is absolutely a bike we need to spend more time on."
5590,"Spartan models will start arriving in shops by late August. It will be offered in four complete carbon frame models ranging in price from $9,069 (for the Shimano XT Di2 equipped model) to $4,539 (for a SRAM NX build). Two aluminum versions will also be available, starting at just $3,349 with a SRAM NX kit."

I rode it after testing a bike that fatigued me, and I finished my ride on the Domane Disc feeling fresher and more energized than I started. It's also the best descending road bike I've ever been on—it will tear through corners accurately and at a frightening velocity. But the precise and predictable handling will bail out a less-skilled or very tired rider, too.—Matt Phillips"

5597,I’m not going to pretend Basso’s Diamante SV (Super Veloce) is an inexpensive bike. It’s quite obviously the opposite. But I will say it is a good value if you’re in the market for an Italian-made race bike. 
5598,"Founded in 1977 by Alcide Basso (brother of Marino Basso, the 1972 world champion and 27-time Grand-Tour stage winner), Basso is based in the cycling-rich Veneto region of Italy, which is also home to Pinarello, Castelli/Sportful, Giordana, Selle Italia, Fizik, and Campagnolo."
5599,
5600,
5601,"It’s fair to say that Basso is not, in the USA, as well known as its Italian compatriots Pinarello, Colnago, and Bianchi. The company hasn’t had the big sponsorship deals and wins, or groundbreaking bikes that have helped build the mythology surrounding some other Italian bike brands. But Basso has done something the other brands haven’t: it has evolved with the times, yet maintained its made-in-Italy heritage."
5602,"The Basso Diamante SV, and the company’s other seven carbon frames, are, company representatives claim, made in Italy at a carbon-factory 50-percent owned by Basso. The factory was founded in 1986 and, in addition to Basso frames, makes parts for motorsports (cars and motorcycles) and aeronautics. Basso reps won’t disclose the facility’s other clients on the record, but trust me: you’ve heard of them."
5603,
5604,
5605,"Confirming that Basso bikes are, truly, made in Italy is important because the “Made in Italy” sticker doesn’t always mean what it seems to mean. As it was explained to me once, the sticker can be legally applied if most of a product’s value is produced in Italy. “Most of the value,” is tough to quantify, but it can mean applying, in Italy, paint and a premier brand name logo to a raw frame that was produced in a Taiwanese factory. So I’m always a bit wary about saying a product is made in Italy unless I’ve actually seen the factory."
5606,
5607,
5608,"I've been invited to tour Basso's facility, but I have not yet had an opportunity to go, so I can't personally confirm that the Daimante SV is made in Italy. But Basso’s USA importer, Trey Henderson, says unambiguously that the Diamante SV is, “Truly, 100% made in Italy at the Basso factory. From carbon production to prep, paint, and forward— it is all done in-house.” Henderson also says that Basso's production capacity allows him to get a frame in your hands (if it's not in stock in the USA) much faster than is typical for an Italian-made bike: four weeks or less."
5609,"That means the Diamante SV’s is one of very few carbon road racing frames *actually* made in Italy. It also means the $5895 frame set price (recently increased from $5395 because of exchange rate fluctuations) compares well to the Asian-made Pinarello F10 ($5950), and Wilier’s Zero.6 Unlimited ($5499) frame sets."
5610,"Of course, being made in Italy does not make the Diamante SV a better bike than a Taiwanese-made bike like the Specialized Tarmac. In fact, I have no problem saying that the Taiwanese carbon-frame factories are capable of producing the highest quality and most advanced carbon bicycle frames in the world—their supply chain, technology, and experience there is unrivaled. And in some ways it makes no difference where the Diamante SV is made: what matters most is that it is made well, made safe, and rides as it should."
5611,"But in abstruse ways it does matter. A bike’s terroir is a large component of what makes it, it. What draws many to one bike over another is the stuff only that bike has; not the stuff all bikes have. Most high-end carbon road racing bikes are made in Taiwan and have 405mm chainstays and oversized bottom brackets; only Basso carbon frames come out of the Basso carbon factory near Bassano Del Grappa."
5612,Frame Details
5613,
5614,
5615,"Positioned as Basso’s highest end frame, the Diamante SV is a carbon road racing bike some aerodynamic-looking tweaks. It has the dropped, knife-edged, seat stays, rear wheel cutout, a fork crown that blends into the down tube, deep fork blades, and a deep head tube with beak-like protuberance and a fat truncated airfoil for a downtube. Claimed frame weight is 820 grams with a 390 gram fork."
5616,"The SV’s Italian made competition is Colnago’s $5900 Italian-made C60 frame, although the C60’s fork is made in Taiwan and the frame is made with tube-and-lug construction with no aerodynamic enhancements. the Basso is a monocoque frame (usually lighter than tube-and-lug) with mild aerodynamic shaping, which makes the Diamante SV’s design more similar to the Pinarello F10."
5617,RELATED: You Are Frame Builder Dario Pegoretti
5618,"The product description that accompanies the Diamante SV makes allusions to aerodynamic benefits with statements like, “Its tube shapes are able to cut through the air like blades. The rear turbulence is almost non-existing, “ and, “We have improved the air penetration by designing new tube shapes.”"
5619,"I asked a Basso representative for wind tunnel data, but due to the August holidays, so no one was available to answer my request. A wind tunnel test done by the German publication Tour showed the Basso to be a bit less aerodynamic than a Pinarello F10 or a Wilier Triestina Cento1 Air (in the configurations tested)."
5620,
5621,
5622,"The Diamante SV uses a press-fit BB86 bottom bracket (which occasionally groaned during testing); direct mount brakes (the rear on the seat stay, rather than under the chain stay); internal routing with a chip system for compatibility with both electronic and mechanical drivetrains; and tapered steerer fork (1-1/8” to 1-1/2”). The internal seatpost binder was effective and fuss-free."
5623,"Tire clearance is amazing: this bike easily swallows 28mm tires, and even some 30mm tires. A proprietary seatpost with offset head is standard, but a zero-offset post is offered. Four colors are offered: the blue and fluorescent orange finish on my review bike is one of the nicest I’ve ever seen."

5627,"Geometry and Fit
	The Diamante SV is offered in seven sizes: 45, 48, 51, 53, 56, 58 and 61 centimeter."
5628,"Published chainstay lengths are short: 400mm for the 45 to 53cm, 402mm on the 56cm, and 406mm on the 58 and 61cm frame (405 to 410mm is common for a rim brake road race frame). Published head tube angles seem slightly relaxed compared to American/crit geometry, but not uncommon for an Italian bike. Basso’s geometry information does not include fork offset or trail information and, again due to August holidays in Italy, could not be provided at time of publication."
5629,
5630,
5631,"If you’re limber, the Diamante SV offers a long and low fit. A size 53 Diamante SV has more reach (393mm) and lower stack (530mm) than a 54cm Specialized Tarmac SL6 (384mm reach and 544mm stack). In this raciest form, the stem is slightly recessed into the top tube; a detail usually found on time-trial frames."
5632,
5633,
5634,"However, the Diamante SV is shipped with Basso’s Comfort Kit: a riser that adds two centimeters to the bike’s head tube length and raises a 53cm SV’s stack up to about 549mm (and shortens reach slightly). 2cm of spacers under the stem would be effectively similar to Basso’s Comfort Kit, but Basso’s product information claims that the comfort kit is stiffer than an unsupported stack, for a better handling bike."
5635,
5636,
5637,The Comfort Kit on my test frame was also the source of some noise and movement which I was able to quiet. But my suspicion is the Comfort Kit will always be a potential noise source.
5638,Complete Builds
5639,
5640,
5641,"In addition to the frame-set-only option, the Diamante SV is offered as a complete bike in eight builds."
5642,"Complete builds are spec'd with a Microtech (Basso's house brand) carbon bar, Microtech MCT38 aluminum clincher wheels, Astute saddles, and Michelin tires."
5643,
5644,
5645,"My test bike had a Campagnolo Super Record drivetrain with Microtech M150 carbon-clincher wheel upgrade (available on all builds for $1550) and would carry a retail price of $11,795."
5646,"While the M150 wheels on my review bike were acceptable, I'd suggest skipping the Microtech upgrade and applying the money to something with a more modern rim profile, like Boyd Cycling's 60mm carbon clincher wheel set ($1650)."
5647,"The Ride
	The Daimante SV is a bike that meets your expectations, but doesn’t exceed them. It’s inoffensive, a bike that largely disappears, with no obvious shortcomings, but doesn’t provoke wide-eyed awe either."
5648,"The ride, smoother than many; the handling, on the quick side of neutral; head tube stiffness, good; bottom bracket stiffness, very good. It doesn’t matter if it’s a Gran Fondo, a crit, a Sunday social ride, or a chasing KOM, the Diamante SV does it all very well."
5649,RELATED: Rauler Classic Lugged
5650,"It is an enjoyable and likable bike. I had a great time riding it; it drew a lot of attention and questions; many riders declared it, ""beautiful."" But here’s the problem: although Diamante SV is a very good bike, the bar for an almost $6000 frame is set higher than “very good.” As one tester put it, “The ride is pretty fantastic. But lots of bikes are fantastic. The ride needs to be fantastic plus something.” If you’re looking for a race bike, the Pinarello F10 is stiffer, sharper, and faster. And if you want the best all around Italian-made bike, that’s the Colnago C60."
5651,
5652,
5653,"The Diamante’s life preserver is that it provides some of the better attributes of the F10 and the C60 into one bike. It’s lighter, and (probably) more aerodynamic than a C60; it’s a bit smoother than the F10, and the Basso is made in Italy (the F10 is not). It’s also beautifully crafted, gorgeously finished, and has fantastic tire clearance— qualities that are not insignificant."
5654,"The Basso Diamate SV comes up a little short on performance compared to the best race bikes in the world. But if you’re a person who feels that where a bike comes from is as important as how it rides, the Diamante SV—one of the only Italian-made, modern-looking carbon race frames—is a purchase you’re not likely to regret."

5656,"The start of something beautiful
"
5657,"The Sora components (and the wheels) let you know right away this isn’t an expensive bike, but the ride makes you forget that. Sitting in with the lead group on a long, flat stretch, spinning along as easily as those on $10,000 bikes, responding to potholes or gravel with little flicks of the bike to either side, trimming speed to stay on pace, and dropping back to pull two other riders up to the group—what I had underneath me was a capable all-rounder. When I got out of the saddle on a short, twisting kicker, the bike felt solid and, while not light, not burdensome. It carried its weight (and it is there) with a matter-of-fact demeanor, and it can, on downhills, push past the limits of its pricing. It has to be muscled into the corner, but it will carve aggressive lines—more meat cleaver than scalpel but, again, so what. It does the job. I chased a leading group across a long, rolling, windblown stretch, and it was only then, as I settled into the bike for an extended period of applied power, that it ever left me wanting. It didn’t give back enough compared to what I was putting into it. But how many people, I thought, are going to push a $1,300 bike like this, for this long, and ask it to catch on to a pack of pro-level bikes ridden by such fit people?"

	During one ride, Lou fell behind the group while on the Giant Defy 3 and didn’t catch up for some time. When he finally pulled up, he said simply, “The Defy and I had a moment.” Later, in his notes, I read this: “This bike is special, not just because of its sub-$1,000 price. The most fitting thing I can say is that the Defy encourages you to slow down, to sit up, rise out of the drops, and look around. After I stopped to take a picture, I thought about sprinting to catch back on to the group, to find a wheel. Then I didn’t. It seemed like an affront to this bike.”—Gloria Liu"
5663,This is one of the most affordable and user-friendly trainers available that records power. We torched our quads on it for several weeks to see how it performed. 
5664,"I share a lot of opinions that are popular among the bike-inclined. Going fast? Hell yes. Caps? Essential. Climbing? Rough, but rewarding. However, I usually lose people when I admit that I don’t really hate indoor training. I used to: When you bring the bike inside, I thought, you inevitably lose a sense of purpose. How could all those monotonous indoor miles, lacking real-world conditions, possibly help you train for crankin’ it outdoors?  "
5665,"Using the Kinetic Road Machine Smart over the past few months helped me rediscover motivation during trainer rides, largely because of one essential feature: power. Plenty of bike trainers have power, and plenty of power-equipped cranks and hubs can be used indoors, but at $409, the Road MachineSmart —with its Bluetooth Smart-syncing inRide sensor and Kinetic Fit app—make up one of the most affordable power-equipped trainer packages on the market that we know of."
5666,"     RELATED: How to Choose an Indoor Bike Trainer
	 How It Works
	The Kinetic Road Machine Smart is a progressive fluid resistance trainer: It generates resistance by spinning a blade through a fluid-filled chamber, paired with a 6.25-pound flywheel to produce realistic acceleration and momentum. "
5667,"Rather than measure power directly, as high-end power meters do through electronic strain gauges, the Kinetic trainer estimates it. The trainer has a sensor called inRide, which measures your speed 12 times per wheel rotation, then uses that figure to generate a power value based on Kinetic’s VirtualPower algorithmic power curve. "
5668,"While direct power measurement is more accurate than estimated power, particularly on the road, Kinetic reps David Simpson and Jason Overman say they have tested the Road Machine Smart’s power measurements against strain-gauge meters like Quarq cranks and PowerTap wheels and found that differences tend to be in the 2- to 3- percent range in most cases. “My workout averages differed by two watts for a 45-minute interval workout,"" Simpson says. ""I have seen a bit more variation on very high effort intervals; power output during those is more erratic and inconsistent. [The inRide sensor] doesn’t pick up acceleration the way a Quarq does, so power spikes more on the Quarq… As long as I am consistent and calibrate both units they seem to give me very similar results.”"
5669,"If you’re the type of cyclist who wants to pick up on immediate, sharp changes in power over short intervals, VirtualPower might not be accurate enough for you. But for my training purposes—which were to be able to measure my own progress over time for longer efforts, and to perform power-based workouts—I was satisfied that the Kinetic Road Machine Smart seemed to be consistent against itself. I found that my perceived effort, compared against measured watts, seemed to be consistent over time (and that I could see an upward trend in power as I got fitter)."
5670,
5671,
5672,"Simple Set-Up
	My test package included the fully assembled Kinetic Road Machine Smart with inRide sensor, a fixed eight-slot riser ring (retail price: $29) for the front wheel, and an extra quick-release skewer ($15). The skewer comes included with all Kinetic products, but the riser ring is sold separately. 
	 
	Set-up was intuitive: The big rubberized adjustment knobs made it easy to attach my bike to the trainer, and the trainer has a lever lock system that made it just as easy to release my bike after a ride. Bonus: The 20.7-pound trainer has a hinge at the top of its A-frame, meaning it can be folded down for transport (it fit easily in the trunk of my coupe) or if you want to save space at home. It takes a bit of muscle to fold and unfold, but you get what feels like a sturdy product. "
5673,     RELATED: How to Avoid Getting Bored on the Trainer
5674,"Syncing with the Fit App
	While I set myself up with a music playlist, TV show, or cycling-themed podcast each time I used the trainer, media always ended up becoming background noise—I became engrossed in the numbers. I started my test using Kinetic’s free inRide app on my iPhone 6, but partway through my test period, Kinetic released a new Fit app on February 3.  "
5675,"In Fit, I could adjust my display to watch 68 real-time data fields while riding; view my lifetime stats; review detailed power, speed, and cadence data breakdowns for logged activities, as well as heart-rate data when I paired a Bluetooth Smart-equipped HRM (I use a Wahoo Fitness TICKRx chest strap and a Mio Global Link wrist strap). I also had the ability to export my data to a host of apps, including Strava; and play any video saved on my phone or iPad within the apps. I preferred to use Fit on my phone and Netflix on my iPad, but it’s nice to know I had the option of easily switching between a video and the Fit tracker display by double-tapping the screen if I ever want to use just one i-product. When I used the video option with a Fit workout, a timer bar at the bottom of the video showed me how much time I had left in a given interval.
	 
	The real perk of the apps is their integrated workout feature. The Fit app has a whopping 107 workouts that provide directions to perform intervals according to seven intensity levels (lactate threshold, VO2 max, etc.); workouts tailored to the popular Sufferfest videos—and that’s just a start. According to Overman, Fit features “actual training plans that assemble those workouts into something that can give people a little more guidance over six or ten weeks to really achieve their goals.”"
5676,"“We see this as an opportunity for us to get power training to more of a mass audience,” Simpson adds. “It's a very inexpensive entry point into a much more structured training system. When we introduce the training plans with the new app, that's going to be a huge help to anybody who really is lost in this wilderness of power training.” "
5677,
5678,
5679,"Ride Impressions
	Once my bike was firmly in the trainer, I’d connect the app to the inRide sensor by pedaling. After selecting a workout and performing a 10-minute warm-up, I had to calibrate my ride to current conditions for more accurate power estimates. Fit asked me to sprint to over 20 mph, then stop pedaling so the inRide sensor could time how long it took to decelerate from 19 mph to 13 mph, augmenting the power curve to account for any extra resistance. This meant I didn’t have to worry about turning the resistance unit’s adjustment knob the exact same way every time, or worry that my tire pressure might be slightly different from the norm. "
5680,"I was then cleared to start my workouts. Kinetic advises starting out with the FTP (Functional Threshold Power) Test workout, which estimates the maximum wattage a rider can hold over an hour time-trial, to take advantage of tailored power training. Fit recalculated power targets for every interval in each of its workouts based on my personal fitness level after I took the test. When I selected a Kinetic-developed workout, the app flashed a message at the beginning of every new interval. I prefer noise alerts, too, so that I don’t have to look at my phone to make sure I don’t miss a notification, and Fit allowed me to set audio alerts for new intervals; dips into different power zones; and other crucial training moments. Regardless, I had the option to set my display to show me what my target power was supposed to be at any time, if I did miss a notification. "
5681,"Noise from the trainer was never why I missed a notification. I thought the trainer was impressively quiet; I could still hear video playing on my iPad at sub-maximal volume when pedaling at 16 to 17mph, with an electric fan on. Kinetic claims that using its trainer tire can make the trainer even quieter. If you live with other people, though, they might find your speed intervals—anything above about 21mph—slightly annoying. "
5682,"There are a few ways the Fit app could improve. For one, exporting ride info to apps like Strava doesn’t go seamlessly: My ride mileage, and power and heart-rate graphs don’t transfer over, though I’m able to see power zone and heart rate zone analysis. As developers zap bugs in the early Fit releases, this issue should disappear, says Kinetic. One thing I’d like to see in an update is the option to continue logging an activity after finishing a Fit workout, if the rider still has gas in the tank; right now, the app automatically ends and logs an activity at the finish of every preset workout. "
5683,     RELATED: The Inside Ride E-Motion Rollers Make Riding Inside Easier
5684,"Winding Down
	The trainer itself is easy and enjoyable to use. Whether I was revving it as hard as I could or standing to pedal, the Road Machine Smart was dependably stable, both with and without a mat underneath it.  "
5685,"At the outset of every session, the resistance felt a bit inconsistent, but after the tire warmed up, the sensation became road-like; I lost speed while coasting in a natural way, and gained speed smoothly when I pedaled harder. As a fluid-resistance trainer, the Road Machine Smart adds resistance as speed increases, and you change resistance by pedaling at different rpms and shifting your gears. I felt resistance change quickly when I pedaled at a different cadence in the same gear. Jumping straight into my big ring from the small ring to do speed work took a lot of oomph at the outset, but resistance smoothed out once I was at my desired speed. I felt that the resistance was effective for my workouts, and I definitely felt the burn when I was supposed to. I’ve even been able to keep up my climbing fitness by cranking up my watts and lowering my cadence over longer indoor intervals, combined with lower-body exercises."
5686,"One complaint some people have with fluid trainers is that all those watts can overheat the fluid, which can make the fluid unit expand and leak; Kinetic accounts for this by using thermodynamically neutral liquid silicone, which better withstands heat produced during your blazin’ workouts and the bitterest cold—even nights in your car’s trunk—and makes it so that you don’t have to recalibrate your ride every half hour to account for changes in the liquid’s temperature. "
5687,"The app is easy to use and will be even more so once the developer team works out a few kinks: The basic organization of the app’s functions are great, so improvement is a matter of functionality, not usability. "
5688,"If you’re new to indoor training, don’t worry about seeing a silvery residue on your tire after each use—it’s pretty normal. I asked Simpson and Overman about what that means for the lifetime of the roller. The trainer comes with an unconditional lifetime warranty, but even if it didn’t, Overman says there’s no reason to worry. “We just had one guy contact us to say he's got 120,000 miles on his Road Machine.” (Note: The original Road Machine launched 16 years ago.) For proper tire hygiene, though, Simpson suggests wiping down the tire and roller interface regularly with isopropyl alcohol and a rag. “I do it every day, personally,” Simpson says. “After it evaporates, you get a really nice sticky interface and you'll find you'll need less pressure to keep the roller tight to the tire without any slippage.”"
5689,"The Kinetic Road Machine Smart—an affordable, accurate, easy-to-use power trainer—was enjoyable to use and a great way to get in a workout. That Kinetic anticipates supplementing it with constructive training plans makes it even more attractive. VirtualPower is limited compared to its split-second-sensitive strain-gauge competition—you won’t see bursts of power and decelerations registered immediately in your power curves—but it offers sufficient guidance and responsiveness for cyclists more concerned about increasing their general riding fitness over time."
5690,"The Road Machine Smart and Fit app also make a strong case for year-round indoor training. Being able to fine-tune my interval workouts is so valuable, I can see myself hitting the trainer for speedwork (or an excuse to watch a movie guilt-free) long after the snow melts."
5691,"Training with power negated the last reason I had not to ride indoors more often, and with the Kinetic Road Machine Smart around, it’s something I’ll look forward to. "

5727,
5728,
5729,
5730,"The Sixer is Bell’s completely new high-end trail helmet. It replaces the Super, with a new shape, integrated MIPS, and large amounts of ventilation. The Sixer uses the same Fit Flow Race retention system found on Bell’s Zephyr road helmet. It provides horizontal and vertical adjustment and allows for an even fit with minimal pressure points. Like the Zephyr, the padding in the helmet has an integrated “Sweat Guide,” engineered to pull sweat away from your face and out on to the front of the helmet where it drips away, keeping it away from the eyes. There is also an integrated removable camera and light mount."
5731,"The Sixer is constructed with a fusion in-mold polycarbonate shell. It also has an exposed polycarbonate roll cage built in, and features progressive layering that’s designed to manage different impact speeds and scenarios. The Sixer is goggle-friendly, and also comes with ports for eyewear to fit comfortably and securely. The helmet comes in four different sizes: S, M, L, and XL. The helmet is a claimed 410g in size Medium, and will sell for $150 when it is available in November. There are multiple color options available, including several rad “Joy Ride” schemes."

Like the 3R, it has a removable chin bar using the same three-latch system, but with an improved rear latch. The Super DH utilizes a MIPS Spherical system. The MIPS system fits between two layers of foam: one high-density and one lower-density. The outer shell sits on top of the inner shell, acting as a ball-and-socket that can move a few millimeters in any direction in the event of an impact. The helmet has a substantial amount of ventilation for a full face with vents in the helmet and chin bar.

5750,"I had the opportunity to test out each of the new Bell helmets over several days in Whistler and Squamish, BC. The first helmet that I tried out was the Sixer. The fit was good and comfortable. The retention system provided even pressure, and kept the helmet in place the way it should. The most impressive aspect of it all is the sweat guide. Although temperatures reached into the 90s and I was sweating a substantial amount over the course of the ride, I did not get one drop of sweat in my eyes—it all went straight to the front of the helmet and dripped off as it was supposed to. I did have a few drops hit my nose here and there, but that is a far more pleasant experience than having it burning my eyes. The helmet stayed cool and the airflow moving thru it was noticeable. My glasses fit well on the back of the helmet and stayed in place over rough terrain when I wasn’t using them. (Riding faster is fun! Up your game with workouts from our new book.)"
5751,"I also tried the 4Forty MIPS for a day. The biggest detail that I noticed was that there was very little difference between it and the Sixer in terms of overall comfort and experience. The helmet performed great and in no way would I think that it was a sub-$100 helmet if someone handed it to me. While it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles that the Sixer does—most noticeably, my sunglasses didn’t fit well in it—it’s an incredible value, and I wouldn’t hesitate for a moment to make it my go-to helmet. The sweat guide worked just as well, and the helmet was equally comfortable."
5752,"I spent a couple of days in the Whistler bike park using the Super DH. The fit of the helmet was great, and the retention system greatly aided in correctly positioning the helmet in the optimal position for me with my goggles. I have had issues in some full-face helmets that do not have an adjustable retention system with where they sit on my head, but that was not the case with the Super DH. It held a noticeably lower temperature than many other full-face helmets, and was very comfortable. Even with the removable chin bar, the Super DH feels sturdy enough to ride DH trails at DH speeds."

5754,"What happens when you give a mechanical idiot the tools to build a custom bike frame?
"
5755,"I signed up for United Bicycle Institute's chromoly TIG-welding frame-building course under the premise that if I could walk away in two weeks with a sound custom bike frame, then so could anyone else. But I knew the instructors had their work cut out for them when simply filling out my initial paperwork required technical assistance."
5756,"Luckily, once I understood two things—Ashland, Oregon-based UBI accepts plenty of rookies like me, and it takes a lot to destroy chromoly—I found my frame-building legs."

5758,Days 1 and 2To-Do: Weld bead on scrap metal; weld T-joint and gruelon
5759,It's probably a good thing I didn't know we'd be wielding a torch on the first day of class.
5760,"But our instructors—Ron Sutphin, UBI president, master mechanic and master frame builder, and Gary Mathis, formerly of Fat City Cycles and Independent Fabrication—cut to the chase: By the end of the first week, my front triangle needs to be 70 percent welded."
5761,"First, they show us how to clean and prep mitered pieces of steel—file until they fit together without gaps, then deburr the metal and clean it with sandpaper and rubbing alcohol—an art that can make or break your welding. Then it's onto tacking, or spot welding, the pieces together. Ron uses clamps, jigs, and scrap metal to support his hands and line up the pieces before getting a 450-degree arc going, creating a molten puddle, adding filler and finally welding the joint."
5762,"I'm just starting to understand what tungsten is (the metal that makes up the electrode we'll be using), when I find myself at my workbench, looking at my Miller Maxmaster 200, trying to figure out how to adjust the various knobs."
5763,"I figure it's best to dive right in, so I grab my welding mask, complete with a dark UV 8 lens, and oversized cotton gloves—grateful that their organic fiber will smolder long before it catches on fire—and sit at the desk, propped up on one knee to comfortably reach the workspace. After some crackling (not enough pedal), a couple blown holes (too much pedal) and numerous electrodes later (from getting too close to the metal), I'm welding."
5764,"Simply seeing the joint, let alone holding the welding torch at a 10-degree angle, mere millimeters away from said joint, is tricky. So is varying pedal pressure to accommodate for cold and pre-heated metals, all while adding filler and biasing the heat to the non-mitered tube so you don't blow a hole. The ultimate goal: to weld a smooth bead, trying to minimize the heat-affected zone where the metal is distorted."
5765,All this happens while you're being partially blinded by a pulsating flash bright enough to burn your cornea without proper protection. It feels much like riding a night lap in a driving snowstorm. Often I need to lift my mask in order to see what kind of bead I've laid—if any.
5766,"I knew I'd be in over my head here, but I'm wondering if two weeks is enough time."
5767,"After a couple of hours of welding, I'm still finishing my T-joint (two mitered pieces welded at a 90-degree angle), while everyone else is working on their gruelons: three 6-inch mitered pieces joined together at 45-degree angles. I feel slightly reassured when Ron explains that 95 percent of students leave with sound bikes."
5768,"The day's lecture is about design, speaking in inches, millimeters, centimeters and angles as they relate to bottom bracket (BB) drop (the vertical distance between the center of the wheel and the center of the bottom bracket), chainstays, seat tubes (ST), effective top tubes (TT), head tubes (HT), fork rake, etc...and that's just the overview. Apparently tomorrow we go into detail. I'll be designing my 650B mountain bike from dimensions borrowed from a 15-inch Redline Monocog 29 and 14-inch Haro 650B. I plan on riding a Vicious Cycles rigid fork, and adjust the geometry accordingly. Finally, I start my gruelon, laughing at how quickly and easily the tubes file to perfection now that I realize that less filing is often better."
5769,
5770,"Days 3 and 4To-Do: Fill out TIG worksheet (dimensions for frame, fork, headset, tubes, wheels/tires), frame-drawing-dimensions worksheet (lengths, angles, clearances, diameters) and machining-dimension worksheet (miter lengths and angles, hole-saw diameters); select tubes; complete BB failure test and rough-cut front-triangle tubes; complete jig-setup dimensions and chainstay drawing."
5771,"Students in the TIG class can choose to build a mountain, road, hybrid, cyclocross, track or trials bike. Before this trip, I never imagined myself manufacturing a frame, but most of my seven classmates have dreamed about it for years. Forrest, a welder by trade, is the class star. Ben, a wrench from Bozeman, Montana, was given this course by his wife, who will be receiving a custom mountain machine that will be added to the couple's quiver of 30-plus bikes. Jeff, a mechanical engineer, broke his back and has only partial use of one leg, but lives to ride his bike and needs a step-through frame. Joel, the young Canadian kid who's building a dirt-jump bike, has been taking classes here for four weeks, working toward his goal of wrenching in shops around Canmore. And wise Mustafa from Turkey aims to build bikes for his new youth road-cycling team, the first of its kind in the country."
5772,It turns out that 50 percent of UBI graduates go on to careers in the bike industry. No wonder the information is so in-depth: We're learning the business of building custom frames. Ron also informs us that we'll have a full-scale drawing by lunch.
5773,"There's a lot to keep track of: measuring to the millimeter; formulating dimensions, diameters, lengths; using protractors, triangles, straight rulers and compasses. Then comes the mitering measurements and tube selection. I now fully understand what double-butted means, both internally and externally, and I've already lost count of how many times I've reformulated my frame dimensions. But judging from Gary's and Ron's calm reactions to my glazed stares, my level of ineptitude isn't unusual. And picking out the tubes, precutting them and mitering them, then laying them onto the blueprint, has made me want to build my frame more than ever."
5774,"UBI alum Mike DeSalvo, of DeSalvo Custom Cycles, has arrived to teach us more welding tricks. Seeing him work is like watching a surgeon: His delicate hands hardly move as they lay long, thin and beautifully consistent welds."
5775,"My first pass after the demo is spectacular. Then I flail for the next hour until I finally floor the amp pedal, melting the worms and holes and ugly fller together so I can complete my ST-BB failure-test project—welding a seat tube to a BB shell and then destroying it to make sure it doesn't fail at the weld. After clamping the BB into a vise, I insert a steel rod into the end of the seat tube and push down on it. Just as the guys are taking bets on whether they'll have to step in and finish the job, I apply my entire body weight and reach failure—which, oddly enough, means I've succeeded. Then it's on to mitering my seat tube with Gary's guidance so tomorrow I can start welding the ST and BB shell. Do I wish I had more welding practice? Uh, yeah."
5776,
5777,Day 5To-Do: Seat-tube/bottom bracket sub-assembly; start front triangle
5778,It's time to make the first welds on my custom frame. By the end of the day all I will be able to do is throw my hands into the air and laugh.
5779,"First, I blow some big holes that I think are irreparable, but as it turns out, they're easily fixed. After that mini-meltdown, I weld the rest of the ST-BB joint. As I'm waiting for an available machine to tool the rest of my tubes, I decide to double-check my standover height. Mike convinces me that I need quite a bit more clearance, which unfortunately means having to hacksaw off the BB weld I just finished, re-miter the tube to its new length and prep it."
5780,"Because this will put me behind, Mike says he'll help weld it. But after the first pass, we realize that I put the vent hole—made to keep air from burping through welds, as well as for drainage—in the wrong place. Out comes the hacksaw again, as Mike hacks through his weld to fix the mistake. Luckily the third time assembling the ST-BB is a charm...just in time for class to let out for the weekend."
5781,Days 6 and 7To-Do: Weld main triangle; weld chainstays to dropouts; miter and weld chainstays to main triangle; check frame alignment
5782,"There's nothing like a weekend away from the shop to gain a fresh perspective, which for me means not sweating the small stuff anymore. I listen to the lectures, but don't try to absorb every last detail as we go over adding chainstays to the main triangle—I know I'll need a mini tutorial by the time I get to that step anyway."
5783,"During the morning work session, I miter my main triangle tubes, tack them together and even start welding. Things I am sweating: turning the jig upsidedown, horizontal, standing on end while remembering to reset the grounding cable and finding ways to rest my hands so I can be as steady as possible in each position."
5784,"I'm not sure if it's the added pressure of knowing this story will appear in a magazine, or the extra-strong cup of Evo's coffee, or maybe the realization that it'd take a lot to destroy my bike, but I jam through the process of welding my main triangle together."
5785,"First comes a lecture about seatstays, which Mike calls tricky—unbeknownst to me, ""things have been straightforward until now,"" he says. There sure is a lot more ""eyeballing"" when it comes to this part, which makes for good comic relief after all the measuring to the millimeter and determining angles to the nth degree."
5786,"In between lectures, I work on my chainstays, which prove quite fickle. Using a double-bend design to accommodate 650B wheel clearance and vertical Paragon dropouts with a replaceable hanger, I miter the stays and somehow get all four pieces into the tenacious chainstay jig so they can be tacked together. Of course, after getting three of the four points tacked, the contraption falls to the side, popping all but one tack. Back to square one."
5787,
5788,"Days 8 and 9To-Do: Measure, miter and weld seatstays to main triangle; braze on bridges, brake mounts, guides and stops; frame prep"
5789,"I start the day by welding my chainstays, which involves getting into contorted positions and welding together metals of varying thicknesses. I do as much as I can, and then yield the torch to Ron. He's spent the past few days in Portland, setting up UBI's newest frame-building classroom."
5790,"Then it's time for chainstay alignment, which requires us to muscle (or cold-set) them into their proper position. We then move to frame alignment, which also involves some muscling—as well as setting the wheel in and checking the BB drop. Then we attach the seatstays—and get to break out the masking tape and markers."
5791,"Gary demos another new technique using a flame torch, flux and silver to braze on seat-tube bridges, bottle bosses, housing guides and cable stops. My classmates think brazing looks easier than TIG welding, but to me it seems downright dangerous."
5792,"The next day, we pick out cable and housing guides. This proves yet another unfathomable challenge. Of course I've noticed these tiny necessities on my bike before, but I never realized how many factors go into choosing them (round, oval, bullet-like; single, double, triple?), not to mention figuring out where they go."
5793,"Demos include facing the head tube and bottom bracket. Though the mechanics in the class could do this in their sleep, my nerves are on edge at the thought of possibly stripping my BB and headset threads, not to mention killing the tools."
5794,"I finish by laying yet another signature Lesley weld: It's beautiful—but millimeters from the actual joint. Ron says I'm on the verge of another breakthrough. And I can feel it, like I could build another front triangle in no time now. It's sad, yet exciting, that things are starting to click just as the class is winding down."
5795,Day 10To-Do: Frame-alignment check; slot seat tube; final instructor check; receive certificate and photo
5796,"It's hard to believe I'll be shipping my bike home today. The morning starts with brazing on cable guides and housing stops, then chasing the headset threads and facing each end, and repeating the same process with the BB shell. Then it's on to reaming the seat tube, or grinding down the interior heat-affected/weld zones until a seatpost can slide nicely into the tube. We also learn about the equipment you'd need to build a frame at home. (It runs about $4,000, half that if you buy used.)"
5797,"I'm the last one to finish—I've already been daydreaming about custom paint colors, wheelsets and components—and then there's the sudden fear that maybe all the mistakes I've made up to now will make my 650B frame unrideable. But when Ron checks my work, its readings are similar to those of UBI's demo bike, about 2mm off overall. I've passed. Now it's time to pack up my custom frame."
5798,Lesley Suppes is anxiously awaiting her frame's return from the paint shop—and hopes to have ridden it by the time you read this.

5803,"The new Fat Chance Slim Chance is a TIG-welded steel road frame, which isn’t a big deal: Hundreds of builders all over the world crank them out daily."
5804,"But 25 years ago, when the first Slim Chance arrived, a welded steel road frame was special. In the early '90s, steel frames were almost all joined with brazed lug construction. TIG (which stands for tungsten inert gas) welding is generally more difficult than brazing and requires great care and skill. But properly executed, it results in a very light and strong joint."
5805,     RELATED: 16 Awesome Steel Bikes That Will Make Your Friends Jealous
5806,"Though Chris Chance is mostly known for his Fat City/Fat Chance mountain bikes, he began his framebuilding journey in the '70s by training at Witcomb Cycles, a custom builder of high-end steel road frames in Connecticut, with the likes of Richard Sachs, Ben Serotta, and Peter (J.P.) Weigle. After Witcomb, Chance started Fat City Cycles in Somerville, Massachusetts, in 1982, turning out lightweight mountain bikes. This background enabled him to make the first Slim Chance road frame lighter than most of its peers (by forgoing lugs), yet very strong and stiff."
5807,"Fat Chance shuttered in 2000, and Chris Chance took a 15-year break from the bike world. Today most steel road frames are welded, and it’s the lugged and brazed frames that are a novelty."
5808,
5809,
5810,"Now Chris Chance has returned, and so has the Slim Chance."
5811,"The world around it has changed a lot, but the Slim Chance 2.0 isn’t radically different from the original. It’s still steel and still welded, the BB is still threaded, and there’s still a pump peg. Geometry is even similar to the ’91 bike (which is also similar to a modern-day carbon race bike like, for example, the Specialized Tarmac). However, the new Slim’s tubing diameters have increased slightly, as have the fork steerer and seatpost diameters, to improve stiffness."
5812,"But the Slim of today doesn’t hold the same unique position in the bike market that it did 25 years ago. The norm for performance is in another galaxy now. The new Slim is still a high-performance steel road bike, but it’s not fast, light, or stiff like a modern carbon bike. If you focus your bike purchases on what they’ll do for you on the Strava leaderboard, this is not your bike."
5813,     RELATED: Which Bikes Do Custom Builders Ride?
5814,"What it is: a gorgeous steel bike, one of the nicest I’ve ever ridden, custom or stock. It’s delightfully smooth. I was hypnotized by the visible fore/aft oscillation of the fork legs moving in response to bumps. I melted with joy at the way the bike swooped wide arcs through turns. I giggled at how composed it was bombing at over 50 mph."
5815,"The frame is springy, lively, and courses with energy. I so enjoyed this bike that I pulled off the cycling computer mount, because this bike made me stop giving a crap about time, distance, speed, or watts. Riding it just made me happy."
5816,
5817,
5818,"Its heritage may be as a light racing bike, but in today’s context, the Slim has the gravitas of an elder statesman. It will not hold you back, but it does not push you forward like the best high-performance road bikes do. Sure, you can ride it hard, and of course a fast rider will still be fast on it. But this bike is about quality and freedom—and the experiences created by both."
5819,"As a bike reviewer, I want to situate the Slim Chance among the many choices available to consumers and let you know exactly where it fits in. I don’t know that I can. The Slim helped create the world of welded steel bikes, but because that world is now so big and rich, the Slim melts into it rather than stands alone. But it is remarkable that it can be reintroduced, with relatively few changes, and still feel like a fresh and modern craft-built steel bike. The reasons have changed, but the bike is still something special."
5820,"The expanded range of 1x components could simplify your ride—and make your bike look better
"
5821,"One of the most consistent themes throughout the evolution of the bicycle’s drivetrain has been “more gears.” Almost all the technology associated with the bicycle drivetrain has been developed to refine shifting function or to facilitate adding gears to the bicycle. Because, you know, if two speeds is better than one, then three is better than two, and four is better than three. Drivetrains seemed to be locked into this trajectory—always more, never less—which led to 22-speed (road) or 33-speed (mountain) drivetrains."
5822,"	Today, however, SRAM wants to convince some of us that less is greater than more."
5823,"	Riffing off its popular one-by (1x) mountain bike and Force CX1 ’cross drivetrains, SRAM is introducing an expanded range of 1x products pitched to gravel, adventure, triathlon/time trial, fitness, commuter, and road riders. The groups are called Force1 and Rival1. Their key technologies are the same ones used on SRAM’s 1x mountain and ’cross drivetrains, but SRAM expanded the offerings and tuned them for road-centric applications."
5824,"	Because there really isn’t any new technology, I’m going to talk about the big-picture questions first, then talk tech. If you want to get a picture of what this stuff is, imagine SRAM’s Force CX1 group, add more chainring sizes and cassette options, and call it Force1. Then and add a lower priced version of basically the same group and call it Rival1. There ya go."
5825," Do You Want 1x?
	Maybe."
5826,"	With 1x you are giving up something. At SRAM’s media presentation in early April, road product manager JP McCarthy stated right from the top, “We are in no way claiming a one-by drivetrain replaces a two-by.” When the number of gears is cut in half, either range or ratios are sacrificed."
5827,	You can see this for yourself at the excellent website gear-calculator.com. The site allows you to compare two drivetrain options.
5828,"	I’ll get you started with a range comparison pitting a 1x11 using a 50-tooth ring and SRAM’s 10-42 cassette (more on this later, but it’s the same cassette used in SRAM’s existing 1x mountain bike groups) against a 2x11 group with 34/50 compact rings and an 11-28 cassette"
5829,"This 1x11 drivetrain has a slightly wider range than the 2x11, almost equal on the low gear, with a taller high gear and bigger steps. With the 2x drivetrain, the rider can keep it in the small ring for the first four cogs, then shift to the big ring and big cog when the ratios overlap (ignore surly mechanics: if the chain is long enough, big/big cross-chaining a modern drivetrain is fine). This gives the 2x11 drivetrain 15 ratios. (Technically, it’s about 18 distinct ratios, but hitting them all sequentially would involve a lot of shifting in and out of the big ring and up and down the cassette. It’s possible, but a pain in the ass and I’ve never met anyone who goes through the trouble for a couple extra ratios.)"
5830,"	Tighter steps with 1x are possible at the expense of range. This comparison looks at a 2x11 drivetrain with 39/53 rings and an 11-25 cassette versus a 1x11 drivetrain with a 54 tooth ring (SRAM does not make a 53t 1x ring) and 11-25 cassette. No surprise, the 1x has almost identical steps to the 2x in the 53, but 1x loses the low end of the range."
5831,"	You can play with gear-calculator.com to compare all sorts of possible permutations, but the results are always essentially the same:
	* A 1x drivetrain with the range of 2x, but larger steps.
	* A 1x drivetrain with the same steps as part of a 2x range, but a narrower range than 2x."
5832,"	Adding the additional complication of a second derailleur, chainring and shifter on a bike just to get four-ish (depending on overlap) extra ratios can seem a bit silly. Or not. Your situation will dictate your best path."
5833,"	For example, some of my co-workers and I find that for competitive road riding, having smaller steps is preferable because it reduces the chance of feeling like we’re jumping between ratios that are a little too low/a little too high when trying to maintain a cadence/perceived effort/power target."
5834,But the simplicity of 1x is appealing also. My Seven Axiom SL do-everything-but-race bike has 36/52 rings with an 11-32 cassette. I could get a similar range using a 48-tooth ring and 10-42 cassette and a simpler drivetrain.
5835,"	I’m sure I’d encounter some situations where I’d miss the additional ratios offered by 2x, but I’m also reasonably sure that that those situations would be easily tolerable considering the Seven’s purpose. I’d think it would be the same for gravel, adventure, fitness, and commuter bikes: Having the same range with fewer parts and a simpler setup seems like a pretty good deal, and worth giving up a few ratios."
5836,"	It’s also easy to imagine circumstances where a tuned-and-tight range would be an advantage. Bikes honed for a specific use or course—criterium races, triathlons and time trials, even a climbing stage or flat road race—might only need a very narrow range of ratios. With a ring and/or cassette swap, SRAM’s 1x drivetrain’s gearing can be tuned to a specific demand, resulting in a simpler drivetrain that eliminates redundant and unused elements."
5837,"	To do this tuning right, however, the user would likely need to do a lot of chainring- and cassette- (and maybe chain-, which I cover below) swapping for different courses and training situations. This can be a pain. With 2x, you’re always carrying everything you might need."
5838," Beyond the Number of Gears
	Range and ratio aside, SRAM says there are advantages to 1x. It’s simpler (and more “pleasant,” says McCarthy) and it creates a cleaner looking bike because the inner chainring, the front derailleur, and its cable and housing are eliminated."
5839,"This might also make the drivetrain a bit lighter. McCarthy says the average weight savings for Force1 versus Force 22 (the 2x11 group) is 170 grams. The 1x rear derailleurs are heavier than their 2x counterparts—Force 22 medium cage, 187g, Force1 medium cage, 261g—but because of the reduced front drivetrain system, the total result is a weight reduction. However, McCarthy’s 170-gram claim is assumes the same cassette. The 1x’s weight advantage starts to erode if a bigger (heavier) cassette is used to recoup some of the lost range. SRAM does not yet have an estimated weight savings for Rival1 versus Rival 22 but it expects it would be greater than 170 grams (with the same cassette)."
5840,"	Cautioning that SRAM’s data is far from complete, McCarthy says that there is an aerodynamic advantage to 1x because the cable and housing, front derailleur and hanger, and inner ring are eliminated, but the gains are somewhat offset by the larger 1x rear derailleur. SRAM has no data to share at this point, but hopes to have more complete data in the future."
5841,"	McCarthy touted another advantage, one that I have yet to feel on a mountain or ’cross bike with a SRAM 1x drivetrain. The “chain and chainring interface is so secure, it gives the bike a different feel,” he says. “It feels more efficient.”"
5842,"	“Is that true?” I asked. When it comes to rings and cog, bigger is more efficient. “True, a larger ring with the same gear ratio is more efficient,” says McCarthy. “The reason is that the smaller ring has a higher tension, which results in higher friction.” SRAM’s preliminary and limited efficient testing, done by an outside agency, reveals that difference in efficiency is a “fraction of a watt,” at a 270-watt input. SRAM is building a test machine in its Coimbra, Portugal, chain factory to explore efficiency questions more completely. I hope to have more information to share in the future."
5843,"Meet Rival1 and Force1
	We’ve covered SRAM’s 1x drivetrains for mountain and ’cross before, so I’ll skip the deep tech dive for a shallow wade."
5844,"	The technologies below already existed in SRAM’s universe. And they already had a drop-bar 1x drivetrain called Force CX1. All that’s really “new” with this batch of products is a wider offering of 1x products. What was called Force CX1 becomes Force1 and it is accompanied by a lower price Rival1 group. There are also a few non-series parts like a flat-bar shifter for SRAM road 11-speed derailleurs, and a lower-end crank aimed at fitness and commuting bikes. For time trialists and triathletes, SRAM’s 11-speed bar-end rear shifter will be sold separately."
5845," What Makes It Work
	The crucial features that make SRAM’s 1x drivetrains secure are found in the rear derailleur and the chainring."
5846,"	The chainring has alternating thick and thin teeth, which grab the chain’s link plates, locking the chain on the ring without any supplementary retention. It seems too simple to work, but so far it has worked well for my co-workers and me. A few of us have dislodged a chain on longer travel full suspension bikes in very rough terrain, but these incidents are very rare."
5847,"	The rear derailleur uses a straight parallelogram that can only move laterally, making it impervious to ghost-shifting in rough terrain, says SRAM, and providing lighter shifting action. The pulley cage has a one-way clutch that damps its forward rotation and reduces chain bounce. Like the chainring, the pulley teeth alternate thick/thin."
5848," XG Cassette
	A very important piece of SRAM’s 1x system is the 10-42 11-speed cassette. Without this cassette, SRAM’s 1x groups would not have been embraced as widely by mountain bikers. It provides both the low and high end necessary to make a single-ring drivetrain a viable alternative to 2x."
5849,"	This wide range cassette has existed in the SRAM universe since the launch of the XX1 mountain bike group in 2012, but until Force1 and Rival1, SRAM did not have a derailleur compatible with their drop-bar shifters with enough capacity for this cassette. Presently, this cassette cannot be used with SRAM’s multi-ring drivetrains."
5850,"	Though it’s just one tooth smaller than the 11 already found on many cassettes, the 10-42 cassettes requires a new cassette driver standard called XD. It’s required because the diameter of the standard Shimano/SRAM driver body limits the smallest cog to 11 teeth. It’s a lot of hassle for one tooth, but McCarthy says the effort is worth it, “for added range, where added range is necessary.”"
5851,"	Many wheel and hub companies offer XD drivers for their mountain bike products, so making the driver for road hubs and wheels should not be a stretch. While Zipp (owned by SRAM) does make a XD driver for its 77/177D disc hubs (found on the 202 Disc, 303 Disc, and 30 Course Disc-brake), it does not make one for the hubs used on its rim-brake wheels."
5852,"A second 1x-only cassette, this one an 11-36, also exists in SRAM’s parts catalog. This is the widest range cassette SRAM offers for the standard 11-speed Shimano/SRAM cassette driver body."
5853,"	Since the cassette is not 1x specific, just about any 11-speed cassette and any SRAM/Shimano compatible 10-speed cassette will work."
5854," What You Need to Know
	* The significant differences between Rival1 and Force1 are weight, materials, and finishes, and not functional features.
	* Force1 and Rival1 are not new groups, but expansions of the existing Force 22 and Rival 22 groups. The only parts distinct to 1x are the rear derailleurs, chainrings, and two cassettes: the 11-36 and 10-42. All of SRAM’s current 11-speed chains are compatible with the 1x groups. SRAM’s 2x11 groups—Force 22, Rival 22 and Red 22—are unchanged.
	* Only a rear derailleur and chainring are required to convert an existing SRAM 2x11 drivetrain to 1x11. The left shifter won’t be connected to anything, but if that bugs you, the hood can be gutted. In a completely shocking bit of user-friendliness, the Rival1 and Force1 rear derailleurs are backwards compatible with SRAM’s 10-speed drop bar shifters.
	* 11-speed cassette options are 10-42 (requires a long cage derailleur), 11-36, 11-32, 11-28, and 11-26 (requires a Force1 short cage derailleur). The widest range 10-speed cassette SRAM offers is an 11-32. A SRAM cassette is not mandatory, so any Shimano 10- or 11-speed cassette will work. So will IRD’s wide-range cassettes, offered in 10-speed (11-28 up to 11-42) and in 11-speed (11-30 up to 11-42); and the Praxis Works 10-speed 11-40. So far, only SRAM offers a 10-42.
	* Force1 chainrings are offered in 38-, 40-, 42-, 44-, 46-, 48-, and 50-tooth for 110 BCD; 52 and 54t for 130 BCD. Compared to last year’s Force CX1 rings, the new rings are slightly modified to improve durability, “by manyfold,” and to run quieter, McCarthy said. While the 38 to 50 tooth rings are likely to be used for cyclocross cross, gravel, or adventure riding, the 52 and 54 tooth rings probably will not, so SRAM eliminated the mud evacuation ports found on the smaller rings. Eliminating the ports made the rings stiffer, said McCarthy. Force1 crank arms are carbon, and offered with both a 110 and 130mm BCD spider. The spider may be removed and changed to a different size. The cranks are offered in 162.5, 165, 170, 172.5, 175, and 177.5mm lengths, BB30 and GXP axle.
	* Rival1 chainrings are offered in 110 BCD 38-, 40-, 42-, 44-, 46-, 48- and 50-tooth only, with no 130BCD options. Rival1 crankarms are aluminum and sold only with a 110BCD spider. However, the Rival1 crank uses the same removable spider interface as the Force1, so it is possible to upsize the spider. The cranks are offered in 162.5, 165, 170, 172.5, 175, and 177.5mm lengths, BB30 and GXP axle.
	* The derailleur’s pulley-cage pivot is placed so the upper pulley moves vertically as the cage rotates. This keeps the upper pulley close to the cogs for better shifting, says SRAM. It also means the system is sensitive to chain length. More than a 2-teeth-up or 4-teeth-down change in chainring or cassette requires chain resizing.
	* SRAM offers Force1, Rival1, and 10-speed left levers for hydraulic and mechanical brakes with the front shifting mechanism deleted."
5855,"How It Rides
	I had an opportunity to ride a Santa Cruz Stigmata CC ’cross bike fitted with Force1, a 40-tooth ring and a 10-42 cassette outside of San Luis Obispo, California. The 40-mile route included plenty of climbing and descending on open road, and paved fire roads, but most of the riding took place on dirt fire roads—some of them quite steep—that ranged from smooth to very rough, thanks to ruts from recent rains."
5856,"I went as slow as 7mph on some climbs, and reached a 38mph maximum speed. The range was impressive, letting me spin easily up the steepest bits (a bit more than 16 percent in a few places) and gave me plenty of gears for almost everything else. I did, however, nearly spin out on a fast, paved, tailwind-aided descent. I never once thought the steps were too big. But this was largely a social pace gravel ride, and not the situation where I’d want tight steps. Shifting was exactly what I experienced when I rode Force CX1: crisp with a smooth and light—but not too light—effort. Despite some rather jarring rain ruts, I didn’t drop a chain, and neither did any of the other 11 1x-equipped riders in my group."
5857," 1x for All?
	I polled a few of my co-workers to see what they thought about a 1x drivetrain for their riding. I got a diverse range of reactions, one of them being, “If SRAM could make their front shifting as good as Shimano’s, they wouldn’t need to push 1x on us,” which is harsh, but not entirely unfair. However, the best front shifting in existence is found in Shimano’s electronic Di2 groups, which are expensive and complex."
5858,"	On the other end of the spectrum from Mr. Grumpy was a rider who said, “I’m kind of psyched to try 1x. What was the last technological development that actually simplified the bicycle?” We’ve grown so used to new equaling more. It is actually quite refreshing to have something come along that makes a bike simpler and cleaner, without any compromise to the bike’s purpose or capabilities. Really, the only sacrifice 1x asks us to make is to spin a bit faster in some gears and grunt a little more in others."
5859,"	I think many might see 1x as a competitor to 2x. I don’t think of it that way. 2x has a place. 1x has a place. Hell, 3x has a place. There isn’t one answer. We are riders with needs and wants; this gives all of us more options to fulfill them. It’s less than you had before, but it could be all you need."
5860," Availability and Pricing
	McCarthy says that the new 1x parts will be available aftermarket in mid- to late summer. Bike brands will take delivery in May and there are at least 35 brands that will offer bikes with Force1 and Rival1 drivetrains."

5864,Make sure you’re picking the right bike by asking these crucial questions while shopping
5865,"There’s only one question that you should never, ever (not even as a dare) ask while in a bike shop: Should I buy a new bike or a new TV?  "
5866,"But the rest of the questions you’re feeling nervous about asking? Those are all fair game. In fact, if you’re investing significant cash in a new ride, most of these questions are important, no matter how mundane or rudimentary they may seem."
5867,     RELATED: How to Buy Your First Bike
5868,"Which brings up a good point: If the salesperson you’re buying from makes you feel silly for asking questions, consider taking your business elsewhere. “The store should make you feel comfortable,” says Steve Beheler, operations manager for Spokes Etc., a Virginia-based chain of bicycle shops. Look for a retailer where the salespeople encourage you to ask questions. Then lob both your softballs and hardballs at them.  "
5869,"If you’re not sure what to ask, reference this list of nine questions for every buyer—from the cyclist purchasing an entry-level commuter to the enthusiast picking up a $6,000 speed machine.  "
5870,"Do I know what I want to use this bike for?
	Okay, you need to ask this of yourself, not the salesperson. But Emily Bremer, the women’s marketing manager for Trek Bikes, stresses that this is probably the most important thing to sort out before you begin your search. “Think about what you want versus what you need,” she says, adding that the two may be pretty different—you definitely don't need carbon wheels to join in on the local punchy group ride, even if you'd like to have them. Conversely, to join in on that same ride, you'll need a road bike, even though you might not want to pony up the cost of one. Most importantly, think about what you’re going to do the most with the bike and what kind of riding you have nearby. "
5871,"Do I even need to buy a bike at a bike shop? 
	You can buy anything on the Internet these days: granulized fox urine, tinfoil hats, and gourmet, food-grade crickets, to name a few. Of course, that means you can also purchase your new bike with the click of a button. But just because you can doesn’t mean you should (looking at you, guy thinking about stocking up on the fox urine). "
5872,"When you buy a bike from an authorized retailer, you know that the bike was assembled by a professional mechanic, and you begin to build a rapport with that shop—a great way to find out about new routes or group rides or maintenance clinics and events. You also ensure you’re not getting a counterfeit product, which is a continuing problem in the bike industry.   "
5873,"Even if you’re not planning on buying a bike online, buying from a shop can still have benefits. Shop bikes generally include some sort of warranty on the frame and components—something you won’t get at a big box superstore or when buying a used bike."
5874,"     RELATED: How to Buy a Bike for $1,000 or Less"
5875,"Can I ask for a discount?
	“You can always ask,” says Beheler, but margins on bikes are anemic at best, so be prepared for rejection. However, he says shops are often willing to give discounts on accessories, especially when purchased in tandem with a bike. "
5876,"Oh, and no, the bike shop probably doesn’t want to sponsor your next race season. “Not even a super awesome Cat. 1 rider should just assume a discount is appropriate for them personally,” says Adrian Flores, the general manager of Austinbikes Service Station, in Austin, Texas. Flores adds that discounts are often earned not by talent but by loyal patronage. "
5877,"Can I take a test ride?
	“Definitely take a test ride—it will validate a credible salesperson’s recommendation,” says Beheler. In fact, if a bike shop won’t let you take the bike for a quick spin, you should probably shop elsewhere. “Make sure they show you how all the features on the bike work—including the shifting and the brakes,” says Beheler. "
5878,"How do I know if a bike fits me?
	This can be hard intel to gather from a 10-minute test ride, so you’ll need to go with your gut and what your salesperson is suggesting (see above about finding a salesperson you trust).  “Mainly you shouldn’t be hyper-extended trying to reach your handlebars,” says Bremer. If you're unsure of whether you're reaching too far, ask to test the same bike in the next size up and down. Comparison will make it clearer which one fits best."
5879,"You'll likely end up spending hours on your bike, so you want to feel comfortable riding. Nothing should feel awkward right off the bat—except for maybe your saddle. “Most saddles are a little uncomfortable at first, especially if you haven’t been riding at all,” says Bremer. One last question worth asking is whether your bike comes with any sort of fitting, and whether the shop will swap out parts on your bike to ensure you get the perfect fit—some will, but others won’t."
5880,"Do I  have to buy a gender-specific bike? What’s the difference? 
	No, you definitely don’t. It’s probably worth learning about them, though. “What makes a women’s specific bike different varies from brand to brand,” says Bremer. Some brands use different carbon thicknesses throughout the frame to make lighter, more compliant bikes, while others tweak features to include things like a shorter reach to the handlebars, narrower handlebars, and women’s-specific saddles. “There are benefits to it, but it the geometry of the bikes doesn’t apply to all women,” says Bremer "
5881,"Furthermore, sometimes women-specific products actually work better for men. “It’s pretty rare but it does happen,” says Beheler. So if your salesperson suggests you try a bike that’s not marketed towards your gender, don’t be offended—they just want to make sure you’re getting the best bike fit. "
5882,     RELATED: Why Men Should Try Women's Bikes
5883,"How many bikes should I test ride? 
	Beheler says you should ride at least two or three, but avoid the trap of trying every bike within a 100-mile radius. “If someone rides 10 bikes, it gets more confusing than anything else,” he says. "
5884,"Can I ask my bike shop to install a kickstand? What about accessories I bought online?
	“If the bike can physically accommodate a kickstand, we’ll put it—or anything else you want—on,” says Beheler. While most hybrid and urban bikes can fit a kickstand, road and mountain models are generally a different story—ask your mechanic what the best way to lean them is. As for those accessories you ordered from Amazon, most shops will install them without issue, but you should expect to pay a fee to have them put on. "
5885,"If you want to have a professional fit or a tune-up done on a bike you bought online, that’s okay too. “It’s encouraged to find a great fit for your bicycle, whether you buy it online, used from another person, or in the store. Find a fit-person you trust, and expect to pay for the services,” says Flores.
	 Do bikes come with a warranty or included maintenance?
	It varies. You should think of your purchase as the beginning of a long (and hopefully happy) relationship with your local bike shop. This means you’ll probably bring your bike in a few times a year for servicing and repairs. Some shops include a level of service with the purchase of a bike; you should ask about your shop’s policy. You should also find out what the manufacturer’s warranty covers. Often frames are covered “under normal use” which doesn’t include damage from crashes.  Finally, ask about whether the shop will help you navigate the warranty process or whether you’ll be on your own. "
5886,"New system is protected inside axle and runs on an AA battery
"
5887,"Rotor today announced a new platform for its crank-based power meters. The INpower Power Meter's parts are almost all located inside the crank axle. A discrete antenna, about one centimeter tall, and a battery door are the only visual cues."
5888,"Hiding two strain gauges, the battery and the electronics inside the axle centers the weight of the system, and provides a measure of protection, which mountain, ’cross, and gravel riders will appreciate. Rotor chose the common AA battery for INpower, heavier than the 2032 coin cells found in most other power meters. Rotor says it chose AA because that size is easy to find at any time. Claimed battery life is 300 hours of ride time—which is a lot of riding."
5889,"	Like a Stages or Garmin Vector S, INpower does not measure both legs; rather it doubles the left leg power output. Single-sided power allows Rotor to achieve a lower price than it would with a dual-sided system: INpower starts at $939 for a complete crankset (no rings); Rotor’s Power dual sided power meter starts at $1,594 (no rings). Rotor’s existing single-sided power meter, the Power LT, will be phased out."
5890,"	One very interesting feature of INpower is that the crank’s rotational speed is constantly monitored. Most crank-based power meters sample rotational speed a few times per crank revolution, 1 to 12 times per revolution depending on platform. From these samples, an average rotational speed is calculated. But this calculation assumes a constant rotational speed until the next sample is taken."
5891,"But, says Rotor’s research specialist Christie O’Hara, cyclists never pedal at a constant rotational speed. And when oval rings are used, like Rotor’s Q-Rings, the rotational speed varies even more—if you’re using oval rings with any crank-based power meter except INpower, you’re power data is probably off by 2 to 5%, says O’Hara. Constant rotational speed monitoring provides accurate power measurement with oval rings."
5892,	     RELATED: Guide to Power Meter Metrics
5893,	The constant rotational measurement allowed Rotor to create a pair of new metrics dubbed Torque 360 and Optimal Chainring Angle (OCA).
5894,"	Torque 360 allows Rotor’s new Windows software to display a graph of the rider’s complete pedal stroke, showing where in the pedal stroke the maximum power is generated, and illustrating the dead spots. This allows riders to work on their pedaling efficiency, smoothing out their pedal stroke and reducing negative torque, or how much your rising leg is working against your driving leg."
5895,"	As for OCA, Rotor’s Q-Rings have several mounting options to tune where in the pedal stroke the fat part of the oval is located. The OCA metric displays the crank angle at which the rider applies maximum force, which helps riders with Q-Rings find their optimal mounting position."
5896,	OCA and Torque 360 are ANT+ profiles: Any head unit that implements the profiles can display these new metrics.
5897,"	INpower is an ANT+ only system: there’s no Bluetooth, and no USB plug so firmware updates must be pushed over the air from a computer or smartphone."
5898,      RELATED: The Perfect Pedal Stroke
5899,"	I had an opportunity to ride INpower in the Sequel Demonstration Forest. After a time- and leg-saving lift by Shuttle Smith Adventures we rode Buzzards, Cusacks, Ridge, sections one through five of the Flow trail and took Hihn’s Mill out. I do like riding with power on my mountain bike (I use a Stages power meter at home), so I was looking forward to trying this new option. Unfortunately, my unit quit transmitting on two separate occasions. Rotor sent me home with a different unit to ride long term, so I’ll know by next week if I just happened to grab a bad apple.
	INpower cranks use Rotor’s UBB system to navigate the sea of bottom bracket standards. The cranks use an extra long (102mm in the mountain version), 30mm diameter axle that can be adapted to almost any current standard with Rotor’s UBB bottom bracket cups. The one significant exception: BB90 or BB95, which happen to be the standards Trek uses."
5900,	Rotor will offer INpower cranksets in both mountain and road platforms. Rotor expects the products to begin shipping from Spain next week and land in US shops in mid-May.
5901,"	For the road, INpower is offered in Rotor’s 3D 30, 3D+, and aerodynamic Flow cranksets. Prices and claimed weights are:
	Flow with 110 or 130mm MAS spider: $1,139, 597 grams w/110 spider
	3D+ with 110 or 130mm spider: $1,079, 525 grams w/110 spider
	3D with 110mm spider: $959, 562 grams."
5902,"	For the mountain Rotor offers INpower for its top of the line CNC machined Rex 1 crank arms and heavier, lower cost forged and machined Rex 2 arms. Rotor sells cranks a la carte: rings and bottom brackets are sold separately. Rex 1 is $1,079 and 562 grams (claimed) with a dual-diameter 110/60mm spider; with a 76mm BCD spider it is $1,019 and 549 grams. Rex 2 is $959 and 579 grams with a dual-diameter 110/60mm spider; with a 76mm BCD spider it is $939 and 566 grams."
5903,"For current owners of the above cranks, Rotor will offer the left arm only. Prices are: Flow, $869; 3D +, $839; 3D 30, $779; Rex 1, $839; Rex 2, $779."
5904,"With the launch of INpower, Rotor is launching a free Windows application (download from inpower.rotorbike.com) that reads and displays all the information the crank is sending and provides all the data even the most intense triathlete would ever want, including the new Torque 360 metric. An Android app will also be offered. Apple fans will have to wait: Rotor said Mac and iOS apps are in the works, but offered no timeline."
5905,"The high-tech heads-up display glasses offer great optics and easily accessible data—and they'll definitely get you noticed
"
5906,"When Recon’s integrated heads-up display Jet eyewear was introduced last year, it sounded like something straight out of a sci-fi flick—and looked the part, too. These shades have a built-in screen that can take photos and videos and display GPS ride metrics without ever having to pull out a phone or look down at a handlebar-mounted computer. Recon is already shipping Jet units to customers who pre-ordered and making them available to the masses. Plus, we got our hands on a pair for a first impression. It took a little while to get used to its features and just plain wearing these very unique glasses, but the technology is impressive and about to get even more so with the development of new apps."
5907,"Recon says the Jet’s computer is equivalent to those found in most modern smart phones and that certainly seems to be the case. It has many of the functions and features of smart phones and GPS-driven cycling computers. Impressively, Recon has packaged all this technology on a pair of glasses in a way that's unobtrusive to the rider. Other than the heads-up display (HUD), the only thing that really feels different than normal eyewear is the 85-gram weight. The bendable earpieces and nosepiece make for a great fit, even with my crooked nose. Optics are crisp, clear, and on par with most high-end eyewear."
5908,"The HUD is adjustable to line up with your eye via a small tab at the bottom of the housing. The resolution is a bit pixelated—it’s not like looking at an iPhone’s retina display—but this is only noticed while looking at photos or videos. Data and map reading are sharp and clear. To navigate within the device, use a small toggle button at the bottom and side mounted optical touch pad. The controls are intuitive and easy to use once you get used to them."
5909,"Jet works as a standalone piece without the aid of a smart phone. The sunglasses offer a camera, video camera, and GPS info similar to a cyclocomputer’s dashboard with speed, distance, and duration of the ride. It also stores these activities and your fastest times. One cool feature is the ability to see other Jet users on the map. Jet also integrates with your phone using Recon’s Engage app via a Bluetooth connection. This phone app gives you a dashboard for Jet’s ride content away from the glasses. Jet also engages with your phone by displaying texts, calls, and music controls, all while the phone is in your pocket. Jet features Wifi, Bluetooth, and ANT+ connectivity. Area maps and firmware updates are uploaded via Recon’s Uplink computer program."
5910,"Jet’s packaging is sleek and well-integrated but the look is unique. If you don’t want to be noticed, forget wearing these glasses—you’ll get long looks and second glances everywhere you go. Having a small portion of your peripheral vision blocked by the HUD screen takes a little getting used to—on the road I adapted quickly but I found it tougher to adjust while on the mountain bike in technical terrain. Some will argue any blocked vision is dangerous, but I’ll argue that taking your eyes off the road to look down at a computer or phone is even worse."
5911,"All of the Jet’s integrated features are just the tip of the iceberg and almost a distraction from the bigger picture. Upcoming third party apps will really make this technology sing. Right now, Jet is a lot like an iPhone without apps—cool, but nowhere near what it could really become. According to Recon, dozens of cycling-related apps for the Jet will be available by the end of the year. And the Jet is not just for cycling—there is already an app for sailing and one for shooting that allows the wearer to aim and fire around corners. Wearable technology is growing in popularity, and Recon’s Jet eyewear might prove to be one of the most intriguing examples for cyclists yet."
5912,SRAM’s 1x12 mountain bike drivetrain may upset one of the final reasons to be a 1x holdout
5913,"Despite the popularity of SRAM’s 1x11 drivetrains, some riders have remained holdouts, citing the system’s limited range of gears. But with its 12-speed Eagle groups, the company might finally have killed the front derailleur. By squeezing 12 cogs into the same space as 11, engineers created a 500 percent range (your hardest gear is five times the ratio of your easiest) that’s close to that of some 2x setups, and much wider than the 420 percent gear range of an 11-speed, 10-42 cassette."
5914,"The group is available in SRAM’s top-of-the-line XX1 version, which is intended for XC racing and trail use, while X01 Eagle covers trail to enduro riders—it’s $224 less than XX1, but weighs 46 grams more and has a more bombproof construction."
5915,     RELATED: Our First Ride Using SRAM XX1 Eagle
5916,"SRAM’s current XD driver can still be used, but everything else is new. Since the Eagle cassette uses the same 10-42 gear range and spread for its first 11 cogs, it felt familiar until I got to the 12th, 50-tooth cog. The jump from 42 to 50 is slightly larger than the other shifts on the cassette, causing a bigger change in cadence, but the actual shift is smoother than the previous jump from 36 to 42 cogs on the 11-speed groups, thanks to new shift ramp profiles in Eagle that more smoothly guide the chain onto the 50-tooth cog. XX1 features the gold-colored titanium nitride finish, while X01 comes in traditional silver. "
5917,"Having a 50 in the back isn’t just about having a very low climbing gear; it enables you to gain back the high end of the range in a 1x setup by using a larger chainring (like a 36- or 38-tooth). But some frames may not have the clearance to run a chainring that big. Setup and tuning is more fickle too, as tolerances tighten up with the 12-speed system. (Learn how to handle these and other issues in The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance and Repair.) Cable tension and B-tension clearance (the distance between the upper pulley wheel and the cogs) seem to be even more critical than before. And there is a 34-gram weight penalty compared with the 11-speed XX1."
5918,But the gain in range is well worth it.
5919,"Our rigorous annual testing program is designed to point you toward the greatest, most fun bicycles on the planet—and it just got even more competitive
"
5920,"We started with 84 stellar bikes. After months of evaluating, comparing, and eliminating—followed by one hella intense week of riding the 30 finalists (and the most challenging, vehement, loud debates over bikes we’ve ever had)—we ended up with these 19 winners: bikes we recommend without reservation because they are class leaders, are amazing values, or extend the limits of what’s possible technologically. And, because of course, they bring the fun—hard."
5921,     RELATED: 2015 Road Bike Editors’ Choice Winners
5922,"For more than a decade, we’ve presented you with the best of the best of each year’s bikes—thanks to a process that involved splitting them into categories such as “best men’s enthusiast road,” picking three to five finalists, then choosing one winner from each group. This year, we changed everything—except the integrity and the exhaustiveness of the testing. For starters, we canned the categories. They’d gotten to feel restrictive, precluding us from picking, say, two outstanding bikes that both happened to end up classified as recreational road, and they also prevented us from considering wonderfully quirky bikes that don’t fit into any box. So this year, the initial nominations were free-form, based on our judgment of the many models we’d already ridden or had knowledge of; our test director’s objective survey of factors like price, weight, and components; and, finally, on pure, idiosyncratic passion. The contenders included everything from custom titanium all-day bikes to blinged-out TT machines. And we devised a new, multistep voting and evaluation process that required the riders who felt most strongly about a bike (pro and con) to argue its case before a revolving board of our most experienced testers. The system was objective enough to be fair and subjective enough to be selective. Then we rode the hell of out the finalists at our home office in Pennsylvania and during a one-week camp in Solvang, California. We raced past vineyards and empty farm fields, ground our way up climbs baked by the sun and bordered by snow, and screamed down descents. We debated ride quality, value, class leadership, and X-factor—the illogical, phenomenal spell a bike can cast. At the end, we had 19 winners: the baddest, raddest, most fun ones out there."
5923,"I’d anticipated, well before the final votes, that this Editors’ Choice would result in just such a knockout lineup. On our third and final ride of the first day’s testing, the group split between two routes, then ended up crossing paths on Ballard Canyon Road. It was the golden hour, and the sun silhouetted the gnarled fingers of the California oaks against glowing green pastures. It was gorgeous, but it wasn’t the scenery that struck me. It was the look on Lou’s face as we passed one another on opposite sides of the road; him on the climb, me descending. He had this radiant smile, this expression of pure, unadulterated joy. Then Jesse went by, then Joe. They glanced at me, and I at them, and we all wore that same look, driven by the same thought: We love these bikes. And we knew that you’d love them just as much."
5924,"Oil-free formula is water-resistant up to 80 minutes—and won’t make you look like a ghost
"
5925,"Out in the unforgiving heat of the Sea Otter Classic expo, the battle for sunscreen samples is nearly as cutthroat as the bike racing. But after getting shot down by multiple booth attendants who were overprotective of their few remaining freebies, I chanced upon Zealios."
5926,"Zealios is a small sports cream company from Berkeley, California, that we first noticed at Interbike a few years ago, when co-founder Kevin Fuller was wandering the floor handing out samples. Luckily Fuller came through once again today with a generous hit of zinc-based SPF45—and the product was just as exceptional as we remembered from those original test packets."
5927,"When it comes to sunscreen, “zinc-based” is usually just a fast way of saying, “Get ready to rock that cadaver look.” But because Zealios doesn’t use oil, you don’t have to worry about the whitish film that other zinc-based products can often curse you with—the product goes on completely clear, won’t clog your pores, and doesn’t feel greasy or heavy. Best of all, it has a waterproofing agent that lasts up to 80 minutes in water—or in my case, for 80 minutes of sweating like a sinner in church. The Sun Barrier SPF 45 I tried has the highest FDA water-resistance rating of any sunscreen available, Fuller says, but refuses to reveal his top-secret waterproofing ingredient."
5928,     RELATED: Sunscreen: A User’s Guide
5929,"Fuller and co-founder Austin Britts originally formed Zealios to sell chamois cream. They’ve since expanded their line to sunscreen and—by popular demand—sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners that repair the damage done to hair by swimming in chlorine. About a year ago they quit their former jobs as chemical salesmen to focus on Zealios full-time and make performance-minded products using as many natural ingredients as possible—as long as those ingredients make the product better. “There are a lot of all-natural products that don’t really do anything,” Britt says. “Our idea is, ‘What’s the point of being natural if it doesn’t perform?’” (My carefully preserved pastiness can report that the sunscreen does, indeed, perform.)"
5930,"At $15 for 3 oz. of sunscreen, it’s a bit pricier than mainstream sunscreens but reasonably priced for high-performance non-greasy broad spectrum UVA/UVB protection. In addition to being oil-free, it’s also free of PABA and parabens. Oh yeah, and it’s been rigorously tested by cyclists and other athletes—Zealios is a sponsor of the Jamis cyclocross team."
5931,"Fuse and women’s Ruze hardtail sport the brand’s new 6Fattie plus-size tires for mountain bikes
"
5932,"Plus-size tires are one of the hottest trends at Sea Otter this year, and Specialized has launched two mountain bikes designed around the 27.5+ size: the Fuse and the women’s specific Ruze. Both bikes feature the company’s all-new “6Fattie” 27.5+ plus-size tire."
5933,"The 6Fattie tires are 27.5 inches in diameter and three inches wide, offering riders the ability to run lower tire pressures than on traditional, 2.1- to 2.4-inch mountain tires. The combination of the wider tire and lower tire pressure increases the contact patch with the trail—up to 69 percent, says Specialized—giving the tires significantly more traction."
5934,     Related: Specialized Rumor 650b
5935,"With matching, slack 67-degree head angles, and relatively short 433mm chainstays for snappier handling, the Fuse and Ruze hardtails are made for more aggressive trail riding. Three builds are available for the Fuse and Ruze: Pro, Expert, and Comp. The Fuse comes with a 120mm fork, while the Ruze got a 100mm fork to keep the stack lower. The Ruze also features an angled top tube to achieve a shorter reach and lower standover height."
5936,"To accommodate the extra-wide tires, Specialized designed a unique “diamond chainstay”: In order to provide enough clearance for the 3-inch wide tire, while maintaining enough stiffness for quick handling, the chainstay “splits” to go up and over the widest part of the tire."
5937,"Also to accommodate the new tire size, these are dedicated 1x frames: The Pro models get 1x11 drivetrains, the Comp and Expert builds get 1x10. All versions get wide-range gearing, with 11-42 cassettes. All Fuses and Ruzes come with dropper posts—Pro builds get the new, 12-position IRcc Command Post by Specialized; the less-expensive models get Tranz X droppers."

5941,"Joe’s Carbon Solutions offers custom frame paint options
"
5942,"Sometimes the most interesting product isn’t a product at all, but a service. Walking the Sea Otter Expo, we spied several eye-catching frame paint jobs at an exhibitor and walked over to inspect.
Joe’s Carbon Solutions does carbon frame repair, but also has a solid business in custom frame painting. The company started out painting for Kestrel and Calfee 25 years ago, and several years back hung out their own shingle.
They paint new or used frames, metal and carbon. You can have a new, custom-made frame sent to them for finishing or send them a restoration job. Simple, single color paint jobs start at $400, although customs can reach much more. And Joe’s claims a short turnaround time of as little as a week. But what we liked was the originality and innovation.
They’re experimenting with a paint that mimics the look of chrome without the caustic chemical treatment (or weight) of the real thing. With the exception of detailed designs, all logos are masked and stenciled, not decals. And they work with two external designers, one of whom is a cyclist and one of whom isn’t, so if you want to match, say, the paint job on a Mercedes-Petronas F1 car, or color-match a favorite hue, they can create an original design to fulfill your wishes."

5947,WTB gives road tires the plus treatment
5948,"One of the hottest trends in mountain bikes is the 27.5-plus tire size—approximately three-inch-wide knobby tires on 27.5"" rims. These tires provide flotation, huge traction, and a smooth ride: stuff that drop-bar riders want also. And there has been a general trend towards wider road tires—first 25mm, then 28mm. But WTB, a company best known for mountain-bike tires, and the company that helped launch 27.5-plus, says, “You roadies want wide? We’ll give you wide!” Meet the 47mm Horizon."
5949,
5950,
5951,"The WTB Horizon ($68) is a 650b (aka 27.5"") by 47mm tire, designed for pavement and gravel riding. The overall diameter is about the same as a 700x30mm tire, but is obviously much wider, and should be run at lower pressures, which results in a cushy ride. Because it’s built on the 650 size, it’s a more compact (fewer fit and geometry compromises) and lighter package than it would be in 700x47mm."
5952,"This is not a mountain bike tire: It has a slick center section,and minimal shoulder texture. It is tubeless-ready, but can be run with tubes. Claimed weight is 515 grams per tire. Obviously, all that extra rubber isn’t free: Consider that Zipp’s 700x28mm Tangente Speed weighs about 220 grams per tire. Compared to that, the Horizon adds almost 1.5 pounds, per bike, of extra rubber alone."
5953,     RELATED: The Ultra Capable Cannondale Slate
5954,"The Horizon is heavier than the vast majority of road tires, and there will likely be an aerodynamic penalty and a rolling resistance penalty. Wider tires have been shown to have lower rolling resistance than narrower tires, but only at the same pressure: You ride wider tires to use lower pressures."
5955,"But this really isn’t a tire for people who have weight, aerodynamics, and rolling resistance as their primary concerns. This is a tire for people who want to make their road rides smoother, and to take their “road bike” more places, and further into the backcountry."
5956,
5957,
5958,"Wheel options are not an issue: Any existing 27.5"" mountain bike wheel with compatible driver body and hubs will work—there are lots of them. So too will any 27.5"" mountain bike rim. Mountain wheels and rims would probably be overkill for a Horizon-equipped road bike, so there is opportunity for wheel/rim companies to jump in with “plus-road” options. So far, only 3T has announced a 650b road/gravel wheel."
5959,"With an outside diameter equivalent to a 700x30, should the Horizon fit into a frame built for 700c wheels, that frame’s geometry shouldn’t be affected. The Horizon is so wide, however, that there are limited drop bar frames on the market originally built for 700s with the clearance required. WTB maintains a list of Horizon-compatible bikes on its website."
5960,     RELATED: Plus Size Tire Guide
5961,The Horizon should fit easily into any 27.5-inch-wheel mountain bike and turn it into a speedy commuter or utility bike. It should also be a great option for Cannondale’s Slate. But I’m most curious to see what else frame builders and bike brands can do with this tire.
5962,
5963,
5964,"One of my favorite bikes at NAHBS was a yellow Hunter built around the Horizon. Rick Hunter built an elegant road (or road-ish) bike that, for all that tire stuffed into it, doesn’t look awkward, heavy, or slow. It looks like it can go a lot of places, it looks smooth, and it looks fun. I wanted to ride it, to see what it could do and where I could go. This plus-road thing could easily fizzle, but if Horizon-equipped bikes are as comfortable and capable as the Hunter looks, I think it will make a lot of riders happy."
5965,A bike is your ticket to freedom and fun
5966,"Life is way too short to waste time looking for parking on campus this year. That’s why you should take a bike to college with you. Bikes are not only an awesome way to get around, but also an easy way to stay in shape. Chat with friends or make new ones as you roll along the bike path to class. Hop on your bike and head into town for a coffee or a late-night snack. Your bike is your ticket to freedom and fun. Plus it can save you some money compared to owning a car, money you can use for books or beer. "
5967,"A campus bike should get you to class reliably, so opt for one with multiple gears if your local terrain is hilly. Bikes like the Specialized Alibi Sport Step-Through and Diamondback Trace Sport provide a full range of gears for mountainous areas. If you don't necessarily need the gears, though, a single-speed option means less weight and less maintenance. For shifting that won't need a tune-up when you inevitably leave your bike outside in the rain, go for internal gearing, like you'll find on the Raleigh Harlan or Priority Classic Plus. "
5968,"The convenience of bicycle commuting is negated if the bike presents problems of its own, so consider how you'll use your campus bike before you buy. Models like the Schwinn Wayfarer come with two fenders to keep water from spraying up from the tires and ruining your outfit. State Bicycle Company equips its Elliston Deluxe with two racks, which affords multiple loading options for trips to the grocery store and library, although many of the bikes on our list come with rack mounts for future upgrades. Step-thru bikes from Civia and Specialized make your ride more compatible with your entire wardrobe."
5969,"Make sure to leave room in your budget for a few additional necessities. You’ll want a helmet to protect you in the event of a crash.

With fall’s shorter days, a bike light is essential and the Knog Pop ii is an inexpensive colorful option to light your way ($13 to $25, backcountry.com). Pair it with Knog’s Pop R tail light ($10 to $18, backcountry.com). Last, but certainly not least, you’ll want a lock to keep your new bike secure. Grab a Blackburn Local U-Lock and head to class ($23 to $30, backcountry.com)."
5970,"Also consider where you're putting the bike when you get home. Locking a bike outside overnight means its non-locked parts (wheels, seats, accessories) are subject to thievery, and the elements can take a toll on components, so we'd advise against it. If you'll be shouldering the bike to walk up and down stairs each day, an aluminum frame option like the Civia Lowry Step-Thru or Trek FX 2 will lighten the load. Keep your receipt on file and take down the bike's serial number (located beneath the bottom bracket) and register it with your school and/or municipality; you'll be glad you did if it ever goes missing.

Some bikes will ship mostly assembled and you’ll likely be able get it ready to ride on your own, but it’s still a good idea to pay a shop to check it over and make sure your new bike is dialed and safe. If your new ride needs assembly, it’s best to find a shop to take care of it for you. That way you can be confident your new bike will run smoothly.

6008,Campagnolo has made no secret that its new midrange Potenza group is intended to go shifter-to-shifter with Shimano’s Ultegra.
6009,"It’s a tall order: Ultegra 6800 is a stunning combination of price, weight, and performance that has made it the dominant drivetrain on bikes costing (most commonly) about $2,500 to $5,500. For Campy to unseat Ultegra as original spec on more midrange bikes will require some behind-the-scenes business, but before that, Potenza has to match up against Ultegra in the stuff that matters to riders."
6010,"So, does it?"
6011,"At retail, Potenza would cost you about $115 more than Ultegra ($1,050 versus $935). But bike manufacturers get volume discounts, so it’s possible that a bike built with Potenza could be the same price as the same bike built with Ultegra. (Learn to maintain your components like a pro—and even build up your own bike—with the Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance & Repair!) "

6014,"I’ve ridden Potenza about 1,000 miles so far (read my initial impressions about it here), often back-to-back with Ultegra, which comes out just ahead in performance, but with a smaller gap than its slight advantages in price and weight. Of Campy’s mechanical groups, Potenza requires the lightest touch and is the smoothest shifting. I’m inclined to say it is Campagnolo’s best-shifting mechanical group, though it lacks some of the features of the brand’s higher end groups. Potenza upshifts only one gear per press, while Record upshifts up to five. And it lacks some of Campy’s endearing character, like the distinct, crisp mechanical feel and sounds."
6015,
6016,
6017,"Lever throws are shorter than Ultegra, and the clicks are sharper compared with Ultegra’s damped and buffered quality. Shifts feel faster, more robust, and only a little less smooth. Even Potenza’s front shifting—where Shimano is usually clearly ahead of the competition—is fast, polished, and nearly equal. Ultegra still has the smoothness and refinement that makes it the leader, but only just."
6018,"Shifts are announced with more noise than Ultegra, but less than typical for Campagnolo. Once in gear, Potenza turns with a hush, save for some noise from the chainrings at extreme chain angles. To be fair, Shimano and SRAM groups do the same."
6019,     RELATED: 6 Gearing Mistakes You're Probably Making
6020,"Ergonomically, Potenza is a step up for Campagnolo. The hood covers—its best yet—have good grip and some cushion, which is helpful for riding without gloves. Newly shaped hood peaks are an improvement as well, making the additional hand position on top of the peaks more functional. Potenza’s thumb buttons drop lower than Campy’s other mechanical groups, mimicking the shape of its EPS electronic shifter buttons. They’re also easier to reach from the hoods and drops. A lightly textured strip on the front of the brake levers offers more grip than a shiny finish, especially when your hands are wet."
6021,"Campy has also introduced a new and improved brake-pad compound for aluminum rims: power is up, modulation is smoother, and the brakes feel livelier. But Shimano’s brake feels a little stiffer and modulates better where it is most crucial: near lockup."

6027,"One of the four things that for me sets the Watch apart from other wrist-based fitness trackers or performance monitors — and that also makes it preferable to just using your iPhone to run Strava or answer a call, text, or email mid-ride — is the factor that takes longest to appreciate and utilize: Its potential to integrate disparate parts of your life in a more seamless use of technology and communication. Here are a few examples that have struck me over the past four days:"
6028,"It’s not much more of a hassle to pull your phone out of your jersey pocket to do any of these things, but it’s the cumulative ease of accomplishing so many small tasks that has me wondering if the Watch is going to feel irreplaceable to me at some point—a little bit like when shifting moved from the down tube to the brake hoods."
6029,"The second thing that makes the Apple Watch stand apart is that it’s not a closed device; it’s a delivery vehicle for all the apps and functionality that will be developed for it. When you buy the Watch you’re not stuck with its own integrated workout tracker (which most cyclists will find basic and just okay) or any other software—you’re also buying a new way to access Strava (already available in an app that’s optimized for wrist use), or Map My Ride (coming soon, the company says), or whatever your favorite app is, as well as all the cycling-oriented apps yet to be conceived.

(The heart monitor, by the way, is fairly accurate, and during general rides as well as an intense criterium gave me readings consistent with those I’ve gotten from dedicated monitors.) And I kind of already miss wearing my mechanical, automatic, limited-edition John Coltrane Oris.

6207,This well-thought out tool kit has everything you need to do basic repairs on any bike
6208,"Feedback Sports, makers of excellent portable repair stands and bike storage products, recently expanded its product line into the bike tool market. The initial line consists of of three tool kits: the 19-tool Team Edition ($249.99), a collection of seven T-handle tools ($129.99), and the 12-tool Ride Prep ($129.99)."
6209,"I’ve used all three tool kits, but I’m going to focus on the Ride Prep kit here because it’s the most versatile and accessible of Feedback’s offerings. The quality of the tools is the same among all options. "

6211,"With items like a disc rotor de-bender; disc-pad spreader; valve core tool for Presta and Schrader; and tubeless-ready metal core tire levers, this kit is definitely mountain-bike friendly, but also ready for 'cross bikes and the new generation of disc-road and gravel bikes. "
6212,Carrying a lot of gear? Here's a better way to pack your jersey pockets for a ride:
6213,"The tools have good weight and comfortable contours, and many have a rubberized surface for a better grip. The tools fit well, and feel sturdy and well-built: the bodies of the three-ways, for example, don’t flex and twist when loosening a stubborn bolt. The tools look nice, too, and when they cost this much, they should. (Check out our custom Silca Wrench set for more stylish tool option!)"
6214,"There’s obvious thought put into the kit as well. I appreciated the comfort of the chain tool’s long and wide pin driver, and the simplicity of the spring-loaded link holder. The carrying case is sturdily built, with a good handle and robust zipper. It keeps the tools organized (there’s enough room for an extra tool or two),  though some tools pop out of their holders if the case gets tossed around. Zipped, the case measures about 7x11.5x2.5 inches; small enough to fit in checked luggage or a bike case when it’s not on a bench or in the back of a car."

Still, you will probably need to supplement some specific tools depending on your bike’s build. For example, this kit does not have a 10mm hex wrench (Which you'd need for Campy and some BB30 cranks); it doesn’t have tools for CenterLock disc rotors, external bottom bracket cups, or cassettes; the Phillips screwdriver head is a bit small; and the spoke wrench is a bit of an anachronism in a world of system wheel sets with splined or internal nipples. "

6220,"Whether you’re just ducking in for a coffee or leaving your bike out all day, there’s a lock for you on this robust list. "
6221,"In 5 minutes time, you can order a coffee, check your email, politely glance at the other café-goers, receive said coffee, and return to your unlocked bike, which was stolen 4 minutes ago. Shouldn’t have asked for an extra shot, but hindsight is 20/20 and now your prized bicycle is listed on a neighboring city’s Craigslist for pennies of what you paid. Bike thefts happened 162,547 times in 2016, according to FBI statistics, although the real number is likely higher because many property crimes go unreported. An Oregonian analysis of 13,000 Portland bicycle thefts found that only 2 percent of reports ended in arrests, which means your bike is probably gone for good. "
6222,"The good news is bike thieves are criminals of opportunity, so you can decrease your risk by locking up more intelligently than the next cyclist. We’ll run through the pros and cons of each genre to help you pick the best lock for your situation. "
6223,"A thief with the right tools can defeat any bike lock in 5 minutes, but that doesn’t mean all locks are created equal: The crook will raise hell cutting through a hardened-steel U-lock or chain with an angle grinder, so he or she is more likely to defeat a cheaper, lightweight cable lock with a set of bolt cutters. To decide how much security you need, consider your location and duration of lockup. All-day lockups on college campuses and in major metro areas where thefts are common require more security, says Kryptonite brand manager Daryl Slater, and anything left out overnight necessitates paranoia-level countermeasures (using multiple locks that can’t be defeated by the same bolt cutters is a good start). Here’s how the basic lock types differ, in order of most to least secure."
6224,"Most U-locks (D-locks in the U.K.) require power tools to defeat—although lightweight models like the RockyMounts Carlito are the exception. The locks are heavier and more expensive than most variants, but you’ll want the hardened steel when a misguided thief attempts to cut one with hand tools. High-security models like Kryptonite’s New York Fahgettaboudit and Abus’s Granite Extreme use double dead bolts, which means two cuts are needed to open the lock—all but the most daring thieves see them and keep moving. "
6225,"Chain locks can be as secure as U-locks and D-locks if the chain is hardened steel and the shackle is equally durable. A hardware store chain matched with your old gym class combo lock, though, is losing to the bolt cutters. A large chain can lock up a bike’s frame and both wheels while increasing the diameter of the tree, post, etc. to which you’re able to lock your bike, and models like the Hiplok Gold are designed to fit comfortably around your waist. "
6226,"Folding locks are an increasingly popular alternative to chain and cable locks, and their low profile when folded makes them great for commuters. Some are susceptible to bolt cutters, a Wirecutter test found, and power drills can quietly compromise their connecting joints. Like chains, they enable you to lock up to objects too big for U-locks and D-locks. "
6227,"These are the least secure type of lock, yet their ubiquity proves two things: Cyclists might not know how easy they are to defeat, and they prefer them because they’re cheap, lightweight, and easily wrapped around a frame. “Most stolen bikes are locked by cables or a hardware store chain that’s easily cut with 12-inch bolt cutters,” Slater says. Because they’re the quickest to cut, they’re best for low-theft areas and keeping someone from walking off with an otherwise unlocked bike.  "
6228,"You’ve bought a lock, now put it to work. “Make sure you lock according to value,” Slater says. “The frame (being most expensive), the rear wheel, then the front wheel.” Unlocked frames and wheels will likely be stolen eventually, so your best bet is locking both wheels to the frame with a chain or cable lock (or another U-lock, in high-risk areas). Aim for well-lit places and never leave a lock against the ground, as thieves might get the necessary leverage to pry it open. Make sure your bike can’t be lifted up and over a poll or tree. Slater says he’s encountered victims whose bikes were locked to street signs, over which a bike can easily be hoisted, or small trees, which were promptly cut down. As a general rule, the thing you’re locking to should be stronger than your lock. Lastly, take down your bike’s serial number (under the bottom bracket) and register it with your local police department in case the worst happens. "

And while Stages’ (and other companies') single-leg meters are up to the task of providing reliable data and information, Team Sky asked for a dual-sided meter to add depth and dimension to the numbers they were getting in training and racing (think: marginal gains). "
6266,See Fit Chick Selene Yeager Demonstrate Every Training Zone:
6267,"There was an underlying reason too: Athlete recovery. When Columbian Sergio Henao fractured a kneecap in a training accident while scoping out the time trial course of the 2014 Tour De Suisse, the dual-sided meter allowed Henao and team physiologists to look at separate left and right side power data to optimize the recovery procedure. The team reported that the new data allowed them to target specific exercises, as well as monitor progress, to get Henao back on the bike with less stress."
6268,"And after teasing a dual-sided power meter for the public for the last couple of seasons, Stages has finally brought it to market. It has of course been tested at the top end of the sport by Team Sky, who were instrumental in providing feedback and data.

6272,This new aerodynamic helmet from Giro gives you the benefits of a long-tail TT helmet without looking like an alien
6273,"Giro’s Vanquish helmet is the California company’s newest aero offering. It replaces the Air Attack in its helmet lineup with a design that sports better aerodynamics, cooling, and fit. It will begin shipping in late fall 2017 with an early release of about 40 helmets expected to be available around the time of the Kona Ironman. "
6274,RELATED: Cycling Helmets—What You Get At Every Price
6275,"In designing the Vanquish, Giro had clear objectives: it wanted a bike helmet that cooled better than the existing Air Attack, with improved aerodynamics and a better fit. It also wanted the helmet to incorporate a MIPS slip plane without altering fit, and to position the Vanquish as an everyday choice, not only an event type product. So the company started from a blank slate."
6276,How to get the perfect fit with a new helmet:
6277,"Giro went about a slightly different design process than before. Where the Air Attack was designed fairly quickly—mainly in response to where Giro saw the market heading and the need to supply its sponsored teams with aero product—the Vanquish enjoyed a slower gestation, and was more engineering-driven. Giro wanted to nail down the numbers it sought before the final shape was handed over to the industrial design team, which meant the company didn't even see it until it was about 80 percent done. "
6278,
6279,
6280,"By initially smoothing and then interrupting airflow at three “cliffs” molded into the exterior, Giro claims the shape of the helmet ""fools"" air into acting like it’s passing over a long tail TT helmet.  The shell consists of three pieces, which cover a dual-density foam core. Giro worked with pro athletes like Alexander Kristoff to get real world testing on the Velodrome and on the road to validate aerodynamic data.  "
6281,Optics by Zeiss
6282,"Zeiss is a world leader in optical products, especially lenses. For the Vanquish, Zeiss developed a series of lenses that filter blue light to give greater depth and contrast to vision. Called Vivid, The tints aim to hang on to the blue of the spectrum that helps enhance contrast, and lose the blue that doesn’t. Like the Air Attack, lenses are built into a shield that magnetically grips the helmet to further enhance aerodynamics. The new longer tail on the shield allows the air to flow past the helmet even better."
6283,
6284,
6285,"An added bonus showed up in testing: the shield helped channel airflow through the helmet. For those times you may not want full coverage, the shield can be positioned out of the way by inverting it and sticking it to a second set of embedded magnets. Just want to wear regular shades? The shape of the helmet works well with them, and there are even ports in the forward vents to hold them when not in use. "
6286,Retention and weight savings
6287,"RocLoc MIPS blends two technologies together for comfort and weight savings. Rather than including both the RocLoc retention system and the added bulky layer of the MIPs slip plane, which sometimes forced wearers to size up, Giro was able to combine both together. You still get excellent adjustability and the protection of MIPS, which has been shown in lab testing to reduce rotational forces on the brain in the event of a crash, all in a lower profile that also saves some grams. "
6288,
6289,
6290,"I got to ride in the Vanquish for about four hours. While it is hard to quantify aerodynamic advantages in the real world without test equipment, one detail I noticed immediately is how quiet the helmet is. It fits like most other Giro offerings, and has impressive adjustability for fit. The straps lay very flat to the face and don’t “shimmy” in the wind. And the ventilation was admirable; you could feel air passing thorough the helmet even at slow pace, and once up to speed, the cooling effect was noticeable. When wearing the shield, there is the distinct feel of air moving over the face. When stowed on top of the helmet, the shield does block a little of the air that could get through the front vents, but not enough to be bothersome. "

6294,"For the last couple of years I've been adding socks to shopping carts all over the Internet. There were the purple prismic La Galaxies from The Athletic. A grey-and-black House Industries pair with the Richard Sachs logo. Plus the entire La Girafe Sportive nine-pair combo pack from Tenspeed Hero. But I couldn't justify buying them when my dresser already overflowed with socks I'd gotten at events or on sale, ones that were serviceable enough, but said nothing about me. Then one day last year, I couldn't resist any longer. While I'd been deferring to practicality, socks had blown up. Instagram friends were posting gleeful pictures of their purchases with multiple sock-related hashtags and captions like, ""When I get stressed, I buy socks!"" My collection was lame and uninspiring.
So I chose three of my favorites from TSH, typed in my credit card number, and clicked ""complete my purchase.""
I busted out the first pair (light blue with stitched white latticework) for the lunch ride on a brilliant, summer-like October afternoon. I often sit at my desk over lunch and skip the daily group ride. But not on this day: I had new socks and I wanted to wear them.
Something like 18 people had shown up. Rapha had sent its espresso truck, so the barista was there, along with most of the BICYCLING staff, a couple of guys from the magazine downstairs, and the locals in team kits who sometimes join in and rip everyone's legs off. No one said anything about my socks, but that wasn't the point. They made me smile. They were more than just a layer of fabric between my skin and shoe; they were my reason to ride."

6296,"The group became a churning double paceline as we headed out Indian Creek. Chirps of conversation filtered back through the pack; riders spun along effortlessly. I was close to my limit right away, and for about 15 minutes I clung to a wheel wondering exactly when I'd pop.
Bitter espresso gurgled into my throat as my heart rate began a blistering gallop, my scalp prickled, and a wailing hurt seared my legs. I watched the pack get smaller and smaller around the first Mountain Road corner, and it was gone.
One person hung back. I refused his offer of help, I was too proud. Without the pack, the headwind hit hard. I kept going, but I knew this road. There was no intersection for a while, no natural place for the group to wait.
I hung my head, frustrated by my complicated emotions about riding bikes—of not being fast enough to ride with my friends, of missing out on the fun, of letting it upset me at all.
Then: a flash of light blue, first on the left, then the right, up and down. The socks that, just minutes before, had made me so excited to be on my bike.
I felt a catch in my throat, an almost giggle. Even as I write this, it seems impossible, but I could feel the angst lift and float away.
Right then, I made a choice. Being down on myself felt like a profound waste of time. Instead, I chose to remember that I was out riding on a beautiful fall day and wearing the best socks ever.
I found a tailwind, and eventually made my way back to the office.
I think about this moment now and then, any time I'm off the back or otherwise teetering toward an unhappy place. You always have choices. You can hang your head in despair—or you can look at your socks."

6301,
6302,
6303,"I've ridden and liked many other Split Pivot bikes before this, but the Django's suspension felt particularly good. It climbs with the efficiency of a cross-country bike, yet remains supple and active at all times. This combination encouraged me to keep going on technical climbs because, more often than not, I was successful in making sections that often force me off the bike. I never felt the need to reach down and use the Rockshox Monarch shock's platform switch, either—a particularly good thing since it quit functioning for some reason midway through the very first ride. "
6304,"A long front-center gave me plenty of room for a good pedaling position, even with the short 45mm stem. A low bottom-bracket height meant I had to watch my feet and pedal placement in the rocks, especially in the low-suspension setting, but I easily adjusted to it. I strongly preferred the low setting but could see how those who climb a lot or pedal in rocky terrain might like the high adjustment."
6305,
6306,"I was also encouraged by how the Django performed on descents. The Split Pivot suspension again took center stage with a plush-yet-controlled feel that I'd swear had an extra 10mm of travel because it felt perfectly matched to the 130mm-travel front end. It is supple and smooth over roots and rocks, while avoiding bottoming out on all but the hardest landings and G-Outs. A low bottom-bracket height gives the bike a ""sit in"" feel and low center of gravity that make cornering natural and fluid. The carbon frame on the SX model I tested felt rigid and accurate, resisting flex or any other bad habits. While the Django may only have 120mm of travel, it's the kind of bike that provokes you to seek out trail features you can use to boost off. "

6308,"There were flies in the ointment, like a narrow 725mm-wide handlebar—it felt really mismatched to the bike’s short stem. I swapped it out for a 780mm-wide bar after the first ride, and it matched my preference and the bike's nature. "
6309,
6310,
6311,"Also, it could be the fact that I've spent a lot of time testing plus-size tire bikes lately, but the Django's 2.3-inch front/2.2-inch rear tires felt noticeably narrow to me. A wider rim and/or tire might provide a better riding platform. And while bonus points are merited for having a bottle cage inside the frame's front triangle, it seemed to be placed unnecessarily high on the downtube to the tune of about an inch, limiting the size of water bottles you can use.   "
6312,"Overall, I was really impressed with the Django. The long front-center and short stem are together ideal for aggressive riding, steep terrain, and both at the same time. Devinci aimed this bike at riders who are looking to get a playful and very fun bike that can handle rough terrain. Even though I only went for a few rides on it, my first impression is that Devinci nailed it. "
6313,"The Devinci Django is just now arriving at dealers. Three carbon models will be offered, ranging in price from $5,689 for a Shimano XT 1x11-equipped model, to $3,789 for one with SRAM GX 1x11. Four versions with aluminum frames will be offered starting at just $2,589 for the S model with Rockshox Sektor RC fork and Shimano Deore 2x10 drivetrain."

6315,"When John Loughlin lowers a cordless angle grinder onto a ­section of a TiGr ­titanium bike lock clamped to a table, it emits the piercing scream of something that has a reason to live. White sparks spray the air and metal whiskers fly­ uncomfortably close to where I stand nearby, cringing. There is the distinct bouquet of burning hair."
6316,"Five seconds go by. Then 10. If we were on a city street right now, a small crowd of spectators might have formed a curious semicircle. Which is exactly the point. Assuming any lock can eventually be compromised, this is the most helpful thing it can do: create such a time-­consuming spectacle when it is assaulted as to make a bike not worth stealing. Because too often—as Loughlin demonstrated earlier by snapping a steel U-lock like a candy cane—it’s over in a flash. We’re standing in a garage in New Jersey where blacksmiths worked iron 200 years ago. This is where TiGr locks originated, in Loughlin’s parents’ 18th-century home, where gilt-framed paintings, yawning fireplaces, and green acreage beyond the barn suggest the estate of a retired American president, not an engineering lab."
6317,     Related: How to Prevent Bike Theft
6318,"In this unlikely environment Loughlin and his father dreamed up an even more unlikely device, a wholly new entry in a mostly familiar field of cables, chains, and U-locks. TiGr (pronounced “tiger”) looks like a giant tweezers—a single flat strip of titanium, bent on one end, open on the other. You slide the lock onto the bike like a paper clip, capturing wheels, frame, and bike-parking rack, then secure the two ends in a dense, smooth, cylindrical rotary disc lock with a bead-tight keyway. After stowing the tips inside the cylinder, you depress a button to activate the lock. When not in use, the lock can be strapped to a top tube."
6319,"Its visual deterrence value feels low. If I were in my kitchen I might try to open it with my good scissors. The device scarcely interrupts the look of the bike, and for riders accustomed to the appearance of brawn, TiGr’s minimalist vibe may not inspire confidence. “It’s an alternative to the Mr. T approach,” Loughlin tells me."
6320,"Reasonable people could hesitate to entrust their Shinolas and Globes to a family business prototyping attractive locks in a home workshop the size of a church confessional. But the Loughlins aren’t an ordinary family. Both John and his father, Bob, are mechanical ­engineers, and Bob has worked in the security business for 35 years. He got his first patent in 1957 and has generated a slew of them since—though he calls some of them “10-dollar solutions to one-dollar problems.” After working for Hewlett-Packard and developing a cardiac catheter, Bob Loughlin invested in a business with friends, making low-end padlocks. “I wanted to do something better,” he says. He started designing security for the military, including locks for nuclear cruise missile launchers and storage facilities. He invented an indicative tamper seal for luggage and a sleek, guillotine-like lock for UPS trucks, which cut street thefts in New York’s Diamond District from 186 to zero in a single year."
6321,John (left) and Bob Loughlin created the TiGr in their home workshop. (Joshua Simpson)
6322,"The Loughlins obviously didn’t design the TiGr just to look good. They focused on creating a lock responsive to common forms of assault. When John passes me a pair of bolt cutters and lays the titanium between its jaws, I fail to slice through it despite using all the force I can muster. U-locks are vulnerable to car-jack attacks because of their rigidity, but titanium can bend under such an assault and still remain intact. And TiGr resists being torqued by a pipe—the lock body simply spins around the tips of the bow."
6323,"The Loughlins brainstormed the TiGr in 2010. They threw up a Kickstarter­ page promising a “lock as cool as your bike.” Their goal was to raise $37,500. By their ­deadline they had $108,065, and with 740 backers, way more order-­fulfillment than they’d bargained for. “We really should have put a cap on it,” Bob says now."
6324,"The fact that a product like this can attract such interest before it ever appears in a bike shop suggests either they’ve come up with a true game changer or cyclists are so desperate for a foolproof lock, they’ll take a flier on an intriguing new concept. “The lock industry­ is the slowest-changing industry there is,” Bob Loughlin­ says. “It doesn’t look a lot different today than it did 5,000 years ago.”"
6325,"And that’s the problem, as he sees it. Criminals keep getting wise to the latest lock upgrades. Theft is on the rise. The race is on for something stronger, smarter, tougher."
6326,"SPENDING THE DAY with engineers endeavoring to create better locks honestly makes me feel a little bit sheepish. Until recently­ I hadn’t given mine much thought. I routinely locked the gold hybrid I ride around San Francisco to street signs using a U-lock with a busted cylinder. Once I met my friend Seamus at Symphony­ Hall. Seamus is the kind of man who wears his reinforced-­steel chain across his chest like a Scottish warrior,­ and he secured his custom Rodriguez to a city-installed locking station. When we came out, my bike was there and his was gone. He was devastated. “I didn’t even want another ­bicycle,” he said. “There’s a grieving process. It’s like replacing a pet the next day.”"
6327,"It wasn’t necessarily that expensive frames like Seamus’s are more attractive to bandits; lock makers say the cost of a bike matters little in the opportunistic world of on-street theft. The episode reinforced my faithless posture toward the concept of lock reliability. I use mine because it narrows the pool of potential thieves from All Jerks to just Jerks Carrying Tools. But I don’t trust my lock to withstand an attack, and every manufacturer I spoke to supported my reasoning: If someone with skills and criminal intent wants my bike badly enough, he’ll get it. End of story."
6328,"But what about people like Seamus, who invest so much in their bikes and, by extension, their lock’s reliability? How can it be that it’s now possible to remotely fire missiles at ­terrorists from thousands of miles away, but we lack the technology to keep a bicycle safe on a city street? In fact, the picture gets even more cruelly arbitrary. According to the National Bike Registry, 1.5 million­ bicycles are stolen annually, and that number is rising. In Los Angeles, despite an overall decline in crime between 2009 and 2010, bike thefts jumped 29 percent during that same time. In New York City, they’re up 25 percent."
6329,"Some of this can be pegged on riders settling for inadequate locks. Bolt cutters can snap a cable lock in less time than it takes you to tie your shoelaces.­ “Cables are useless,” says San Francisco Police Department ­sergeant Joshua Kumli, who recently recovered a stash of more than 100 hot bikes from one 18-year-old kid. “It’s like a hot knife through butter.” An angle grinder capable of shearing through U-locks can be had for about the cost of a monthly bus pass, and the same websites that explain how to remove wine stains also feature demonstrations on using the tool to shear through a lock. Some of the ­videos show these lock-­cracking lessons as oblivious passers-by amble around on lunch break, which also obliterates any ­confidence you might have in good Samaritanism’s deterrent potential. And of the few bike thieves caught for their crimes, so ­paltry a number actually serve any time that in this economy bike theft can seem like a viable career path."
6330,"Most lock makers will tell you theft nearly­ always results from improper lockup, but they’ll say in the next breath that there’s no such thing as an undefeatable lock. That doesn’t mean they’ve stopped trying. In workshops and labs around the world, engineers and inventors are on the hunt for the product that will restore faith by optimizing­ the two essential, seemingly countervalent features of lock design: convenience and security."
6331,"Kryptonite's Fahgettaboudit locks on both ends of the U shackle. That requires thieves to make two cuts, doubling their time to break the lock. (Joshua Simpson)"
6332,"IN KRYPTONITE'S TESTING garage, ­power cords plunge vinelike from the ceiling, and across the floor machines and tools grubby from heavy use stand ready, even though the engineers aren’t in today. I see this from the doorway, because Kryptonite’s marketing manager, Daryl Slater, won’t let me inside."
6333,"Slater’s job is to obstruct. There’s a powerful imperative to maintain privacy around the testing and design of Kryptonite locks. While the U-lock market now boasts a robust buffet of options, Kryptonite holds a reputation for being the best. (The company considers sales figures proprietary, so this is difficult to quantify.) At the major European testing bodies that subject security devices to all manner of savagery—drilling, cutting, twisting, saltwater exposure—Kryptonite locks get some of the highest ratings."
6334,"This reputation extends into the realm of iconography. In its ads, Levi’s has an orange Kryptonite Mini through a waist loop of its Commuter jean, and Slater claims that before the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the Charlotte, North Carolina, police called to ask how to cut Kryptonite products in case protestors locked ­themselves in place. The chief said his officers had tried everything, including the Jaws of Life. “He sounded tired,” Slater told me."
6335,"The brand’s power is startling when you consider Kryptonite’s origins. In 1972, there was no bike-lock industry. If you were worried about theft, you went to the hardware store and bought a length of chain, which you secured with a padlock—a system criminals could destroy with bolt cutters and roughly eight seconds of free time. All this was changed by a history grad named Michael Zane. In 1971, he was working at his father’s sheet-metal business in Boston when he read a news story about a special U-shaped bicycle lock designed to resist bolt cutters. Zane contacted the designer and worked with him to make enough locks to start a business. “We sold the first product for $20,” Zane says. “It looked like a bear trap.” Bike shops across the country turned him down; they had no customers looking for such a device yet."
6336,"Zane’s fortunes changed when New York City’s Second Avenue Bicycle Shop held a public trial. The staff used his lock to secure a bike to a meter outside the shop and left it there. After a month, although the frame had been stripped, it remained locked to the pole. This established Kryptonite’s reputation. Zane designed an ad showing a parking meter angled into broken concrete with a Kryptonite-locked bike pulled to the top, as if Godzilla had tried to rip it from the ground. Across the photo, in pink cursive: “Nice try!”"
6337,"Kryptonite offered a product guarantee for its locks, and processing claims supplied anecdotal evidence of its weak spots. “We got better because the thieves made us better,” Zane says. When robbers began to fit pipes over the end of keyways to snap U-locks off, the company moved the keyway to the center of the crossbar. When theft rates forced Kryptonite to pull its antitheft policy in New York, the firm fought back with locks made from extra-hard steel. And after one rider’s infamous Bic discovery—jamming the barrel of the classic ballpoint pen into the keyway popped Evolution and KryptoLoks—Kryptonite moved to disc-style cylinder locks."
6338,"At Kryptonite’s offices in Canton, Massachusetts, Slater shows me devices that trace the company’s evolution. The original U-lock prototypes were iron, with massive flat shackles that look like equestrian stirrups. As the locks improved, the shackles grew larger, then shrunk down, and the steel (which replaced iron) in the locks was rounded, becoming smooth, dense, and heavy. Idly biceps-curling the New York Legend chain, I feel a jolt of exertion in my neck. The best locks feature highly dense steel that’s thick enough to prevent thieves from getting tools between the lock and the bike, says global product manager Don Warren."
6339,"Zane’s improvisational style changed in 2001 when he sold the company to Ingersoll Rand (IR), the gargantuan industrial firm that also produces some of the very angle grinders preferred by lock breakers. Tough new products coincided with IR’s acquisition, most notably the New York Fahgettaboudit line, the name meant to evoke the kind of thick-necked mob muscle that keeps crooks moving down the block. The locks get Kryptonite’s own highest security rating—10 of 10 padlocks. The chain can fend off bolt cutters, but at a cost: It weighs 15.25 pounds, not exactly built for a comfortable commute. The newest mini U-lock is badass, but it’s meant to work in tandem with a chain or cable."
6340,"At IR’s testing sites, engineers expose the locks to extreme heat, irradiate them with UV rays, and put them through tests that simulate thousands of lockups over a span of years. But Slater says the attacks they hear about most often are the same as ever: bolt cutters, hacksaws, car jacks, and cordless angle grinders."
6341,"While Kryptonite has ­antitheft options for virtually every lock it sells, plenty of riders say the stringent ­fulfillment requirements for the company’s policy make getting refunds a ­challenge. “You’ll find a lot of griping on the Internet about the difficult restrictions,” Slater says. “It’s better to just not have your bike stolen at all.” ­Kryptonite considers the number of antitheft claims it satisfies annually proprietary, but both Slater and Warren maintain that with the right Kryptonite lock for your city, properly used, your bike is more likely to be struck by lightning than nicked by a thief."
6342,"Cheaper bike locks can be broken with small, inexpensive hand tools. (Joshua Simpson)"
6343,"THEY'RE TRYING. The lock makers want to win. The people at Knog, an Australian company offering silicone-wrapped U-locks in cheerful colors, say their testing program is engineered to take in data and allow for improvements at every point of the product cycle—from design to prototyping, through manufacturing, and again before the locks are shipped. Knog’s designers factor in customer feedback for the next generation of their products, says chief marketing officer Mike Lelliot."
6344,"It’s a testament to faith in ingenuity—or to the power of human self-­delusion—that a business often defined by failure is becoming more crowded­ all the time. Competitors jostle to stand out by imbuing their locks with distinct personalities. Knog’s playful branding—it compares the Bouncer model to a “crazy little designer dog”—belies the products’ security potential; its popular Strongman lock has received superb ratings from several European testing bodies. The locks are designed to be “extensions of our collective personality,” Lelliot says. “They ought to make us happy, like a vintage Faema espresso machine that squeezes out perfect coffees each morning.”"
6345,"Blackburn boasts a brutal-looking array of U-locks with unique hexagonal shackles designed to resist cutting, each named after a notorious prison—Sing Sing, Leavenworth, San Quentin. The mascot for OnGuard, whose locks bear a strong resemblance to Kryptonite’s, is a snarling, yellow-eyed dog. The trick in these marketing gambits is not only to make a vivid argument to shoppers who might not care to educate themselves on the composition of hardened steel, but also to make a case to potential robbers."
6346,"TiGr is the first to use all titanium. Bob Loughlin first began to conceive the lock in the summer of 2009, when he wandered into a rental shop in Sun Valley, Idaho. All the bikes came with a cable lock—but for his personal ride the owner had established five locking stations in different places around the area where he’d left heavy chains. Loughlin returned home thinking, There’s got to be a better way. His past endeavors had made him a full-fledged lock geek; his office shelves are studded with unusual mechanisms—long, finger-shaped devices encrusted with filigree, others that take seven keys to pop. He and John began designing and prototyping a lock made from titanium, a material as strong as steel but half the weight (the largest TiGr model weighs two pounds). Ti had only recently become affordable enough for commercial applications. John started poking around online bike forums for ideas. When they had a prototype, John took it to lock companies, but they felt the TiGr was too different, as he remembers the meetings. “So we said, ‘Screw it, let’s take it right to the crowd.’” The Kickstarter forum provided robust feedback. Commenters asked about pipe attacks and angle-grinder vulnerability, and in response the Loughlins posted­ videos comparing TiGr with a U-lock of undeclared origin. In one, John’s bolt cutters and tin snips only scarred the ti, and when a car jack hit its maximum height the lock was stretched but intact. “The branch that bends doesn’t break,” Loughlin says."
6347,"The two often work at home, using a collaborative style John euphemizes as “constructive­ interference.” Bob still calls on his military security contacts for testing, but even after the lock passes rigorous tests, John remains uneasy. “You do the best you can, but you do lie awake waiting for that first e-mail saying, ‘You son of a bitch.’”"
6348,"TiGr didn’t have a flawless launch. One Kickstarter customer complained the lock didn’t fit around New York City’s fat posts, and others noted it wasn’t a great fit for bulkier mountain bike wheels (the Loughlins have since added new sizes). A recent German video shows a woman cutting through the lock with bolt cutters in five seconds. (The Loughlins responded on Facebook that the snipped lock was TiGr’s smaller, 0.75-inch version; the brawnier, 1.25-inch device has about 67 percent more material and is the only TiGr lock certified by the ART Foundation, an organization that sets standards in the bike-centric Netherlands. The unstated but clear message: If you’re really concerned about security, buy the bigger version.) And the locks come at a premium. The high-end model costs $220—as much as $100 more than top-shelf chains."
6349,"Will the TiGr, or any new or existing product, do the job? Probably—in some cities, for a time. “Some thieves out there are very ­brilliant people,” says Rick Schad, creative director of the company that owns OnGuard. “We could say the same of software pirates and ­hackers. They’re innovative. It’s a puzzle.”"
6350,"Given the perpetual cat-and-mouse game that defines the industry, it seems cyclists can assume one of three attitudes: nihilistic surrender to the inevitability of theft, ­old-school reliance on brawn, or an adventurous ground-floor investment in something new. After watching designers press ahead, I decided to abandon Option One. I threw out my old busted U-lock and will double down on a better, sturdier system—armed with a glimmer of hope and crossed fingers.

In 1971, he was working at his father’s sheet-metal business in Boston when he read a news story about a special U-shaped bicycle lock designed to resist bolt cutters. Zane contacted the designer and worked with him to make enough locks to start a business. “We sold the first product for $20,” Zane says. “It looked like a bear trap.” Bike shops across the country turned him down; they had no customers looking for such a device yet."
6373,"Zane’s fortunes changed when New York City’s Second Avenue Bicycle Shop held a public trial. The staff used his lock to secure a bike to a meter outside the shop and left it there. After a month, although the frame had been stripped, it remained locked to the pole. This established Kryptonite’s reputation. Zane designed an ad showing a parking meter angled into broken concrete with a Kryptonite-locked bike pulled to the top, as if Godzilla had tried to rip it from the ground. Across the photo, in pink cursive: “Nice try!”"
6374,"Kryptonite offered a product guarantee for its locks, and processing claims supplied anecdotal evidence of its weak spots. “We got better because the thieves made us better,” Zane says. When robbers began to fit pipes over the end of keyways to snap U-locks off, the company moved the keyway to the center of the crossbar. When theft rates forced Kryptonite to pull its antitheft policy in New York, the firm fought back with locks made from extra-hard steel. And after one rider’s infamous Bic discovery—jamming the barrel of the classic ballpoint pen into the keyway popped Evolution and KryptoLoks—Kryptonite moved to disc-style cylinder locks."
6375,"At Kryptonite’s offices in Canton, Massachusetts, Slater shows me devices that trace the company’s evolution. The original U-lock prototypes were iron, with massive flat shackles that look like equestrian stirrups. As the locks improved, the shackles grew larger, then shrunk down, and the steel (which replaced iron) in the locks was rounded, becoming smooth, dense, and heavy. Idly biceps-curling the New York Legend chain, I feel a jolt of exertion in my neck. The best locks feature highly dense steel that’s thick enough to prevent thieves from getting tools between the lock and the bike, says global product manager Don Warren."
6376,"Zane’s improvisational style changed in 2001 when he sold the company to Ingersoll Rand (IR), the gargantuan industrial firm that also produces some of the very angle grinders preferred by lock breakers. Tough new products coincided with IR’s acquisition, most notably the New York Fahgettaboudit line, the name meant to evoke the kind of thick-necked mob muscle that keeps crooks moving down the block. The locks get Kryptonite’s own highest security rating—10 of 10 padlocks. The chain can fend off bolt cutters, but at a cost: It weighs 15.25 pounds, not exactly built for a comfortable commute. The newest mini U-lock is badass, but it’s meant to work in tandem with a chain or cable."
6377,"At IR’s testing sites, engineers expose the locks to extreme heat, irradiate them with UV rays, and put them through tests that simulate thousands of lockups over a span of years. But Slater says the attacks they hear about most often are the same as ever: bolt cutters, hacksaws, car jacks, and cordless angle grinders."
6378,"While Kryptonite has ­antitheft options for virtually every lock it sells, plenty of riders say the stringent ­fulfillment requirements for the company’s policy make getting refunds a ­challenge. “You’ll find a lot of griping on the Internet about the difficult restrictions,” Slater says. “It’s better to just not have your bike stolen at all.” ­Kryptonite considers the number of antitheft claims it satisfies annually proprietary, but both Slater and Warren maintain that with the right Kryptonite lock for your city, properly used, your bike is more likely to be struck by lightning than nicked by a thief."
6379,"Cheaper bike locks can be broken with small, inexpensive hand tools. (Joshua Simpson)"
6380,"THEY'RE TRYING. The lock makers want to win. The people at Knog, an Australian company offering silicone-wrapped U-locks in cheerful colors, say their testing program is engineered to take in data and allow for improvements at every point of the product cycle—from design to prototyping, through manufacturing, and again before the locks are shipped. Knog’s designers factor in customer feedback for the next generation of their products, says chief marketing officer Mike Lelliot."
6381,"It’s a testament to faith in ingenuity—or to the power of human self-­delusion—that a business often defined by failure is becoming more crowded­ all the time. Competitors jostle to stand out by imbuing their locks with distinct personalities. Knog’s playful branding—it compares the Bouncer model to a “crazy little designer dog”—belies the products’ security potential; its popular Strongman lock has received superb ratings from several European testing bodies. The locks are designed to be “extensions of our collective personality,” Lelliot says. “They ought to make us happy, like a vintage Faema espresso machine that squeezes out perfect coffees each morning.”"
6382,"Blackburn boasts a brutal-looking array of U-locks with unique hexagonal shackles designed to resist cutting, each named after a notorious prison—Sing Sing, Leavenworth, San Quentin. The mascot for OnGuard, whose locks bear a strong resemblance to Kryptonite’s, is a snarling, yellow-eyed dog. The trick in these marketing gambits is not only to make a vivid argument to shoppers who might not care to educate themselves on the composition of hardened steel, but also to make a case to potential robbers."
6383,"TiGr is the first to use all titanium. Bob Loughlin first began to conceive the lock in the summer of 2009, when he wandered into a rental shop in Sun Valley, Idaho. All the bikes came with a cable lock—but for his personal ride the owner had established five locking stations in different places around the area where he’d left heavy chains. Loughlin returned home thinking, There’s got to be a better way. His past endeavors had made him a full-fledged lock geek; his office shelves are studded with unusual mechanisms—long, finger-shaped devices encrusted with filigree, others that take seven keys to pop. He and John began designing and prototyping a lock made from titanium, a material as strong as steel but half the weight (the largest TiGr model weighs two pounds). Ti had only recently become affordable enough for commercial applications. John started poking around online bike forums for ideas. When they had a prototype, John took it to lock companies, but they felt the TiGr was too different, as he remembers the meetings. “So we said, ‘Screw it, let’s take it right to the crowd.’” The Kickstarter forum provided robust feedback. Commenters asked about pipe attacks and angle-grinder vulnerability, and in response the Loughlins posted­ videos comparing TiGr with a U-lock of undeclared origin. In one, John’s bolt cutters and tin snips only scarred the ti, and when a car jack hit its maximum height the lock was stretched but intact. “The branch that bends doesn’t break,” Loughlin says."
6384,"The two often work at home, using a collaborative style John euphemizes as “constructive­ interference.” Bob still calls on his military security contacts for testing, but even after the lock passes rigorous tests, John remains uneasy. “You do the best you can, but you do lie awake waiting for that first e-mail saying, ‘You son of a bitch.’”"
6385,"TiGr didn’t have a flawless launch. One Kickstarter customer complained the lock didn’t fit around New York City’s fat posts, and others noted it wasn’t a great fit for bulkier mountain bike wheels (the Loughlins have since added new sizes). A recent German video shows a woman cutting through the lock with bolt cutters in five seconds. (The Loughlins responded on Facebook that the snipped lock was TiGr’s smaller, 0.75-inch version; the brawnier, 1.25-inch device has about 67 percent more material and is the only TiGr lock certified by the ART Foundation, an organization that sets standards in the bike-centric Netherlands. The unstated but clear message: If you’re really concerned about security, buy the bigger version.) And the locks come at a premium. The high-end model costs $220—as much as $100 more than top-shelf chains."
6386,"Will the TiGr, or any new or existing product, do the job? Probably—in some cities, for a time. “Some thieves out there are very ­brilliant people,” says Rick Schad, creative director of the company that owns OnGuard. “We could say the same of software pirates and ­hackers. They’re innovative. It’s a puzzle.”"
6387,"Given the perpetual cat-and-mouse game that defines the industry, it seems cyclists can assume one of three attitudes: nihilistic surrender to the inevitability of theft, ­old-school reliance on brawn, or an adventurous ground-floor investment in something new. After watching designers press ahead, I decided to abandon Option One. I threw out my old busted U-lock and will double down on a better, sturdier system—armed with a glimmer of hope and crossed fingers.

6388,"Ibis adds plus-size tire compatibility to two of its 27.5er trail mountain bikes, and we put one to the test"
6389,"Ibis is the latest brand to embrace the 27.5+ tire platform by adding compatibility to its new Mojo 3 and updating the existing Mojo HD3. The company is adopting the plus-size treatment in a unique way: The two trail mountain bikes have 27.5-inch designs, not 29ers, like pretty much every other plus-sized bike released so far. The result is an equally unique ride that will change the perception of the high-volume tire for a lot of riders—it certainly did mine. "
6390,     RELATED: 2016 Buyer's Guide: The Best Trail Mountain Bikes
6391,"The third-generation Mojo has a brand-new, 130mm-travel design based only loosely on the Mojo 2 launched in 2005. This iteration features dw-link suspension and 27.5-inch or 27.5+ tire compatibility thanks to Boost-width front and rear ends. (Boost allows for tight 425mm chainstays and clearance for up to a 2.8-inch-wide plus-size tire.) The geometry is pretty much standard-issue for a modern trail bike, with a 66.8-degree head angle paired to a 140mm-travel fork. Ibis says bottom-bracket height after setting sag is the same with a 2.3-inch and 2.8-inch tire. Claimed frame weight for the Mojo 3 is just 5.5 pounds, and my size-large test bike weighed 27.3 pounds fully built. "
6392,
6393,
6394,"The updated 150mm-travel Mojo HD3 pairs the exact same front triangle and shock included in the previous update (see the related link below), but adds a Boost-width rear end and linkage. The resulting swingarm retains the exact same 430mm chainstay length and suspension kinematics as before—it's just wider to accommodate tires up to 2.8 inches in width. This will be a running change in future HD3 models, and will be offered as an upgrade for existing bikes beginning in April. HD3 frame prices remain the same as before; the upgrade kit, including lower link and hardware, will run $899."
6395,     RELATED: The New Ibis Mojo HD3 Is an Evolution of a Classic
6396,"I spent a week getting acquainted with the Mojo 3 on the trails surrounding my Southern California mountain home. After riding numerous dedicated 27.5+ bikes and many converted ones, I thought I had a good handle on what the high-volume-tire platform was all about—but I have to admit that the new Ibis Mojo 3 caught me by surprise. Most plus-size bikes have a bit of a monster-truck or fat-bike feel to them, but not this one."
6397,"""Simply put, this was the lightest, most lively feeling, and even maybe one of the most fun 27.5+ bikes I have ridden to date."" "
6398,"Simply put, this was the lightest, most lively feeling, and even maybe one of the most fun 27.5+ bikes I have ridden to date. It has all the bump-leveling qualities and traction of a plus-bike without feeling like one. The unconventional approach of making a 27.5+ tire fit in a 27.5-inch bike, rather than a 29er like pretty much every other plus-size bike, seemed to pay off big time. There are some shortcomings (more on that later) but the result is an astoundingly good plus-size bike with snap and liveliness that put it in a class all by itself."
6399,
6400,
6401,"Everything about this bike, from suspension to handling, feels spot-on for a 130mm-travel trail bike. Climbing performance is great, with plenty of antisquat built into the system to prevent bob or movement while pedaling. The great suspension combined with the crazy traction of the plus-size tires meant technical climbs became much, much easier. Handling is stable, especially with the plus-size tires, but the bike also has an agile side that makes it easy to snap through tight turns."
6402,"Since the Mojo 3 can also be a regular 27.5-inch bike, I spent a day with it set up in that mode. Although it’s still a very good bike, I strongly preferred it with plus-size tires in every trail scenario I put it in. This surprised me; I tend to prefer normal 29er wheels about 70 percent of the time on 29er/27.5+ platforms. I attribute my preference of the plus-size wheels on this model to the use of 2.8-inch tires paired with the Ibis 741 rims with 35mm inner width: This gives the bike a setup that I like to call “plus light,” since there’s hardly any weight penalty for the extra traction and flotation. The Ibis rims create a shockingly good plus-size setup, especially with 2.8-inch tires, because they’re pretty light and wide enough for tire support at pressures as low as 12 PSI."
6403,
6404,
6405,"The only real downside to this bike is the fact that rear-tire clearance gets a little tight—a consequence of keeping the chainstay length this short. The Schwalbe Nobby Nic 2.8 tire clears just fine, but I did experience some rub on the upper linkage when bottoming out. It turns out the tires stretch a bit with use; I experimented with a new tire and found the Nobby Nics can grow up to 2.5mm in height. But, Ibis has since redesigned the upper link, so this has become a non-issue. "
6406,
6407,
6408,"I didn’t get the chance to ride the HD3 with the Boost-width rear end in plus mode, but I expect similar results and more tire clearance due to longer chainstays. The Mojo 3 is available now, with the Special Blend build coming available in June. Framesets retail for $2,999 and complete bikes start at $3,999 for the Special Blend build. The HD3 is available now. Framesets retail for $2,899, with complete bikes also starting at $3,999 for the Special Blend build with a XT 1x drivetrain. "
6409,We got a sneak peek at a prototype version at a recent launch
6410,"Long rumored, but not seen, Campagnolo has finally teased its disc brake. On the last day, at the last moment, of the launch of the brand’s new mid-range Potenza drivetrain, Campagnolo showed the assembled press their disc brake. But we could not ride it because it is not yet corretto. Campagnolo’s professional teams, however, will begin public testing of the brake soon."
6411,
6412,
6413,"Though they showed the disc brake, Campagnolo’s assembled representatives told us they would not be answering any tech questions. The brake they showed is not the final product. It is still under development, and could change significantly by the time it is ready for sale. They do not want any details of the prototype product to be confused with the final product’s."
6414,"There is no timeline Campagnolo is trying to meet; no targeted date for the brake to be in stores. “We will probably be the last to market,” admitted Lorenzo Taxis, Campangolo’s director of global marketing, “Our objective is not to be the first, but to bring the best.”"
6415,
6416,
6417,"But before it can be sold, it must be tested rigorously. Joshua Riddle, Campagnolo’s press manager explained, “When a product is proven to have professional race-winning performance, but it is also proven to maintain that performance over time, and if it can pass all of Campagnolo’s rigorous safety standards—because there isn’t a component on a bicycle that we make that isn’t a safety component—if we can surpass all that, then internally it is considered Campagnolo corretto,” said Riddle."
6418,     RELATED: Road Disc Brakes: Never Make These 5 Mistakes
6419,"The disc brake is not yet Campagnolo corretto, and until it is, it will—like Campagnolo's EPS before it—bear “Campagnolo Tech Lab” branding as it wends its way through the development process."
6420,
6421,
6422,"The only reason Mr. Riddle and Mr. Taxis showed the press the brake is because Campagnolo’s sponsored World Tour teams—Movistar, Astana, Lotto—had received samples and will begin publicly testing soon."
6423,"Oddly, when I asked Mr. Taxis if those teams had requested a disc brake, he said no—the push had come from the sponsors (I assume frame sponsors), but not team management or riders. I’m sure disc brake detractors will read plenty into that."
6424,
6425,
6426,"Until Campy’s disc brake gets closer to its final form, details are limited. Here is what I observed based on a close-up examination, and a quick lever squeeze:"
6427,"• Full hydraulic, with two piston calipers"
6428,"• The levers have extended hood peaks, similar to SRAM’s Hydro R,but are shorter and more curvaceous. The levers looked very polished and ready for production."
6429,
6430,
6431,"• The calipers were not as graceful as the levers, and looked further from production-ready. They have fixed hose entry, not adjustable banjos."
6432,• Versions for both mechanical and electronic shifting were displayed.
6433,• I saw both flat mount and post mount calipers.
6434,• I saw both 140mm and 160mm rotors. The rotors looked very similar to Magura’s Storm SL rotors.
6435,• At least two different hood-cover textures are being tested.
6436,
6437,
6438,"• The bikes were equipped with prototype disc-specific wheels. The rims looked to be based on the Bora 50 rim, but without a rim-brake track. Both front and rear wheels used Campagnolo’s G3 spoking pattern (rim brake wheelsets use G3 for the rear only). The rear hub was all aluminum, while the front hub had a carbon middle section; quick release and thru-axle versions were displayed. The six-bolt rotor mounting standard was used."
6439,"Campagnolo promises that once it is up to the company's standards, I will have an opportunity to ride the disc brake. I eagerly await Campagnolo’s next launch invitation. Hopefully, that’s the launch where I will ride the disc brake and tell you how it came to be, finally, corretto."

6443,"The Wahoo KICKR sees a redesigned frame that better integrates with today’s disc brake equipped bikes. The handle and frame have been repositioned and reshaped to better clear disc brake calipers with the flat-mount style of attachment. Additionally, Wahoo has completely redesigned the rear axle of the Kickr to work with all types of thru axles. The New design sees an update to a more robust axle that uses slide-in adaptors to fit bikes with both standard style QR (130 and 135mm) and 10x130, 12x135, 12x142 and boost 12x148 thru axles. This update makes the KICKR 17 compatible with almost all frames. It also decouples the frame from the trainer to allow it to work with the new CLIMB indoor trainer grade simulator."

6449,Currently the Climb only works with the Wahoo direct drive Kickr 17 and Wahoo Snap. The Climb wirelessly pairs with both these trainers and automatically adjusts for elevation or can be controlled via a remote on the top of the tower. On most direct drive trainers the rear axle of the bike is captured by the frame when its locked down to the trainer. This doesn't allow the bike to pivot as needed as the Climb raises or lowers the bike when simulating grades.

6456,"New bikes are launching fast and furious this time of year, and Scott is bringing a couple of new disc-equipped road bikes to popular categories. On the race side is a disc-equipped version of the 2016 Paris-Roubaix-winning Foil aero road bike. On the Endurance side, a new value-priced Addict that packs a sub-1000g carbon frame and disc brakes."
6457,
6458,
6459,"Joining the growing field of disc-brake aero road racing bikes is the 2018 Scott Foil Disc. This bike is two-thirds new: the main triangle is the same as the existing Foil for rim brakes, but with a new fork and rear triangle."
6460,"According to the information released in Scott's presentation, the company's frame-engineering team estimates that adding disc brakes to a bike incurs a three-watt penalty. Scott's product team wanted the Foil with disc brakes to be as slippery through the air as the Foil with rim brakes, so they set about finding ways to regain the lost three watts."
6461,RELATED: A Beginner's Guide to Disc Brakes
6462,"This led to details like shielding the front disc caliper with both a wider and deeper fork leg, and an extended tip on the drive-side fork dropout. Another drag-reducing trick: removable levers on the thru axles, and countersinking the front thru axle into the fork leg."
6463,
6464,
6465,"In the end, Scott’s representatives claimed they regained the three-watt disc-brake penalty."
6466,"Weight is another disc-brake penalty Scott sought to minimize with the Foil disc. A one-piece fork—without bonded-in dropouts, like Scott’s forks for rim brake bikes—with continuous fibers from dropout to steerer, allowed them to build a disc-brake fork that was just 15 grams heavier than the rim-brake Foil’s fork."
6467,"At the back, the rear triangle is molded as one piece, with hollow dropouts and no alloy inserts, which keeps the weight gain down to 25 grams compared to the rim-brake frame. (The claimed frame weight for a Foil Disc is 985 grams.)"
6468,
6469,
6470,"All told, the Foil Disc’s frame and fork is only 40 grams heavier than the Foil frame and fork for rim brakes."
6471,"That 40 grams is, if Scott’s information is to be believed, the only significant performance difference between the rim and disc versions of the Foil’s frameset. As discussed, aerodynamics are the same; representatives also claim bottom bracket and headtube stiffness are the same (the disc fork is laterally a bit stiffer); and compliance values are the same for both frames."
6472,There is another difference between the Foil Disc and Foil for rim brakes: the disc brake version can take larger tires: up to 30mm.
6473,
6474,
6475,"One clever detail we applaud: the frame has molded-in guides to help direct the wheels into place more easily, and faster. Another speed trick: the 12mm thru axles use a 1.5mm thread pitch so they unscrew more quickly than an axle with the more common 1.0mm pitch."

Consider how much water you’ll need: A two-liter reservoir is good for short trips, but you’ll want three or more on longer rides. Just remember that water is heavy—2.2 pounds per liter. If possible, try packs on with weights to see what riding with a load will feel like.Focus on fit
When trying on a pack, tighten the straps and make sure none chafe or bind. The bag should fit your torso’s length, and women should look for models with curved straps. Some new models use a triangular bladder that sits lower in the pack, which helps alleviate back pain.Bladder control?
Make sure the reservoir is easy to open and close and that the hose detaches. These features can simplify filling and loading the bladder. Also examine the bite valve. The best ones have a lock to shut off the flow of water so you won’t have any accidental drips.Key Features
1. Easy access: Pockets and other organizing features keep your essentials handy. You’ll want a hook to keep your keys secure, a padded pocket for your phone, and loops for a pump.
2. Ventilation: Look for models with ventilation channels—mesh fabric stretched over the back panel to let air flow between your back and the bag—to keep you cooler on warm rides.
3. Hose routing: On some packs, the hose can be routed over only one shoulder. Others let you run it on either side. Try both styles to see which you prefer."
6505,"Cane Creek has just released a new HELM Coil Fork, as well as some limited edition anodized brakes and a new ultra-low headset"
6506,"A long-time favorite among cyclists for their lightweight, quality components, Cane Creek has released three new products at this year’s Eurobike show. The HELM Coil 27.5, a coil-sprung suspension fork, a limited-edition color anodized version of their popular eeBrakes, and a new, premium headset, designed with a uniquely low stack height add new options to the Cane Creek line-up for riders. "
6507,Here's how to set the sag on your shock for a perfect ride:
6508,"When Cane Creek launched their HELM air sprung fork earlier this year, it surprised those who associate the brand more with its ubiquitous shocks and headsets. But Cane Creek has been in the fork game longer than many realize—the company introduced some of the first mountain bike forks in the 90s. With the HELM Coil 27.5 fork, Cane Creek offers trail riders a choice between coil and air suspension, depending on their preference and riding style. "
6509,"Why a coil? The development of lighter framesets for trail and enduro bikes has offered more freedom when it comes to component choices, and one consequence has been a revived interest in (generally heavier) coil spring suspension, especially for sustained, aggressive trails. On long descents, the oil in a shock can heat up and become less viscous, which will change the suspension progression. Coil shocks, which are suspended by a physical metal coil rather than oil and air pressure, offer more consistent performance and progression on punishing descents."
6510,RELATED: Cane Creek DBInline Coil Shock 
6511,"The HELM Coil 27.5 is adjustable, and provides a suspension range from 130mm to 160mm of travel. The fork’s compression rod is indexed to ensure riders get the travel they need. Changing the location of the spring perch requires no addition parts and provides riders with a customized travel profile. The HELM 27.5 coil fork will retail for $1,100 and is available at CaneCreek.com now. "
6512,
6513,
6514,"Cane Creek’s ultra-light eeBrakes have gained a following among weight-watching road riders. According to Cane Creek, the eeBrakes are half the weight of most competitors on the market at 82 grams for the front and 80 grams for the rear. "
6515,"For 2017, eeBrakes are being offered in a super-limited anodized blue-and-gold color. Cane Creek is calling it El Chulo—which can mean handsome or cocky, depending how you interpret it. The El Chulo eeBrakes will be available for two weeks only, from today until 15 September, so if they match that bike you're building, you'll have to act fast! They're compatible with tires up to 28mm, and levers from SRAM, Shimano and Campagnolo. They'll run you $325, but regularly retail for $315, which means the cool colors are only a $10 upgrade. "

6517,"Finally, Cane Creek's new ""Slamset"" headset aims to give riders a lower stack height by creating a slimmer headset assembly. The Slamset makes possible stack heights as low as 2mm, while still providing a sealed bearing and proper preload for the headset. This option will appeal to riders looking for the extra aerodynamics and responsive handling of a low position on the bike. "
6518,Cane Creek has also equipped the Slamset with their newly designed Hellbender bearing. The Hellbender is a heavy-duty stainless steel bearing that’s sealed against the elements. Cane Creek is confident the Hellbender will stand up to just about any conditions you may encounter on the bike. 
6519,"POC's Tectal Race, Octal X, and Coron Air helmets use a simple form of rotational impact protection"
6520,"Swedish company POC has made quite the name for itself in its short 10 years of existence. Having incorporated MIPS technology in their helmets previously, POC has now developed a new SPIN technology, their own system that the company has tested in the same Swedish test lab where MIPS was first developed. SPIN stands for “Shearing Pad Inside,” designed to provide similar (or better, according to POC) protection to MIPS against the effects of oblique or rotational impacts, which can cause brain injury."
6521,How to make a safe left turn in traffic and avoid a crash:
6522,"The SPIN system looks like MIPS, but it's actually less complex. Rather than using an elastomer-suspended structure that rotates upon impact, SPIN uses specially developed pads placed in critical locations in the helmet. Those pads shear or move in any direction to produce the same effect. Filled with medical-grade silicone, the pads also seem more comfortable than standard helmet pads."
6523,
6524,
6525,"The Tectal Race SPIN, Octal X SPIN trail and cross country helmets, along with the Coron Air SPIN, a downhill-certified, full-face helmet, are the first helmets in POC’s line to incorporate this technology. While the new pads are removable, and the new Tectal Race and Octal X helmet shells had very few changes from current models, the team at POC noted that older helmets cannot and should not be retrofitted with the new SPIN pads, because helmets must undergo testing with the appropriate pads in them to be certified and verified for safety."
6526,RELATED: The 17 Best Helmets of 2017
6527,"I was curious about the SPIN technology, and after getting one of the new helmets in my hands, I think that POC is on to something. The test numbers show equal or greater protection than MIPS, and the pads simply feel comfortable to the touch. Comfort, which has always been a strength of POC, has certainly been taken to an even higher level with the SPIN pads. While I haven’t had time riding in one of the new helmets yet, I am looking forward doing so."
6528,"Currently, pricing is listed as follows:"

6530,More travel and a burly build give this e-bike the power to tame aggressive trails without a shuttle
6531,"Specialized has been pushing boundaries since first diving head-first into the e-bike market with the original Turbo S several years ago. The Turbo was a great bike, and since its introduction, Specialized has invested heavily in bringing new designs and models out, each greatly refined from the one previous. Earlier this year, we saw the Turbo become more appropriate and functional for commuting with the introduction of the Turbo Vado. On the other end of the spectrum, the Turbo Levo (a knobby-tire dirt counterpart to the Vado), was unveiled. The latest creation to come out of Specialized’s Swiss e-bike engineering facility is the Levo Kenevo. Based on a pedal assist system rather than a throttle, as all Specialized’s e-bikes are, the Kenevo is the beefed-up version of the standard Levo, ready to tackle anything (as the name rightly implies). "
6532,Is riding an e-bike ride still a workout? Here's what we uncovered:
6533,
6534,
6535,"Looking at the bike, it’s obvious that it takes a lot of aesthetic cues from Specialized’s Enduro. The aluminum frame, although it looks nearly identical, has 180mm of travel front and rear, versus the Enduro’s 160mm of travel. There is an Ohlins TTX coil shock on the back of the bike and a Rockshox Lyrik up front. The Kenevo is designed around 27.5” wheels with clearance for up to 2.8” tires. It has similar geometry to the Enduro, with a few minor adjustments. Specialized’s new Command Post WU, also seen on the refined Enduro, is also spec’d on the bike. Currently, the bike is available in one model and costs $7,500."
6536,RELATED: Your E Bike Questions Answered
6537,"The Kenevo is compatible with almost all the same parts as the standard Levo, as far as the motor system is concerned. It uses the same motor, batteries, and mission control software as the Levo. This is a good thing, because the bike is more easily serviced and likely to be more accommodating of future updates—something Specialized seems to have been very conscious in the latest generation of the Turbo family."
6538,"What’s the purpose of an e-bike with 180mm of high-end suspension front and rear? The team at Specialized said that they’ve had a lot of requests for more aggressive, longer-travel bikes. E-bikes are still a highly debated topic in America with access and land management issues aplenty; in Europe, they’re catching on more rapidly. The Kenevo is a bike that can be ridden on mountain bike trails that would typically be accessed with a chairlift or shuttle vehicles, thus eliminating the need to use a chairlift or car to get to the top of terrain built for a more downhill- oriented bike. When I brought up the issue of trail access in America to the Specialized team, the answer was simple and made sense: “Just as you would when riding a non-e-assist mountain bike, don’t ride where you aren’t supposed to.”"
6539,
6540,
6541,"I spent a short amount of time on the Kenevo at Mountain Creek Resort in New Jersey. The bike was nearly as fast as the gondola in getting to the top of the mountain, and getting to the top under some of my own power (yes, assisted greatly by the bike) felt way better than it does to ride up on the lift. Descending, the bike rode exactly as I expect a long-travel trail or downhill bike should. It had a little extra heft, but that was quickly forgotten. At the bottom, it was seamless to raise the seat and pedal back up for another lap. No waiting in lift lines, no getting off the bike. It was a good and fun experience. As with the Turbo Levo, battery life is not as much of an issue as it has been in years past. I rode several laps, climbing a couple of thousand feet, and still had nearly half of the bike's battery life left."
6542,"The Kenevo is a lot of fun, there's no denying it. Used in an appropriate environment, there’s nothing else on the market that currently competes. It's a great option for eliminating the hassle of shuttling and riding lifts to access certain trails, and it opens another avenue to getting out and exploring places where e-bikes are allowed."
6543,"Easier battery installation, charging, and wireless connectivity"
6544,"Campagnolo’s EPS electronic groupsets are very good, but since the beginning, the Power Units—that's the battery to you and me—have had some quirks. Magnetic on/off switches, funky charging ports, somewhat cumbersome mounting formats—stuff that might frustrate riders unfamiliar with Campagnolo’s eccentricities. But to the company’s fans, it’s just Campy being Campy."
6545,"The third version of the EPS Power Unit, available soon, addresses most of those quirks and eccentricities and makes living with Campagnolo’s electronic drivetrain a little easier."
6546,
6547,
6548,"The V3 battery is round and slim; it easily fits inside seat posts or frame tubes, and can be secured with clips or plugs. This is an improvement on both the V2’s shorter, fatter, oblong housing and the V2 anchoring system, which consisted of special bolts that passed through the water bottle bosses and screwed into the battery’s housing."
6549,
6550,
6551,"Since Campy is Campy, each battery style has its own interface. The V3 Interface incorporates the charging port, much like Shimano’s Di2 junction box. Again, this is much more user-friendly than V2, which required a special hole drilled into the frame to locate the port. The V3 Interface is shaped more organically than V2, and is much more pleasing the eye."
6552,     RELATED: Campagnolo’s New Potenza Drivetrain
6553,"With the V3 Power Unit and Interface, Campagnolo has added some additional features to its electronic groupset. The V3 interface contains Bluetooth and ANT+ chips, allowing it to communicate with Garmin head units to display current gear and battery status, and smartphones through the MyCampy app."
6554,
6555,
6556,"MyCampy—which is free and available soon for iOS, Android, and eventually Windows Mobile—talks to the EPS drivetrain, and provides battery status and diagnostics, performs firmware updates, and lets the rider customize some shifting features. Additional features will be added in future versions of the app."
6557,Tuning options include:
6558,"• Soft, normal, or hard shifting, which alters the speed and force with which the derailleurs move."
6559,"• MultiShift, the number of cogs shifted when a paddle is held down, can be adjusted from one to ten cogs."
6560,"• MultiShift sensitivity, the delay before MultiShift is initiated, can be tuned."
6561,"• Shift assist: The rear derailleur automatically selects a new cog after a front derailleur shift is initiated by the rider to prevent large cadence changes. For example, if you’re in 50x23, and you drop into the 34, the rear derailleur, after a short delay, will drop three cogs to the 17. This feature can be enabled, or disabled."
6562,
6563,
6564,"• Controls: The shift levers can be reprogrammed to personal preference. Unlike Shimano Di2, the rider cannot customize the function of each button independently. Campagnolo provides six pre-set programs. Sprinter mode, for example, sets the shift levers behind the brake levers to control the rear derailleur, and the shift levers on the hoods to control the front derailleur. One-hand programs, for either right or left hand, employ the EPS mode buttons on the hoods to allow all shifting to be controlled from one side."
6565,
6566,
6567,"If customizing all of the above is too much for you, three factory preset modes—race, sport, comfort—incorporate all of the above parameters. Race, for example, provides the fastest shifting, MultiShift is enabled for 10 cogs with the shortest delay, and Shift Assist is turned off. This is the mode that EPS is set to when delivered from the factory."
6568,
6569,
6570,"Another feature of the app is called My Garage. This tracks the mileage of your bikes, and some individual components, and provides maintenance and service reminders. This feature works for SRAM and Shimano drivetrains in addition to Campagnolo. An unlimited number of bikes and wheelsets may be added to the garage."
6571,"The My Sessions feature takes information from My Garage, EPS shifting data, and combines it with Strava-like ride tracking. You start My Sessions at the beginning of a ride, and tell the app what bike and wheelset you’re riding—selected from the gear in My Garage—and it tracks the mileage on those parts. The app can also be paired with heart rate, cadence, and speed sensors, and records that data along with shift information."
6572,     RELATED: Campagnolo’s Much-Anticipated Disc Brake
6573,"When the ride is over, the ride is synced to the cloud, where it can be viewed with the MyCampy web app. It provides the usual analytics—speed, distance, elevation, power, cadence, heart rate—along with a high level of shifting information: how much time spent in a gear, when you shifted, etc."
6574,
6575,
6576,"MyCampy can also receive data from Garmin Connect, so if you prefer to use a Garmin GPS cycling computer to track your ride data, you can pull the data down into MyCampy after the ride. If you track your rides this way, and you still want to keep track of the mileage on your gear, you will need to select the bike and wheels you used in the MyCampy web app after the ride."
6577,"If you’re wondering about privacy, if you use MyCampy, Campagnolo does have access to your data, which it will use to aid product development, but insist will never be sold."
6578,"Everything is going to the smartphone, and soon enough, SRAM and Shimano will offer apps that integrate with their components. Campagnolo got there first, and offers riders with EPS customization of its drivetrain with unprecedented ease. The rest of the app’s features are less compelling, perhaps, but they provide deeper interaction with Campagnolo: interaction that goes both ways."

6587,"More and more riders are buying bicycles from beyond the bike shop. We lay out the process of direct-to-consumer sales, so you can determine if it's right for you. 
"
6588,"Buying a bike today can be as easy as clicking a button on a website. Direct-to-consumer online bike sales have been around for a few years, but with the recent entries of Trek and Giant into the digital storefront space, the option gained a certain level of legitimacy: Two of the biggest bikemakers in the world no longer rely exclusively on dealer networks to sell to retail customers. As such, online sales are expected to expand to more manufacturers, and become available to more people."
6589,"While some shoppers will still want the personal touch only a local dealer can offer, consumer-direct bike sales come in direct response to today's rapidly changing purchasing trends. A recent National Retail Federation survey found that the average American did 46 percent of their holiday shopping last year online, rather than in stores—and that’s not even considering the impact on regular spending from the rise of shopping and delivery services ranging from Amazon Prime to Instacart. "
6590,"“There’s an emerging consumer class that are digital natives,” says Trek spokesman Eric Bjorling. “Bike shops will still be pillars of community, but you’ll see more and more bikes sold online.”"
6591,"     RELATED: 9 Bike-Buying Questions, Answered"
6592,"In the US, the list of companies that sell complete bikes consumer-direct includes about 20 brands of varied size, with sales models that range from online-only with direct shipping to customers, to hybrid digital/physical models like Trek’s and Giant's (for example, you’ll still work with a local retailer for delivery and service)."
6593,"Buying online has benefits—chiefly, time savings. You aren’t bound to a retailer’s store hours, and you can make a purchase decision on your own time, and in the comfort of your home or workplace. “Two weeks ago, we sold a bike to a surgeon during his work day,” says Mark Lynskey, who founded Litespeed and now runs Lynskey Designs, a US-made online brand. “He started a chat, then stepped into surgery and once his assistant was able to take over, he came out and finished the conversation.”"
6594,"For a buyer who knows exactly what they wants, this can be an enticing option. That said, there are factors you’ll want to consider:"
6595,"How will you interact with the seller?
	You probably are already researching your purchase online, comparing models and prices from brand to brand. But what if you have questions that aren’t answered by the spec sheet? Most brands selling direct, as well as some online retailers, use online chat as a primary interaction. Other communication tools these brands are using include YouTube channels and the old favorites, FAQ pages and even 1-800 lines."
6596,"Chat is “the most effective tactic we have,” says Sharon Yu, general ganager for the American arm of German direct-to-consumer brand Bulls Bikes. “It’s been surprising to us how popular chat is,” says Bjorling. But in retrospect, maybe it’s not. Lynskey points out that a lot of bike brands have excellent web sites for showcasing product, but there’s zero opportunity for interaction or deeper learning. “I can’t ride-chat with them, I can’t understand the nuances, and so there’s an extreme disconnect,” he says. Worse, it’s a sales barrier: “If I get to a point where I want that bike, I have to go offline and make time to go down to a shop. Once you have a customer who wants your product, you have to give them the opportunity to click 'buy' so they can get on with their life.”"
6597,"     RELATED: 10 Bike Fit Myths, Busted"
6598,"How do you get the right size?
	Probably the top question asked in chat is, 'What’s the right size?' says sources we spoke with. The answers, and how they’re delivered, are broad. Bulls provides a size recommendation based on height and inseam, which is a common approach for online retailers. Trek encourages customers to visit a shop if they don’t know what size they need, but if they’re between sizes, chat can usually help them settle. “If someone doesn’t know what they need, we can walk them through it, like a shop would,” says Lynskey. “I appreciate people’s anxiety over this, but it’s extremely rare. It’s not even once a month that we get a return for the wrong size.”"
6599,"One option: Get a basic bike fit at a local shop, on your current bike. You’ll be supporting that shop, without the obligation to buy a new bike from them, but you’ll have comfort in knowing that you’re at least getting the right size frame."
6600,"How will you assemble the bike when it arrives?
	Things to consider: Will the bike be delivered directly to you, or to a partner shop? Will assembly be required? If so, how much? And will that require specialized tools, like a torque wrench? As with size, answers vary. Trek ships to shop partners who handle the build and deliver a ready-to-ride bike. Other companies ship directly to you. A few online sellers use the AirCaddy boxes that reduce user assembly to simply attaching the front wheel, setting seat height, and maybe spinning on pedals. Shipping costs more, but the bikes are professionally built and prepped prior to shipping, so you’ll be ready to ride within moments of opening the box. "
6601,"Most brands use standard bike boxes, which require slightly more assembly. The most important thing to investigate in these cases is what happens to bikes before reaching those boxes."
6602,"Some companies, like Lynskey, have employees professionally assemble and prep every bike—even ride-testing briefly to ensure everything’s properly adjusted. Then, the bike is minimally disassembled for shipping. Home assembly amounts to installing the handlebars and pedals, attaching the front wheel, and inserting the seatpost; it takes only a few minutes."
6603,"But if a bike is shipped direct-to-consumer from the factory, where assembly quality control varies, it can include more complicated tuning, like adjusting derailleurs or installing brake cables. If you’re buying a more expensive bike, chances are that some of the fasteners (like stem bolts) have torque ratings. Neglect to use a torque wrench during assembly, and any failures might not be the seller’s responsibility."
6604,"It’s never a problem to take a bike to a shop for professional final assembly and quality checking, but make sure you know what you’re getting before you click buy, and the resources you'll have afterward: Assembly instructions range from simple manuals to YouTube channel videos with step-by-step demonstrations."
6605,     RELATED: 29 Bike Shops You Must Visit
6606,"What if you have a problem, or need warranty help?
	If your bike is coming consumer-direct, don’t let your excitement carry you away when it arrives. Check the box for obvious signs of tampering or damage, like an errant disc rotor or rear derailleur poking through a hole. Often, matters of shipping damage are between the recipient and delivery service, but notify both the seller and the shipper immediately. Shipping damage is pretty rare: If the bike is properly packed, even a standard cardboard shipping box will protect your new ride."
6607,"And before purchasing, you of course checked out the warranty, right? This is essential for consumer-direct brands that don’t have local retailers handling warranty claims. The seller should always be your first stop for a warranty issue. A branded part like, say, a suspension fork, can be warrantied direct to that company, but the bike seller is the first point of contact for determining where you need to go. For any house-brand or unbranded parts, the seller is your only contact. Make sure to get a return authorization number and shipping label, and follow up if you haven’t heard anything after 10 business days. You should at least get a notification that the claim is in process."
6608,"“We get a lot of questions about returns,” says Yu. “Our policy is very straightforward: We stand behind everything we sell.” That’s consistent with other brands we spoke with. But read the return policy carefully because terms vary from company to company. Bulls, for instance, offers a replacement/refund within 15 days of purchase on unused equipment—you can take it for a parking lot test ride, but not much more. Lynskey offers a generous policy: “You’ve got 45 days to evaluate your bike and if you don’t like it, you can exchange it or parts, or send it back for a refund,” Lynskey says. Don’t abuse the bike, but you can ride it normally. "
6609,"Where will you get the bike serviced?
	Any professional bike shop can work on pretty much any bike. And some online brands, like Lynskey, have a hybrid shop model where a local retailer gets credit for a sale in their area (Trek’s system is similar). That gives you a ready-made service option."
6610,"Without that shop relationship, some buyers feel uneasy bringing a brand known for online sales into a shop for service. Our simple advice: Don’t be. A professional shop will work on almost any bike unless the part in question is ruined, and shouldn’t make you feel bad about buying online. "
6611,"Retail is changing dramatically. Trek’s Bjorling predicts that even five years from now, most bikes will still be sold in physical stores, but he admits that as people become more and more comfortable buying things online, the shop model will have to change. “Service is going to be the biggest opportunity in the coming years,” he says. “That’s a point of differentiation for brands and it’s going to come down to what level of service a retailer can provide.”"
6612,"A looming example: the rise of mobile bike shop franchises like VeloFix and Beeline. Some franchises will be independent, but it’s worth noting that Backcountry.com, which owns online retailer Competitive Cyclist, recently invested in Beeline. That’s a perfect service model to support its online sales, and positions it ideally to become a US sales agent for European customer-direct brands that don’t have operations here."
6613,     RELATED: How to Get the Best Deal on a Bike
6614,"Who are you as a buyer and what’s right for you?
	Online buyers span a broad range. Trek’s Bjorling said that some of the most popular models have been kids bikes, since all color options are available online and might not be in local stores. On the other hand, Lynskey says his customers are experienced, knowledgeable cyclists who know exactly what they want and have no trouble clicking “Buy” on a $6,000 purchase."
6615,"Ultimately, it’ll come down to your cycling comfort level. Lynskey says that his overriding service philosophy is to make the customer happy. Even when customers return products, they’re satisfied by the experience. But if you have reservations that you can’t set aside, don’t force it; a good bike shop can help guide every step of your purchase and, as Bjorling noted, is a community resource in a way that no online seller can be."
6616,"While no one thinks that bike shops are going away, their role will evolve as riders get more comfortable buying online. “I think if you’re not doing something along the lines of what we’re doing, you’re getting ready to die a slow death,” predicts Lynskey. “It’s a digital world, and that’s increasing exponentially.”"

Road Plus wasn’t even a thing back then, but the fact that it also fits the newer high volume treads was just one of the many reasons we gave this great-riding, versatile bike our coveted Editors’ Choice award.

Both the frame and fork now feature flat-style brake mounts as well. Other upgrades include new hardware, such as superlight carbon-ti axles.

6624,"The old-world values that define the component maker Campagnolo make it so beloved by the faithful that they describe it as a soul instead of a brand.
"
6625,"This is a fable about emotion, but it starts as a business story. For the past half century the Italian component maker Campagnolo and its chief competitor, the Japanese conglomerate Shimano, have gone toe-to-toe in one of the great rivalries not just of the cycling world but of the entire business world. The elements intrigue those who study such things: Despite their near-comic contrast in size—Shimano's bicycle-division sales were $2.1 billion last year, Campagnolo's around $150 million—the companies have considered each the other's greatest foe. Over the years, the spirit of that rivalry infected their customers. Road cyclists can be passionate about their choice of components, but none are more notoriously passionate than Campy freaks. They wax eloquently about the curves and swooping lines of new components, create personal museums of old parts, can be stunned into silence and immobility by the sight of a complete boxed Campy tool set.
	Campagnolo traditionally had been seen as owning the top 1 percent of the cycling market, the high-end professional and custom-build customer, while Shimano was considered to dominate OEM (original equipment manufacturer)—its components, ubiquitous on mass-production bikes made by major players, at times have been found on as many as 70 percent of all bikes made.
	Campagnolo was also traditionally acknowledged as the choice of champions. Eddy Merckx rode only Campy. Bernard Hinault rode Campy to all five of his Tour de France victories. So did Miguel Indurain. Of course the Italian champions Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi rode Campy. But the last Tour winner to ride a Campagnolo gruppo under the Arc de Triumph was Italy's Marco Pantani in 1998. (The inevitable asterisk of modern sports: Oscar Pereiro, who was declared the 2006 winner after a failed drug test negated Floyd Landis's victory, rode Campagnolo.) Lance Armstrong won seven yellow jerseys on Shimano gear. When he retired in 2005, many insiders assumed Campagnolo would do whatever it took to make sure the next winner was on its componentry. But Shimano won in 2007 and 2008. Then things became really bleak for Campy: The upstart SRAM stole the crown. A Chicago company that found its first success by selling handlebar shifters for mountain bikes in the 1980s, SRAM didn't put out its first road-bike group until 2005. But just four years later, in 2009, Spain's Alberto Contador won the Tour on the company's top groupset, Red. Contador and SRAM won again in 2010, before Shimano took over again in 2011, under Cadel Evans.
	Campy's problems aren't limited to the Tour de France podium. Today's younger generation of riders generally assume they can't afford Campagnolo's gear and aren't impressed with its historic pedigree. Older, more affluent riders still covet the brand's cachet, but, as one industry insider observes: ""When all of us 50-year-old guys with $6,000 bikes get too old, fat, and lazy, what are they going to do?""
	The rise of SRAM cuts to the heart of Campagnolo's dilemma. When SRAM introduced its first road-bike groupset six years ago, Campagnolo ignored the American upstart. That was a mistake. Nimble and smart, SRAM rose quickly to challenge the Shimano-Campagnolo duopoly. SRAM's engineers developed new products quickly and outsourced production to factories that could make the products at a lower cost. When I asked Michael Zellman, SRAM's global marketing manager, if I could stop by and see the Chicago factory, he said, ""Sure, but there's not much here to see. We manufacture in 15 locations all over the world."""
6626,
6627,
6628,"It wasn't hard to be impressed by Campagnolo's operation. The airy manufacturing complex could house a fleet of 747s, but it's not driven by an assembly-line mindset. Campagnolo's machinists ply their craft at autonomous tooling stations. Components are dropped into small-batch metal bins the size of laundry baskets, which are then hand-wheeled to the next station. The factory floor was clean enough to lick.
	Piazza guided me to a progressive stamping die, a 30-foot monster that sent out a shuddering whump! every two seconds. It felt and sounded like the company's beating heart. I watched as steel tape was fed into one end. Newborn Campagnolo Super Record cogs emerged from the other. A machinist in blue coveralls picked a random cog and held it to his eye like a diamond cutter. There are almost no traditional assembly lines at the Campagnolo factory. Each machinist works like an artisan. There's a bit of the Renaissance guild about the place. Which is no coincidence; the artisan-guild concept was created just a few hours south of here, in Florence, in the 12th century."
6629,
6630,"Campagnolo expanded into other components, establishing a reputation for innovation and unsurpassed quality. Tullio, a broad bull of a man with a powerful voice and piercing gaze, worked closely with top pro riders and with frame builders in the artisan towns of northern Italy: Faliero Masi, Edoardo Bianchi, and Ernesto Colnago. For a 30-year stretch—from 1968 to 1998— Campagnolo dominated the pro peloton. In the Tour de France, 27 of 31 winners rode Campy. In the Giro d'Italia, Campy won 26 of 31 titles."
6631,"The company's DNA was established during those years. Tullio never wanted the mass market. His heart and soul were in the high-end stuff, the pro gear. During the bike boom of the 1970s, when every family in America kept a quiver of Schwinns in the garage, Campagnolo refused to expand to meet low-end demand."
6632,"""I went over to Vicenza to work with Tullio on developing some Schwinn pedals in 1973,"" recalled Jay Townley, a bicycle-industryconsultant who worked for Schwinn during the boom years. ""The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was making manufacturers add pedal reflectors for safety. I showed Tullio a reflector we could put in the openings of those old rat-trap pedals. He looked at the pedal, frowned, and said 'Brutto! Brutto!'"" Ugly! Ugly!"
6633,
6634,
6635,"
	Crude design offended the old man. Campagnolo's designers strove for elegance in the engineering sense of the word: Finding the simplest, lightest, most efficient solution to the problem of human-powered propulsion. Given a choice between his own beliefs and the fortune to be made in the mass market, Tullio turned his back on the fortune. By the end of the 1970s, Campagnolo had abandoned all but the pro racing and very top luxury portion of the specialty retail market to Shimano and Suntour, Japanese companies that were happy to scale up production to meet the demand for less expensive chains, sprockets, and derailleurs."
6636,"That refusal to compromise quality moved Campagnolo from a company to a cause. Some call it a cult. It's a symbol of old-world artisan craftsmanship, a refusal to compromise twinned with manly know-how, seasoned with a tinkerer's curiosity and a dash of machismo. The classic film Breaking Away captured the mystique in the character of Dave Stohler, a blue-collar Indiana kid enthralled by Italian cycling culture. His pride and joy was a Masi road bike equipped with Campagnolo gear."
6637,"Lorenzo Taxis, Campagnolo's global marketing manager, described the power of the Campagnolo name: ""It is a soul,"" he said. ""It is a soul contained by a brand."""
6638,"That's a heavy burden. Perhaps that's why, long after Campagnolo must have realized there was a market for electronic shifting, it continued to refine its product in those secret rooms while Shimano offered its version for sale. At Campagnolo, there is a sense that the company must weigh each product against the culture of cycling itself. ""We must ask whether this product is notdemocratic, let's say,"" Lerrj Piazza told me. ""It is a social thing. It's not logical to put a product on the market which is not touchable by the people"" because of its high price."
6639,"There's also the risk of putting the Campagnolo imprimatur on a product that could pollute the purity of cycling. Officials in Vicenza are mum on this point, but at least one competitor is also struggling with the issue. Earlier this year officials at SRAM (which has no electronic shifter on the market) asked an ad agency to find a way to turn the absence of such a product to the company's advantage. The essence of cycling, a SRAM official wrote to the ad shop, ""has always been about the 'Culture of Mechanical'—a.k.a. the raw, tactile connection of the human animal to a beautiful, efficient, analog machine."" Using a battery to power an essential part of the experience, the memo said, ""just isn't right."""
6640,"Campy must balance such fidelity to old-school principles with its need to stay cutting edge. ""If you lose the quality and the innovation,"" Piazza told me, ""you lose the love for the brand."""
6641,"There's no nameplate outside Valentino Campagnolo's office. Tullio's son, who took over the company at age 35 when his father died in 1983, can be found by entering an unmarked door that leads to a spare conference room. Before going to Vicenza I'd asked an American bike-shop owner for his impressions of the great signore. ""Valentino, he's, well, he's a little strange,"" the retailer said."
6642,"Valentino Campagnolo emerged from behind a plain wooden door, a thin, reserved, 63-year-old man dressed in slacks and a blue-striped dress shirt, with a bit of a Christopher Walken vibe. He moved slowly and deliberately, almost as if purposefully opposite the image that still endures of his bulldog old man."
6643,"When I asked about the company's decision to stay in Italy while the world decamped to Asia, Campagnolo offered a frank answer. ""It was a forced decision,"" he told me. When he took over the company in 1983, he said, ""I didn't have any special strategy. I didn't have any special management skills in how to handle the company outside of Italy."""
6644,
6645,
6646,"
	There's deep history behind this cryptic answer—and some insight into Campagnolo's willingness to trade high Italian labor costs for the knowledge. Valentino inherited the company two years after the opening of the massive new Vicenza factory, which was old man Tullio's way of doubling down on Italy. In the early 1980s, Tullio and Valentinowatched as Schwinn, then the world's leading bicycle manufacturer, closed its Chicago factories and moved production to Taiwan. An industry exodus ensued. ""The bicycle industry has a history of chasing cheap labor,"" said the former Specialized executive Gary Coffrin. ""The industry migrated to Taiwan in the 1980s, and then to China in the 1990s."""
6647,"Everything was fine at first. Schwinn's profit margin thrived on low-cost Asian labor. But in 1985, Schwinn ended its arrangement with its Taiwanese production partner, a company called Giant Manufacturing. What happened next is a lesson that Valentino Campagnolo has never forgotten. Giant turned around and used its newfound manufacturing expertise to produce bikes under its own brand that were better and cheaper than Schwinn's. Though Schwinn bounced back several times, ultimately it never recovered and, by 1992, was bankrupt."
6648,"""We do everything inside the company,"" Valentino Campagnolo told me. ""This is something in which I strongly believe. If I know how to produce it, I can always improve my performance. If somebody else is doing it, my improvements are out of my control. This is a very strategic decision for us."""
6649,Technology transfer—some would call it idea theft—is a concern in cycling just as it is in any industry that outsources. Imagine the electronic development room deep inside Campagnolo that Piazza wouldn't even allow me a peek into—but situated thousands of miles away from those who care most about its integrity.
6650,"Security, proximity, and low labor costs spurred Campagnolo to open its first satellite factory in 2005 in Piteti, Romania, an industrial city in the center of the old Iron Curtain stronghold. Managers and engineers from Vicenza can drive to the plant in a day. Manufacturing wages aren't China-cheap, but they're low, about $14,000 a year. Italy's strong metalworkers' union doesn't include Romanian workers, so Campagnolo can hire and fire more easily. Perhaps most crucially, it's in Romania—a country famous for a man who drank blood and another whose name included the phrase ""the impaler."" Its remote location and spooky cultural reputation act as their own barriers to technology transfer."
6651,"""We first develop new products and methods of manufacturing in Vicenza,"" Valentino Campagnolo explained to me. ""And when it has been perfected, then we can bring that activity to Romania. We have exactly the same machines, equipment, and methods in Romania and Vicenza."" The company has made huge investments in carbon-fiber components. ""We didn't want to take any risk by putting these components in the hands of somebody else,"" Campagnolo told me. ""They require a high degree of human labor, and we wanted to keep everything inside the company."" So the company perfects a manufacturing process with its longtime, highly skilled craftsmen in Vicenza, then teaches the intricacies to its employees in Romania."
6652,"""I think this was a big mistake that some Italian companies have made,"" Piazza told me. ""They chose to produce in the Far East, and they spread their knowledge. In the Far East, they produce a good product, but the innovation in Europe is different. If you take your knowledge elsewhere, it's a big risk."""
6653,"Campagnolo can be called a lot of names. Stodgy. Insular. Arrogant. But nobody has ever called the company cheap or stupid. As bicycle-industry veterans wonder how long the company can survive, some of the world's top economists and business strategists are taking a fresh look at the Campagnolo-style business model and finding it newly appealing. A combination of outsourcing fatigue (those long flights to Shenzhen for quality control take their toll), rising labor and transportation costs, and the let's-rethink-this mindset of the recession have dampened the business world's enthusiasm for Asian manufacturing."
6654,
6655,
6656,"
	One key is to understand that Campagnolo is a commodities company. It's specialized and high-end, like an airplane manufacturer or a medical-device maker. Product failure is not an option. Quality is all."
6657,"""In high-end, small-batch manufacturing, where you're making very exacting high-quality products, labor costs aren't your major concern,"" says Kathryn Shaw, PhD, a Stanford University economics professor who studies the expense of manufacturing. ""The main costs are in product design, which you need to stay on the cutting edge."" A company like Campagnolo, she says, ""is investing heavily in brand value. That's one of their major assets. Maintaining that brand is part of the cost of doing business."""
6658,"A high-end company that dilutes its brand value by chasing cheap labor, she says, does so at its peril."
6659,"The airplane giant Boeing recently learned this lesson the hard way. In the early 2000s the company went full-throttle into outsourcing, pulling parts for its highly touted 787 Dreamliner from around the world: wings from Japan, floor beams from India, passenger doors and landing gear from France and Sweden, parts of the tail from South Korea and Italy. The whole thing would be assembled in Boeing's factory in Everett, Washington."
6660,"Ten years later, a humbled Boeing has done an outsourcing about-face. The 787, finally set for release this year, has been dogged by years of delays and quality-control issues. The outsourced subs simply couldn't come through with top-quality parts on deadline. Engineers and machinists making, say, a wing and fuselage that had to match exactly couldn't correct problems by walking across the factory floor and talking. They had to sync time zones, catch overseas flights, overcome language and culture barriers, wait weeks for a corrected batch of parts to arrive. ""We spent a lot more money in trying to recover than we ever would have spent if we'd tried to keep the key technologies closer to home,"" Boeing CEO Jim Albaugh said in an interview earlier this year."
6661,"Quality control and technology transfer have always been problems with outsourcing, but cheap labor and transport made up for those deficiencies. Now, the economics are shifting. Labor costs, for instance, though still low, are rising. The average Chinese production worker made $1,740 a year in 2003. In 2008, that same worker made $4,140. ""After factoring in the higher labor and freight costs, we find that the former offshore savings have turned negative,"" a team of McKinsey & Company consultants concluded in a recent report titled ""Time to Rethink Offshoring."""
6662,"Campagnolo's strategy makes sense on another level. Phin Upham, PhD, a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, recently published a study of outsourcing in the bicycle industry. ""Most people think you can outsource manufacturing and keep marketing and research and- development in house,"" he said. ""It doesn't work like that. It's almost impossible to have effective R&D without also being involved in the day-to-day manufacturing. R&D isn't about a group of smart people sitting in a room thinking deeply about a new bicycle wheel. It's a result of being so immersed in the details that you find a way to weld something a half-percent better."" Staying close to the ground has its value, too. Upham pointed out that years after Giant ate Schwinn's lunch, the Taiwanese company established a facility in the Netherlands—partly to put its people in touch with new developments in European cycling."
6663,"Manufacturing at the highest-quality level, Upham says, ""is not a dumb thing to do."" It requires skills that are difficult to attain and aren't easily scalable. If the demand for Campagnolo'stop-level $2,500 carbon-fiber groupset, the Super Record, exploded tenfold, the company couldn't simply hire 10 times as many skilled machinists and ramp up production. Those machinists don't exist. ""Highly qualified machinists know their worth,"" says Upham, ""and they won't sell their labor cheap."""
6664,"Campagnolo executives have been known to go to extremes to defend the knowledge and the sanctity of the company's brand. At a certain point, you wonder whether this obsession has something to do with their current slippage in the market. Case in point. In the company's executive offices, I chatted briefly with Lorenzo Taxis, the company's group marketing and communication director. A substantial man with ginger hair, Taxis wore a fine Italian vested suit and carried himself with the aspect of a duke. I mentioned that I hailed from Seattle."
6665,"""Very nice city,"" he said. ""I recently spent some time there."""
6666,"I wondered why a guy from Campagnolo would spend time in Seattle, so I threw out a guess. ""Were you there on a patent issue?"""
6667,"Taxis paused. ""Something like that,"" he said, then ended our conversation."
6668,"A little research solved the mystery. In 2007, the component company FSA ran a series of ads in cycling magazines (including this one) in which it claimed to make the world's lightest crankset: 633 grams, compared with the Super Record crankset, which weighed 652 grams."
6669,"Campy engineers spend entire careers developing ever lighter and stronger gruppos. The company spent years developing its carbon-fiber technology. Its officials like to say its carbon fiber is more precious than gold. And now the U.S. branch of FSA—based in Mukilteo, Washington, a sleepy town north of Seattle—was claiming its cranks were better?"
6670,"In Vicenza, umbrage was taken. Campagnolo flew its lawyers to Seattle to launch a federal lawsuit for false advertising."
6671,"""We were shocked,"" said Matt VanEnkevort, managing director of FSA USA. ""We could have handled this out of court. But we had zero conversation before they filed."""
6672,"These kinds of suits are usually settled quietly, especially with a small player like FSA USA. ""We're not even in Campagnolo's weight class,"" VanEnkevort told me. FSA's annual American sales hover around $10 million, about 7 percent of Campagnolo's worldwide revenues. But the lessons of history are remembered in Vicenza. Campagnolo paid dearly for ignoring SRAM in 2005, and would not overlook another challenge, no matter how small. In this instance, we're talking about a difference in components of 19 grams. Find a very small egg. Boil it. Cut it in the middle and discard one half. The tiny bit that remains in your palm is about 19 grams."
6673,"During the two-week trial last summer, Campagnolo's attorneys grilled FSA's VanEnkevort about the methods used to compare the weights. By the time his testimony concluded, it was fairly clear that FSA had fudged a little on its weight comparison. But that wasn't the end of the case."
6674,"When he took the witness stand, Campagnolo's Taxis spoke about the brand equity he'd traveled halfway around the globe to defend. ""It's very easy to lose the image"" that Campagnolo has established, Taxis said. ""It's very hard to recuperate it."" If FSA ran 18 pages, he said, ""we need to run at least three times as many"" to recover."
6675,"FSA's lawyers threw a little cold reality on Taxis, though. ""Do you know who Lance Armstrong is?"" one asked."
6676,"""Yes, I do,"" Taxis answered."
6677,"""He won the Tour de France seven years in a row, didn't he?"""
6678,"""Correct."""
6679,"""He's never used a Campagnolo product, has he?"""
6680,"""No."""
6681,"""He uses Shimano and he uses SRAM for his groupsets, his crankset, and his racing parts, correct?"""
6682,"""Correct."""
6683,"""Campagnolo parts don't make any bikes go faster than a competitor, do they?"""
6684,"""No."""
6685,"As FSA's attorney continued to needle Taxis about Campagnolo's lack of recent Tour success, Campagnolo's lawyer objected: What's the relevance here?"
6686,"""The testimony was from Mr. Taxis that Campagnolo is leading in innovation, and Full Speed Ahead is trying to piggyback on their reputation,"" FSA's lawyer explained. ""I think the jury should understand that Campagnolo, to the cycling world, is not quite as painted."""
6687,"Campagnolo's claim was denied. The Italian company appealed the case, despite expensive legal bills and long odds. (False advertising claims are difficult to prove. To succeed, Campagnolo would have to show that the ads actually converted its buyers into FSA buyers.) The verdict was eventually affirmed."
6688,"Campagnolo officials declined to comment on the litigation. At FSA's Mukilteo headquarters—a warehouse and a tidy suite of offices staffed by young dudes and their dogs—Van Enkevort says, ""I can't help but feel this was a vendetta against us for having the gall to compare our product to Campagnolo's. I have a feeling Valentino saw those ads and got very upset."""
6689,"The number of riders, bike-shop owners, and industry insiders who profess a love for Campagnolo are legion. Losing Campagnolo, they say, would be like the computer industry losing Apple. Or the auto industry without Porsche. An executive who was with FSA at the time it was being sued told me, ""I sure hope Campagnolo survives."""
6690,"Peter Chisholm, owner of the high-end Vecchio's Bicicletteria, is one of the deans of the cycling scene in Boulder, Colorado. He's also a prime example of the kind of loyalty Campagnolo can count on. ""I would rather walk than ride anything other than Campagnolo,"" Chisholm told me when I strolled into his store recently. He hiked up the sleeve on his Italian sweater to reveal a Campagnolo winged wheel tattooed on his forearm."
6691,"""When I got into cycling in 1985, if you were a serious cyclist you used Campagnolo, period,"" he said. ""It's still the premium componentry. It's the best in form, function, durability, and maintainability."""
6692,"Vecchio's deals in high-end custom bikes, the $6,000-and-up models that begin with a custom frame fitting. ""If my customers take all that time and effort to build the right bicycle, they're not going to skimp on components. They want the best. They want the Rolex, not the Casio."""
6693,
6694,"Findley is the prototypical rider all three high-end component makers—Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo—are courting. A 37-year-old college professor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Findley commutes to work, competes in Tuesday-night ""hammer rides,"" and tackles a century now and then. If this were an election, Sam Findley would be the undecided voter in a swing state."
6695,"""I'm trying to get the best bang for the buck,"" Findley told me. As a teenager he rode his father's road bike: ""A classic Bianchi with a group of perfect Campagnolo diamonds."" As a penny-pinching college student he rode what he could afford: a Schwinn Prologue with Shimano gear. Now in his thirties, he's got a little coin in his pocket. He's riding a Cannondale with SRAM Rival components."
6696,"Why SRAM? ""It's lighter than what I could otherwise get for my money, and the bike shop guys were really good about pointing that out. They like it and ride it,"" Findley said. ""I've done a few races where SRAM provided neutral support, which I liked. And, frankly, Campagnolo parts weren't stocked locally. I could get a Campy group, but if the bearings went out I'd have to wait a week or two to get the parts shipped."""
6697,"Tom Kattus is the man charged with winning Sam Findley's allegiance. Kattus, 48, has one of the toughest jobs in the American cycling industry: He's the general manager of Campagnolo North America. It sounds like he commands an empire, but in truth Kattus has exactly five full-time employees. Five. They work out of a small office suite in Carlsbad, California. And they're the second-largest subsidiary of Campagnolo worldwide."
6698,"Kattus is a realistic man. ""The younger crowd saw Lance win seven Tours on Shimano,"" he told me. ""They just saw SRAM win the Tour, and SRAM has done an excellent job of marketing to the younger generation. Younger American riders haven't seen Campagnolo out there. Plus we have this stigma that we're very high-priced, almost out of reach."""
6699,"As a former Cannondale manager, Kattus knows how to fight in the retail trenches. ""We're outgunned in North America, we have limited resources, so we have to be creative. We have to take a grassroots approach. But we're willing to push it and go for it."""
6700,"One of Kattus's first initiatives is an industry discount program that gives employees of bike shops that carry Campy a reduced price—a perk the company had not offered in the United States. A lot of road-bike buyers like Sam Findley seek advice from the guys in the repair shop. And if the techs don't like Campy, the sale goes to SRAM or Shimano. ""Our first prerogative is to get shop employees to understand Campagnolo—to get them on the bikes, get them riding the gear,"" Kattus said."
6701,"Sometimes it seems like Campy's innovation and arrogance go hand in hand. And the latter can trip up the former. Last year the company introduced the Super Record groupset, which included the world's first 11-speed cassette and a thinner, stronger chain. By most accounts, the gear is stellar. Cycling News readers voted it Best New Product of 2010. But fixing the new chain required a special, $299 tool—the most expensive chain tool ever produced. If you ask a bike mechanic making $12 an hour what he thinks of the new 11-speed gruppo, prepare to get an earful about the chain tool."
6702,"""Kattus is a very smart guy,"" said Rick Vosper, a longtime bike-industry consultant now working as the director of Airborne Bicycles. ""He knows who to go after: the key influencers. The hot young rider in town, who's often an employee of the bike shop. If I'm selling those components, I want the fastest guy in the club, the sharpest guy in the shop. Those guys are going to change people's minds about which components to buy for your next bike."""
6703,"Part of Kattus's challenge is overcoming the perception that Campagnolo simply doesn't care about North American riders. The United States represents only 14 percent of the company's sales, and while Kattus scrambles to cover the country with a staff of five, SRAM continues to saturate American shops and races with its reps. ""We ensure that racers, shop owners, consumers, everybody has a point of contact with SRAM,"" said Michael Zellman, SRAM's global marketing manager. ""It's in our company DNA. SRAM started with Stan Day and Mike Mercuri traveling around in a car, pulling parts out of their trunk, asking riders to give it a try. We've always been there at the races."""
6704,"That is, of course, a page right out of the Campagnolo playbook. It's how Tullio Campagnolo established his Tour- winning gruppos 40 years ago. And it may be a piece of knowledge that the cardinals at the Vatican in Vicenza have forgotten."
6705,"Campagnolo has never wanted wealth or world domination. That goes for the family as it does the company. It could have ramped up for the Schwinn boom of the 1970s, sold its components on the cheap. It chose not to. The company could have chased low-cost labor in Taiwan in the 1980s, expanded to China in the 1990s, gone completely global in the 2000s. Instead, Campagnolo hunkered down in Italy. Valentino could have sold the company or gone public. He stubbornly kept it in the family."
6706,"This is a very Italian way to operate. More specifically, it's the northern Italian way. Vicenza and the larger Veneto region are famous for nurturing artisanal manufacturers like Campagnolo. Luxottica, which produces Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, is headquartered nearby. A few miles away, the Zamberlan family produces some of the world's finest hiking boots. Diesel and Benetton are based in the region. Bottega Veneta, one of the world's elite fashion brands, produces its famous handbags at a factory that's literally across the street from Campy."
6707,"These companies survive by targeting the highest strata of the market. It's the opposite of the economic model that dominates in the United States right now, which is to use cheap labor and scorched-earth tactics to gain massive market share. And it goes against the American exit strategy: selling out to reap a fortune."
6708,"At Campagnolo, there is no exit strategy. There is only, in the words of Lorenzo Taxis, the soul that is contained within the brand. It's almost a fairy tale. What if there was a company that didn't want to take over the world? What if there was a company that just wanted to make the best products it could possibly invent, and be satisfied with a little profit at the end of the day? The company wouldn't betray its customers. It would be beholden to no craven shareholders or institutional investors. Perhaps most critically, the company would learn from history, value its institutional memory, and cultivate creativity on the factory floor. That is Campagnolo and the knowledge."
6709,"The hitch in this scenario is that Campagnolo may now be a prisoner of its own fairy tale. Competitors like SRAM and FSA are young. They can become anything, take risks, grow in any direction. Campagnolo does not have such freedom."
6710,"One final story. In the mid-1980s, just after Valentino took over, Campagnolo experienced a series of stumbles. In 1984 the company released its Delta brake, which featured a revolutionary triangular design. Still considered by many cycling design aficionados to be the most beautiful brake ever made, the Delta looks like it should be on display in the Museum of Modern Art. It was Campagnolo's bid to leap ahead of Shimano, which had begun to challenge the Italian company in the high-end market. But Campy allowed form to outrun function. The Delta was heavy (all that beautiful steel) and lacked modulation—it gripped too forcefully, in the opinion of many riders."
6711,"Valentino learned a tough lesson, one that stays with him today. Sitting at a table in Vicenza, I asked him about the company's reputation for producing beautiful products.
	He bristled.
	""Below our logo is written 'Pure Performance,'"" he told me. ""That is there to underline the biggest part of our activity. Our focus is first on technical performance. Then development becomes a question of cost. Only at the very end, the final choices are addressed to allow the product to be nicer. This is the very last step. It cannot be differently.""
	Valentino may disagree, but there is more to Campagnolo than the knowledge. There is deep beauty, as well. The question is whether the world is still willing to pay for it."
6712,"The old-world values that define the component maker Campagnolo make it so beloved by the faithful that they describe it as a soul instead of a brand.

6713,"This is a fable about emotion, but it starts as a business story. For the past half century the Italian component maker Campagnolo and its chief competitor, the Japanese conglomerate Shimano, have gone toe-to-toe in one of the great rivalries not just of the cycling world but of the entire business world. The elements intrigue those who study such things: Despite their near-comic contrast in size—Shimano's bicycle-division sales were $2.1 billion last year, Campagnolo's around $150 million—the companies have considered each the other's greatest foe. Over the years, the spirit of that rivalry infected their customers. Road cyclists can be passionate about their choice of components, but none are more notoriously passionate than Campy freaks. They wax eloquently about the curves and swooping lines of new components, create personal museums of old parts, can be stunned into silence and immobility by the sight of a complete boxed Campy tool set.
	Campagnolo traditionally had been seen as owning the top 1 percent of the cycling market, the high-end professional and custom-build customer, while Shimano was considered to dominate OEM (original equipment manufacturer)—its components, ubiquitous on mass-production bikes made by major players, at times have been found on as many as 70 percent of all bikes made.
	Campagnolo was also traditionally acknowledged as the choice of champions. Eddy Merckx rode only Campy. Bernard Hinault rode Campy to all five of his Tour de France victories. So did Miguel Indurain. Of course the Italian champions Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi rode Campy. But the last Tour winner to ride a Campagnolo gruppo under the Arc de Triumph was Italy's Marco Pantani in 1998. (The inevitable asterisk of modern sports: Oscar Pereiro, who was declared the 2006 winner after a failed drug test negated Floyd Landis's victory, rode Campagnolo.) Lance Armstrong won seven yellow jerseys on Shimano gear. When he retired in 2005, many insiders assumed Campagnolo would do whatever it took to make sure the next winner was on its componentry. But Shimano won in 2007 and 2008. Then things became really bleak for Campy: The upstart SRAM stole the crown. A Chicago company that found its first success by selling handlebar shifters for mountain bikes in the 1980s, SRAM didn't put out its first road-bike group until 2005. But just four years later, in 2009, Spain's Alberto Contador won the Tour on the company's top groupset, Red. Contador and SRAM won again in 2010, before Shimano took over again in 2011, under Cadel Evans.
	Campy's problems aren't limited to the Tour de France podium. Today's younger generation of riders generally assume they can't afford Campagnolo's gear and aren't impressed with its historic pedigree. Older, more affluent riders still covet the brand's cachet, but, as one industry insider observes: ""When all of us 50-year-old guys with $6,000 bikes get too old, fat, and lazy, what are they going to do?""
	The rise of SRAM cuts to the heart of Campagnolo's dilemma. When SRAM introduced its first road-bike groupset six years ago, Campagnolo ignored the American upstart. That was a mistake. Nimble and smart, SRAM rose quickly to challenge the Shimano-Campagnolo duopoly. SRAM's engineers developed new products quickly and outsourced production to factories that could make the products at a lower cost. When I asked Michael Zellman, SRAM's global marketing manager, if I could stop by and see the Chicago factory, he said, ""Sure, but there's not much here to see. We manufacture in 15 locations all over the world."""
6714,
6715,
6716,"It wasn't hard to be impressed by Campagnolo's operation. The airy manufacturing complex could house a fleet of 747s, but it's not driven by an assembly-line mindset. Campagnolo's machinists ply their craft at autonomous tooling stations. Components are dropped into small-batch metal bins the size of laundry baskets, which are then hand-wheeled to the next station. The factory floor was clean enough to lick.
	Piazza guided me to a progressive stamping die, a 30-foot monster that sent out a shuddering whump! every two seconds. It felt and sounded like the company's beating heart. I watched as steel tape was fed into one end. Newborn Campagnolo Super Record cogs emerged from the other. A machinist in blue coveralls picked a random cog and held it to his eye like a diamond cutter. There are almost no traditional assembly lines at the Campagnolo factory. Each machinist works like an artisan. There's a bit of the Renaissance guild about the place. Which is no coincidence; the artisan-guild concept was created just a few hours south of here, in Florence, in the 12th century."
6717,
6718,"Campagnolo expanded into other components, establishing a reputation for innovation and unsurpassed quality. Tullio, a broad bull of a man with a powerful voice and piercing gaze, worked closely with top pro riders and with frame builders in the artisan towns of northern Italy: Faliero Masi, Edoardo Bianchi, and Ernesto Colnago. For a 30-year stretch—from 1968 to 1998— Campagnolo dominated the pro peloton. In the Tour de France, 27 of 31 winners rode Campy. In the Giro d'Italia, Campy won 26 of 31 titles."
6719,"The company's DNA was established during those years. Tullio never wanted the mass market. His heart and soul were in the high-end stuff, the pro gear. During the bike boom of the 1970s, when every family in America kept a quiver of Schwinns in the garage, Campagnolo refused to expand to meet low-end demand."
6720,"""I went over to Vicenza to work with Tullio on developing some Schwinn pedals in 1973,"" recalled Jay Townley, a bicycle-industryconsultant who worked for Schwinn during the boom years. ""The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission was making manufacturers add pedal reflectors for safety. I showed Tullio a reflector we could put in the openings of those old rat-trap pedals. He looked at the pedal, frowned, and said 'Brutto! Brutto!'"" Ugly! Ugly!"
6721,
6722,
6723,"
	Crude design offended the old man. Campagnolo's designers strove for elegance in the engineering sense of the word: Finding the simplest, lightest, most efficient solution to the problem of human-powered propulsion. Given a choice between his own beliefs and the fortune to be made in the mass market, Tullio turned his back on the fortune. By the end of the 1970s, Campagnolo had abandoned all but the pro racing and very top luxury portion of the specialty retail market to Shimano and Suntour, Japanese companies that were happy to scale up production to meet the demand for less expensive chains, sprockets, and derailleurs."
6724,"That refusal to compromise quality moved Campagnolo from a company to a cause. Some call it a cult. It's a symbol of old-world artisan craftsmanship, a refusal to compromise twinned with manly know-how, seasoned with a tinkerer's curiosity and a dash of machismo. The classic film Breaking Away captured the mystique in the character of Dave Stohler, a blue-collar Indiana kid enthralled by Italian cycling culture. His pride and joy was a Masi road bike equipped with Campagnolo gear."
6725,"Lorenzo Taxis, Campagnolo's global marketing manager, described the power of the Campagnolo name: ""It is a soul,"" he said. ""It is a soul contained by a brand."""
6726,"That's a heavy burden. Perhaps that's why, long after Campagnolo must have realized there was a market for electronic shifting, it continued to refine its product in those secret rooms while Shimano offered its version for sale. At Campagnolo, there is a sense that the company must weigh each product against the culture of cycling itself. ""We must ask whether this product is notdemocratic, let's say,"" Lerrj Piazza told me. ""It is a social thing. It's not logical to put a product on the market which is not touchable by the people"" because of its high price."
6727,"There's also the risk of putting the Campagnolo imprimatur on a product that could pollute the purity of cycling. Officials in Vicenza are mum on this point, but at least one competitor is also struggling with the issue. Earlier this year officials at SRAM (which has no electronic shifter on the market) asked an ad agency to find a way to turn the absence of such a product to the company's advantage. The essence of cycling, a SRAM official wrote to the ad shop, ""has always been about the 'Culture of Mechanical'—a.k.a. the raw, tactile connection of the human animal to a beautiful, efficient, analog machine."" Using a battery to power an essential part of the experience, the memo said, ""just isn't right."""
6728,"Campy must balance such fidelity to old-school principles with its need to stay cutting edge. ""If you lose the quality and the innovation,"" Piazza told me, ""you lose the love for the brand."""
6729,"There's no nameplate outside Valentino Campagnolo's office. Tullio's son, who took over the company at age 35 when his father died in 1983, can be found by entering an unmarked door that leads to a spare conference room. Before going to Vicenza I'd asked an American bike-shop owner for his impressions of the great signore. ""Valentino, he's, well, he's a little strange,"" the retailer said."
6730,"Valentino Campagnolo emerged from behind a plain wooden door, a thin, reserved, 63-year-old man dressed in slacks and a blue-striped dress shirt, with a bit of a Christopher Walken vibe. He moved slowly and deliberately, almost as if purposefully opposite the image that still endures of his bulldog old man."
6731,"When I asked about the company's decision to stay in Italy while the world decamped to Asia, Campagnolo offered a frank answer. ""It was a forced decision,"" he told me. When he took over the company in 1983, he said, ""I didn't have any special strategy. I didn't have any special management skills in how to handle the company outside of Italy."""
6732,
6733,
6734,"
	There's deep history behind this cryptic answer—and some insight into Campagnolo's willingness to trade high Italian labor costs for the knowledge. Valentino inherited the company two years after the opening of the massive new Vicenza factory, which was old man Tullio's way of doubling down on Italy. In the early 1980s, Tullio and Valentinowatched as Schwinn, then the world's leading bicycle manufacturer, closed its Chicago factories and moved production to Taiwan. An industry exodus ensued. ""The bicycle industry has a history of chasing cheap labor,"" said the former Specialized executive Gary Coffrin. ""The industry migrated to Taiwan in the 1980s, and then to China in the 1990s."""
6735,"Everything was fine at first. Schwinn's profit margin thrived on low-cost Asian labor. But in 1985, Schwinn ended its arrangement with its Taiwanese production partner, a company called Giant Manufacturing. What happened next is a lesson that Valentino Campagnolo has never forgotten. Giant turned around and used its newfound manufacturing expertise to produce bikes under its own brand that were better and cheaper than Schwinn's. Though Schwinn bounced back several times, ultimately it never recovered and, by 1992, was bankrupt."
6736,"""We do everything inside the company,"" Valentino Campagnolo told me. ""This is something in which I strongly believe. If I know how to produce it, I can always improve my performance. If somebody else is doing it, my improvements are out of my control. This is a very strategic decision for us."""
6737,Technology transfer—some would call it idea theft—is a concern in cycling just as it is in any industry that outsources. Imagine the electronic development room deep inside Campagnolo that Piazza wouldn't even allow me a peek into—but situated thousands of miles away from those who care most about its integrity.
6738,"Security, proximity, and low labor costs spurred Campagnolo to open its first satellite factory in 2005 in Piteti, Romania, an industrial city in the center of the old Iron Curtain stronghold. Managers and engineers from Vicenza can drive to the plant in a day. Manufacturing wages aren't China-cheap, but they're low, about $14,000 a year. Italy's strong metalworkers' union doesn't include Romanian workers, so Campagnolo can hire and fire more easily. Perhaps most crucially, it's in Romania—a country famous for a man who drank blood and another whose name included the phrase ""the impaler."" Its remote location and spooky cultural reputation act as their own barriers to technology transfer."
6739,"""We first develop new products and methods of manufacturing in Vicenza,"" Valentino Campagnolo explained to me. ""And when it has been perfected, then we can bring that activity to Romania. We have exactly the same machines, equipment, and methods in Romania and Vicenza."" The company has made huge investments in carbon-fiber components. ""We didn't want to take any risk by putting these components in the hands of somebody else,"" Campagnolo told me. ""They require a high degree of human labor, and we wanted to keep everything inside the company."" So the company perfects a manufacturing process with its longtime, highly skilled craftsmen in Vicenza, then teaches the intricacies to its employees in Romania."
6740,"""I think this was a big mistake that some Italian companies have made,"" Piazza told me. ""They chose to produce in the Far East, and they spread their knowledge. In the Far East, they produce a good product, but the innovation in Europe is different. If you take your knowledge elsewhere, it's a big risk."""
6741,"Campagnolo can be called a lot of names. Stodgy. Insular. Arrogant. But nobody has ever called the company cheap or stupid. As bicycle-industry veterans wonder how long the company can survive, some of the world's top economists and business strategists are taking a fresh look at the Campagnolo-style business model and finding it newly appealing. A combination of outsourcing fatigue (those long flights to Shenzhen for quality control take their toll), rising labor and transportation costs, and the let's-rethink-this mindset of the recession have dampened the business world's enthusiasm for Asian manufacturing."
6742,
6743,
6744,"
	One key is to understand that Campagnolo is a commodities company. It's specialized and high-end, like an airplane manufacturer or a medical-device maker. Product failure is not an option. Quality is all."
6745,"""In high-end, small-batch manufacturing, where you're making very exacting high-quality products, labor costs aren't your major concern,"" says Kathryn Shaw, PhD, a Stanford University economics professor who studies the expense of manufacturing. ""The main costs are in product design, which you need to stay on the cutting edge."" A company like Campagnolo, she says, ""is investing heavily in brand value. That's one of their major assets. Maintaining that brand is part of the cost of doing business."""
6746,"A high-end company that dilutes its brand value by chasing cheap labor, she says, does so at its peril."
6747,"The airplane giant Boeing recently learned this lesson the hard way. In the early 2000s the company went full-throttle into outsourcing, pulling parts for its highly touted 787 Dreamliner from around the world: wings from Japan, floor beams from India, passenger doors and landing gear from France and Sweden, parts of the tail from South Korea and Italy. The whole thing would be assembled in Boeing's factory in Everett, Washington."
6748,"Ten years later, a humbled Boeing has done an outsourcing about-face. The 787, finally set for release this year, has been dogged by years of delays and quality-control issues. The outsourced subs simply couldn't come through with top-quality parts on deadline. Engineers and machinists making, say, a wing and fuselage that had to match exactly couldn't correct problems by walking across the factory floor and talking. They had to sync time zones, catch overseas flights, overcome language and culture barriers, wait weeks for a corrected batch of parts to arrive. ""We spent a lot more money in trying to recover than we ever would have spent if we'd tried to keep the key technologies closer to home,"" Boeing CEO Jim Albaugh said in an interview earlier this year."
6749,"Quality control and technology transfer have always been problems with outsourcing, but cheap labor and transport made up for those deficiencies. Now, the economics are shifting. Labor costs, for instance, though still low, are rising. The average Chinese production worker made $1,740 a year in 2003. In 2008, that same worker made $4,140. ""After factoring in the higher labor and freight costs, we find that the former offshore savings have turned negative,"" a team of McKinsey & Company consultants concluded in a recent report titled ""Time to Rethink Offshoring."""
6750,"Campagnolo's strategy makes sense on another level. Phin Upham, PhD, a visiting scholar at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, recently published a study of outsourcing in the bicycle industry. ""Most people think you can outsource manufacturing and keep marketing and research and- development in house,"" he said. ""It doesn't work like that. It's almost impossible to have effective R&D without also being involved in the day-to-day manufacturing. R&D isn't about a group of smart people sitting in a room thinking deeply about a new bicycle wheel. It's a result of being so immersed in the details that you find a way to weld something a half-percent better."" Staying close to the ground has its value, too. Upham pointed out that years after Giant ate Schwinn's lunch, the Taiwanese company established a facility in the Netherlands—partly to put its people in touch with new developments in European cycling."
6751,"Manufacturing at the highest-quality level, Upham says, ""is not a dumb thing to do."" It requires skills that are difficult to attain and aren't easily scalable. If the demand for Campagnolo'stop-level $2,500 carbon-fiber groupset, the Super Record, exploded tenfold, the company couldn't simply hire 10 times as many skilled machinists and ramp up production. Those machinists don't exist. ""Highly qualified machinists know their worth,"" says Upham, ""and they won't sell their labor cheap."""
6752,"Campagnolo executives have been known to go to extremes to defend the knowledge and the sanctity of the company's brand. At a certain point, you wonder whether this obsession has something to do with their current slippage in the market. Case in point. In the company's executive offices, I chatted briefly with Lorenzo Taxis, the company's group marketing and communication director. A substantial man with ginger hair, Taxis wore a fine Italian vested suit and carried himself with the aspect of a duke. I mentioned that I hailed from Seattle."
6753,"""Very nice city,"" he said. ""I recently spent some time there."""
6754,"I wondered why a guy from Campagnolo would spend time in Seattle, so I threw out a guess. ""Were you there on a patent issue?"""
6755,"Taxis paused. ""Something like that,"" he said, then ended our conversation."
6756,"A little research solved the mystery. In 2007, the component company FSA ran a series of ads in cycling magazines (including this one) in which it claimed to make the world's lightest crankset: 633 grams, compared with the Super Record crankset, which weighed 652 grams."
6757,"Campy engineers spend entire careers developing ever lighter and stronger gruppos. The company spent years developing its carbon-fiber technology. Its officials like to say its carbon fiber is more precious than gold. And now the U.S. branch of FSA—based in Mukilteo, Washington, a sleepy town north of Seattle—was claiming its cranks were better?"
6758,"In Vicenza, umbrage was taken. Campagnolo flew its lawyers to Seattle to launch a federal lawsuit for false advertising."
6759,"""We were shocked,"" said Matt VanEnkevort, managing director of FSA USA. ""We could have handled this out of court. But we had zero conversation before they filed."""
6760,"These kinds of suits are usually settled quietly, especially with a small player like FSA USA. ""We're not even in Campagnolo's weight class,"" VanEnkevort told me. FSA's annual American sales hover around $10 million, about 7 percent of Campagnolo's worldwide revenues. But the lessons of history are remembered in Vicenza. Campagnolo paid dearly for ignoring SRAM in 2005, and would not overlook another challenge, no matter how small. In this instance, we're talking about a difference in components of 19 grams. Find a very small egg. Boil it. Cut it in the middle and discard one half. The tiny bit that remains in your palm is about 19 grams."
6761,"During the two-week trial last summer, Campagnolo's attorneys grilled FSA's VanEnkevort about the methods used to compare the weights. By the time his testimony concluded, it was fairly clear that FSA had fudged a little on its weight comparison. But that wasn't the end of the case."
6762,"When he took the witness stand, Campagnolo's Taxis spoke about the brand equity he'd traveled halfway around the globe to defend. ""It's very easy to lose the image"" that Campagnolo has established, Taxis said. ""It's very hard to recuperate it."" If FSA ran 18 pages, he said, ""we need to run at least three times as many"" to recover."
6763,"FSA's lawyers threw a little cold reality on Taxis, though. ""Do you know who Lance Armstrong is?"" one asked."
6764,"""Yes, I do,"" Taxis answered."
6765,"""He won the Tour de France seven years in a row, didn't he?"""
6766,"""Correct."""
6767,"""He's never used a Campagnolo product, has he?"""
6768,"""No."""
6769,"""He uses Shimano and he uses SRAM for his groupsets, his crankset, and his racing parts, correct?"""
6770,"""Correct."""
6771,"""Campagnolo parts don't make any bikes go faster than a competitor, do they?"""
6772,"""No."""
6773,"As FSA's attorney continued to needle Taxis about Campagnolo's lack of recent Tour success, Campagnolo's lawyer objected: What's the relevance here?"
6774,"""The testimony was from Mr. Taxis that Campagnolo is leading in innovation, and Full Speed Ahead is trying to piggyback on their reputation,"" FSA's lawyer explained. ""I think the jury should understand that Campagnolo, to the cycling world, is not quite as painted."""
6775,"Campagnolo's claim was denied. The Italian company appealed the case, despite expensive legal bills and long odds. (False advertising claims are difficult to prove. To succeed, Campagnolo would have to show that the ads actually converted its buyers into FSA buyers.) The verdict was eventually affirmed."
6776,"Campagnolo officials declined to comment on the litigation. At FSA's Mukilteo headquarters—a warehouse and a tidy suite of offices staffed by young dudes and their dogs—Van Enkevort says, ""I can't help but feel this was a vendetta against us for having the gall to compare our product to Campagnolo's. I have a feeling Valentino saw those ads and got very upset."""
6777,"The number of riders, bike-shop owners, and industry insiders who profess a love for Campagnolo are legion. Losing Campagnolo, they say, would be like the computer industry losing Apple. Or the auto industry without Porsche. An executive who was with FSA at the time it was being sued told me, ""I sure hope Campagnolo survives."""
6778,"Peter Chisholm, owner of the high-end Vecchio's Bicicletteria, is one of the deans of the cycling scene in Boulder, Colorado. He's also a prime example of the kind of loyalty Campagnolo can count on. ""I would rather walk than ride anything other than Campagnolo,"" Chisholm told me when I strolled into his store recently. He hiked up the sleeve on his Italian sweater to reveal a Campagnolo winged wheel tattooed on his forearm."
6779,"""When I got into cycling in 1985, if you were a serious cyclist you used Campagnolo, period,"" he said. ""It's still the premium componentry. It's the best in form, function, durability, and maintainability."""
6780,"Vecchio's deals in high-end custom bikes, the $6,000-and-up models that begin with a custom frame fitting. ""If my customers take all that time and effort to build the right bicycle, they're not going to skimp on components. They want the best. They want the Rolex, not the Casio."""
6781,
6782,"Findley is the prototypical rider all three high-end component makers—Shimano, SRAM, and Campagnolo—are courting. A 37-year-old college professor in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Findley commutes to work, competes in Tuesday-night ""hammer rides,"" and tackles a century now and then. If this were an election, Sam Findley would be the undecided voter in a swing state."
6783,"""I'm trying to get the best bang for the buck,"" Findley told me. As a teenager he rode his father's road bike: ""A classic Bianchi with a group of perfect Campagnolo diamonds."" As a penny-pinching college student he rode what he could afford: a Schwinn Prologue with Shimano gear. Now in his thirties, he's got a little coin in his pocket. He's riding a Cannondale with SRAM Rival components."
6784,"Why SRAM? ""It's lighter than what I could otherwise get for my money, and the bike shop guys were really good about pointing that out. They like it and ride it,"" Findley said. ""I've done a few races where SRAM provided neutral support, which I liked. And, frankly, Campagnolo parts weren't stocked locally. I could get a Campy group, but if the bearings went out I'd have to wait a week or two to get the parts shipped."""
6785,"Tom Kattus is the man charged with winning Sam Findley's allegiance. Kattus, 48, has one of the toughest jobs in the American cycling industry: He's the general manager of Campagnolo North America. It sounds like he commands an empire, but in truth Kattus has exactly five full-time employees. Five. They work out of a small office suite in Carlsbad, California. And they're the second-largest subsidiary of Campagnolo worldwide."
6786,"Kattus is a realistic man. ""The younger crowd saw Lance win seven Tours on Shimano,"" he told me. ""They just saw SRAM win the Tour, and SRAM has done an excellent job of marketing to the younger generation. Younger American riders haven't seen Campagnolo out there. Plus we have this stigma that we're very high-priced, almost out of reach."""
6787,"As a former Cannondale manager, Kattus knows how to fight in the retail trenches. ""We're outgunned in North America, we have limited resources, so we have to be creative. We have to take a grassroots approach. But we're willing to push it and go for it."""
6788,"One of Kattus's first initiatives is an industry discount program that gives employees of bike shops that carry Campy a reduced price—a perk the company had not offered in the United States. A lot of road-bike buyers like Sam Findley seek advice from the guys in the repair shop. And if the techs don't like Campy, the sale goes to SRAM or Shimano. ""Our first prerogative is to get shop employees to understand Campagnolo—to get them on the bikes, get them riding the gear,"" Kattus said."
6789,"Sometimes it seems like Campy's innovation and arrogance go hand in hand. And the latter can trip up the former. Last year the company introduced the Super Record groupset, which included the world's first 11-speed cassette and a thinner, stronger chain. By most accounts, the gear is stellar. Cycling News readers voted it Best New Product of 2010. But fixing the new chain required a special, $299 tool—the most expensive chain tool ever produced. If you ask a bike mechanic making $12 an hour what he thinks of the new 11-speed gruppo, prepare to get an earful about the chain tool."
6790,"""Kattus is a very smart guy,"" said Rick Vosper, a longtime bike-industry consultant now working as the director of Airborne Bicycles. ""He knows who to go after: the key influencers. The hot young rider in town, who's often an employee of the bike shop. If I'm selling those components, I want the fastest guy in the club, the sharpest guy in the shop. Those guys are going to change people's minds about which components to buy for your next bike."""
6791,"Part of Kattus's challenge is overcoming the perception that Campagnolo simply doesn't care about North American riders. The United States represents only 14 percent of the company's sales, and while Kattus scrambles to cover the country with a staff of five, SRAM continues to saturate American shops and races with its reps. ""We ensure that racers, shop owners, consumers, everybody has a point of contact with SRAM,"" said Michael Zellman, SRAM's global marketing manager. ""It's in our company DNA. SRAM started with Stan Day and Mike Mercuri traveling around in a car, pulling parts out of their trunk, asking riders to give it a try. We've always been there at the races."""
6792,"That is, of course, a page right out of the Campagnolo playbook. It's how Tullio Campagnolo established his Tour- winning gruppos 40 years ago. And it may be a piece of knowledge that the cardinals at the Vatican in Vicenza have forgotten."
6793,"Campagnolo has never wanted wealth or world domination. That goes for the family as it does the company. It could have ramped up for the Schwinn boom of the 1970s, sold its components on the cheap. It chose not to. The company could have chased low-cost labor in Taiwan in the 1980s, expanded to China in the 1990s, gone completely global in the 2000s. Instead, Campagnolo hunkered down in Italy. Valentino could have sold the company or gone public. He stubbornly kept it in the family."
6794,"This is a very Italian way to operate. More specifically, it's the northern Italian way. Vicenza and the larger Veneto region are famous for nurturing artisanal manufacturers like Campagnolo. Luxottica, which produces Ray-Ban and Oakley sunglasses, is headquartered nearby. A few miles away, the Zamberlan family produces some of the world's finest hiking boots. Diesel and Benetton are based in the region. Bottega Veneta, one of the world's elite fashion brands, produces its famous handbags at a factory that's literally across the street from Campy."
6795,"These companies survive by targeting the highest strata of the market. It's the opposite of the economic model that dominates in the United States right now, which is to use cheap labor and scorched-earth tactics to gain massive market share. And it goes against the American exit strategy: selling out to reap a fortune."
6796,"At Campagnolo, there is no exit strategy. There is only, in the words of Lorenzo Taxis, the soul that is contained within the brand. It's almost a fairy tale. What if there was a company that didn't want to take over the world? What if there was a company that just wanted to make the best products it could possibly invent, and be satisfied with a little profit at the end of the day? The company wouldn't betray its customers. It would be beholden to no craven shareholders or institutional investors. Perhaps most critically, the company would learn from history, value its institutional memory, and cultivate creativity on the factory floor. That is Campagnolo and the knowledge."
6797,"The hitch in this scenario is that Campagnolo may now be a prisoner of its own fairy tale. Competitors like SRAM and FSA are young. They can become anything, take risks, grow in any direction. Campagnolo does not have such freedom."
6798,"One final story. In the mid-1980s, just after Valentino took over, Campagnolo experienced a series of stumbles. In 1984 the company released its Delta brake, which featured a revolutionary triangular design. Still considered by many cycling design aficionados to be the most beautiful brake ever made, the Delta looks like it should be on display in the Museum of Modern Art. It was Campagnolo's bid to leap ahead of Shimano, which had begun to challenge the Italian company in the high-end market. But Campy allowed form to outrun function. The Delta was heavy (all that beautiful steel) and lacked modulation—it gripped too forcefully, in the opinion of many riders."
6799,"Valentino learned a tough lesson, one that stays with him today. Sitting at a table in Vicenza, I asked him about the company's reputation for producing beautiful products.
	He bristled.
	""Below our logo is written 'Pure Performance,'"" he told me. ""That is there to underline the biggest part of our activity. Our focus is first on technical performance. Then development becomes a question of cost. Only at the very end, the final choices are addressed to allow the product to be nicer. This is the very last step. It cannot be differently.""
	Valentino may disagree, but there is more to Campagnolo than the knowledge. There is deep beauty, as well. The question is whether the world is still willing to pay for it."
6800,"Lightweight climbing prowess can be yours at eyebrow-raising prices
"
6801,"Trek has announced the release of an aluminum version of its lightest race bike, the Émonda. In doing so, it brings this lightweight climbing platform—the same one that will be raced by the Trek Factory Racing team in the Tour de France—to a more affordable price for consumers."
6802,"The company says that the Émonda ALR is one of the lightest aluminum race bikes out there, claiming that it's even lighter than the similarly Ultegra-spec’d Specialized Allez Comp and Cannondale CAAD10. To accomplish this, Trek used a new welding process it calls “Invisible Weld,” which it says uses less material while strengthening the bonds between the tubes, allowing designers to minimize the weight of the frames. Claimed frameset weight is 1,408 grams—1,050 grams for a 56cm unpainted frame (the carbon Émonda SLR raced by the pros weighs 700 grams claimed), and 358g for the carbon fork. Claimed weight on a complete Émonda ALR 5 with Shimano 105 is 18.8 pounds; the ALR 6 with Ultegra 6800 weighs 17.3 pounds. At $1,760 for the ALR 5 and $2,250 for the 6, these are definitely respectably light bikes for the price—especially when you get Ultegra on the latter."
6803,     Related Video: 2015 Trek Émonda
6804,"The Émonda ALR will eventually come in six builds, starting with the ALR 4 spec’d with Tiagra, and including versions with Dura-Ace Di2 or SRAM Red; but for now, just the ALR 5 and 6 models are available, as well as a frameset ($990). As with the carbon Émonda line, all groups are complete, meaning that the ALR 5 sports Shimano 105 across the board: chain, cassette, brakes, derailleur, etc. All the ALR bikes feature size-specific tubes, to target a similar ride quality across frame sizes. Carbon forks provide some additional front-end stiffness, compliance, and weight savings."

6829,"The 2016 Stumpy and Rhyme mountain bikes for men and women have more travel, more options, and more excitement than ever"
6830,"When I daydream about mountain biking, it looks a lot like this. I am riding through the forest but it feels more like a jungle. It is fall when it should be spring, but it seems that in this place summer might last forever anyway. Lush, green ferns overflow onto the trail. The singletrack is dark, wet, and fast. We duck in and out of the shade of the trees, finding shelter from the southern hemisphere sun that seems to bore into your skin when you stand beneath it for too long. Towering trees, covered in a soft, fuzzy red bark, are a blur in my peripheral vision. They’re a familiar fixture from my childhood in Northern California; but I’m on the other side of the world. What are redwood trees doing in New Zealand? It feels like a dream."
6831,"Only, I’m awake. The burning in my quads tells me so. I’m in a familiar situation: Past my personal red line, trying to keep up with much faster riders. Yet not wanting to be anywhere but here. And the new bike beneath me is egging me on. These droppy, poppy, and twisty trails of Rotorua, New Zealand, are ideal for showcasing its capabilities."
6832,Specialized picked a good place to launch its 2016 mountain bikes. 
6833,"What’s New: 2016 Stumpjumper FSR
	The 2016 Stumpjumper trail bike, and its women’s equivalent, the Rhyme, are two new Specialized mountain bikes intended for riding like this—fast, fun, and aggressive. The company did away with its EVO distinction (which previously designated the most capable versions of its models) and made the entire Stumpy line more trail-ready: 29er versions come with 140mm forks and 135mm of rear travel; 27.5 versions get 150mm of front and rear travel. The models also get slacker angles—a 67-degree head angle on the 27.5, and 68 degrees on the 29er. "
6834,"When creating these trail-oriented mountain bikes, Specialized focused on improved handling. To do that, they lowered the BB to 13.2 inches and shortened the rear end—the 27.5 version has 16.5-inch chainstays and teh 29er has 17.1-inch stays. The company also beefed up the top and down tubes. "
6835,The FSR suspension system got a new tune to improve pedaling efficiency without sacrificing the system’s ability to stay active under pedaling and braking.
6836,     RELATED: The Benefits of Wide Mountain Bike Rims 
6837,"Parts got a refresh, too. All versions of the Stumpjumper and the Rhyme come with Specialized's new Command Post, released last month. The new version of the dropper is still cable-actuated, but it features 12 position settings over the previous version’s three. Also, all versions of the 27.5 and 29er bikes will get Specialized’s wide Roval Traverse rims: The alloy versions feature a 29mm inner width and the carbon options have a 30mm inner width. All brakes are from Shimano—XTR for top-of-the-line models, SLX on the Comp builds. The Elite alloy version and up gets a 1x drivetrain."
6838,"Finally, for the seemingly growing faction of hydration pack-haters, the company further integrated its SWAT (Storage, Water, Air, Tools) system onto the bikes. New carbon Stumpy models have a storage compartment on the down tube that is accessed via a plastic door where the water bottle mounts. The door opens to reveal two cloth wraps: One holds two CO2 cartridges or a hand pump, the other holds an inner tube. You can also store items like food, a rain jacket, and other supplies within the down tube. A bulkhead above the BB keeps stored items from getting stuck."
6839,     Related: Redesigned Specialized Camber Hits a Sweet Spot
6840,"The Stumpjumper will be sold in alloy and carbon models, ranging from $2,900 for the Stumpjumper FSR Comp up to $8,900 for the S-Works FSR Stumpjumper."
6841,"What’s New: 2016 Rhyme Women’s Trail Bike
	Alongside the new Stumpy is its women’s equivalent, the 150mm-travel, 27.5-inch wheel Rhyme. In designing the Rhyme, Specialized departed from the approach it’s taken with its past models, which is to build toward a women’s specific geometry—the Rhyme shares the same frame, geometry, and carbon layup as the men's 27.5 Stumpjumper. Amy Nelson, Specialized's women’s mountain bike product manager, said the company polled more than 1,000 women to better understand what they they wanted in an aggressive, trail riding bike. “What we heard was that women wanted the same, proven trail geometry that Specialized offered to men,” Nelson said."
6842,"There are some small differences between the Rhyme and Stumpjumper besides paint scheme: The FSR suspension is tuned to accommodate a lighter rider. Touchpoints are also different: The Rhyme gets Specialized’s Body Geometry Women’s Myth saddle, and a narrower handlebar at 720mm, compared to the Stumpy’s 750mm bar. The Rhyme also gets an XS size—the entire size range is made to accommodate riders from 4’10” to 6’0”—and size-specific crankarms: 170mm on XS and S; 175mm on M and L. "
6843,"Overwhelmingly, Nelson says that women request the 27.5-inch wheel size for aggressive trail riding, so the Rhyme is not available as a 29er for now. And it’s sold in three builds—starting with the Comp alloy at $2,900 and going up to the Expert Carbon at $5,900.  "
6844,"What’s New: Stumpy / Rhyme 6Fattie
	Many brands are experimenting with hardtails built around 27.5+ wheels—including the new Fuze and Ruze models released by Specialized last month—but the 6Fattie versions of the Stumpjumper and Rhyme represent one of the fewfull-suspension bikesdesigned around the tire size, which sits between a typical tire and super-fat ones. Both models come with a 3-inch-wide Specialized 6Fattie tire."
6845,"Joe Buckley, the company's mountain bike product manager, said that the wider tire enabled him to run lower tire pressure for a 69 percent increase in contact patch, with just seven watts of increased rolling resistance. Those stats are going to vary depending on the specific pressure, but the idea is the same—more traction for a minimized increase in rolling resistance."
6846,"The 6Fattie versions of the Rhyme and Stumpy get a custom, wider rear end that incorporates the Boost 148 rear hub—a 148mm spacing for the bigger tires, with a Boost 110mm-wide hub in the front. Both come with a 1x drivetrain. "
6847,     RELATED: The 15 Best Mountain Bikes of 2015 
6848,"We’re a little curious as to the company’s choice to build the 6Fattie versions on 29mm-wide rims. Our testers have been riding 27.5+ and 29+ tires, and so far, and we've had a better experience when we mounted those tires on rim closer to 40mm rims. However, we've also tried the Stumpy 6Fattie and enjoyed it. Specialized says it tested the 6Fattie on 38mm rims, but the wider rims didn't deliver enough benefit to justify the weight penalty. Buckley added that they’re still assessing what the appropriate rim width may be."
6849,"How it Rides: Stumpjumper / Rhyme 27.5
	On the second descent of the first day’s ride, which included countless twisty, bermed turns on tight, narrow singletrack that had trees on either side, the medium 27.5 Rhyme I rode (remember, same frame as the 27.5 Stumpy) was quick and agile through every tight switchback and fast, swoopy turn. Coming down one of the technical descents toward the end of the day, an exposed and sometimes very steep segment of singletrack bench-cut into the side of a mountain, the 27.5 wheels tracked through fast, 180-degree switchback turns with speed and ease. And when we hit some very steep, nearly vertical sections, the Rhyme lapped it all up."
6850,"This is one of those bikes that makes me think about how the stereotype about long-travel bikes not being good climbers is so outdated. We ascended more than 3,000 feet that day, and the updated FSR suspension pedaled so efficiently that on some fire-road climbs (and descents over small bumps), I sometimes thought I had forgotten to open my Fox CTD shock from “trail” to “descend.” (Nope, fully open—and I soon figured out that I could just leave it that way for the entire ride.) And the bike felt light as I ascended, too (claimed weight on a small Rhyme Expert Carbon is 27 pounds)."
6851,"However, when I needed it, the suspension was there. When the pace picked up in the woods, the Rhyme proved to be happy to fly, soaking up the hits from larger root drops and smoothing the landings. The bike was springy and poppy, begging to catch air over medium-sized rollers and undulations in the trail."
6852,"I’ve finally become a dropper post devotee, and I’m glad to see it on the most affordable versions of these bikes. The new Command Post worked mostly smoothly—the only time it did get stuck was on the third day, when heavy rainfall created sandy, gritty mud that gunked up the seatpost and it was stuck in the down position for half a lap. (I was able to push it back up and it worked fine after that.) I’ve found the rebound on the previous version to be a bit, er, violent, but the post is smoother. However, from my initial experience, I think having 12 positions is overkill. On the trail, I sometimes found it distracting trying to dial in the exact position I wanted."
6853,"I do have one concern with the 27.5 version of the bike: While I love how it is, for some reason I found myself striking my pedal numerous times, and I think it has something to do with the BB height (though the 175mm cranks are also longer than I usually ride). These weren’t pedal strikes in normal places, like sections with larger rocks; they were in flatter, off-camber sections or tights turns where I had to pedal to maintain momentum. If I leaned the bike over, I’d graze the ground, which rattled me enough that I was constantly mindful of it. A few other journalists on the trip, men and women, had the same experience. When I rode the 29er on day three, though, I didn’t notice this issue, but the wet conditions led to less aggressive cornering."
6854,"How it Rides: Stumpjumper 29
	I hopped on the S-Works Stumpjumper 29er on the third day of the trip. It was raining heavily, yet the Stumpy was stable in the tight, greasy turns, tracked predictably over wet roots, and floated down the puddled, steppy sections with nary a hair-raising moment. In very tight switchback turns, I was conscious of the bigger wheels, but just the slightest extra attention got the bike through on the right line every time. I wouldn't go as far as to say I forgot I was on a 29er, but I almost forgot—this one is very nimble for the wheel size."
6855,"And for some, the speed you can carry on a straightaway will make up for the extra finesse you’ll have to put into tighter turns. Our second run of the day, a trail called Split Enz, spat us out on a long, steep, and rutted descent. Those big wheels picked up all that momentum, and I was going scary-fast over the bumps. As I squinted to keep the flecks of rock and dirt from flying into my eyes, this 29er held its line faithfully and absorbed all the high-speed juddering. It felt like the fastest I’ve gone on a bike in a while. "
6856,"I did notice a little extra firmness in the suspension compared to the 650b Rhyme, presumably because the tune is aimed at a larger rider, but mostly it had the same characteristics as I observed on the Rhyme."
6857,"First Impression = Fun
	This is just a first impression after three days on the new platform. There are some aspects of the bikes I’d like more time to suss out, and you can expect a more in-depth review in an upcoming issue of Bicycling or on this site. "
6858,"But for now, let’s go back to the redwood jungle. A tall, bermed turn approaches quickly and I push the bike into it hard. Another berm, and another, as the trail snakes through the trees. It straightens out for a moment over a pile of twisted roots and I loosen my grip on the handlebar and unweight the front, and the bike skips over the bumps. The ground dips away again, then swoops right back up. We are flowing, bike and rider. It feels a crime to be silent when there’s this much fun being had. I let out a big whoop. When I daydream about mountain biking, I am riding a bike that feels a lot like this."
6859,"Real-world speed and comfort from a name that led the aero trend
"
6860,"In the 1990s Graeme Obree and Chris Boardman battled each other in one of sport’s great duels. While Obree competed on grit and used radical body positions, Boardman, who was sometimes called “The Professor,” took a more methodical approach, focusing on training and engineering advances, and then refining his aerodynamics to eek out a few extra meters. For his first attempt, he co-designed a bike with sports car maker Lotus and continued to push the aero envelope on subsequent attempts. When his career as a racer ended, Boardman set out to create fast bicycles for the masses.
The Boardman AiR/TT 9.4 is one such fast bike and Boardman’s obsessive attention to detail shows. It’s got smart aero features and yet is pleasing to ride—two qualities that don’t often go together. Time trial bikes are judged rightly by their ability to shave seconds or minutes from a race. But this bike encourages one to consider additional factors: Does the bike impress, have cachet, and compel one to ride outside of the race course? The AiR/TT delivers on those accounts, too.Stop the Clock—Comfortably
Riders on Boardman bikes have topped the podium at Ironman World Championships, and I expected refined details from the AiR/TT. Like many TT bikes, the 9.4 nests the front brake inside the fork, hidden from the wind to decrease aerodynamic drag. Likewise, the rear brake is tucked out of the wind, underneath the chainstays. The brake cables and shifter wires are tucked inside the frame and practically invisible.
What I didn’t expect was how enjoyable the bike was to ride. Whether I was on a long, flat straightway with wind buffeting me from the side, or on a technical course, I was comfortable enough to stay in a compact aero position and manage my speed through pedaling cadence. Never—not even on blustery spring days—did the wind blow me off my line. The 9.4’s calm handling gave me confidence on technical courses and while zipping around neighborhood streets on a just-for-fun ride. I never worried about over-steering corners, and the bike moved almost gracefully along round-a-bouts and 90-degree turns. The bike’s designers found the sweet spot between responsive and stable, stiff and forgiving.
On long races or training rides, the AiR/TT felt as comfortable as any time trial bike I’ve tested. I was able to ride hard, fast, and with purpose for hours without discomfort. Other times, I just took it out for an easy spin, happy to let the miles tick by. The more I rode this bike, the more I wanted to ride it."

6862,"Not Without Want
Electronic drivetrains have been a great addition to time trial bikes. The rapid shifts, even under load, means I’m always in the right gear and never worry about dropping my chain anymore. So I was happy to see the 9.4 equipped with Shimano Ultegra Di2. One of the biggest advantages of electronic shifting, however, is that it makes it possible to have shifters within reach of the brake levers. On a technical course, where braking and shifting happen a lot, having the ability to modulate speed and change gears easily adds an element of safety and control. Few bikes in the 9.4’s price range offer that feature, but I’d still love to see it on a model as capable as this one even if it adds a few bucks to the price.
The way the front brake sits recessed into the fork also limits the width of rim that fits. I tried installing a Zipp 808 Firecrest clincher the night before the race but it initially would not clear the brake pads. Boardman suggested some adjustments to accommodate wider wheels, and I eventually got the wheel to work, but the installation was tricky and fiddling with the brake was made harder because its position inside fork doesn’t leave much room to work.British Style Cues
I like that the 9.4 does not look like a tricked-out creation of a mad aerodynamicist with only watt-savings on his mind. The Boardman 9.4 has pleasing angles and mostly traditional shapes. In true British style, it’s available in subdued colors: white with black and yellow accents. The clean lines of the top tube blend nicely at the seat tube. This is subtle, and important to me. The cockpit does not incorporate any proprietary components, which some models require to fit around funky frame shapes, it looks elegant, and functions well—the bars and arm pads are easy to adjust. The split-nose Adamo saddle looks appropriate on the bike, and I found it comfortable.
The Boardman 9.4 offers a top-level aero package with electronic shifting and is comfortable to ride at any speed, for races short and long. And it does not look like a Frankenbike. You don’t have to be chasing the hour record to benefit from this bike, but the 9.4 is so fast that it just might inspire you to make your own attempt."
6863,"Here’s what you need to know about the latest trend in mountain bikes
"
6864,"If you’ve been paying attention to new mountain bike products, you’ll have noticed one trend that’s rapidly growing in popularity: plus-size tires. This new, wider tire size is meant to bridge the gap between standard mountain bike tires and fat bikes. How fat are plus-size? There’s no rigid definition, but Trek’s designation is about as good a starting place as any: a 2.8- to 3.25-inch tire on a 35- to 50mm (external) rim. Because they’re so big, plus-size tires are larger diameter (a 27.5x3-inch wide tire is close to the diameter of a 29x2.2) so they roll over obstacles more easily than a smaller diameter wheel, and they have a larger contact patch, which should improve traction."
6865,"Below is a plus-size primer based on my research, experience and riding impressions so far."
6866,     Related: 27.5 Mountain Bikes for Every Trail
6867,"Plus size is more expensive
	If you haven’t noticed, mountain bike tires are getting very expensive. One top-of-the-line mountain bike tire today can cost $65 to $70. Plus-size tires will be even more expensive. There’s more material in a bigger tire, which leads to a higher prices. Plus, these bigger tires aren’t yet produced at the same volume as other tires. If plus-size production numbers increase, tire prices could come down. Here’s a sampling of prices (per tire):"
6868,"- Specialized Ground Control Fat 26x4.6, $160
	- Schwalbe Jumbo Jim 26x4.0–4.8, $113–$140
	- Bontrager Hodag 26x3.8, $120
	- WTB Trailblazer 27.5x2.8 TCS Light Fast Rolling, $68
	- WTB Bridger 27.5x3.0, TCS Tough High Grip, $77
	- Vee Trax Fatty Plus 29x3.0, $120
	- Vittoria Bomboloni 27.5x3.0 and 29x3.0, $119
	- Bontrager Chupacabra 29x3.0, $120
	- Maxxis Chronicle 29 x 3.0, $95-$120
	- Surly Dirt Wizard 29x3.0, $90
	- Surly Knard 29x3.0, (wire bead, 27tpi). $65
	- Panaracer FatBNimble 27.5x3.5, $80"
6869,A couple tires stand out. WTB’s Trailblazer and Bridger tires are anomalies because they do not carry a plus penalty: They’re the same price as a comparable smaller WTB tire.
6870,"The $65 Surly Knard I listed is in the same pricing ballpark as a smaller high-end tire. However, this version has a low TPI casing and wire bead, so it will be heavy and ride like a low-tpi tire. The high end 29x3.0 Knard sells for $90."
6871,The larger tubes to go with larger tires aren’t cheap either. A Surly 29x3.0 tube is $13.50.
6872,"These prices are important because riding off-road is hard on tires. When riding on the snow, the chances of cutting or puncturing a tire are pretty small. But when the terrain is dirt and rocks, the chance increases dramatically. On average, I ruin about six tires per season. At $65 each, that’s about $400 dollars of tires a season. At $100 each, that’s about $600 per season."
6873,     RELATED: Why You Should Go Wide on Your MTB Rims
6874,"Plus size is heavier
	Making a tire bigger and wider adds material. Adding material adds weight. All else equal, a 27.5 x 3.0 tire will be heavier than a 27.5x2.2 tire; there’s no way around it. My test set of WTB Trailblazer 27.5x2.8 tires weighed about 1,000 grams each. This is one of the smaller plus-size tires around and they are the light version of the tire, not the heavy-duty version."
6875,"Cyclists have forever been told that rotating weight is exponentially more important than non-rotating weight, and that reducing or centralizing rotating mass is a huge advantage. And here comes plus size, adding rotating weight on the very outside of the wheel."
6876,"Plus-size rim weights are still a bit of an unknown as rim shapes have yet to shake out, but overall, plus-size rims are wider than a regular rim. Like tires, more material is always heavier. Here’s a comparison using WTB’s products: The company’s plus-size specific Scraper 27.5 (45mm) rim weighs 650 grams (claimed); the Frequency 27.5 rim in 25mm width (a middle-of-the-road trail rim) weighs 527 grams."
6877,"Heavier rims and tires will make a bike feel slower when the rider accelerates, and less reactive when working through a snaking singletrack."
6878,"But trading weight for performance is a compromise mountain bikers have shown they’re willing to make. Suspension is heavier than a rigid frame; 29” wheels are heavier than 26” wheels; disc brakes are heavier than rim brakes; wide bars are heavier than narrow bars. If it improves the ride experience enough, riders will tolerate the added weight of plus."
6879,"Another ancillary weight gain: sealant. Because the tire has more surface to seal, more sealant is required, adding to the rotating weight."
6880,"Companies will try to make stuff too light
	Because plus-size adds weight, there will be requests for lighter rims and tires. And companies will try to race each other to make the lightest stuff. The pendulum will swing too far and there will be a spate of products that are too damn light and unreliable. Eventually, the pendulum will swing back a bit and a middle ground will be reached. The bike industry seems incapable of deviating from this path."
6881,"Plus size is heavier. If we want to ride it and have reliable products, we just need to get over that fact. We’ve gone through this (and continue to go through this) with 29” tires and tubeless/tubeless ready tires; the rush to make them as light as possible has resulted in many unreliable tires that cut or break too easily. And because there’s so much sealant in the tire, when you do flat a tubeless plus, it will be an even larger mess. Yuck."
6882,"Tire pressure matters more
	There are many factors involved, but with plus size, a rider should expect to use pressures of around nine to 15 psi. This requires a reliable gauge that reads accurately at those pressures; a floor pump with a 140 psi gauge will not be precise enough. I like Schwalbe’s Airmax Pro."
6883,Accuracy is important. A 1psi difference is a much larger change at 10 psi than it is at 25 psi.
6884,     RELATED: We Test Wide Mountain Bike Rims
6885,"Rim width is important
	Plus-size tires are taller and have more grip, so they exert more force on the interface between the rim and the tire’s bead. Because of this, the tire requires more support to prevent it from squirming and rolling. Support comes from a wide rim that spreads the beads and lets the sidewalls stand more vertical, so its profile looks more like a ""U"" and less like a lightbulb. A tire shaped like a lightbulb will need more pressure to prevent it from squirming, which reduces one of the big advantages of plus-size tires."
6886,"Because it’s still early days, “proper” rim width is still being worked out, but a few experts have told me that around 40mm (internal width) is a good starting point, “We recommend 39mm inner width. With a 39mm, you can make great use of a 3.0-inch tire and still run narrower tires like a 2.30 with good results,” said Al Clark, product manager for Bontrager tires and tubes."
6887,"It feels different
	The “feel” of a bike is a very tricky thing to define. We’re all calibrated a little differently, so even though we all experience feel, it’s not the same experience. But this is for certain: Increasing wheel weight, tire volume, and contact patch changes the way a bike feels."
6888,"In my experience, bikes with plus-size tires feel a bit more numb and require a more deliberate effort to steer. During my first rides on plus-size tires, I felt like I was a bit behind and found I was initiating turns a fraction too late. And getting used to the traction limits and breakaway point took more time than I expected. Heavier wheels make the bike feel slower on climbs and more sluggish to accelerate, but they also carry more momentum when spun up and provide the sensation of a calmer, more stable bike. A larger contact patch helps with braking traction, but heavier wheels are harder to slow down, so braking is a bit different too."
6889,But humans adapt very quickly. I expect that after a few more rides the bike will feel mostly normal to me.

6891,"They affect a bicycle’s suspension
	Pneumatic tires are also suspension; the increased height and volume make plus-size tires longer travel suspension than a smaller tire. But it is undamped suspension, and I find plus-size tires are noticeably bouncy—the bigger the tire, the bouncier they are."
6892,"It could be that I just need to adapt or experiment further with tire pressures, but so far I find the way plus-size tires pinball around and occasionally bounce me off-line a bit disconcerting. When I rode a Salsa Bucksaw in dry conditions, I was blown away by how much the rear end bounced around when braking into turns."
6893,"Plus tires are bouncy enough that I asked some tire manufacturers if slow-rebound casings are possible. Answer: maybe, but not without significant and undesirable compromises, like very slow tires."
6894,"One might be tempted to increase the fork or shock’s rebound damping force to counteract the bounciness. Don’t. Why? Here’s the simple version from an expert who wishes to remain anonymous: “The spring and damper in the fork are in series with the spring and damper in the tire. The velocities of the two suspension systems add to get the final velocity you feel. The sum of the rebound velocities from the tire and fork systems is not affected noticeably by changes in the fork rebound damping. The fast rebound of the tire is much larger, and it is still what you will feel.” In short, even if you slow down the rebound, the front end will still feel bouncy."
6895,"Some people might titter that heavier wheels increase a bike’s unsprung weight (parts connected to and not supported by the suspension) which will make the suspension less responsive. In theory, yes, this is true; but according to the anonymous expert I quoted above, in reality the weight increase of plus-size tires is probably not enough to make a difference you can feel on the trail."
6896,"Plus-size will get better with time
	Plus-size equipment is comparatively new and there's a lot of evolution ahead. Early 29er equipment was, compared to today's stuff, terrible. In a few years, many of the complaints, quirks, and drawbacks of plus stuff should be worked out or at least minimized."
6897,"If you’ve tried it, you like it, and you’re in the market for a new bike, absolutely buy a plus-sized bike. But remember, there’s more plus-size stuff coming and companies will learn from their first attempts. If you have a bike you love and you’re not ready to buy, keep riding that bike you love. When you are ready to buy, plus-size will be better than it is today."

6912,"With super-wide tires, fat bikes float over snow, sand, and almost anything else in their path. But are they right for you?"
6913,"Just like big tires, trends can take a long time to blow up. Consider the pathbreaking ­Pugsley, from alt-bike brand Surly. When introduced in 2005, the bike was unlike anything else out there. With 3.8-inch-wide tires, it rode like a jeep, plowing over anything in its way."
6914,"The bike was designed for riding across snowy trails, but soon turned up underneath ultra-distance explorers and noncyclists looking for a new way to exercise during the winter. “I don’t think anyone at Surly consciously thought, oh, this is going to be big,” says Adam Scholtes, product manager at the Minnesota-based brand."
6915,"Seven years later, the fat-bike craze is in full swing and everyone from boutique brands to global behemoths like Specialized and Trek want a piece of the action—and Surly alone now offers three distinct models. Despite the comical proportions of a fat bike, it takes only one ride to understand the category’s appeal. The 3.8-inch tires create a huge contact patch with the ground, grabbing up traction on slick and loose surfaces. They are heavier than most bikes and turn slowly, but speed isn’t the point. The massive volume of the tires allows you to run air pressures so low they barely register on a normal pump’s gauge. The resulting floatation enables them to roll over snow, sand, mud, wet roots, rocks, and other terrain that would otherwise be impassable."
6916,Related: Mongoose Brings Fat Bikes to the Masses
6917,"Recent design advances have expanded the bikes’ appeal. Even the Pugsley was a leap forward from its fat-bike forebear, the 1991 Hanebrink Extreme Terrain. That dune-buggy-like model used 20-inch-diameter, 8-inch-wide tires to negotiate snow, sand, and slickrock, but the small wheels limited its appeal. Current offerings ride more like traditional bikes and have improved in other subtle but important ways. Single-ring drivetrains ­(especially new 1x11 systems) offer a wide range of gears without requiring a front derailleur, which can clog with snow and ice. Changes­ in frame geometry have made the bikes more maneuverable and easier to steer. And the latest models are finally starting to shed some weight. Borealis now makes a fat bike with carbon-fiber rims that weighs a shocking 22 pounds."
6918,"Just don’t get too excited about using a fat bike for everyday transportation. Explorer Mike Curiak has ridden thousands of miles on them and plans to use one on a 700-mile expedition to the Northwest Passage this summer. “Fat bikes take me places where people haven’t been, where normal bikes couldn’t go,” he says. But he’d never consider one for conventional trails. “An $800 hardtail with a suspension fork will ride a million times better,” he says."
6919,"Still, there’s plenty to love. Fatties have extended the riding season through winter in the northern half of the United States and, in towns with groomed snow trails, the bikes are becoming as popular as cross-country skis. In Minneapolis, where Surly is based, enthusiasts have created a race series. And shops everywhere are finding that the bikes’ unique ride entices novice riders, drawing new riders to the sport."
6920,"“Because the tires are less apt to slide in corners, lose traction on rocks, or fall into ruts on even normal trails, fat bikes are just harder to screw up on,” says Ben Witt, who owned Milltown Cycles in Faribault, ­Minnesota, before taking a job at Salsa. People would walk by his shop, spot a fat bike, and come in to ask what it was. “I’d tell them riding one makes you feel like you’re eight years old again,” he says. And that might ultimately be the fat bike’s biggest draw."
6921,"Even Curiak admits that the wide wheels are a little addictive, no matter how good a rider you are. “There is something brainstem-level fun about this,” he says."

6926,"Now available with a svelte carbon frame, the Beargrease feels quicker than it looks—and Salsa designed it for snow events like Alaska’s Iditabike. Unlike many fat bikes, this one puts the rider in an aggressive position. That could put too much weight on the front wheel—a hindrance on sand or snow—so the company tweaked the frame angles and tube lengths. Even on challenging terrain, I felt centered between the wheels and was able to float over obstacles. The Makwa carbon fork has proportions similar to models with suspension. A few small brands offer suspension forks for fat bikes, but no major suppliers have committed yet. If they do, the Beargrease will be ready.—Ron Koch"

I stopped picking a line and let the 4.6-inch-wide tires float me over rocks and roots. Better still, I could explore new terrain, like the bank of a stream or a sandy wash. I had expected the big tires to feel sluggish, but the lightweight carbon fork made it easy to loft the front wheel over obstacles. The bike felt agile, even when I rode it on twisty trails at home in Pennsylvania. The big wheels slowed the steering, but added stability and let me drift through corners—a fun sensation no matter what kind of terrain I was riding.—Mike Yozell"

And if that’s not rugged enough, the town receives as much as 140 inches of snow a year. To create bikes that can handle such a wild and diverse terrain, the company gives them 190mm-wide rear axles and faster handling. The American-made frame also comes with rack mounts and can accommodate standard 29er wheels, if you decide to ride on ­hard-packed trails."
6937,"Our Aluminum Deluxe came with a carbon fork and 90mm-wide rims. The parts are ideal for riding in winter—the twist shifters are mitten-friendly, and fluidless mechanical disc brakes are easier to service than hydraulic models should they seize on the frozen tundra. The bike rode well on soft surfaces but felt at home on firmer terrain. In fact, there aren’t many places this versatile fat bike can’t go.—Matt Phillips"

6943,"Riding it requires you to adjust your style somewhat. The cranks are spread wide to clear the rear tire, so once in the saddle you might feel a little like you’ve mounted a horse. The bike’s massive wheels also make it harder to steer, especially at low speeds. Pick up the pace and the Moonlander responds with some agility; push it too hard, however, and this fat bike feels like a runaway bus. But for those who want to travel over heavy snow, deep sand, or explore those open spaces on a map where there are no trails, the Moonlander is a great choice.—Matt Phillips"

The clothes will know your temperature preferences and automatically adjust their in-built cooling or heating systems so to keep you perfectly comfortable—and to optimize your performance."

6962,"It might sound futuristic, but the future isn't so far away."
6963,"""Everything you describe is physically possible,"" says Charles Ross, a performance sportswear design expert at Falmouth University. ""I certainly expect there to be temperature-controlling garments available from the year 2020."" Ross would know: He's working on technologies for textile producers, including one with strong links to cycling clothing. The potential value of these innovations means he's not allowed to say who they are, but at least he can describe three of the clever ways the smart fabrics can work."
6964,"""For heating, you can mechanically trap dead air inside the fabric to increase insulation against cold. Or you can use smart materials that carry electric currents through the fibers to generate heat,"" says Ross. ""For both cooling and heating, the fabric can contain microcapsules of something a little like wax. It absorbs body heat and melts but, if you get too cool, it radiates the heat back to warm you up."""
6965,"A few performance garments, mostly aimed at skiers and motorcyclists, already use batteries to actively keep wearers warm; some heat technology companies, like Gerbing and EXO2, have even patented fabrics specifically meant for heating. Gerbing offers Nanowire and Microwire, which depend on microscopic steel strands to dissipate heat produced by lithium batteries; EXO2's patented FabRoc fabric instead encases conductive particles in a rubbery, stretchy material that President and CEO Drew Walston describes as ""a little like the inner tube of a bicycle tire."" The company is currently working on producing ThermoKnitt, a conductive, wire-free yarn."
6966,"More dynamic smart fabrics are on the way to make life even better for cyclists. ""We're embedding electronic devices into yarns that can be woven and manufactured into wearable, washable clothing,"" says Tilak Dias, a professor at Nottingham Trent University. ""We've looked at embedding LED lights in fabrics to make cyclists more visible. You can also embed sensors in the textiles and monitor a cyclist's temperature and perspiration."""
6967,"With sensors for sweat rate, air, and body temperature, merged with data from your power meter or heart rate monitor, it's only one short step to the golden fleece: a jersey so smart it can keep you in perfect comfort on every ride. This is the job for a new app from VTT, Finland's technical research center. ""Until now, the automatic control has been the missing link,"" says Pekka Tuomaala, principal scientist at VTT. ""It's difficult because everybody has different comfort levels according to the amount of muscle they have. Preferences between people can vary by as much as 6 degrees C [11 degrees F]."" With VTT's new software, he says, you can personalize your comfort settings and the data from sensors in a piece of compatible performance clothing and on your bike will continuously adjust the garment's temperature to suit your parameters. "

I didn't have room there to elaborate on a few aspects of my shop that made my workspace really shine. I offer this up because when I was researching the design of this room there were tons of blogs about garages for car mechanics, but nada for building the ideal bike room.

6973,"Locker: There may not be a more superior system for storing your bike-wear. Places like IKEA sell reproduction lockers for a fortune, but I picked up a used locker at a salvage yard for less than $100. It was painted a hideous gold so I stripped the paint off with a belt sander. It was a lot of work, but the bare metal looks really cool, and a three-bay locker is actually pretty huge, with hooks to hang stinky stuff so it airs out (thanks to the locker's vents) and shelves for stacking jerseys. Unless you have a closet in your garage or want to shell out for an expensive storage system, I can't imagine a better setup."
6974, 
6975,"Floor: Simple polished concrete. I've seen polished concrete countertops and even some kitchens done this way. I chose it because it's relatively cost-effective, you can put radiant heat right into the floor as we did, and you can dye the concrete mix a dark color so the grease you spill won't show up. The best thing about polished concrete is that it brooms off easily because of the smooth texture, and if you drop a screw or washer it won't wander into a crack between floorboards. Advice: Use an ecologically neutral sealant, like Bioshield Hard Oil. The advantage is super quick off-gassing that's non-toxic and lead-free. Often even ""green"" waxes and sealants are full of drying agents that are incredibly noxious. Not so much fun to breath that stuff in during application, and especially in the months that follow, when you're wrenching in this space."

1. Get pipe floor flanges from the hardware store and screw them to the wall.  
2. Thread T-shaped sections of pipe to these so that the ends of the T face sideways. 
3. Plug steam fittings into the T-pipes because they act as reducers for the ends of the cable. 
4. The hardware store will have ferrules that clamp to the ends of the cables to keep them from fraying; slot the cable ends through the steam fittings and then clamp the ends with the ferrules.  
5. Attach the curtain to the cable using shower curtain rings, which are also inexpensive"

7091,Electrical nerve stimulation can help alleviate muscle pain and aid in recovery—and the Omron TENS unit can help with this and more
7092,Maybe it's time to add a new tool to your recovery kit.
7093,"Chiropractors and professional athletes have long used electrical stimulation of both muscles and nerves to alleviate pain and speed recovery. Electrical muscle stimulators send low electrical signals to activate different muscle groups to help aid circulation; they're often used as an alternative or complement to massage and have become popular recovery products. Nerve stimulators work on a higher frequency to help ""reset"" neurons that might be causing painful spasms; they target specific soreness and are often used in medical pain relief therapy. "
7094,Looking for other ways to boost your recovery? Try these post-ride stretches: 
7095,"After testing a Marc Pro Plus dual muscle and nerve stimulator, one of our editors wrote that it works like a recovery ride; the electrodes stimulate your muscles to pump out waste and facilitate muscle recovery. And unlike a recovery ride, which is easy to overdo, you’re not doing anything but sitting there as the unit works. Ultimately, she says her legs felt lighter and fresher and that she ""definitely had more spring going up the stairs"" after hard rides. "

It's on sale today on Amazon for $27 (it retails for $38)."
7098,"It features 15 different intensity levels, and modes for specific pain in your lower back, shoulders, arms, feet, legs, and joints. It’s small and portable, the pads last for 150 uses, and the preset modes make it easy to get started even if you've never tried electrical stimulation before."
7099,"Accessorize your street clothes with the right winter gear.
"
7100,"Dressing for frigid temperatures as a casual-clothing commuter is not the same as gearing up for a cold-weather training ride. It's unlikely you'll wear high-tech cycling apparel--sweat-wicking base layer, wool jersey and wind- and moisture-blocking tights. No, you're just a guy or gal who has a few city blocks to travel to work or who has errands to run around town. So how do you stay warm when your base layer consists of khakis, Gold Toes and a dress shirt?"
7101, 
7102,"Be cool Step outside: You should feel comfortable--and even a little cool--but not warm. If you're toasty before you start coasting, you'll be hot when you're pedaling. That will cause you to sweat, and sweat makes you cold. Play it safe: Layer. It's easy to peel clothing off if you start to boil--and just as easy to slip it back on."
7103, 
7104,"Add accordingly Start with this advice, then fine-tune it to your comfort level. Cold: Wear medium-weight gloves, a wind- or waterproof jacket and an ear band. Colder: Add a hat under your helmet and choose heavier gloves. Coldest: Pull on a face mask and slip shoe covers over your tootsies--and maybe add windproof pants. Raining: Do what it takes to stay dry, such as a waterproof jacket and pants. After a few test rides in different temperatures, you'll start to figure out what to wear when."
7105,"The limited-edition aero wheels offer a refined ride and powerful braking—but at a price
"
7106,"After releasing a series of road wheels that accommodate disc brakes, Zipp has turned its attention back to rim models. Notably, the company has updated its highest performance road-racing aero wheel, the Zipp 404 Firestrike, and created a new version of that model for tubular tires."
7107,"	Zipp released the first Firestrike in June 2014 as an improvement to its popular 404 Firecrest carbon clincher. The newer model had a brake track topped with silicon carbide, which offered better performance in wet conditions. Though slightly wider than a Firecrest (26.4mm compared with 24.7mm), the Firestrike was just as aerodynamic, and it handled better and felt more stable in the wind. At the time, Zipp developed a new rear hub that improved lateral stiffness and used a pre-set bearing preload system instead of the previous adjustable version. The wheels also had ceramic bearings (the Firecrest came with steel)."
7108,"	The new 404 Firestrike Carbon Clincher Limited features all that exciting tech and gets new quick releases, brand-name Ceramic Speed bearings, and Silca’s no-rattle valve extenders. Zipp claims the wheels weigh 1,620 grams—about the same as the previous model—and the cost remains a hearty $3,600."
7109,"	The new Zipp 404 Firestrike Tubular Limited (also $3,600) uses the same hub, spoke pattern, brake track, and rim dimensions as the clincher. It also receives the same bearing, quick-release, and valve extender updates. The tubular version differs in some ways, however. It has a different layup, tooling, and molding process that Zipp claims make the rim more durable and better able to survive cross races or punishing cobblestones. Zipp brands the process Carbon Shield, and it’s available only on the tubular version. The rims have a tire interface designed for tubulars, which reduces weight. A set comes in at 1,395 grams."
7110,"	With the new wheels, Zipp also added the word “Limited” to the model name and will only produce 404 models (see what they did there?). In a press release announcing the wheels, Zipp says, “As new designs, technologies and manufacturing techniques are proven, they are rolled into new versions of the 404 Firestrike.” Given the limited production, it seems as if Zipp might position the Firestrike models as fast-evolving, skunk-works type products available to the public."
7111,"	I have some time on the previous 404 Firestrike carbon clincher. Functionally it is the same as the new version and on my scale a set weighs 1,644 grams, not far from what Zipp claims the Limited version comes in at. But before I discuss performance, some perspective is important: These are by far some of the most expensive widely available carbon clincher rims, and among the heaviest of the top performers."
7112,	Here’s a chart of the most common premium carbon clinchers.
7113,"Zipp’s premium price is clearly not getting you category-leading weight. But the wheels do provide class-leading brake performance. It’s fantastic (for a rim-brake wheel) in the wet. Better than any carbon clincher I’ve used and easily comparable to, and even exceeding some aluminum brake tracks. It initially feels a bit too grabby in dry conditions, though that sensation subsides with time and experience. Hopefully Zipp will add the Firestrike’s braking features to all its carbon wheels."
7114,"	They still can’t touch the wet-weather braking of disc brakes, but not everyone is ready to make the leap to discs. So if you value wet-weather braking, and are committed to rim brakes, the Firestrikes can’t be beat. It might be a Pyrrhic victory, however. Zipp’s competitors have been significantly improving the braking performance of their carbon wheels. Bontrager, Campagnolo, Enve, and even Zipp (pre-Firecrest) offer very good braking. Good enough that it’s becoming harder to justify the premium price and extra weight of the 404s."
7115,"	Firestrikes are not quiet wheels. They make the whoosh-y noise, and amplify and echo other sounds. They sound like they should ride firm and harsh, but the ride is actually quite lovely: compliant, lively, with a nice feel of the road. Of the carbon clinchers I’ve tried, Zipp and Bontrager are the class leaders here."
7116,"	Stiffness was also very good. I didn’t sense much in the way of windup or lateral deflection even when I went full-gas. The front wheel was sharp and reactive when turned into corners, and the wheels tracked precisely, with a bit of compliance that helped me stay on line through bumpier corners. The rear hub’s drive mechanism sounds like a precision instrument, engages reasonably quickly, and didn’t pop or skip. The hubs did not develop any play, and I heard no groans or creaks from the wheelset. But I’m not a heavy guy, nor do I put out watts like Cavendish."
7117,"	Though they accelerate with purpose, the 404 Firestrikes are not zippy wheels. This is the compromise of deeper rims: Their aerodynamics should take you farther, faster, with less effort, but you’re sacrificing quickness. Riders who are attentive, attuned to performance, or fluent in the language of power meters might detect the extra speed an aerodynamic wheel like the 404 Firestrike can deliver. But riders who only want a bike that feels quick and lively will likely be happier with a light wheel like Zipp’s 202."
7118,"	I found the 404s delightfully stable on windy rides and they even outperformed some much shallower wheels. They still get pushed around some but far less than many aero wheels I’ve tested. The final point is a small detail, but one I appreciated. I could mount tires easily and without tools, which made fixing a flat mid-ride a more pleasant experience."
7119,"	These wheels aren’t for anyone, and Zipp knows that—they’re crazy expensive, relatively heavy, and hard to find. But they offer excellent braking in wet conditions, well-rounded performance, and Zipp’s aerodynamic expertise. The 404s are not finicky wheels either and can be used as a daily driver or reserved for race day. To the right cyclist, that’s worth a lot, and Zipp’s betting that there are 404 riders who agree."

	You don’t know how a bike truly fits or handles until you’ve hopped in the saddle and taken it for a test spin.

7124,"Don’t Test a Bike at a Shop, Then Buy Online
	Definitely test ride a bike at your local shop and bombard the salesperson with any questions you may have, but don’t use that knowledge to buy the same bike online for a few bucks less. That’s bad form. And whatever you do, don’t expect more free advice when you bring the bike you bought online into that same shop to fix a problem.  "
7125,"“Our time is worth money,” said Adam Rodkey, a manager at Bikesmiths in Bloomington, Indiana. “If I’m giving you my expertise to make someone else money, well, that’s just bad business.”"
7126,"Don’t Visit Just One Shop or Ride Just One Bike
	Brand loyalty can be a great thing, but just because you’ve always ridden Cannondale bikes, it doesn’t mean you can’t experience how a Santa Cruz or a Salsa rides. You’ll either reaffirm your love for Cannondale or find a bike that fits you even better. Either way, it’s a win."
7127,"Don’t Settle on a Bike
	If you don’t like the way a bike handles or looks, or it doesn’t fit quite right, don’t buy it just because you’re getting a great deal. You'll likely own the bike for several years and spend plenty of hours on it, which means you should be really comfortable with the package you're getting."
7128,"“A friend was buying his dream bike, a [Pinarello] Dogma, not too long ago,” says John Gatch, mechanic for the Lionhearts Developmental Team in Cincinnati. “He could have gotten a black-on-black model right then, or he could wait until June and get the silver-on-black model he really wanted. He knew if he got the black-on-black Dogma, it would bother him every time he went on a ride. He didn’t want to be kicking himself, wondering why he didn’t just wait a couple of months.” "
7129,"Don’t Be Reluctant to Engage the Salesperson
	The Internet is filled with information about various bikes, so it’s easy to think you don’t need assistance. But many bike companies offer specialized online training on their models to shop staff, Kuchy said, giving them access to information you may have overlooked. "

	“Be honest about the type of riding you will do and then focus on those strengths when bike shopping,” O’Donnell says. “Don't buy a pure race bike, then complain because it’s uncomfortable on centuries."" Beware of any bike that needs significant modification to work for you—component swaps get expensive, and large fit adjustments (like adding a stack of headset spacers or a super-long stem) can change the character of the bike completely. A few tweaks are fine, but if you find yourself with a long list of things you'd like to switch, shop around to see if there's another bike that better fits your needs."
7133,"Don’t Skip the Accessories
	Many new riders budget a certain amount for a bike, but completely forget about the accessories they'll need, according to Colin Kuchy, a territory manager for Trek. At the very least, Kuchy suggests walking out with a helmet, quality shorts with chamois padding, a floor pump, bottle cages, and bike lights. Spare tubes, tire levers, and either a small pump or CO2 inflator and cartridges are also must-buys. "
7134,"Don’t Forget to Ask about Discounts and Special Offers
	Buying a bike is a lot like buying a car: You may love that gorgeous Subaru sitting on the lot, but you’re not going to buy it without haggling with a salesperson. Why should it be any different when you’re buying a Specialized? You may or may not be successful—profit margins on new bikes typically are fairly small—but you can often negotiate a discount on higher-margin accessories pretty easily. "
7135,"Don’t Skimp on a Proper Fit
	Have the salesperson confirm you’re buying the right-sized bike, then make an appointment with the shop’s professional fitter to get everything dialed. Most decent-sized shops have some type of bike-fitting service, whether it’s an old-school set up with a plumb bob and a tape measure, a more high-tech Retul 3D motion-capture system, or something in between."
7136,"“Riding an ill-fitting bike is like driving a nice sports car with four of those little spare-tire donut wheels,” Gatch says. “You’re not only wasting watts without a good fit, you’re also risking (a repetitive stress) injury.”"
7137,"Don’t Walk out of the Shop Forever After You Buy
	When you buy a bike at a shop, you’re also entering into a relationship. Many local shops offer a complimentary 30-day tune-up and free adjustments for at least the first year, not to mention advice and expertise. Don’t know how to change a flat or properly lube your chain? See if the shop offers any maintenance clinics, or ask the shop wrench to show you how. (If they don't, sign up for our online maintenance class through RodaleU.) Many mechanics will gladly walk you through the steps of routine maintenance and basic repairs, especially on slow days. "
7138,"Don’t Rule Out a Custom Bike
	If you’re an experienced rider who can’t seem to find a bike with the particular qualities you desire, consider having one custom-built. After getting a client’s measurements, O’Donnell will ask about his or her experiences with previous bikes, including what characteristics they loved and what they didn’t like; component and paint choices; and, of course, budget. O’Donnell documents every step of the process—from the steel tubes being cut, to the frame returning from the painter—and shares photos with the client through e-mail and social media. In the end, the customer gets a gorgeous bike built exactly to his or her specifications for less than the cost of a super-high-end race bike."

	If you don’t like the way a bike handles or looks, or it doesn’t fit quite right, don’t buy it just because you’re getting a great deal. You'll likely own the bike for several years and spend plenty of hours on it, which means you should be really comfortable with the package you're getting."
7148,"“A friend was buying his dream bike, a [Pinarello] Dogma, not too long ago,” says John Gatch, mechanic for the Lionhearts Developmental Team in Cincinnati. “He could have gotten a black-on-black model right then, or he could wait until June and get the silver-on-black model he really wanted. He knew if he got the black-on-black Dogma, it would bother him every time he went on a ride. He didn’t want to be kicking himself, wondering why he didn’t just wait a couple of months.” "
7149,"Don’t Be Reluctant to Engage the Salesperson
	The Internet is filled with information about various bikes, so it’s easy to think you don’t need assistance. But many bike companies offer specialized online training on their models to shop staff, Kuchy said, giving them access to information you may have overlooked. "
7150,"“Make sure the salesperson is asking you just as many questions as you are asking them,” says Tim Mendoza, manager at Plano Cycles in Plano, Texas. “A good shop with good staff should be trying to benefit the customer first, not just land a sale.”"

7152,"Don't Buy a Bike that Doesn't Align with Your Riding Goals
	“Be honest about the type of riding you will do and then focus on those strengths when bike shopping,” O’Donnell says. “Don't buy a pure race bike, then complain because it’s uncomfortable on centuries."" Beware of any bike that needs significant modification to work for you—component swaps get expensive, and large fit adjustments (like adding a stack of headset spacers or a super-long stem) can change the character of the bike completely. A few tweaks are fine, but if you find yourself with a long list of things you'd like to switch, shop around to see if there's another bike that better fits your needs."
7153,"Don’t Skip the Accessories
	Many new riders budget a certain amount for a bike, but completely forget about the accessories they'll need, according to Colin Kuchy, a territory manager for Trek. At the very least, Kuchy suggests walking out with a helmet, quality shorts with chamois padding, a floor pump, bottle cages, and bike lights. Spare tubes, tire levers, and either a small pump or CO2 inflator and cartridges are also must-buys. "
7154,"Don’t Forget to Ask about Discounts and Special Offers
	Buying a bike is a lot like buying a car: You may love that gorgeous Subaru sitting on the lot, but you’re not going to buy it without haggling with a salesperson. Why should it be any different when you’re buying a Specialized? You may or may not be successful—profit margins on new bikes typically are fairly small—but you can often negotiate a discount on higher-margin accessories pretty easily. "
7155,"Don’t Skimp on a Proper Fit
	Have the salesperson confirm you’re buying the right-sized bike, then make an appointment with the shop’s professional fitter to get everything dialed. Most decent-sized shops have some type of bike-fitting service, whether it’s an old-school set up with a plumb bob and a tape measure, a more high-tech Retul 3D motion-capture system, or something in between."
7156,"“Riding an ill-fitting bike is like driving a nice sports car with four of those little spare-tire donut wheels,” Gatch says. “You’re not only wasting watts without a good fit, you’re also risking (a repetitive stress) injury.”"
7157,"Don’t Walk out of the Shop Forever After You Buy
	When you buy a bike at a shop, you’re also entering into a relationship. Many local shops offer a complimentary 30-day tune-up and free adjustments for at least the first year, not to mention advice and expertise. Don’t know how to change a flat or properly lube your chain? See if the shop offers any maintenance clinics, or ask the shop wrench to show you how. (If they don't, sign up for our online maintenance class through RodaleU.) Many mechanics will gladly walk you through the steps of routine maintenance and basic repairs, especially on slow days. "
7158,"Don’t Rule Out a Custom Bike
	If you’re an experienced rider who can’t seem to find a bike with the particular qualities you desire, consider having one custom-built. After getting a client’s measurements, O’Donnell will ask about his or her experiences with previous bikes, including what characteristics they loved and what they didn’t like; component and paint choices; and, of course, budget. O’Donnell documents every step of the process—from the steel tubes being cut, to the frame returning from the painter—and shares photos with the client through e-mail and social media. In the end, the customer gets a gorgeous bike built exactly to his or her specifications for less than the cost of a super-high-end race bike."
7159,Here are some more reasons why you might want to consider going custom:
7160,"The new high-performance shoes feel great, whether you're riding or scrambling over rocks. "
7161,"Finding a comfortable, quality shoe that fits—that’s the stuff of legends and fairy godmothers, right? The demands of mountain biking dictate that shoes be stiff and rugged, that they can be worn all day, and that we can walk easily in them when the trail becomes too difficult to ride. Finding one that meets all those requirements is not at easy task."
7162, 
7163,"Pearl Izumi, however, believes it has just designed the perfect shoe—no magic wand required. The new X Project line is built around the idea that mountain bike shoes can be stiff and comfortable, and the shoes incorporate some intriguing designs to get the job done. They use a flexible carbon sole that Pearl says is rigid enough to deliver power to the pedals yet flexes when you’re walking or running. According to Pearl, the sole has the same power transfer as its top-of-the-line mountain bike shoe."
7164, 
7165,"X Project shoes also use a full-length, but tapered, carbon plate that aids in power transfer without restricting the shoe’s flexibility. An EVA foam heel helps absorb trail impacts and co-molded rubber tips on hollow lugs should provide better traction than the hard plastic lugs on many shoes."
7166, 
7167,"This isn’t the company’s first alternative to the traditional cross-country mountain bike shoe. The company’s X-Alp line uses lace enclosures and soft rubber soles. The models resemble trail-running shoes more than mountain bike footwear. But those shoes sacrifice efficiency and performance for comfort. The X Project is something else. The shoes were designed with input from two of Pearl’s pro riders, Brian Lopes and Ross Schnell, and are targeted to mountain bikers who demand pedaling efficiency, but also crave comfort and versatility on and off the bike."

7174, 
7175,"We tried on a pair of X Project 1.0 shoes and took them for a quick spin at Bootleg Canyon near Las Vegas. True to Pearl’s claims, they were remarkably easy to walk in, offered good power transfer and fit about as well as any other high-performance shoe we’ve worn. They weren’t quite as comfortable as a slipper, but it was close."

7210,The Vivax model is similar to what pros would use to motor dope—and this is how it feels to ride it
7211,"Over the past few years, e-bikes have exploded in popularity—they’re quickly gaining market share with commuters, cargo bike riders, and mountain bikers. But there’s one subset of e-bikes that is a bit lesser-known: Those that look almost exactly like regular, non-electric models.  "
7212,"These bikes have motors that are tucked away in the frames of traditional road bikes, with batteries hidden in seat packs or water bottles. They’re in the news lately, thanks to accusations of “motor doping” in the pro ranks, but they're easily available to the masses as well. There are two main brands that offer kits to consumers: Typhoon and Vivax. "
7213,"We took a trip to Greenwich, CT, to visit Signature Cycles, the US distributor of the Vivax Assist brand of hidden motors. We got a first-hand look at the system and how it’s installed, and we were able to take a short test ride on a bike equipped with it. "
7214,Signature’s owner Paul Levine and head mechanic Justin Bagnati walked us through the particulars of the system and dispelled some of the mystique surrounding the Vivax and similar systems. 
7215,"How it Works
	The Vivax motor needs to be housed in a frame that’s built specifically to accommodate added stress from the motor and to integrate the wires and battery. Signature currently works with Seven Cycles and Parlee for frames able to accept the motor, and Vivax itself also offers frames.  "
7216,     RELATED: Are Tour de France Racers Cheating with Secret Motors? 
7217,"Once installed, the Vivax is pretty impressive: It’s small, quiet (but not soundless), and lightweight. The motor is a 200-watt output unit that delivers a claimed 100- to 110-watt boost to the drivetrain. Run time is a claimed 90 minutes with the stock battery, though there are smaller batteries available that offer the same wattage boost over a shorter duration. The motor has a bevel gear that mates to a corresponding gear held to the spindle of a 24mm crankset with a pressed collet. (Currently it works best with Shimano Hollowtech cranks and can be made to work with FSA. According to Bagnati, SRAM cranks are a no-go because of the stepped spindle.) On the bike we tested, the battery was rather large and housed in a saddlebag. The system comes stock with a bullet-shaped trigger that is about 1.5 inches long, but on this model, a cleaner-looking SRAM eTap “Blip” shifter located on the handlebar triggered the motor. "
7218,
7219,
7220,Bagnati says that adapting a bike to the Vivax system isn’t as simple as purchasing the motor and slipping it into the seat tube. The frame you’re using needs to have an internal diameter of 31.6 straight through the seat tube's length. Two small holes located at a precise distance just above the bottom bracket allow the motor to be pinned in place. The gear on the crank spindle requires a bottom bracket with threaded English cups that have been machined out on the inside to pass over the collet and drive ring. The whole system adds about four pounds to the overall weight of the bike—a weight somewhere in the neighborhood two full water bottles. 
7221,"Who’s Interested
	Levine says that the Vivax system is the same type that could be used to cheat in the pro peloton, but when asked about his own clientele, he describes a much different rider: those who need just a bit of a boost to get over the climbs or some extra oomph to stay with a group. Of course, that doesn't come cheap: The Vivax system is about $3,500 on its own; add a custom frame and premium build, and it's no surprise that bikes start at $9,700.  Levine says his Vivax customers are generally well-heeled and slightly older. They are interested in multi-day trips in the Alps, guided tours with groups, and maintaining the speed they are accustomed to from years of riding but perhaps no longer able to sustain. They're also particular about the aesthetics of their bikes and praise the system’s ability to be out of sight on what appears to be a standard road bike. Other benefits are the ability to only use the motor when you need that extra kick, and the low weight. That weight renders the bike light enough to use even without the motor engaged."
7222,     RELATED: This Is How Motor Doping Works
7223,"How it Feels
	I got to ride the bike for about 45 minutes on rolling hills just outside Greenwich. It was an excellent place to get acquainted with the system and how it dovetails with your riding. "
7224,"First, a word about setup:  The Vivax should be set for the rate you are pedaling to provide the best experience. If you spin at 90rpm, you will get the most benefit from the Vivax by having it set to that speed. Conversely, if you are someone who turns the cranks at a lower rate (70rpm for example), you can set the motor to that speed for the best power output.  It can also be adjusted while riding if the terrain you are on is changing—say, from the flats to sustained climbing. By holding down the trigger for five seconds, the motor will reset to the cadence you’re currently riding. Ideally, the motor should be toggled off by pressing the trigger before you stop pedaling. If you don’t, it will automatically kick out of assist mode almost instantaneously and you’ll be under your own power—but not before it delivers a small kick, much like the one you get when mistakenly trying to coast on a fixed gear bike. That sensation was more pronounced at lower speeds than high when I tried it during the ride. "
7225,"There is only one setting to the Vivax. It’s either on, delivering the promised 100-110 watts, or off and not holding you back. "
7226,"The first thing I noticed while riding was the sound of the motor. It’s quiet enough that with traffic noise or in the midst of a pack or a crowd it would be almost undetectable. But riding two-up on a quiet road, it’s noticeable. I also quickly learned that there is a sweet spot to the motor and that riding more than about 10 rpm above or below the set cadence resulted in either a whine as you over-drove the motor, or a heavy drone as you lugged it and the motor slowed down below where it wanted to be. People familiar with driving a stick shift automobile will readily understand what I’m talking about. "
7227,
7228,
7229,"Once you hit the button to trigger the motor the extra power is noticeable. It’s not the huge boost of a regular e-bike; it’s more the feeling of having a really good, heavy tailwind. You’re still working—there is no getting around that fact—but even getting up the steepest hills we rode (about 22 percent for a quarter of a mile), I still felt like I wasn’t digging as deep as I would need to when unassisted. Prior to riding, I had also wondered whether there would be drag on the drivetrain when the motor was disengaged; there wasn’t when driving the cranks forward, though when backpedaling, you could hear the motor whine just a tiny bit and feel some resistance. It wasn’t enough to “droop” the chain or cause a dead spot in your pedal stroke when you started pedaling forward again, and so it wouldn’t upset your riding when you are setting up for a corner or leveling your cranks. "
7230,"The power comes on seamlessly; at the touch of the bar-mounted button, there’s that tailwind feeling. You can use the noise of the motor to match your cadence to it. After just a few minutes of riding, I was attuned to it well enough to use the sound to help me know when to turn the motor off, reset the cadence to a different setting, or guide my personal spin back in sync with what the motor was set at. "
7231,"I came away impressed. The Vivax is a well-refined system that delivered on its promise of seamlessly incorporating a small motor to an otherwise normal bike. It’s simple to operate, doesn’t add much weight to a bike, and seems to be well made. Its price may put it out of reach of most mortal riders, but for those that can afford it, it's pretty neat. "

7239,"A fast, comfortable, and off-road-capable bike that’s up for the wide variety of road riding that most of us do"
7240,"This Canyon is emblematic of something pretty cool happening to road bikes right now. A new kind of bike is emerging that offers most of the speed of a race bike, with much more comfort, more sedate handling, and a more upright riding position—without taking it too far and watering down the fun. With disc brakes and clearance for big tires, these bikes deliver better braking, better traction and control, and handling that inspires more confidence on a wider range of surfaces. We think these bikes—the Endurace and similar models like the BMC Roadmachine and the latest version of the Specialized Roubaix—are a big win for most riders."
7241,"The name Endurace is a portmanteau of endurance and race. From the endurance category comes the clearance for up to 33mm-wide tires (officially, though I found room for larger), frame geometry that leans toward stability (longer chainstays, lower bottom bracket, relaxed steering), and a greater emphasis on rider comfort—via both body position and compliance—than a pure road-racing bike. From the race genre, the carbon frame is stiff, light (820g with a 325g fork, claimed), and has some aerodynamic tweaks."
7242,Get an in-depth look at the CF SLX:
7243,"The bike has a one-piece, aerodynamic carbon bar and stem; a leaf-spring suspension seatpost; disc brakes; and gearing that is more race oriented—36/52 chainrings and an 11-28 cassette—than a compact. Look at it and you think, race bike; ride it, and it’s clearly not, mainly because the position and handling are, respectively, more comfortable and serene. One tester, who likes the feel of race bikes even though she doesn’t race, thought the Endurace was too smooth and stable for her tastes—“sleepy,” she called it. But for these same reasons, I think the Endurace is a great bike."
7244,"     RELATED: The Best Road Bikes Under $1,500"
7245,"It is indeed stable, and the handling is swoopy, confidence-inspiring, and predictable: great on mixed surfaces, but just sharp enough that it’s also entertaining to pitch through tight corners on pavement—there is just a touch of initial resistance in the bar before the bike dips into a turn and locks into a line. You can chase PRs on paved climbs and it won’t feel like it’s holding you back. You can ride it all day on dirt roads and not feel like you’re on the wrong bike."
7246,"It’s compliant without feeling soft or sluggish—the post is smooth, not bouncy. While other bikes with rear-only suspension systems—like the Pinarello K8-S and the original Trek Domane—have had a noticeable imbalance in front and rear compliance, the Endurace felt uniform throughout. I like this bike because it’s just a bike for riding roads, paved or dirt. And it challenges the notion that an “endurance” model has to be sluggish or boring. It is a highly technical bike, but it makes riding so simple: You grab it, hop on, and see where it takes you. And you have a great time, no matter how you get there."

7255,A road helmet that fits in on the trails
7256,"Smith’s Route MIPS is nominally a road helmet, but its styling is neither road-aero nor all-mountain chunky, so no one will bat an eye if you show up to the trailhead with it. The big aesthetic departure in the Route is also its chief technical attribute: the green Koroyd panels on the side vents."
7257,     RELATED: The Ten Best Bike Helmets
7258,"Koroyd is a series of very thin plastic tubes (with a wall thickness of less than a tenth of a millimeter) that are thermally welded into a honeycomb-like structure. On impact, the structure crushes like the EPS foam used elsewhere in the helmet, but at a different rate; that makes it more able to absorb lower-energy impacts that are still dangerous for closed-head injuries like concussions. Smith currently has an exclusive license on the technology but incorporates it on just two panels on the Route, as opposed to a full Koroyd and EPS shell on the pricier Smith Overtake. Smith also outfits the Route with a MIPS (Multi-directional Impact Protection System) slip-plane liner to help mitigate rotational forces in a crash."
7259,"I tested the Route MIPS in September and October during a long “second summer” with highs that routinely neared 80 degrees. Some Overtake users have noted the helmet feels hotter than conventionally vented lids; I didn’t notice that with the Route, but that might be because the three central intake vents and exhaust vents are conventional. I did find it to be a little noisier at speed compared to a Giro Synthe MIPS. The Koroyd panels also prevent you from sliding sunglass temples between the vents; instead, the temples have to clasp the outside of the vent ribs. It’s generally secure but takes some practice to get the placement down, and at 333 grams, it’s a little heavier than comparable helmets from Giro and Bell. But those are mostly aesthetic concerns. The Route is an attractive and versatile helmet that’s $70 less than the Overtake, with much of the same tech."

The new model has a lot of important changes: It has a new frame that has a slacker head angle and shorter stays; the BRAIN shock is gone; and the bike is available in three wheel sizes (27.5, 27.5+, and 29er). But it’s the Specialized Stumpjumper’s SWAT door that makes me swoon."

The Yeti SB5c, for instance, is one of the better bikes I’ve ridden, but it wouldn’t work if engineers had to fit the shock and suspension linkages around a water bottle."

7268,"But, sometimes I just want to leave the damn pack at home. It’s heavy, creates pressure points and sweaty spots, and even the best ones bounce around, restrict movement, and mess with my center of gravity. I ride with one because I have to, not because I want to. I know I’m not alone. I’ve seen riders strap tubes and tools all over their frames and stuff their pockets full. Even the formerly ridiculed fanny-pack––which is smaller than a hydration pack and carries weight lower––has made a comeback as mountain bikers search for an alternative."
7269,"Specialized’s SWAT Door is a welcome tool in the revolution against the hydration pack. By giving me a space to store tools, food, and a jacket, it frees me to ride less encumbered. I feel lighter, and less restricted—it’s liberating. Sure, this little trap door might seem silly, but it’s led me to smile more on rides, and that’s bigger to me than a shock tune or geometry change."

I live in a suburban development carved into cornfields, work a 40-minute drive away, and my most bikeable shopping possibility is a never-easy 6-mile round-trip (thanks to a steep, mile-long climb). Elegantly clunky Euro-style bikes aren’t up to the riding I do, and bikes built for the distance and terrain (and speed) don’t match my idea of what riding should be like in my dream of commuting, hitting the farmers’ market, and riding to dinner on a single bike.
Then I saw the Sweetpea A-Line, a steel step-through with a light wheelset, slick tires, and a hill-friendly triple chainring. Designed by Natalie Ramsland in Portland, Oregon, it looked to have the heart of a road bike and the soul of a city bike. Ramsland’s made-to-order bikes have a years-long wait list, but this is part of her Lust line, built in standard and custom sizes and available in months.

The Boulder Bicycle Rando is designed to excel at randonnees—nonstop, long-distance, self-supported events that are not quite races but require riders to hit checkpoints by designated times. Most randonnee bikes, including this one, are durable and designed to carry high front loads (like the Gilles Berthoud bag), equipped with lights and fenders, are stable without feeling sluggish, and at slower speeds feel natural instead of soporific (as race bikes tend to when you noodle them along). Despite how it looks, this bike isn’t made for touring, says Mike Kone, the owner and designer of Boulder Bicycle. The frames generally aren’t rigid enough to be loaded up in the back, he says. “We don’t have eyelets on the rear because we don’t want to invite loads the bike isn’t intended to handle.” Forgoing the stiffness and strength required to handle a rear rack makes the Boulder livelier, lighter, and sweeter-riding than a truckish touring bike. And, in my opinion, better looking.—Matt PhillipsRead Matt’s full Boulder Bicycle Rando review."

The Runwell is one of my dream rides because, simply, it’s a dream to ride. It’s not a pure version of the porteur delivery bike—its design favors versatility over absolute performance under burden. The ride reaches its best confluence of agility and steadiness with five to 10 pounds in the rack but still feels good with up to 20 pounds or—as some don’t—with nothing. With freight I wouldn’t have wanted in a bag on my back, and that would have fizzled the fun out of the ride had it been on a rear-wheel rack or in panniers, I swooped turns, burst away from stoplights, stood to muscle my way up steep hills, outsprinted dogs and cocky BMX kids, and leapt potholes.

7364,"But a few days before this latest Yeti launch, a PDF was emailed to me with all the details about its latest bike, the SB5.5c. Before I could see or ride the bike, I was able to scan the details on paper: 29-inch wheels, 140mm rear travel; 160mm FOX 36 fork; 66.5-degree head tube angle."
7365,"“Dear god, what a huge bike,” I thought. I expected something even beastlier than Yeti’s 160mm 27.5-inch wheel enduro bike, the SB6c. But I was surprised to discover that the 5.5c is a much livelier and trail-friendly bike than I anticipated, while just as capable as I guessed."
7366,
7367,
7368,"Racer’s Request
	Yeti’s president Chris Conroy says the 5.5c was made at the request of the brand's enduro team. “This came directly out of our racers noticing that on certain courses 29-inch wheels were just flat faster,"" he says Riders were on the 4.5c, but wanted something longer travel that was still super maneuverable. ""When you compare it to the 6c, which is a pure enduro machine, the 5.5c is a little more playful, a little less travel. So on courses that are super rough and they needed to move [the bike] around a bunch, [the 5.5c] will suit that really well. What we found after we made it was that became the favorite trail bike of everybody internally.”"
7369,"The 5.5c’s chain stays are 17.2 inches, quite short for a 29er with this much travel, and, in Yeti’s style, the frames have low-ish bottom brackets (346mm), longish top tubes (601mm, size medium), and the previously mentioned 66.5 degree head angle, which Yeti pairs with a 51mm offset fork."
7370,
7371,
7372,"The 5.5c is the fourth frame to use Yeti’s Switch Infinity suspension system. “Each model is fine-tuned for its specific inputs: geometry, travel, specific shock, typical chainring size, etc., but the distinct Yeti feel is maintained across the line,” Yeti’s engineering director Peter Zawistowski told me. “This is one of the advantages of Switch Infinity: that the system can be easily tuned—with consistent behavior—over a large range of travel and wheel sizes.” Though the stock shock on the 5.5c is the FOX Float X DPS, the bike is coil-spring friendly."

	Yeti unveiled this bike to the press in Moab, Utah, where we rode the new SB5.5c on Hymasa, Rockstacker, Captain Ahab, Porcupine Rim, and some of the Navajo Rocks trails. After the launch, I brought a sample home with me to Durango, Colorado where I took the new Yeti on some of my favorite test loops. In all, I was able to ride the 5.5c on a variety of terrain: fast and open, slow and techy, extended climbs, chunder, smooth, steep, pedal-y."
7384,"What surprised me most about the 5.5c is how capable it is in slower, tighter terrain. On the same trails that riding the 6c was such a fight, the 5.5c was nearly nimble. It pivoted around tight switchbacks—uphill and downhill—very well, and it pedals very efficiently, so it picks up needed momentum quickly. Pedal strikes weren’t much of an issue either, so I could keep my momentum going: BB height is 346mm (13.66 inches), which is low-ish, but not crazy low these days, and the rear suspension doesn’t wallow mid-stroke."
7385,
7386,
7387,"With that kind of adept handling, the big wheels and big travel were less of a burden in the slower, tighter, techier terrain that I had anticipated: The 5.5c was not as huge a bike as I had feared."
7388,"To be clear, my surprise was relative to expectations. The 5.5c still is a bigger, heavier, slower bike: This is a big gun, and there are a lot of situations—mellower/smoother trail riding, tighter trails, steeper and longer climbing—when a smaller bike like the 4.5c is quicker, easier and, to me, more fun to ride."
7389,

With the 5.5c, the rider feels like they’re always getting the full benefit of the 140mm—yeah, it’s plush—with good mid-stroke support, no harsh bottom-out. Personally, I’d like the bike to be a touch more initial sensitivity, and a little more end-of-stroke progression, but I think I can get there with with the stock shock and air volume spacers and more setup time. But I’m also very curious to see what the 5.5c rides like with a coil shock. Another small suspension complaint: Yeti specs the FOX 36 with FIT4 damper, but I’d prefer to see the more adjustable HSC/LSC damper with independently-adjustable high and low speed compression damping on this bike."

7396,"The handling follows the what I expected/not what I expected theme as well. I think most riders will be surprised to find how tight and quick this bike handles based on its numbers; I know I was. It’s actually a reasonably flickable and playful bike that, mostly, doesn’t handle like a 66.5-degree head angle would let on. Will serious enduro riders find it too quick? Time will tell: Yeti’s Richie Rude, the current World Enduro Series Champion, hasn't used the 5.5c in competition yet."
7397,"But, flickable as it is, it still has slack geometry and long travel: It’s hard for an average-ish rider like me to describe the 5.5c as anything other than stable, planted, and composed. The rider sits in this bike, and with the short stays, it’s very easy to get way back, or to pick up the front wheel when necessary. Basically, the strategy for riding the 5.5c is to point it in the general direction you want to go, hold on, and hope you have enough air in the tires."

It’s more bike than the 5c; a better and faster descender and smoother though rough trails, but also less playful and less quick. But compared to the 6c, the 5.5c is livelier, more versatile, and easier to ride in less-than-extreme terrain. The 6c is so much bike that I don’t love trail riding with it, but the 5.5c is quick and fun enough that in mellower terrain it doesn’t feel like you’re doing fine upholstery work with a sledgehammer."

"
7499,"For a company that essentially started the road wheel ""system” approach, Mavic had fallen a bit behind the pack in recent years.
	As other companies unveiled carbon clinchers and wide-aerodynamic designs, Mavic made refinements to existing, traditional wheels. There are two ways to look at the trend: Either Mavic was starting to drop off the back, or the company was rightly cautious about the limits of technology, like carbon fiber clinchers under heavy braking.
	But for 2016, the Mavic road wheel line is starting to become bolder. The company’s new product line includes a lightweight, all-carbon wheel, the Ksyrium Pro Carbon, and a disc wheelset designed expressly for riders who spend a lot of time off the pavement, called the Ksyrium Pro Allroad Disc.
	In a sign of the coming look of road bikes, even the Pro Carbon model is available as a disc wheelset, with axle compatibility for conventional open dropouts with quick releases, as well as 12- and 15mm front thru axles and 15x135 or 142mm rear thru axles.
	Even as it moves forward, Mavic is doing so cautiously. Many of the changes are subtle, for example that Mavic is widening internal rim widths on many of its new road wheels from 15mm to 17mm, which allows wider tires. Here’s a look at the new wheels.Ksyrium Pro Allroad Disc
	The Allroad is designed expressly for mixed surfaces. At first glance, it’s a rebadged Crossmax SL 29 mountain bike wheel. But Mavic’s Road Product Manager, Maxime Brunand, contends that it's different. The model gets a different rim extrusion and 24 spokes because, he says, the company’s testing shows gravel riding on skinny tires actually is harder on a wheel than mountain biking. The wheel gets a new freehub, called Instant Drive 360, with faster engagement. And the wheels use swappable inserts to convert between different axle standards."

7501,     RELATED: 5 Road Tires We Love
7502,"Ksyrium Pro Carbon
	The rim-brake versions build on the technologies Mavic used with its mid-aero CC40 wheel. Mainly, that’s a refinement to what Mavic calls its TgMAX brake track. On the CC40, the carbon surface is lightly machined to provide a more even and consistent braking feel; for the Pro Carbon model, the sidewalls are laser-machined to improve the precision of the machining process. An 80-gram aluminum rim insert on the clincher version helps to dissipate heat and resist impacts. The Pro Carbon is available in clincher (SL C) or tubular (SL T) versions, and for rim or disc brakes."

Mavic says this reduces pressure."

7507,"The padding itself uses a gel layer from Ortholite, which makes footbeds and apparel padding for various companies. Mavic says the Ortholite dramatically reduces vibration. It claims its testing showed that for larger bumps and jolts, Ortholite gel absorbs impacts in 10 milliseconds, compared to about 150 milliseconds for conventional material, and transfers less shock. The chamois pad comes in two sizes based on rider size, and there’s a women’s version as well.First Impressions
	We ride-tested both the Pro Allroad Disc and Pro Carbon (rim) models in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Our first day was a 71-mile journey that started in Idaho, circumnavigating the north side of the Tetons via roads that varied from a two-track on a decommissioned rail grade to smooth crusher-fine gravel, to rocky forest service access-road steeps.
	Our rides for the day were Cannondale Synapse Disc bikes with Allroad Disc wheels and 30mm Yksion Elite tires. The wheels held up solidly, even as bumpy high-speed descents caused many water bottles to spontaneously eject from cages. The Yksion Elite tires had surprisingly good grip for an inverted-tread design, and even in looser conditions never felt unpredictable. The center stripe rolled smoothly on the final pavement section, but flat protection is a bit unknown as our group suffered a number of punctures despite relatively high pressures.
	The second day was a 50-mile ride back to Jackson with the majestic Tetons overlooking our progress. I was aboard a BH Quartz with Pro Carbon SL C wheels. On an out-and-back ascent of Signal Mountain, the SL C wheels performed admirably. On the ascent, spinup and acceleration felt snappy and responsive. Coming back down the twisting descent, braking power and modulation were excellent, with no pulsing or grabby feel. I felt confident that I could scrub speed if a switchback tightened or a CruiseAmerica RV with an amateur pilot appeared (common).
	Mavic’s new wheels aren’t jaw-dropping innovations. They are steady, methodical improvements—more than the small refinements that characterized the Ksyrium line for the past 10 years, but short of a complete re-think.
	You can argue a re-think isn’t really necessary. But at times in the past, Mavic’s wheel refinements have felt overly cautious. What was once the pre-eminent wheel brand in the world has admittedly fallen a bit behind. The new wheels won’t blow past everyone else, but they’re certainly a step in the right direction."

7511,"""Skittle break!"" I called out as we neared the end of the ridge and Jeff promptly produced a half-gallon Ziploc bag of the brightly colored, elixer-like sugar pellets. After gorging on Yellow and Red #5, and having a quick map session to survey the day's route options, we were back on the trail, now plummeting joyously around tight switchbacks into the valley below."
7512, 
7513,"For hours we rode, on singletrack, jeep roads and more trails, along new ridges, through tunnels of trees, and across the sweeping meadows of Alberta's Kananaskis country, a sprawling swath of mountains that spills south for 1,600 square miles from the wild country between Banff and Calgary. Now riding the rolling hills we'd looked down on during the Skittle break, in one aspen-lined clearing, we saw six unbridled horses standing casually in the distance. Looking at the map a bit further on, we realized we were riding on Wild Horse Trail, through Wild Horse Meadow, and along Wild Horse Creek, which, thanks to our formidable powers of deductive reasoning, led us to conclude that those had likely been wild horses."
7514, 
7515,"As the sun slipped toward the horizon the map also told us that our current creek crossing was the last water we'd see for miles—so we filled every bladder and bottle we had and rode on in search of a good place to camp. It turns out an estimated 300 to 500 wild horses live in this area, feral descendants of Blackfeet Indian steeds from centuries past. Which is pretty cool, unless you're trying to find a place to sleep in the meadows where they live, in which case you'll find hoof-pummeled, unrelentingly lumpy ground carpeted in horse manure. Which pretty much sucks the romance right out of the whole wild horses thing."
7516, 
7517,"After cursing their impossibly prolific colons through several meadows and deciding the wild horses should all be used for glue, we finally found a flat-ish, crap-free area on the edge of a small meadow with mountain views to the west, where our first task was setting up our four individual sleep systems. John, the hard-core minimalist, was the most spartan with his directly-on-the-ground, space-blanket bivvy sack. Jeff, the artisan ultralighter, used the skimpiest of air mattresses under a featherweight tarp of his own making. I, the not-exactly-hard-core, comfort-loving photographer, used a posh, 2.5-inch-thick, full-length air mattress (see ""Pack Lightly, p. 36) while Todd, the racer, and I used the same style shelter—a superlight one-person tent in fast-fly mode, with just the rainfly, poles and ground cloth. If a tent were a crayfish, this would be its removable exoskeleton, a nylon shell that delivers tent-like weather protection without the weight of an actual tent."
7518, 
7519,"Less is So Much More
Weight—that is, carrying as little of it as possible—was a central pillar of our trip. It was our second night out and we intended to continue riding exquisite backcountry singletrack for a full five days with everything we needed on our bikes and backs. Which meant bringing only what was necessary and making it as light as physically possible. In other words, none of us had handles on our toothbrushes. Well, Todd, who was on his first multiday, backcountry ride, originally had one until he saw our handle-less brushes, at which point he excused himself and quietly broke his off."
7520, 
7521,"Shoes, insoles and socks surrounded the campfire that night, positioned as close to the flames as we dared. Several creek crossings had left our footgear soaked. The first day had been much the same, but possibly even more scenic. We had definitely crossed more creeks—12 to be exact—from shin-to thigh-deep. Unless you're the frozen-legged photographer and you decide to leave your sunglasses on a rock four creek crossings back. In that case, there were 20 creek crossings, each one more supernaturally cold than the last."
7522,"As our socks steamed, we cooked our respective dinners on miniscule camp stoves. John, ever utilitarian, cut pepperoni and hunks of cheese into a pot of boiling Ramen. Jeff, ever ingenious, mixed instant mashed potatoes with Stovetop Stuffing. I, ever in search of the perfect combination of convenience and tastiness, poured boiling water over my freeze-dried dinner, waited 10 minutes, and—voila—had beef stroganoff. Todd followed my culinary lead and experienced the easy joys of astronaut food for the first time. Each night he would take an inquiring bite of his entree, pause for a moment, then proclaim, ""I can eat that."""
7523, 
7524,"The next morning brought a scene that would replay, in various forms, several times during the trip. Two mountain bikers rolled up as we were breaking camp and the usual trailside banter followed."
7525, 
7526,"How's your ride going? Great, etc."
7527, 
7528,"Then, a pause as they took in the scene, noticed us packing up our tents, and said, ""You guys camp here last night?"""
7529, 
7530,"""Yeah, we're on a multiday ride,"" Jeff said, ""You know, bikepacking."""
7531, 
7532,"Then, another pause as they scanned our camp with new curiosity. We could almost see the word ""bikepacking"" slowly sinking into their brainpans."
7533, 
7534,"""How are you..."" one of the guys said, cutting himself off when he spied the seat, handlebar and frame packs festooning our full-suspension trail rigs and Jeff's rigid 29er. ""Whoa, what are those bags? "" he said, walking over to look at them up close."
7535, 
7536,"""He's the one who makes them,"" Todd said, pointing to Jeff."
7537, 
7538,"Jeff gives them a quick tutorial on the system—shelter and sleeping bag in the handlebar bag, clothes in the seatbag, food in the frame bag in the main triangle. Each item chosen for its diminutive lightness."
7539, 
7540,"""Everything you need for a few days on the trail,"" I added. ""Totally singletrack-worthy."""
7541, 
7542,"""Wow! That's really cool,"" the guy said. After discussing where we started they said, ""Holy shit! That's a big ride,"" and dreamy looks settled over their faces, as their minds played through the possibilities."
7543, 
7544,"In the Beginning...
Of course, there's nothing new about heading out for days at a time on bikes. Ever since velocipedes were invented in the 1800s, adventurous cyclists have been pedaling off with provisions to see what was over the horizon. The first cyclist to circle the globe was Thomas Stevens, who did it on a penny farthing from 1884 to 1886. When mountain bikes arrived on the scene 30 years ago, a new generation caught the exploration bug and set out with laden panniers or trailers. But serious singletrack riding, the ability to really mountain bike for days on end, was still limited."
7545, 
7546,"Then two things happened. First, a subculture of maverick nerds in the backpacking world began creating lighter camping gear than anyone had thought possible. Around the same time a coterie of endurance mountain bikers bored with 24-hour courses (led by John Stamstad, and later by Mike Curiak) started racing multiday routes like the 2,700-mile Great Divide Mountain Bike Route and Kokopelli Trail with no outside support. As endurance riders and others adopted and adapted ultralight backpacking gear to mountain biking, modern-day bikepacking was born."
7547, 
7548,"Now, with base gear weights (not including food and water) of 10 pounds readily attainable, serious mountain biking for days is readily feasible. For riders willing to put in the extra effort—and make no mistake, carrying the weight is extra effort—it's as grand an adventure as you can have on two wheels. Even for non-Herculean riders like me. I'm no Stamstad. I just want to have fun and find new nowheres."
7549,"After saying good-bye to the dreamy-eyed riders, we talked over breakfast about our personal bikepacking histories. Jeff, who's been at it in California's Sierras for a decade, became tired of rack breakages and started creating his own custom gear-carrying systems that have since helped take the sport to a higher level. Todd, a former pro downhiller who was busy soaking up all the bikepacking knowledge he could, became smitten with the concept after hearing about the Tour Divide, one of the races held on the Great Divide Route. He rode 400 miles on the route last year with just a daypack and a credit card, staying in hotels along the way—""I just headed out knowing that I had to get there, and if I didn't, I had to get there,"" he said."
7550, 
7551,"John, who unlike me is a John Stamstad—or, more accurately, who is John Stamstad—has been out of mountain biking for almost a decade. Now an ultrarunner, he jumped in for the first two days of the ride to see how the sport he helped pioneer in the 1990s had progressed. ""You just couldn't do this 10 or 15 years ago,"" he said about the era when he was knocking off his storied rides on dirt roads. ""Not on technical singletrack. It's awesome what the new gear allows you to do."""
7552, 
7553,"After Stamstad bade us farewell and pedaled back to the world beyond campfires, the three of us spent our day threading through forest and meadow. We passed more wild horses, imbued once again with all of their original romance, and whooped while lofting off rocks and roots on the downhills. We skimmed the fringe of the frontcountry, drawing the stares of scrubbed car campers as we passed, dirty and weathered. Heading back into the high mountains, we turned up Little Elbow River and climbed for hours past fortress-like mountainsides weeping with melting snow on our way to the cold winds of Tombstone Pass."
7554, 
7555,"As daylight waned, we rocketed down from a pass into the Big Elbow River Valley, blowing past a hiker-packed backcountry campground, and pedaling on to a grassy bench overlooking the river that we had entirely to ourselves. With the valley spilling away into the distance and a half moon slowly brightening overhead, we ate and talked around the fire, watching the day's last light blush the surrounding peaks. We all agreed it might well have been bikepacking's finest day."
7556, 
7557,"""You're riding for five days with that?!"" said the three riders we met the next day, our fourth. They were muscling overstuffed B.O.B. trailers along a rocky Jeep road. After informing us there was a big grizzly just up the trail, they looked from their Rosie O'Donnell rigs to our Jessica Alba ones and said, ""We gotta get a photo of you guys."""
7558, 
7559,"Then, as if to prove what our sveltely loaded rigs could do, and determined to make our last night out memorable, we headed up the steep trail toward Picklejar Lakes. A 1,400-foot, two-mile climb brought us to a talus-sloped hike-a-bike and then through rock fields to a knoll between the high-mountain lakes where we would soon be lounging around the trip's last campfire."
7560, 
7561,"Our final descent the next morning was an adrenalized plunge down a wildflower-and aspen-blanketed mountainside. The buff, twisting ribbon of dirt shot us into rocky cruxes and along nerve-jangling exposure. After five days on our geared-up bikes we'd mastered the micro-adjustments—the extra pull to lift the front end, the dampened flickability, the increased traction that more weight delivered on corners—and railed that trail like wild horses jacked on Red Bull."
7562, 
7563,"When we finally, inevitably reached Todd's truck, we found ourselves filled with that peculiar, end-of-trip mix of elation and melancholy. On one hand we would soon be feasting on soda, burgers and bag after bag of blissfully salty chips. On the other, the minute Todd picked up his Blackberry and said ""Ahh, back to the world,"" our magnificent ride was officially over. ""I can't wait to take my chamois off,"" Todd said a minute later, giving an undeniable boost to the elation side of the ledger."
7564, 
7565,"With the bikes loaded and the truck speeding down Alberta Highway 40, we talked about how great it would be if we could just keep going. Or, better yet, legally ride the long distance hiking trails like the Continental Divide and Pacific Crest trails. As Canada slipped away outside the car windows, and we watched the world of mountain singletrack, campfires and wild horses fade farther into the distance, Jeff said what was on all of our minds: ""I'm just thinking about where to go next."""

7573,"In 1991, a year after winning his third Tour de France, Greg LeMond’s Z Team came back to the race on prototypes of the Merlin Extra Light. The first titanium bike to fully achieve the metal’s promise, it was as strong as steel but lighter, and possessed a unique and pleasing road feel—slightly more forgiving, with a little extra spring and, somewhat counterintuitively, also more stiffness. Though ­LeMond failed to win a fourth title, his bike sparked a fervor for titanium that lasted through the mid ’90s."
7574,"Today, the competition to build frames that are ever lighter, stiffer, and more aerodynamic has made carbon composites the most desired material for performance road bikes. But to some of the grand masters of bike building, and to a select number of revered engineers and designers who have tried all the materials, there is still nothing quite like titanium."
7575,"“You can use body English with a ti bike because it has some springiness that lets the bike react to you,” says Rob Vandermark, who created that iconic Extra Light. “With a stiffer bike, particularly newer carbon bikes, the stiffness initially feels really good, but there’s no interaction.”"
7576,"Vandermark, an early employee at Merlin Cycles and founder of Seven Cycles, has a nearly unmatched pedigree in custom-bike circles. One person at his level is Tom Kellogg, whose frames were ridden to two professional world championships and 20 national titles ­between 1977 and 1980, a track record that led to his ­collaboration with Vandermark on the Extra Light. Among custom and production builders, Kellogg’s own Spectrum bikes are some of the most respected in the world—even though they’re made with the untrendy gray metal. He points to ti’s nonlinear modulus as the source of the metal’s unique ride: That characteristic means the more force you apply, the harder it becomes to bend. “If you try to bend a piece it will at first give a little,” says Kellogg. “But the further you try to flex it, the more resistant it becomes.” On the road, that trait means you know exactly what’s going on at the intersection of your tire and the pavement—a sensation demanded by performance-oriented riders—but the initial flex means you’re not bothered by rough pavement. Bikes made from steel, aluminum, and carbon can also achieve that result, it’s just that titanium does so with a blend of ride sensations nothing else quite matches, kind of like the way any alcoholic beverage can get you inebriated but only a single-malt Scotch possesses its distinctive, refined combination of tastes."

7578,     Related: 5 Race-Ready Titanium Road Bikes
7579,"Vandermark and Kellogg also point to ti’s longevity—the metal does not rust or corrode, is less likely to be damaged in a crash than bikes made from other materials, and has a longer fatigue life than steel or aluminum. But those are additional benefits, nice qualities to get in a new bike, rather than an abiding reason to buy one. Put simply: It’s all about the ride. We tested five custom bikes to find out if that mysterious, magic ride feel still stands out in the era of carbon. And we found ourselves in agreement with Vandermark, who told us, “Ti will never be back to its former heyday, but we’re seeing it becoming a larger share of our business at Seven. There’s some backlash against the limitations of the carbon ride as the material is pushed to be as light and stiff as possible. It’s great to see good riders enjoy titanium bikes in a way that stiffer frames just won’t allow.”"

7590,"Thanks to a few tinkering cyclists, pedal-powered electricity generators have finally arrived."
7591,"It's been a preoccupation of inquisitive geeks for a long time: trying to extract useable electric power from a bicycle. In basements or garages, they have mounted DC generators and Trek 1200s onto yard-sale trainers, testing voltages and waiting for that eureka moment. The quest has become more popular lately, but it has always served as a emblem for lean and desperate times: Think of Gilligan atop a bamboo bike powering the Professor's makeshift radio, Edward G. Robinson wheezing on his trainer to urge a lightbulb to life in Soylent Green or ectomorph Ed Begley, Jr. deep into lactate threshold on HGTV to make eco-friendly toast."
7592, 
7593,"The problem is that our legs don't have the raw output to make much juice. If you cycle with a power meter, you know that a fairly strenuous ride yields an average of about 140 watts for an hour. Mount your bike to a generator, slice off 30 percent for mechanical and electrical losses, and you've put out a measly 100-watt average during your sweaty hour. It amounts to around a penny's worth of electricity, one three-hundredth of a typical home's daily use—not enough juice to run the PlayStation for 15 minutes."
7594, 
7595,"Until recently, because of low output and high equipment costs, bike generators were mainly used as green educational tools or feel-good gestures for convention booths. On their own, the gadgets had no hope of producing enough power to pay for their own materials, which start at around $250, not including the bike. And because most setups utilized lead batteries, the net environmental impact of making electricity this way would have been devastating if everyone did it."
7596, 
7597,"But that all changed one day in 2007, when recreational triathlete and college student Hudson Harr started trolling Craigslist for the parts to take the latest stab at the time-honored experiment. Harr, then 21, was crashing at his mom's house in St. Petersburg, Florida. ""I told her I was going to do a little prototyping,"" he says. ""Little did she know the living room was going to be packed with gym equipment and electronics."""
7598, 
7599,"After tearing apart several health-club machines, Harr discovered that the Precor elliptical trainer has an onboard generator to power the screen. He began to form an idea for a company, one that wouldn't force gyms to buy new devices to produce pedal-powered electricity. ""Making use of what's already there is a big part of the idea's return-on-investment and environmental sustainability,"" he says. ""If our customers had to buy a new piece of gear, it would be the opposite of sustainable. It would be like, 'Hey, throw away your truck, I have your new Prius right here.'"""
7600,"As Harr started to solicit the expertise of engineers, his design came to include a circuit that sends power directly to the customer's grid, and thus does away with batteries and their environmental issues. But the most crucial breakthrough of all was Harr's choice of venue—health clubs. Because the machines are in near-constant use, they can harness a phenomenon known as ""crowd farming""—the collective impact of small contributions from a mass of people. Harr's machines put out just 0.1 kilowatt—but because they're used for 10 hours or more a day, they harvest enough to pay back their owners within 15 years, roughly the same payback as solar electric."
7601, 
7602,"Health-club owners immediately saw the financial and marketing advantages of such devices, and Harr's company, ReRev, now has 150 machines at more than a dozen gyms. Each facility creates enough electricity to run a small home, and one recently surpassed a megawatt of utility-grade power. In addition to the electrical infrastructure, the firm installs readouts on every exercise station to let users know how much they produced in a workout. Plans are afoot to let gyms compete against each other for kilowatt-hour bragging rights."
7603, 
7604,"Around the same time the young CEO began his experiments, a group of entrepreneurs in Ridgefield, Connecticut, began prototyping a generator that works with a stationary bike. Their company, Green Revolution, enables Spin classes to monitor their energy production on a wall behind the instructor, with a similar equipment cost and payback schedule as ReRev. By all accounts its modified spinners feel like regular ones, complete with adjustable resistance levels; when you add resistance you also increase the bike's power output. But whatever tech you straddle while waiting out the next snowstorm, it's clear that the grid is in for some jolts of collective leg power. ""It's remarkable to watch our data coming through—the ebb and flow of people working out day after day,"" says Harr."
7605, 
7606,"Meanwhile, individual cyclists continue to experiment to find a domestic role for their pedaling, according to Tamara Dean, whose book, The Human-Powered Home: Choosing Muscles over Motors, documents her family's use of bike generators, as well as bike-powered mechanical blenders and grain grinders. Her book, which she wrote using a bike-powered laptop, includes detailed instructions on how to build your own generator. Need serious power on your commute? High Tide Labs, in Palo Alto, California, recently launched a bike-mounted generator called the RollerGen, which puts out more than 30 watts—enough to recharge a laptop computer—as long as you're ride faster than 8 mph."
7607, 
7608,"No matter how accessible pedal power becomes, though, cyclists will probably continue to tinker. In Los Gatos, California, website manager David Butcher, 54, has trained an hour per day nearly every day for the last five years to power his home office equipment, cell phone, electric chainsaw, washing machine and other household gadgets. He started with a simple mock-up 30 years ago, and continues to upgrade his system to increase its efficiency. For instance, he swapped his back wheel for a 36-inch wooden tabletop milled to a perfect circle to drive his generator, and eliminated the chain by bolting the flywheel directly to the crankshaft."
7609, 
7610,"All the modifications still don't make a significant dent in Butcher's overall consumption. But, he says, ""The true value of this has to do with intangibles. Rather than relying on power that may not be good for the environment, you know this power is good for you. And you grow a personal connection with the concept of a watt. It inspires me to push a little harder."
7611, 
7612,"""It's like the way people tend a garden just for a couple of tomatoes,"" Butcher says. ""You drive all over town to get supplies and work on it every weekend. Has it really paid off in time or money? No, those tomatoes probably cost $20 a piece. But you love 'em."""

7631,For 2018 Focus will be launching two e-mountain bikes in the US. The full-suspension JAM² and the hardtail BOLD² are designed around Shimano’s new STePS e8000 platform to provide a natural-feeling electric assist. 
7632,RELATED: The Haro Shift Is An Affordable E-Mountain Bike With Value Features
7633,"Shimano’s new STePS e8000 e-bike drivetrain has been available on Focus e-mountain bikes (and others) in Europe for about a year, but will be offered for the first time on Focus models in the US this January. Compared to most electric bike motors out there, the e8000 system offers similar torque and battery life (250 watts, 70Nm torque) but it also boasts more user-friendly advantages, including a shifter-paddle control system, an easy-to-read bar-mounted display, and nearly drag-free pedaling."
7634,
7635,
7636,"The system also has a Q-factor, or the ""stance"" distance between pedals, that is the same as Shimano's regular XT drivetrain. Since most e-bike motors and battery systems are housed near the bottom bracket, they often push the Q-factor wider. And because the e8000 motor is very compact, Focus was able to adopt a more modern short-rear, long-front geometry, which makes the bike ride more like we’ve come to expect from regular trail bikes. "
7637,"Focus found that most e-bike rides were a couple hours or less, so rather than equip their bikes with a big (heavy), battery, they opted for a smaller, lighter, 378 watt-hour battery. Riders who want longer adventures need not have range anxiety: a rail on the down tube secures a second battery, doubling capacity to 756 watt hours."
7638,RELATED: Introducing Shimano's STePS e8000
7639,"We had a chance to hop on the hardtail BOLD² at the Interbike Dirt Demo yesterday, and were blown away by the e8000 system, as well as the solid, capable feel of the bike. The motor was quiet, organic-feeling, and helpful without being obtrusive—and the slightly guilty feeling of not quite ""earning"" my descents was counteracted by the sheer range of trails the bike opened up. Love or hate the idea of battery-powered riding, I was able to see way more of Bootleg Canyon in far less time than I would have aboard a regular trail bike."

7642,Watch: Is riding an e-bike still a workout?
7643,"The BOLD quickly gained my trust with its predictable handing and planted feel. After a few minutes in the saddle, I was already pushing through corners, hopping drops and maneuvering through the Bootleg's signature loose, off camber rock gardens with relative confidence. With just 120mm of front travel and an aluminum frame, there’s a fair bit of jostling when the gnar factor cranks up, so the BOLD² would probably be best-suited to long XC exploration rides, rather than rowdier enduro shuttles."
7644,"We also took out a JAM² 29 Pro with 140mm of front and rear suspension. While many of the full-suspension e-mountain bikes we've tried are heavy, slacker, enduro-style bikes, the JAM² 29 is lighter and livelier: more like a light trail or cross-country style e-bike. It has quicker handling, and is more responsive. We'd estimate that it's also lighter than any full suspension e-mountain bike we've tried, which makes it ride more like a bike, and less like a motorcycle. The smaller battery is noticeable though: on the same loop we tested several other e-bikes, we used much more of the JAM²'s total capacity than any other bike we sampled."
7645,
7646,

7649,"A deeper look at carbon fiber shows there's far than meets the eye
"
7650," Myth: A carbon frame won’t last as long as a metal one.
	Reality: As long as you don’t crash hard or take a hammer to the frame, a  carbon bike can theoretically last forever. In fact, steel and aluminum last only so long before the metal fatigues and can no longer be used safely, but carbon  remains stable indefinitely."
7651," Myth: After a crash, you should have your frame inspected by a professional.
	Reality: Most cracks that would compromise your bike’s integrity are easy to  spot. You can also run a soft cloth over the tubes—snags indicate potential  problems. If you encounter any issues, or want a second opinion, contact your  manufacturer or a reputable carbon-repair shop. The resident experts can check  for damage with an ultrasonic wave reflector or infrared camera."
7652," Myth: Cracked frames can’t be repaired.
	Reality: Shawn Small, owner of Ruckus Composites, is quick to dispel this fiction. “In many cases, carbon can be repaired more easily than aluminum,” he says. He should know. His shop mends between 1,500 bikes a year. To fix a damaged frame, Ruckus grinds away the damage, layers sheets of prepreg carbon over the void, then repaints the bike."
7653," Myth: Bikes made of carbon are more fragile than aluminum or steel models.
	Reality: Carbon frames are relatively strong and can withstand a significant  amount of force, but only if it’s applied in the direction engineers intended—for example, road shock from a pothole. But if that force comes from an unexpected direction—if you crash into a tree or step on the chainstay—the material is  fragile enough that it would likely rupture."
7654," Myth: The sun can damage your carbon frame.
	Reality: Actually, it’s safe. Bike makers use UV-resistant paint and/or waxes to protect your frame from potentially harmful rays."
7655,"I'm standing in Earl's Cyclery & Fitness in South Burlington, Vermont, looking down a row of carbon-fiber bikes, contemplating the differences between the $1,900 crimson-and-white one in front of me and the $9,000 matte-black beauty at the end of the line."
7656,"	I've been around bikes long enough to know that high-end components can make a big difference in the bottom line, but that only accounts for so much. What I want to know is: What about the frames?"
7657,"	I lean in close enough that my breath forms condensation on the tubes, but the construction techniques within these bikes clearly lie below the surface. I turn to Joe Drennan, Earl's manager, and ask, ""What gives?"""
7658,"	He explains that bike makers use several grades of carbon. ""When you spend more, you get a stronger material, so manufacturers can use less, which makes the frame lighter,"" he offers. That makes sense, but when I press Drennan on how the grades differ, how they affect a bike's feel on the road, and whether one brand's premium carbon bike is like another's, he goes behind the counter and returns with a stack of catalogs. Clearly, I have homework to do."
7659,"	Back home I flip through the literature and tap into Google. I'm bombarded with information. Carbon manufacturing is so complicated and has so many variables that at first I doubt I'll be able to make sense of it. I don't want a masters-level class in material science, but I want to understand how these frames are designed so I can make an informed decision. But I persist over the next few weeks, eventually picking up the phone and talking to nearly a dozen carbon-fiber engineers from brands like Cervelo, Giant, Specialized, and Trek. Over time, the mysterious material comes into sharper focus."
7660,"	The most surprising revelation? The carbon used in every single bike—no matter the cost—comes from one of just five manufacturers. As I would learn, those fibers can be tweaked a multitude of ways before they end up in a frame, but every bike starts with more or less the same raw materials. ""Building a carbon bike is like putting people in a kitchen, all with the same ingredients,"" says Jeff Soucek, director of research and development at Felt Bicycles. ""Some will be great chefs, and they will make something delicious."""
7661,"	Nearly all the carbon produced by the five manufacturers is destined for the aerospace industry (the total amount of carbon used by all bike makers in a year is less than in three Boeing 787 Dreamliners). The Japan Carbon Fiber Manufacturers Association has categorized five grades of the material, four of which are used in bikes and can help guide your bike purchase. Those grades are defined by, among other things, the carbon's stiffness (also called modulus) and tensile strength (which is tested by pulling the material until it fractures). As you move up the scale, the material generally becomes stiffer and more expensive, but not always stronger (see graphic, next page)."
7662,"	All carbon begins as thin fibers that must first be made into sheets—by weaving, or by aligning the strands in a uniform direction—before they become part of a bike. Then manufacturers add glue-like resin to create a composite material called pre-preg, which can be cut and layered into complex shapes. Then things get really interesting."
7663,"	Carbon bikes can contain up to 500 pieces of pre-preg, assembled in 40 or more layers—often combining different grades. Some pieces are as long as a down tube, while others are no bigger than a postage stamp. By using stiff carbon in some places and more forgiving strands elsewhere, engineers can tailor a bike's feel. That's how a company like Specialized can tune a Roubaix to be comfortable on long rides and make a similarly priced Tarmac ultrastiff. As a bike's structure and tube shapes become more complex, it typically requires higher grades of carbon to hit a manufacturers' strength, weight, and stiffness goals. That can significantly add to price."
7664,"	I will never fully understand all the nuances of carbon manufacturing, but the basics now make enough sense that I feel comfortable walking into a shop and selecting a bike. I return to Earl's and hone in on two models that each cost about $3,500. They're made mostly from midlevel carbon, and when Drennan tells me they both should offer a forgiving ride, I understand why that's the case. Only one question remains: How do I know which one will offer a more pleasing ride?"
7665,"	That's easy, Drennan tells me:"
7666,"	""You still have to ride the bikes.""

7684,"CARBON FIBER
									There are two precursors to carbon: rock-like pitch and polyacrylonitrile (or PAN), which is a fishing-line like filament favored by bike makers. To make fibers, manufacturers bake the PAN; heating it longer creates a purer, lighter, stiffer product. Premium carbon threads can be as thin as 7 microns, about one-seventeenth the width of a human hair."
7685,"RESIN
									The glue-like resin epoxy holds carbon strands in place by filling the gaps between them so they can provide structural integrity. Manufacturers can mix in additives (microscopic rubber balls, for instance) to improve certain performance traits, such as increasing a bike's ability to stay intact during a crash."
7686,"PRE-PREG
									These are the thin, pliable sheets of fiber impregnated with resin that, with only a few exceptions, are used to manufacture carbon bikes. Each composite sheet has between 3,000 and 24,000 strands of carbon per eighth of an inch. In structural carbon—the type of pre-preg that gives bike tubes their strength and rigidity—the fibers are laid unidirectionally, which makes them stronger. The interlaced weaves you see on many frames are mostly cosmetic, but offer some protection against impacts."
7687,"LAYUP
									Manufacturing processes vary greatly between companies (and even by model), but most composite bikes are made by arranging small strips (right) of carbon around a solid core inside a mold (far right). Heating the mold liquefies the resin, and pressure forms the pre-preg into the shape of the frame."
7688, Specialized Venge (Courtesy)
7689," Pieces of the Puzzle
	For engineers, building a carbon frame is like putting together an intricate 3-D jigsaw puzzle. Bikes can have hundreds of pieces, assembled in 40 or more layers. To get it right, designers rely on computer software called Finite Element Analysis (FEA), which helps them determine where they should use each grade of carbon and how best to orient the pieces for the ideal mix of strength, stiffness, and compliance. Without leaving their desks, engineers can go through hundreds of variations an hour until they strike the right balance. A high-performance bike like Specialized's Venge, shown, requires about 400 individual pieces of carbon. Each color represents a different thickness of the carbon tubes.

7690,"Norwegian company Sweet Protection expands into the US bike market with helmets, apparel, and protection"
7691,"Sweet Protection is a name that might not be all that familiar to many mountain bikers in the United States. Despite having a nearly 20-year presence in Europe, the Norwegian company is only now expanding their bike offerings to the US."
7692,"The crew at Sweet is based in the remote mountain town of Trysil, with access to world-class skiing, snowboarding, whitewater paddling, and mountain biking. The tight-knit company started making gear out of their desire to have something that worked better for them for the sports they did, and has grown from there. In addition to mountain bike gear, they also make ski and paddle gear, the latter of which has already been available in the US for a few years."
7693,"As the name implies, Sweet is focused on helmets, protection, and apparel. Their higher-end helmets use familiar tech like MIPS along with some interesting shell constructions, which function differently depending on anticipated impact forces. The top of the helmet, for example, features a more elastic plastic to help diffuse a direct impact, while the temples and back are made with a tougher material to help the helmet maintain its shape and protect softer parts of your head. Sweet says their helmets received better scores on a third-party impact test than many brands you might be more familiar with. The company sells everything from a non-MIPS budget commuter option, which comes in at around $150, to a more full-featured mountain bike helmet for $300."
7694,RELATED: Cycling Helmets—What You Get at Every Price
7695,"The apparel line is comprehensive, with both men’s and women’s styles in higher-end materials and subtle neutral colors. Think merino, DWR Micro Ripstop, and a combination of other fabrics with a casual but sporty fit. The protection gear from Sweet consists of knee pads, elbow pads, a clever chest and shoulder protector shirt, and a back protector."
7696,"We're excited to see more gear from Sweet, which on the whole seems to be well thought out, functional, and unique-looking without being obnoxious. While most of the gear isn’t inexpensive, from what we saw, it does seem sturdy and designed to hold up to some serious abuse. Sweet Protection gear will only be available at authorized retailers, so check your local bike shop in the coming months. We'll be conducting a full test of their line here soon."

It’s made from waterproof ripstop nylon and has RF-welded seams, while polyethylene stiffeners add some structure to the tapered half of the bag and help support the load. The bag fastens with a buckle-closure saddle rail strap and two reinforced, wide Velcro straps around the seatpost. That combination should offer the right mix of structural stability to keep a load from flopping around on the rear wheel, and at only 15.2 ounces."

7705,"The dry bag-style closure offers a range of cargo capacities: anywhere from 488 cubic inches of cargo to over 1,000 ci, with extra shock-cord attachments on top for lightweight gear like a jacket or bivy sack poles. The niftiest feature might be the air-purge valve, which allows air to escape the pack interior as you compress the roll-top closure, snugging the load up tight so it shifts less."

7714,A great shock for riders who want to dial in their suspension to be juuust right
7715,"The Fox Float X2 shock is extremely adjustable, which is both its biggest benefit and its biggest drawback. High- and low-speed compression, and high- and low-speed rebound, can be independently externally controlled. Air volume, which alters the spring curve to make it more or less progressive, is adjustable. The shock has a climbing switch to stiffen the suspension for a more efficient feel. And of course, air-spring pressure can be adjusted, too."
7716,     RELATED: Your Fox Float X2 Shock May Have Been Recalled
7717,"What do you do with all that? Make a bike ride like you want. The X2 can be tweaked and customized to a rider’s content. I could spend weeks or months tinkering with the settings and chasing my perfect feel. But there’s so much adjustability, you can get lost in it all and make a bike ride poorly. Fox’s recommended base tune is a good starting point: It resulted in very good performance during my testing. But I found a preferable setup with a bit of tweaking. (Learn how to dial in your suspension—and the rest of your bike's components—with the Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance and Repair!)"
7718,"Compared with the stock shock I removed, the X2 let me achieve the small improvements I sought—I wanted the suspension to be both a bit livelier and a bit more controlled, which is tough to achieve with a less modifiable shock, like the Fox Floats or RockShox Monarchs that come stock on most bikes. However, the damping range is biased firm; I’d like to see Fox open it up so lighter compression and faster rebound is possible. This would particularly benefit lighter riders."
7719,"I’m hesitant to try to describe how the X2 feels because it is so adjustable, and it will perform differently based on the suspension design of the bike it’s installed on. But I will say it is smooth, both sensitive and controlled, and resistant to heat fade. And that, overall, it made my bike ride more like I wanted."
7720,The smooth-handling trail bike is one of the most capable 29ers we’ve ridden
7721,"Before this new 29er was even available to purchase, it had already been ridden to victory at the 2012 Super D national championships—back in July, Adam Craig raced a prototype version in his quest for the title. And after a series of long test rides on my local trails, it was easy to understand his decision."
7722,"One of my frequent loops has a tough little wrinkle—a singletrack descent with a sharp 3-foot rise followed by a small bump. Over the years, I’ve only successfully doubled that feature on a handful of bikes. But I cleared it on my first ride aboard Giant’s Trance X 29 0, after only about an hour of saddle time. This piece of trail makes a good yardstick for measuring a bike’s performance. To hit it correctly, riders must first carry speed through a sweeping left-hand turn just before the jump. The suspension on some other frames has wallowed, killing momentum and altering my line. The Trance X 29er’s Maestro suspension, however, settled easily into the turn, allowing me to load it at the apex and spring forward with momentum and control. That predictable feeling carried over onto every other trail I pointed the bike down."
7723,"The bike climbs remarkably well, too. In the small, 24-tooth chainring, the Maestro suspension worked effectively, offering a stable pedaling platform yet remaining active enough to find traction on loose ascents, even in the Fox shock’s wide-open Descend setting. In the large 38-tooth ring, I often used the air spring’s Trail setting, which capably limited unwanted movement. I never felt the need to use the shock’s stiffest Climb position."
7724,"
The Maestro suspension pedaled crisply, and found traction on loose, SoCal climbs. (Michael Darter) "
7725,"Giant claims the hydroformed aluminum frame weighs 5.9 pounds with shock, and our test bike tipped the scales at 27.3 pounds. That’s surprisingly light for a mid-priced aluminum 29er with 5 inches of travel. The frame tubes have swoopy lines—some, like the downtube, mostly serve aesthetic purposes. But the sharp bend on the seattube creates extra room to tuck in the rear wheel, allowing Giant engineers to trim some length from the chainstays. To further shorten the rear end, Giant devised a new swingarm for the model. The new single-spar design eliminates the drive-side support found on the brand’s other Maestro bikes. Santa Cruz and Intense use similar designs on their VPP full-suspension models."
7726,"At 17.8 inches long, the Trance’s stays are about a half-inch shorter than the 26-inch Trance model, a bike renowned for its long rear end. Compared to its 29er competition, the 29er’s chainstays are pretty typical. For example, Yeti’s SB95 and the Intense Spider have 17.5-inch stays while Santa Cruz’s Tallboy LT has 17.9-inch stays. Giant has historically favored slightly longer stays because a longer wheelbase increases the bike’s stability."
7727, A new single-spar swingarm is similar to the design used by Santa Cruz and Intense. (Michael Darter)
7728,"Although the bike’s seat angle looks extreme, it actually is just 73 degrees—pretty standard fare (and I measured to be sure). However, Giant’s Contact Switch dropper post has a 12mm offset and I often felt like my weight was positioned too far back. That feeling was accented by the Fizik Gobi saddle, which has a small sweet spot located toward the back of the seat. Swapping to Fizik’s Tundra saddle, which has a longer sweet spot, helped, but I still was forced to slide the saddle forward on its rails. Giant’s Contact Switch dropper post worked great, but I eventually switched to RockShox Reverb post, which has zero offset and offered me a better fit."
7729,"
The Trance X 29er has ports to route all cables internally. (Michael Darter) "
7730,"The Trance X 29er 0 comes with Fox suspension. The fork and shock use the company’s latest CTD (climb, trail, and descend) platform settings, though they lacked the slick gold Kashima coat and three-position trail-adjust feature on Fox’s high-end springs. Giant also runs Fox’s 32 Float instead of the stiffer, more adjustable 34 model. The move reduces weight and trims the bike’s final price, but I would have rather seen the 34. The 32, with its less-adjustable damper, felt harsh in rock gardens, so I rode with it mostly in the wide-open descend position. It felt soft and supple, but also dove under hard braking. For riders who can afford it, I’d recommend upgrading to the high-performance Fox 34."
7731,"
A radical bend in the seat tube clears room for the rear wheel. (Michael Darter)"
7732,"There were no surprises from the Shimano XT brakes and drivetrain. They delivered consistent, reliable performance. Giant did choose to run resin pads in the brakes, so riders who want more bite can upgrade to Shimano’s metal radiator-style pad. All of the bike’s cables, including the remote line for the dropper post, are routed internally through the front triangle. The rear brake hose comes externally routed along the downtube from the factory, but there are ports in the frame and non-drive chainstay to route the cable through the tubes."
7733,"The Trace X 29er 0 comes equipped with Giant’s new P-TRX 29er 1 wheelset. They proved to be stiff and resilient even under aggressive riding. Although designed in conjunction with Giant, DT Swiss makes all parts of the wheel. In fact, the freehub contains the proven 36 tooth Star Ratchet system with 10 degrees of engagement. The rim utilizes the same Torx nipple and insert technology as the DT Swiss Tricon for a solid, tubeless ready inner rim shape. A savvy owner will ditch the tube and redundant rim strip, install the included tubeless valve stems and throw in some sealant converting the Schwalbe Nobby Nic tires tubeless."
7734," The Trance X 29er remained calm and controlled, even on aggressive descents. (Michael Darter)"
7735,"The Trance X 29er is also available in two less-expensive models: The $2,775 Trance X 1 has a SRAM X-7/X-9 drivetrain, and Fox suspension; the $1,925 Trance X 2 features SRAM X-5/X-7 components, and RockShox suspension. The model is also sold as a $1,550 frameset. No matter what package you choose, the Trance X 29er is a superb all-around trail bike. Its efficient suspension and dialed geometry create well-balanced ride—no matter the terrain, I always felt comfortable and in control. Some riders may need to swap the saddle or seat post to dial in the fit, but that’s a relatively minor fix for a high-value, high-performance 29er."

Won't it be nice to cease worrying about bicycle thieves? Won't it be sweet to lose the 300-pound chain and its New York City-strength, tempered-steel padlock? Won't it feel liberating to stop wasting time looking for bicycle racks and vacant parking meters? But let's be honest. Have you ever seen someone on a folding bicycle? Circus bear on wheels, right? That's the first thing you think. That's the first thing I think."
7739, 
7740,"Better to admit the truth: Wanting a folding bicycle has its dark side. Isn't it better to own up to that at the outset? A man seeking love might tell himself that he's after something life-affirming and species-propagating, but come on! If he's candid and just the slightest bit self-aware, shouldn't such a man admit that from a certain perspective, there is a better-than-average chance he is hurtling toward heartbreak and searing pain and eternal, shadowless, stygian, hellish gloom?"
7741, 
7742,"What I'm saying is, my desire for a folding bicycle is not entirely daffodils and kazoos. I want a folding bicycle because I want to exact a measure of revenge on the vast and uncaring legal system that has recently victimized me by declaring that I need to vacate the spacious and rent-stabilized Manhattan apartment in which I have been illegally squatting for 13 years. My revenge will be mostly symbolic (as most of my acts of revenge lately tend to be), but it will allow me to store my bicycle in my new dwelling, which is approximately the size of a shoe closet. Speaking of symbolic acts of revenge, I look forward to pedaling past the apartment of my former girlfriend, who has recently dumped me and, if memory serves, in the process mentioned something about a ""sad little man going nowhere fast."""
7743,

Not this sad little man, who, as long as I'm being honest, is not so little anymore, having recently jacked up his already-bad pint-a-night ice cream habit to soothe his nerves about the change in apartment lifestyle and sudden girlfriendless state. Which means that even if I want to keep lugging around the heavy chain, it will be difficult, because it no longer fits around my belly."

7748,"Why a folding bicycle? I'll tell you why. After my ex and I split up, I decided to spend some time healing. I did this by switching from Chubby Hubby to Mint Chocolate Chunk ice cream, because that flavor seemed lighter and more life-affirming. I also spent some evenings typing phrases like ""life-changing gadgets"" and ""worst breakups in history"" and ""bearproof body armor"" into my computer. When none of that brought the fuzzy flowers and birdsong, I took a late-night walk in my neighborhood, the Upper West Side."
7749, 
7750,"And that's where I spotted the man on the folding bicycle. That's where I saw a guy hop off his bicycle, collapse it into a tidy little one-wheeled thing and roll it easily into his apartment building. That night I researched folding bicycles. I learned that improved technology has rendered folding bicycles as energy-efficient and speedy as their nonfolding counterparts, according to those who make folding bikes."
7751,"Do I believe that a folding bicycle will make me happy or that it will change my ex from a quislinglike harpy into a ""challenge""? Do I think it will somehow bring me the contentment and serenity that has eluded me thus far in my life? How could anyone think that of any contraption? Here's another question: Do you know anyone who has ever owned both a Bowflex and a wallet OWL? This sad little man has."
7752,

I bought a Veg-O-Matic every year for my mother's birthday and was always baffled and saddened when, within a week of expressing outsize delight, she lost it."
7754, 
7755,"What I'm saying is, my reasons for getting a folding bicycle are many. First, storage space. Second, I'm too fat for a lock. Third, my daily forays into the Manhattan subway system seem to be growing increasingly stressful, and my nagging suspicions that global apocalypse is imminent seem to be growing stronger, and I have been noticing more and more bomb-sniffing police dogs at the stations I most often frequent. And my dreams about rogue talking elephants have become more violent. The tusked mammals have been yelling at me.

I could seek a bigger apartment, in which a nonfolding bicycle might comfortably fit, but that would require more money, which would require harder, or more, work. That sounds really challenging. That sounds stressful. I don't need more stress. I could start walking or running, or volunteer at the neighborhood soup kitchen. Those are out (see ""stress; more"" above). I could embark on a sensible and long-term program of recovery of mental health, but I've never been one for sensible or long-term. I could (and still might) get ahold of the Ursus Mark VI, the really very cool bearproof suit, made of chain mail, galvanized steel, titanium, high-tech plastic and liquid rubber, and which was recently snapped up on eBay by ""an American who works in consulting for military projects"" and whom I fully intend to track down."
7762, 
7763,Or!
7764, 
7765,Or I can travel to the new frontier of energy-efficient transportation. I can reinvent myself as a pioneer in the brave new world of alternative-energy transportation. It will help me. It will help the world. It will delay global apocalypse.
7766, 
7767,"""Going nowhere fast?"" I e-mail my old girlfriend. ""Not any more, Pumpkin. Are you interested in joining me on an exciting journey to the future? I have already found nice his and hers models of folding bicycles."""
7768, 
7769,"She e-mails back the next day. She tells me she knows that I know she hates the nickname ""Pumpkin."" She tells me I need help, but that she's not the one who can provide it."
7770, 
7771,I will be making this journey alone. That's okay. That's more than okay. A folding bicycle is not designed for a pack animal. Pioneers ride solo.
7772, 
7773,"The first thing is to find the best, most compact, easiest-folding and all-around coolest model. Being a highly trained professional journalist, I buckle down to the lonely, oft-times Sisyphean, painstaking work of research."
7774,"""Really cool folding bicycles,"" I type into my computer and a week and a half later, sitting in the corner of my tiny apartment is a hard plastic suitcase. It stares at me balefully."
7775, 
7776,"Reading about the Bike Friday Tikit was cool. Watching the online video of the guy folding the thing in three seconds was even cooler. But then the suitcase arrived, and I realized I would have to put the thing together."
7777, 
7778,The suitcase sits for a week.
7779, 
7780,"The night before my first full day on my folding bike, I practice folding and unfolding it for an hour or so. I take a few moments in my apartment to think and to plan. I have already decided that I will not carry any lock at all. I will be self-sufficient. I'll be my own self-contained, self-propelled transportation system."
7781, 
7782,"I wonder if anyone on the subway will make a crack about my clown bike. I wonder if my gym will let me check my bike in the coatroom. The gym lets mothers bring strollers. Since when did being childless consign people to second-class citizenship? I make a note to draft a letter to the appropriate legislative body in the following weeks. I wonder and I plan so much that it's midmorning before I leave my apartment. I decide not to take the folding bike out. That night, still planning, I have a pint of ice cream. I walk to the store to buy it."
7783, 
7784,"The next morning, because I don't want to risk carrying my folding bicycle on the subway during peak hours, I sleep in. Then I'm so late, I decide I'll just take a cab."
7785, 
7786,"Walking home, I stop every person I see on a folding bicycle. ""It's changed my life,"" a guy in his early 30s says. He's wearing a suit. He says he rides to the subway from his Upper East Side apartment every morning, takes his folder onto the subway, then rides it from his exit station to his office. ""Best investment I ever made,"" says a book illustrator, a 27-year-old woman. ""Anyone in Manhattan who doesn't own one of these is either very, very rich or merely silly,"" says a guy with a rearview mirror attached to his helmet. (People on folding bikes, like Mormons, PETA members and other apparently odd, possibly dangerous but unquestionably sincere folks, will talk about their faith at the slightest provocation.)"
7787, 
7788,"The next day, I check out subway timetables. I consult weather forecasts. I walk to the subway stop at 58th and Seventh Avenue, which is about half a mile from my apartment, walk back, then unfold my bicycle and make the trip. Eight-minute walk, one-minute ride. I'd be saving myself seven minutes a day. That's 35 minutes a week. That's more than two hours a month. I think of the things I might do in two hours a month. I could go somewhere."
7789, 
7790,"By week four of riding my folding bike, I have become adept at folding and unfolding, but I can't seem to get it to lie on the ground, like it's supposed to. I call the guy from Bike Friday. He talks me through the three-speed changer, expresses dismay and surprise that I can't seem to get it to sit with stability—that was a problem on the older prototypes, he tells me, but he'd had that fixed. He mentions a screw that needs to be tightened when putting the bike together. I vaguely remember a screw that hadn't looked like it needed to be tightened."
7791, 
7792,"Week five, I ride the Tikit to my shrink's, normally a 15-minute walk, or a 10-minute, $6 cab ride. I make it in four minutes, fold my bike on the sidewalk and roll it into the good doctor's office. She is intrigued, asks how I'm enjoying my new vehicle."
7793,"I tell her I feel self-conscious, that I delayed going out on it for a week because I was sure people would look at me funny, would mock me. Why would I think that, she wonders. I know that ""Because it's a fucking clown bike"" would not please her, so we talk for a few minutes about my mother, and a dream I had recently about lady elephants toying with me before feeding me corn, and then it's time to write a check and go."
7794, 
7795,"I wheel the bike onto the street, then snap it open. ""Let's go, Foldy,"" I say, as I ride into the sunset. (I live west of my shrink's office.) Somehow, Foldy has become my bicycle's name."
7796, 
7797,"I look at the world differently now. I evaluate coffee shops on the basis of their floor space, stores for their aisle width, restaurants for the size of their coat-check rooms. Some locations don't measure up to my new, exacting standards. I take Foldy to Starbucks, where I glare at a young mother who gives me an irritated look when Foldy accidentally bumps her."
7798, 
7799,"""Think of it as a stroller, breeder,"" I snarl."
7800, 
7801,"That night I ride Foldy downtown, to a Ping-Pong parlor, to meet friends. There's a woman there I don't know. She doesn't seem unduly impressed by Foldy. She does seem impressed when I call it Foldy. Not in a good way."
7802, 
7803,"Not all of my life is taken over by snarling at Foldy-haters and scaring those who don't understand my Foldy-love. I spend quite a bit of time actually riding my new sidekick. And it's a good ride. A little twitchy, a little hyperresponsive to the slightest pressure on the handlebar, and in spite of all the genius engineering, it's not quite as efficient as a regular bicycle. Still, fun. But not nearly as much fun as dismounting on a crowded corner and nonchalantly folding Foldy, all in about three seconds."
7804, 
7805,"""Is that a bike?"" people say. ""How does it work?"" ""How much?"" ""How does it ride?"""
7806, 
7807,"I think Foldy is calming me. I haven't had any talking elephant dreams in a while. I don't mutter ""They'll all pay"" anymore. I have caught myself exclaiming, when I stumble into my kitchen in the morning, ""We've got a big day ahead of us, Foldy."" Or, ""We're going to a coffeehouse where our kind are not exactly welcome, Foldy, so don't get nervous."" Or, as we approach a Starbucks, ""You're gonna have to trust me on this, Foldy."" I also say ""Me and you, Foldy, me and you."" Or, in times of stress, ""We'll show the bastards, Foldy."""
7808, 
7809,"Where I go, Foldy goes."
7810, 
7811,"I attend a fancy dinner party hosted by the wife of an old friend. I wonder whether I should call and ask if I can bring Foldy into her fancy penthouse apartment or just sneak her up the freight elevator, like a trampy Tri Delt. Remembering that ill-fated college romp gets me thinking about Foldy's sex. I decide he is a guy, more sidekick than girlfriend. He is plucky and brave. Sometimes he needs taking care of, when it's raining. But he is dependable, always there for me in a pinch."
7812, 
7813,"I let Foldy stretch out next to the television in my apartment. The next day, I decide it might be a good idea to figure out why the first seven gears aren't working, perhaps even get a tune-up. By now, because of many hours spent on Internet sites dedicated to folding bicycles, I have located the folding bicycle inner sanctum in New York City. It is not, contrary to some dealers' recommendations, any of the bike shops that traffic in the folding contraptions. It is a cluttered, cramped basement apartment tucked away in the Union Square neighborhood, a hole-in-the-wall that feels more like a drug den or Prohibition-era speakeasy than it does a bike shop. If Yoda had been a folding bicycle nut, he would have hung out here."
7814,"I meet David Lam, the founder and owner, at the basement apartment, and show him Foldy. I tell him what's wrong. I ask (rhetorically of course) whether I am indeed the proud owner of ""the Mercedes- Benz of folding bicycles."""
7815, 
7816,"Lam merely grunts. I notice walls and walls of another kind of folding bike. It's the Brompton, of which I'd read about and tried futilely to procure for a test ride."
7817, 
7818,"""I see you have lots of Bromptons,"" I say. ""They're not better than my bike, are they?"""
7819, 
7820,And that's when my journey into the heart of folding bicycles acquires its guide.
7821, 
7822,"Lam tells me that since he became a folding bicycle aficionado, he has come up with the Six Essential Elements of a folding bicycle."
7823, 
7824,"""Six?"" I ask. I do not ask whether ""having an owner who bestows a nickname"" is one of them."
7825, 
7826,"The six essential elements of a folding bicycle, Lam tells me, are: folding speed, compactness, engineering, ride, weight and price."
7827, 
7828,"""So Foldy, I mean, the Bike Friday Tikit, is clearly the Merced..."" I begin, but Lam is not done with his disquisition."
7829, 
7830,"""The Brompton was created in England, for London traffic,"" Lam says, and in terms of compactness, ""it's the best."""
7831, 
7832,"He pulls down a Brompton, unfolds and folds it. Neither action is as rapid as the folding and unfolding of Foldy, but, I have to admit, the folded Brompton is a marvel—like a large, oversize lunchbox. I feel embarrassed for Foldy's folded state—all gangly and flopping."
7833, 
7834,"He then tells me that most of the Brompton components are proprietary, while Foldy uses standard parts, but when I press him, he admits that ""for a longer ride, I'd take a Tikit or a New World"" (which is another of Bike Friday's offerings)."
7835, 
7836,"I begin to request a tune-up from Lam, but he is not done. He tells me that 10 out of 10 Bromptons get past Manhattan's security guards, while only nine out of 10 Bike Fridays do so. He tells me that he sees himself as an ambassador for folding bicycles and that when he stores his bicycle at the Museum of Modern Art, for example, he makes sure to give the coat-check person a large tip. He spins tales of the fabled Moulton, with its ""elastomer technology,"" and of a genius recluse in Brooklyn who cranks out cheap and speedy folding bicycles for anyone plucky enough to find him."
7837, 
7838,"I leave Lam with a headful of information and folding-bicycle envy. I spend the next few weeks trying futilely to get a Brompton from England. Also, I log many hours on chat boards and Internet sites devoted to folding bicycles."
7839, 
7840,"I love Foldy, but I now know that he is just one of his kind. There are, as my poker buddies assured me when my ""sad little man going nowhere fast"" girlfriend dumped me, many fish in the sea. Online, I find the Strider and the Seven. I read about the fabled and impossible-to- locate Moulton and the Montague, a full-size folding bike sold by an MIT graduate student. I learn about the cranky recluse in Brooklyn who sells handmade folding bicycles for $700. I learn that people love the Tikit but that many, many people love the Brompton, which might not be as comfortable for riding 100 miles as Foldy. I learn that there are some people even more obsessed with folding bicycles than I am."
7841, 
7842,While I'm on the Internet I decide I might as well join some Internet dating sites. (Is my new dedication to multitasking and efficient time use a consequence of my life as a folding-bike owner or a cause? I make a mental note to ask my shrink about this.)
7843,"I take Foldy to a first date, and the woman says ""nice equipment."" She also tells me I have nice eyes and that she has just ""rediscovered [her] sexuality."" I oil Foldy back at the apartment. He deserves it."
7844, 
7845,"Owning a folding bicycle changes a man. I plan more before I leave my apartment. I pack fingerless gloves, for riding and for typing next to drafty windows, which is often the only place near which Foldy will fit. I carry liquid soap, in case the chain falls off, which, honesty compels me to admit, has been happening about every fourth day. I realize that this (preparation for hardship, enduring the little indignities that every pioneer must endure) is how my great-great-great-grandparents must have lived, plucky Ukrainian serfs dreaming of a better life. That cheers me when people jostle me (and Foldy) at Starbucks."
7846, 
7847,"Then, I cheat. Not on the woman who had rediscovered her sexuality, though I do that, too."
7848, 
7849,I cheat on Foldy.
7850, 
7851,"I set up lunch with a PR guy from Dahon, a company that sells more folding bikes, worldwide, than any other. I have heard stories about Dahon, that they're cheap, and fun and easy and for someone who longs for a lasting connection, a bad idea. I of course heard the same things from friends when I started dating Bess, an exotic dancer, and though that liaison ended with tears, recriminations and self-loathing (mostly mine), here I am, again reaching for something gaudy and in all likelihood treacherous. Why can't I be more like I imagine my doughty and sensible Ukrainian forebears had been? They didn't date exotic dancers or betray their faithful wooden carts."
7852, 
7853,Or horses. Or whatever they used to get around.
7854, 
7855,"The PR guy tells me, when he sees Foldy, that if I'm taller than 6 feet, having a bike with 16-inch wheels is self-destructive, that I need 20-inch wheels. He tells me that Dahon has more than 100 patents, that his company makes 50 percent of all folders sold in the United States. He tells me about a place in Santa Cruz, California, where if you take a commuter class, you get a $200 rebate. He tells me that he's been pushing the idea of hanging tags from folding bike seats, so people will know how to fold them. Clearly, this guy knows folding bikes. Or folders, as I now and forever will call them."
7856, 
7857,"He gives me a Dahon MU SL with 20-inch wheels. This folder is not cute. It's hard. It's mean. It's all business. It rattles my butt. But it's easy to pick up. It's incredibly light. It's not into gimmicks. It makes my teeth rattle a little. I don't like folding it as much but I like carrying it. That's not true; I don't actually like carrying it, but I like carrying it better than I like carrying Foldy."
7858, 
7859,"At my shrink's, I talk about wanting the perfect folding bike, and the perfect wife and a perfect life. She tells me that accepting life on life's terms might make living easier. Before I go to bed, I discuss my shrink with Foldy. We both agree that she is a little too easy with facile aphorisms. When I complain that she has made a lot of money from me, and mention that I wish I felt a lot happier and more content than I in fact do, Foldy does not disagree."
7860, 
7861,"I don't talk to the Dahon much. It is nice to ride, but difficult to talk to."
7862,"I love Foldy, but I take the Dahon when I worry about flights of steps or space or the goodwill of the coat-check girls at the gym, especially Debbie, who I'm thinking of asking out. Yesterday I rode the Dahon, who needs a name, to the gym. It's fast, jumpy, kind of harsh and inelegant and a literal pain in the ass. Like a girlfriend I once had, a temperamental and biting harridan, I always marveled at how sweet and compact she looked at rest, curled in on herself. Should that be the Dahon's name? Phoebe? No, Phoebe would kill me if she found out. Speedy? Bump? Swifty? Twitchy? Touchy? Insaniac? I decide on Bump."
7863, 
7864,"That night, after Debbie the coat-check girl turns down my offer of coffee, and after I contract what I'm pretty sure is food poisoning and after I wake at 3 a. m., then rush to the bathroom, where I puke, I lie on the cool tiles of my bathroom floor for an hour or so, staring at the ceiling, wondering how I possibly ended up middle-aged, crammed into a space better suited as a storage closet, single, with two folding bicycles."
7865, 
7866,"I grab a legal pad and pen, crawl back into bed, and between vomiting episodes I make a list of former girlfriends I should have married. I make another of former girlfriends who might accept Foldy. I cross-reference that list with a list of former girlfriends who are still single and have not uttered the phrase ""please don't ever contact me again,"" and/or ""I don't know who you are anymore."" I puke some more, and drink some ginger ale and moan a little bit. No one is on my final list."
7867, 
7868,"I look at the only friend who has never insulted me. He is sprawled in the corner, uncomplaining."
7869, 
7870,"""It's you and me, Foldy,"" I bleat."
7871, 
7872,"Though sometimes when I'm in a big hurry, I still take Bump, otherwise, I'm back with Foldy."
7873, 
7874,"Foldy helps me befriend the crabby waiter at the Greek diner, where I have been eating eggs for the past five years and where, until I wheeled Foldy in, the waiter had only grunted at me. When I'm not riding Foldy through Manhattan, I daydream about small children waiting for me. I imagine them jumping up and down with delight as they spy my slim silhouette cresting a hill, crying, ""It's Foldy! And Foldy's master, Steve!"""
7875, 
7876,"On the streets, I nod at other folding-cycle riders. We raise eyebrows, we nod. We give each other the upturned chin. The message is the same: ""Hey, dude, we might look like circus bears, but inside our chests beat the hearts of lions. Of road warriors!"""
7877, 
7878,"Sometimes I stop a fellow road warrior and we talk. We talk folding time, riding performance, strategy with crabby doormen and waiters. I learn to endure the cars cutting me off, and I learn to deal with the obdurate doormen. I can even deal with the wiseacres who ask, ""What happened to your bike?"" Or, ""Where's the rest of your bike?"" My new archenemies are pedestrians crossing against red lights—always maddeningly heedless of cyclists who by law have the right of way, and positively dismissive of people like me, on folding bicycles. I decide I will buy an air horn."
7879,"I don't buy an air horn. My shrink suggests that if I'm so angry at pedestrians, it might be a good idea to spend a few sessions discussing my anger. That pisses me off. Foldy is also feeling some resentment— I can sense these things—and this troubles me more than my difficult therapist. In fact, things between Foldy and me, while ostensibly pleasant and superficially peaceful, have not been so great lately. Foldy has helped me lose weight, true, and he doesn't judge me when I eat my ice cream late at night, but still, I feel that we have plateaued. What's our future together? Do I even want a future with Foldy? Why don't we do anything fun anymore? If I do get ahold of the Ursus Mark VI, will I be as emotionally available to Foldy? I can feel Foldy's unhappiness in the accusatory silence."
7880, 
7881,"I know that in a relationship, forward movement is necessary. I look for something for Foldy and me to seek together, some life-changing goal. Something that will bring us closer, that will make Foldy and me happy. Happy together."
7882, 
7883,"That's how I decide to enter us in the Folds Up! folding bicycle race, held every spring in Central Park."
7884, 
7885,"I spend the week before folding and unfolding Foldy in my apartment, because folding bike races, from what I have learned, involve sprinting approximately one city block, folding, carrying your folder about 10 yards and back, unfolding, then sprinting back from whence you came. I have studied the races on the Internet, late at night, with Foldy by my side. Bump has left us. I gave back the lightweight and feisty aluminum racer that was causing me so much confusion."
7886, 
7887,"The night before the race, I wash my cycling shorts. I take Foldy from my bedroom, let him spend the night in the living room. He will not be hidden anymore. I'm ashamed that I ever hid him."
7888, 
7889,"""They laughed at you, Folds,"" I say. ""They laughed at us."""
7890, 
7891,Foldy says nothing. How did I ever mistake his silence for shyness or insecurity? His is the silence of the warrior.
7892, 
7893,"""No one's gonna be laughing tomorrow, my friend,"" I say, and pat the Velo Plush prostate-protecting seat I have fitted onto Foldy's frame."
7894, 
7895,"Tomorrow comes and people do in fact laugh. They laugh when I scream ""What?!??"" upon learning that the folding bicycle race will not be a block long, but 3 miles, or twice around the lower loop of Central Park. They laugh, or at least I hear laughter, when I hop off Foldy at the finish line and kneel, breathing hard and sweating from what I suspect might be a minor heart attack. They laugh when Foldy's chain falls off midway through the folding-bike ramble that follows in lower Manhattan."
7896, 
7897,"But I don't care. The laughter of strangers doesn't bother me as much as it used to. That's what life as a folding-bike owner will do to a man. I put Foldy's chain back on and quietly leave the group. I decide I will fold Foldy, then get a coffee, and think a little bit about life, then I will unfold him, and together we will ride back to my apartment, where I'll surf the Internet and look for true love of the human female variety. I decide that today might be a nice day to cruise along the Hudson River. We can get some sun."
7898, 
7899,"""How would you like that, Folds?"" I ask my friend, as we roll toward the river, homeward-bound. Folds does not dignify the question with a response. I admire his quiet ease."
7900,"How high should my saddle be?
"
7901,"Saddle-height adjustment has always been a bit of a dark art. Your shop can determine it scientifically, but here's a quick and simple way to estimate it:"
7902,"1) With your cycling shoes on, sit on the saddle (have someone stand in front of you and hold the bike upright) and grab the handlebar. Let your legs hang straight down."
7903,2) Rotate the right crank to its lowest position.
7904,     Related: A Graphic Guide to Bike Seat Height
7905,"3) Without rocking your hips, place your right heel onto the pedal. Your heel should barely reach the pedal."
7906,"4) If your knee is bent, raise the saddle. If your heel doesn't reach the pedal, lower the saddle until your heel makes contact."
7907,5) Be sure the saddle is parallel to the ground (not the top tube) and the correct distance behind the bottom bracket—your shop will have to calculate this.
7908,6) Record your saddle height.

7914,This updated carbon XC race hardtail mountain bike adds more plus-tire versatility
7915,KHS has given its Team 29 cross-country race hardtail a radical facelift for 2018. A new elevated chainstay design allowed KHS engineers to give it clearance for 27.5+ and 29+ tires up to 2.8 inches in width for riding and exploring off of the race course. The carbon fiber frame has modern features such as Boost width rear axle spacing and internal dropper seat post routing as well.
7916,RELATED: Why You Should Try A Dropper Post
7917,"It's rare to find a race bike with wheel size interchangeability, but this feature could allow cross-country racers to change the functionality of the bike for different courses, or even riding conditions. Some courses reward the roll-ability of a 29-inch wheel, for example, while other trails are ideal for traction and maneuverability of more tire volume in a smaller diameter. With a claimed weight of 22 pounds, the KHS team could offer a lot of bike without a lot of weight. "
7918,"The KHS team comes with 29” DT Swiss X1900 Spline wheels and speedy Maxxis Ikon TR 3C Maxx Speed tires. New components include a Fox 32 Float Step-Cast fork with remote lockout, a Shimano XT 1x11 drivetrain, and an SLX cassette and brakes. Retail price is set at $3,899, and it’s available in three sizes: M, L and XL. Claimed weight is 22 pounds. Availability is not yet determined by KHS but this is a 2018 model, so it should be in shops by next season."
7919,The head-turning aero road bike is part of a full aero package that the company claims will save riders 5 minutes over a 40k course
7920,Aerodynamic claims are nothing new in cycling. You can barely turn around in a bike shop without spotting some product that its makers claim will save you X seconds in a 40km time trial.
7921,"But those claims are often as slippery as the air they pass through. Save a minute compared to what? How did the manufacturer arrive at that figure? And most frustrating of all to those who buy it, how do you know you’re actually faster?"
7922,"So Specialized’s claim around its new Venge ViAS definitely caught our attention. With the new bike, including wheels and tires, and a cycling kit that includes their new shoes, skinsuit and existing Evade helmet, the company promised we’d be five minutes faster in a 40km time trial. What’s more, Specialized offered to prove it. You’re on, we said."
7923,"Venge ViAS Frame
	The Venge frame ($12,500 as shown, $5,800 frame module) is really a module, and one of the most integrated we’ve ever seen. Dedicated parts include the fork, brakes, seatpost, handlebar, and stem. And we mean dedicated: Those parts weren’t merely designed with the frame; it’s impossible to use anything else and they won’t fit on any other bike. "
7924,"The brakes in particular spur a double-take. They’re direct-pull cantilevers, but the front brakes are turned 90 degrees, perpendicular to the fork blades, and the rear are mounted to the seat tube between the seat- and chainstay."
7925,     RELATED: How Specialized Made the Venge ViAS So Fast
7926,"All the hardware does add about 500 grams to a comparable Tarmac. But Specialized says that on all but the hilliest courses, aerodynamics easily trumps weight savings. The benefit of hiding a couple of square centimeters of cable housing, said Aero R&D Manager Chris Yu, is about the equivalent to 400 grams of weight difference on a rolling course."
7927,Roval CLX 64 wheels and S-Works Turbo Tires
7928,"Specialized deepened and widened its CLX 60 carbon clinchers ($2,800; S-Works turbo tires, $55) to maximize aerodynamics around a 24mm-tire profile. The new wheel is more stable in crosswinds despite being deeper."
7929,"Designed in conjunction with the CLX 64 wheel, the Turbo tire features a 24mm width in front and 26mm in back, which Specialized says its testing shows is an ideal width for a rear tire. A dual-compound tread with softer shoulders improves cornering grip. Crucially, the claimed time savings isn’t from aerodynamics, it’s rolling resistance—all aero gains are accounted for in the wheels since the wheel and tire is a system."

7931,"S-Works Evade GC skinsuit 
	Specialized is making two skinsuits; the $500 GC version features three rear pockets, and is stitched in the back only, which makes it easier to get into. Hidden seams on the shoulders smooth airflow."
7932,"S-Works 6 and Sub 6 shoes
	Specialized revamped its S-Works ($400) shoes, moving the Boa lacing dials slightly to improve airflow. And the lace-up Sub-6 version ($325) comes with what will likely be the most-copied aero development: a slim cover for the lace section, dubbed the Warp Sleeve. Specialized is a bit cagier about time savings here given variables like rider pedaling style – hence the “up to” qualifier."
7933,"The last element of the 5-Minute protocol isn’t actually new: It’s the existing Evade aero road helmet ($250), which Specialized says is good for a 46-second savings over its Prevail road model."
7934,First Impressions
7935,"Altogether, Specialized says that the system is over five minutes faster than a conventional setup. That’s an extremely bold claim on its face. There is some amount of wordsmithing there in how they package the aero savings. If you combine any aero bike, aero wheels, skinsuit and aero helmet, the sum total will be quite a bit faster than the sum of each of the alternate options. Specialized’s particular genius here is in combining all that for a single headline figure."
7936,"So yes, there’s some marketing there, but it’s not only marketing. For one thing, if you’re going to make bold claims, you need to back them up. Simply providing wind tunnel data that says that X part is faster is getting so de rigeur now that many of us, in the press and broader public, tune it out. For its claims, Specialized went to greater lengths to prove them than any press event I’ve attended in 20 years of doing this."
7937,"The protocol went like this: Each journalist (there were 12 total) had a basic bike fit done in advance of the event. We had two bikes set up: a new Venge ViAS and an S-Works Tarmac. We took wind-tunnel readings on both setups to establish drag, and then did a back-to-back road test of each setup on a lightly rolling 19km loop to see whether we were faster. Specialized used a sophisticated data analysis software tool from its partner, carmaker McLaren, to normalize the power output and weather conditions across both runs, essentially stripping out variables so we could see the effect of the equipment itself."
7938,"Across my two runs, the Venge setup was 122 seconds faster than the conventional setup, or an average speed increase of 1.74kph (a little over 1mph). That’s significant, especially considering that the actual “conventional” setup we ran was slightly faster than their benchmarks, and since the Sub-6 shoes weren’t available to test, that made the Venge ViAS setup a little slower."
7939,"I wasn’t the only one who was faster: All 12 journalists were. Even stripping out the outliers, the average time savings in the group was two minutes over 19km."
7940,     RELATED: Proof of Speed: How Specialized is Backing Up Its Claims
7941,"After all the science, however, as a rider you’re still left with how a bike feels. The Venge package, to me, felt undeniably faster. Even as the wind picked up slightly on our second run, I could run a gear higher in most situations."
7942,"On group rides, the bike had none of the bottom bracket sway that some earlier aero road models had. There’s plenty of snap and verve, and gaps could be closed down quickly, hills jammed up and descents railed. Braking power and feel was solid—enough that you wouldn’t know it’s a direct-pull cantilever. And the geometry and fit were spot on."
7943,But it’s important to note here that Specialized isn’t necessarily targeting the Venge or Cervelo S5 rider. They aim to get riders off normal road bikes and on to aero machines.
7944,"I’ve never been much for aero bikes as a category. I feel they generally ride like 2x4s, all brute stiffness and aggression, with zero nuance or road feel. And yes, that includes the current Venge. As a tool, they’re a broadsword where I prefer a scalpel."
7945,"The Venge ViAS was the first aero road bike I’ve been on that I actually enjoyed. On a 62-mile road ride, it proved comfortable trading pulls on the gently rolling outward leg, grinding up a climb or hammering an almost 40mph paceline with a tailwind. At one point, grimly hanging on to the back of the line after a pull, I thought to myself: “If I was on a Tarmac right now, I’d be screwed.”"
7946,"Aero road gear is in some ways a treadmill. Once everyone’s on faster stuff, no one has an advantage; we’re all just suffering at a higher speed. But we’re a long way from that point. I still wouldn’t consider myself a likely aero road bike buyer—especially not at the prices that Specialized has introduced the Venge ViAS at. But I have to admit that there’s an allure here: an undeniable acceptance of the fact that, on this bike, I’ll almost certainly go faster than I ever have."

"
8087,"Clothing is one of the most overlooked aspects of aerodynamics. But when you consider that a rider has far more frontal surface area than a bike, it is obvious that even small improvements matter.
The S-Works Evade GC skinsuit will come in 11 sizes to ensure that riders can get as close to a custom fit as possible without the $1,500 price tag that comes with it. Specialized experimented with dozens of fabrics, wrapping cylinder tubes and putting them in the wind tunnel to gauge drag."

8090,"For its shoes, Specialized created not one but two new top-end models. The S-Works 6 is very similar to the existing version. The heel cup has been redesigned for a snugger fit, and the upper uses a fabric layer from Dyneema called Cubic Tech—a high-strength, non-stretch woven panel across the instep that helps prevent the upper from loosening up over time.
The FACT Powerline outsole is Specialized’s stiffest yet, the company says, and accounts for a bold claim from shoe consultant Andy Pruitt: The new sole, he said, improves a figure Specialized calls zero to max watts (basically a function of acceleration) enough that in a 10-second standing sprint, a rider on the S-Works 6 shoes can travel four bike-lengths farther."

8097,"In an interesting and very European choice, the bike has a double chainring up front. While this may seem strange to an American market used to 1x-everything for off-road use, the European market still favors doubles for added range when trekking, and to tackle the continents's plentiful steep climbs and speedy bike paths. As e-bike motors get better and battery life lasts longer, I expect to see this trend shrink."

8107,"Fight airline baggage fees and fly with your bicycle—without going broke.
"
8108,"Note: The information in this article is time-sensitive and subject to change. Always check with airlines ahead of time.BIKES ARE BIG. And so when you fly with your bicycle, that one geometric fact means that airline companies are likely going to charge you extra.
How much extra depends on the airline. Fees range from JetBlue's and Southwest's reasonable $50 per bike each way to the $200 one-way fare US Airways and Delta charge. At $400 in added fees, a round-trip on Delta between Atlanta and Los Angeles would be cheaper if your bike flew as a passenger.
Some airlines are getting the memo. Beginning April 13, Frontier Airlines ended its bike-handling fee for passengers of the more expensive ""Classic"" and ""Classic Plus"" tickets. And for the past two years, in honor of the Tour de France, JetBlue has made bike transit free from July 1 to July 30 (an airline spokeswoman could not confirm that the promotion would happen again this summer).
A portion of the bike fee is based in reality. Larger bags are harder to load and require special handling by the ground crew. In rare circumstances—as with visible damage to a hard-shell case, or divine intervention—airlines may even pay for damages.
The majority of airlines will, theoretically, waive the bike fees if your bicycle doesn't exceed size and weight restrictions of a ""normal"" bag, but unless you're riding a collapsible, BMX, or kid's bike, that's a long shot. The ""normal"" size and weight of non-oversize baggage most airlines seemed to have settled on is 62 dimensional inches (the sum of the length, width, and height) and lighter than 50 pounds.
First things first. Before your bike flies, it'll need to be in box form. Airlines typically prefer hard-shell cases or cardboard bike boxes, but soft cases can work provided there is ample padding. You'll have to remove your pedals and secure your handlebars (or you can encase both in foam or packing material).
If you're flying business class or internationally, the airline may waive some of the baggage fees. It'd be wise to check ahead with your airline if a leg of your journey involves a small regional aircraft, which may not have space for your oversize bag."

8146,"It’s no longer odd to see disc-brake bikes on a ride—from hardcore roadie world-championship training grinds, to the weekly shop ride, to the townie bar crawl—the brakes that were once only a staple on mountain bikes have become the new standard. (Even World Tour teams have been riding them during cycling’s biggest races since the UCI approved them for the 2018 season.) Heck, even the purists at BICYCLING who vehemently resisted discs on aesthetic principle have accepted their excellent stopping power, superior speed modulation, and better all-weather performance on all types of bikes."
8147,"What’s even better is that great braking power is now available at almost every price point. And while disc brakes make huge impacts on your ride, they can be heavier and sometimes more challenging to maintain. So whether you’re a holdout or already rocking them, here’s a basic guide on disc brakes and how to make the most of them. "
8148,"There are two main types of disc brakes: mechanical, which works with cables (just like rim brakes), and hydraulic, which replaces the cables with hydraulic fluid in a fully sealed line. When you brake, the pressure forces the fluid to move into the caliper, pressing the pads against the disc. If you’re interested in buying a disc brake–​equipped bike for less than $1,000, you’re probably going to end up with mechanical brakes. This lower-cost option will allow you to spend less and still own a bike with reliable, all-weather stopping power. Apart from price, some riders prefer cable-activated disc brakes because they’re easier to work on at home, and they’re compatible with most mechanical brake levers. But more bikes are coming stock with hydraulic disc brakes. This pricier option is generally more difficult for the home mechanic to maintain. We suggest having a shop mechanic bleed your brakes (the old hydraulic fluid is flushed and replaced with fresh fluid) because you need to use the right fluid, which is matched to your brake for proper heat management. While this costs more than replacing cables, it only needs to be done every six months. (SRAM recommends bleeding hydraulic disc brakes every six months. Shimano’s official user manuals do not specify a service interval but does say to replace the fluid when it becomes discolored.) "
8149,"Brake levers are attached by the brake lines to calipers located on both the front and rear discs. Calipers contain opposed pistons that sit on either side of the rotor; pressure from the brake line engages these pistons, which push the brake pads inward to contact the disc. The resulting friction slows the bike. "
8150,"If your rotor doesn’t spin freely, you know it—the resulting rubbing, grinding, and squealing will drive you nuts—and it can cost you some momentum. Usually, the caliper is misaligned."
8151,"Fix this by loosening the two bolts attaching the caliper to the frame or fork just enough so that the caliper can move side-to-side. Wiggle the caliper to make sure it moves freely, then pull the corresponding brake lever hard. This will clamp the caliper to the rotor. Hold the brake lever down to keep the caliper in place while tightening the top and bottom bolts until snug. Then retighten the top bolt to torque spec, followed by the bottom bolt. If you’ve adjusted your caliper but still hear rubbing, check your rotor—sometimes they warp from a hit or excess heat.  "

This only works if the rotor is rubbing in one specific spot. If you’re unsure if it’s the rotor or the brake, you’re better off taking your bike to a professional to get it done right.

They produce more heat but are less susceptible to its effects; and they last longer under heavy use and in wet conditions."
8229,"Resin pads are what most brakes come with, but you should consider switching to metallic if you’re bigger, ride downhill terrain, or ride mostly in wet weather."
8230,"If you’ve checked your caliper and rotor but still hear an awful squealing when braking, it can mean that the braking surface (including pads and/or rotors) is contaminated and needs cleaning."
8231,"Detach the wheel and use isopropyl alcohol on a clean rag to wipe off the rotor, then remove the pads and clean them as well. It’s also a good idea to wear disposable latex gloves; you’re trying to get dirt and oil off the braking surface, not add more. Make sure to let the pads dry completely before reinstalling. "

"
8234,
8235,"SRAM recommends replacing pads when the total thickness of the backing plate and the pad material is under 3mm. Shimano says that when the pad material alone is less than half a millimeter thick, it needs to be replaced. If you switch pad type (resin to metallic, say), swap your rotors as well; the pads and rotors pair by “bedding” small amounts of the pad material on the rotor, which means an old rotor won’t get optimal performance with a new pad type because it’s already bedded to the other kind of pad material."
8236,"Once you’ve put some big hours in on your disc brake–equipped bike, you’ll start to incrementally wear down the pads and the rotors. If your brakes start to feel less effective, but you’re certain there’s still life left in the pads and that everything is aligned, check to see if the rotors look glossy. If so, it’s time to grab some sandpaper and get to work."
8237,"Opt for a minimum of 200-grit sandpaper. Remove your wheels, then gently sand each rotor until the glossy haze disappears, and you see a dull color with a slightly textured finish. With this new texture, your bike’s rotors will provide more friction against the brake pads when you pull the levers, restoring the performance you expect from discs. This inexpensive hack isn’t a cure-all, but it has helped our staff mechanic and logistician, Joël Nankman, extend the life of disc brakes for years. Congrats—you’ve just salvaged the integrity of your brakes."
8238,"A cutting edge carbon E-bike that you can't have - yet.
"
8239,"Over the last few years, Pivot has been quietly working on one of the most advanced mountain bikes ever made—the Shuttle e-mountain bike. From its full carbon fiber frame with 140mm dw-link design suspension, to aggressive geometry that’s closer to the enduro-focused Firebird than any other in its line, Pivot didn’t hold anything back when designing the Shuttle."
8240,RELATED: Your e-Bike Questions Answered
8241,"Shimano’s STePS E-8000 system powers the bike, and Pivot does something clever with its 503 watt-hour battery to make the integration ultra clean-looking and functional: A custom plate replaces the lower part of the Shimano battery so it can bolt into the bottom of the downtube. In addition to holding the battery, this plate is a structural piece adding strength and stiffness to the frame. Batteries can be swapped in about five minutes for extended adventures or additional laps on the trail, and a water-resistant port allows for recharging without battery removal."
8242,
8243,
8244,"With a claimed weight of just 44 pounds, the Shuttle is about six pounds lighter than the lightest e-bikes we've encountered, and it might even feel a bit lighter than that out on the trail. Not only is it stiff and precise, but the geometry (including super-short 17.2” chainstays) makes lofting the front end feel almost like riding a normal bike. A really long front-center keeps the front end from getting too light under power, and the crisp dw-link suspension feels efficient while remaining active and supple over bumps. There’s no wallow, hang, or momentum-robbing funny business in the geometry to slow your forward movement."
8245,
8246,
8247,"In an effort to increase frame and wheel stiffness, Pivot utilizes its Super Boost Plus 157mm rear axle spacing like it first used on the Switchblade. And like the Switchblade, the Shuttle can run 29er wheels or 27.5""+ with clearance for up to a 3” wide tire."
8248,"I spent three hours pedaling the Shuttle around the Nevada desert outside of Las Vegas (with a lot of that time spent in Boost mode) and I swear the battery seemed to last longer that other STePS E-8000 equipped bikesI’ve been on—I ended the session with two of the five bars remaining on the gauge. Maybe it was the rolling nature of the desert terrain, or perhaps it was the lighter bike coming into play. It's certainly possible that even in boost mode, the motor didn't have to work as hard as on heavier bikes."
8249,RELATED: The Place for e-Bikes
8250,"I’ve ridden a lot of e-mountain bikes at this point, and the Shuttle is really in a league of its own. It's light, clean-looking, and performs more like a regular trail bike than any e-bike I've tried. Ready for the bad news? You can’t have one. Not in North America anyways—the Shuttle is only being offered in Europe. Pivot is taking a rather conservative approach, waiting to see how things play out here in terms of demand and trail access. In the meantime, Pivot plans on selling all Shuttles in Europe, with a price tag of €9,999."

Head angles that are road-bikey, forks with generous rake (distance between the front axle and the steering axis), and longer front-centers (measured from the middle of the BB to the front axle) than traditional cyclocross bikes translate to a longer wheelbase and more steadiness over rough terrain.

8371,"This is why, a couple of years ago, road bikes started appearing in shops with stock tires measuring 25mm instead of 23mm. Now, thanks to the wanderlust that’s taking more of us off-pavement, and our collective growing desire to ride longer and more comfortably in more conditions, 28 is starting to become the new 25. (Extra clearance on an increasing number of road frames with disc brakes means it might not be long before 30 or even 32 become popular, but for now 28mm is what fits into modern road frames with short-reach rim brakes.)"

He also pointed about that ""the brakes do not require a strong pull to reach lockup, which makes the brakes feel powerful, but that feeling is nicely balanced by the smooth initial bite, and a wide and intuitive modulation band."""
8382,"When shopping for disc brakes, it can be easy to get lost in the different options on the market, but Campy's H11s are great for anyone looking for smooth and quiet operation with a precise feel at the levers."

8384,"Trek shoots for the moon with its new aero road bike
"
8385,"It was a Friday afternoon in late May and I was sitting in the atrium of Trek’s Waterloo, Wisconsin headquarters. I was there to get my first look at Trek’s new 2016 Madone and, during a small break in the action, catching up on some email. A meeting-room door opened to my left, and I watched over 100 men and women stream out. “Company meeting?” I asked my handler, Royce Breckon, Trek’s service brand manager. “Nope,” he said, “Engineering department meeting.”"
8386,"As I would later learn, Trek has about 80 engineers worldwide; when support staff is counted, Trek’s engineering department employs about 200 individuals. While not all of them were involved in the creation of the new 2016 Madone 9-Series, this gives you an idea of the resources and horsepower that the company was able to put into its new aero road bike—and most ambitious model to date."
8387,"Meet the 2016 Trek Madone
	The new Madone has been raced in the wild for some time now, so this release is not exactly a surprise. But now we can share the design details and give you some ride impressions."
8388,"Trek has very high aspirations for the new Madone, calling its release, ""the biggest launch in Trek’s history."" Its tagline is “the ultimate race bike,” and to try and reach that benchmark, Trek considered aerodynamics, handling and rider comfort."
8389,     Related: Pro Cyclists Debut 2016 Trek Madone 9-Series
8390,"The frame is carbon composite, naturally, and the design is highly integrated in the pursuit of (claimed) class-leading aerodynamics. The new Madone also gets Trek’s IsoSpeed Decoupler—a seat tube decoupled from the top tube and seatstays so it may flex further and more easily, increasing vertical compliance—which was originally found on the Domane."
8391,"The 2016 Madone will be offered in two variations. One uses Trek’s highest grade 700 series carbon and the company’s H1 long-and-low fit, and is made in Waterloo, Wisconsin. The second is made of 600 series carbon and uses Trek’s H2 fit–taller stack and shorter reach compared to the same size in H1–and is made overseas."
8392,"The difference, besides fit: The H1 bike is a 100 grams lighter, and in Trek’s testing appears a bit stiffer and a bit more vertically compliant; however, on the open road, the two ride very similarly, says Michael Mayer, Trek’s global road brand manager. Both are considered the company’s top of the line 9-Series frames, but Trek says the customer who wants the H1 fit is more race-oriented and desires every bit of weight savings. A women’s version will be offered; however, it uses the same geometry as the standard H2 with some spec adjustment."
8393,"Trek claims a 56cm H1 Madone frame weighs 950 grams, and that a complete 56cm H1 bike with Dura-Ace Di2 and Bontrager Aeolus 3 wheels weighs just over 15 pounds."
8394,"Aerodynamics and Integration
	Using an iterative process, Trek took a computer model of the first aerodynamic Madone, launched in 2013, and modified, then tested; then modified some more and tested again. Hundreds of virtual models were created, each one trying to make the Madone a bit more slippery, but always with an eye on the bike’s other performance goals. Bottle placement alone was subject to 140 iterations before arriving at the most aerodynamic position, and Trek claims the Madone is more aerodynamic with bottles than without."
8395,"Shadows of the old Madone exist. Geometry is slightly tweaked, and the new Madone’s primary tube shapes are evolutions of the KVF (Kamm Virtual Foil) truncated airfoils introduced in the previous generation. But the new Madone has a much deeper downtube, and aerodynamically shaped seat tube and seatstays where the old used round tubes."
8396,"Trek tested the new Madone against the Cervelo S5, Giant Propel, and a Felt AR in the San Diego Wind Tunnel, which Trek considers to be the best and most accurate. Ben Coates, Trek’s road product manager, stressed that the company was pursuing real-world aerodynamics, so all the bikes in the wind tunnel comparison were equipped with two water bottles."
8397,"Though the Madone was not fastest at all yaw angles (the S5 and AR eclipsed it at some), Trek’s white paper on the new Madone claims the 2016 Madone is the “overall fastest bike across all yaw angles.” Trek also tested a first-generation Specialized Venge, but didn’t include it in their comparison, “based on data collected from previous test that showed it was not a leader in aerodynamics.” How the new Madone compares to the new Venge is unknown."
8398,"Trek’s evaluation then stepped outside the virtual world and the controlled environment of the wind tunnel, and into a velodrome and out on open roads. The claimed results: At 40kph, the new Madone provides a 19-watt savings over a non-aero race bike (Trek used their Emonda as a representative) in a solo time trial situation, and a 14-watt savings when drafting."
8399,"To realize these aerodynamic gains, Trek considered more than just the frame, designing dedicated brakes and an integrated bar and stem. The integrated bar and stem saves 34 grams of drag compared to a Bontrager XXX Aero bar, says Trek. The tops are intended to be ridden naked; wrapping them with tape wrecks the bar’s aerodynamics."
8400,"More drag savings, up to 37 grams, were realized by hiding the cables. They are run internally through the bar, exiting the stem just in front of the steerer clamp and immediately entering the frame. Except for the rear derailleur loop (or wire) and a tiny bit of rear brake cable, the new Madone has no exposed cables, housing, or wires."
8401,"Though the fork’s steerer tube where the stem attaches is effectively 1-1/8” diameter, it is relieved so the cables can enter the frame directly from the integrated bar. While it is possible to clamp other stems to the steerer, it is presently not possible to route the cables properly with anything else, nor use any headset spacers other than those that come with the frame. Speed and integration has its compromises."
8402,"For safety, Trek typically recommends that a fork steerer be cut so a few millimeters are exposed above the stem clamp. Doing so requires an extra headset spacer above the stem. The Madone’s stem, however, is designed with the extra spacer built in so the preload cap sits flat for less drag. Trek’s Blendr system accommodates the mounting of computers and lights to the bar."
8403,"Trek will offer 13 different versions of the integrated bar; all use the same Bontrager VR-CF variable radius drop, however, you will see some Trek Factory Racing riders with a team-only ergo-bend version. Bar widths are 40,42, and 44, all in 90-120mm lengths, as well as a 42x130."
8404,"The center pull brakes are unique to the Madone; no other brake is currently compatible with the frame. The brakes are “designed to seamlessly match the fork and seat stay surfaces, integrating with the recessed areas and allowing air to flow smoothly over the entire surface,” according to the Madone’s white paper. Though the mounting format looks similar to the Shimano direct mount standard—used by the previous Madone and Emonda—it is different enough that only Trek’s brake will work properly."
8405,"The dual-pivot brake matches the power of Shimano's excellent 9000-series brake caliper, says Trek, and leverage is adjustable for proper feel and performance with all the major component-maker’s brake levers. Wide rims are no problem, says Coates. Independently adjustable arm position allows the brake to, “work with every rim on the market today.”"
8406,"After taking a trip down under the bottom bracket on the previous generation, the rear brake returns to the seatstays on the new Madone. Trek says this placement is a bit less aerodynamic, but easier to access and adjust, and, because of the way a wheel flexes, reduces brake rub. Almost all the hardware on both brakes is uncovered and easily accessible, and there is a lever to open the arms for wheel changes. You can’t compensate for brake pad wear by adjusting on the fly with a knob at the housing stop like you can on a typical side pull caliper. Instead, the arms must be moved closer to the rim with a hex wrench."
8407,"One of the more curious details of the new Madone are the “vector wings”. Government regulations state that a bike’s front wheel must be able to turn up to 65 degrees from center, even though a rider would almost never turn the bars that far when riding. However, the shape that Trek desired for the head tube, with internal cable routing for the front brake, did not allow this much rotation. The solution was a cover with sprung wings that accommodate this amount of steering. When the bar is turned far enough, the wing is pushed open by the brake; when the bar is turned back, the wing snaps closed."
8408,"“Ma-domane”
	Historically, one of the biggest complaints about aero bikes is an unrefined ride feel. Trek’s solution: Borrow the IsoSpeed Decoupler from the Domane. But Trek ran into a problem in applying it to the new bike: The aerodynamically shaped seat tube (the Domane’s seat tube is round) could not flex enough to provide worthwhile vertical compliance. The solution was to give the Madone a second, internal seat tube."
8409,"While the exterior “seat” tube is a structural part of the frame, the seat post is attached to second tube hidden inside the exterior tube. That way, the exposed part of this system is aero shaped, but it transitions to a round, bowed tube inside the frame. Anchored at the bottom bracket shell on one end and with the IsoSpeed decoupler at the top, the interior seat tube can then bend under load, providing about 20mm of vertical compliance; double that of its nearest competitor, claims Trek. Overall, Trek says the 2016 Madone has the same amount of vertical compliance as the Emonda, however, the Domane is about 50 percent more complaint than both."
8410,"Trek will offer two seat mast lengths, and two offsets, 5- and 25mm. The saddle clamp is all new, and provides independent adjustment of tilt and fore/aft position."
8411,"More Than Just Numbers
	Echoing a theme we’re hearing more often from more companies, Trek looked beyond just the on-paper numbers when refining the Madone’s feel and handling. The Madone’s white paper, available at Trek’s website, goes into detail on the topic, but here’s a summary based on my conversations with the people involved in the Madone’s development."
8412,"To collect real world data about the loads on a bike in typical riding situations, Trek builds aluminum test models and equips them with strain gauges to measure deflection, power meters, and speed and cadence sensors. Test riders subject the bikes to routine events: climbing, sprinting, and cornering, etc., while data recorders collected information from the sensors about the bike’s behavior in response to the events. Trek used this real world data to evaluate computer models, and to be sure the simulations they run on the frames provides an accurate picture of the way a bike would behave in the real world."
8413,"Using this method, Trek’s engineers could build several versions of a frame, each having different characteristics. Test riders then provided feedback about each frame’s desirable and undesirable traits. Essentially, the models gave Trek the tools to identify and tune the nuances that add up to what riders call “feel.”"
8414,"In designing the new Madone, Trek took feedback from its pro factory racing team riders who said they really liked the way the Emonda rode. Thanks to its testing process, engineers had a good idea of what contributed to these positive characteristics, and they built much of that into the new Madone, even though the latter’s tube shapes are much different."
8415,"Then, in January 2014, Trek had its factory team riders evaluate three prototypes of the new Madone, each with a different carbon layup. That feedback was taken and used to further develop the new bike. A year later Trek had “full production” versions, again in three different layups, tested by the team again and used the feedback to lock in the final layup of the production 2016 Madone."
8416,"At the bike launches I attend, there is almost invariably some slide or discussion about drivetrain, head tube and torsional stiffness and how much awesome-r it is than the previous generation frame and/or competitor’s frames. But Trek’s people didn’t talk much about the Madone’s stiffness at the launch. My impression: They weren’t specifically gunning to achieve a benchmark in a certain test, or notable gains over the previous Madone, or exceed that of competitor’s frames. Their primary concern, I felt, was achieving the ride and handling goals that fulfilled the bike’s purpose, and they seemed quite confident that those goals were met. The resulting stiffness, measured in the traditional ways, is what it is—or so it would seem. They did let on that the Madone is, “a bit stiffer than an Emonda, and less stiff than a Domane.”"
8417,"The Rest
	Aerodynamics, IsoSpeed and feel are the three points Trek is emphasizing with the new Madone, but there are other notable details as well."
8418,The frame can accept up to 28mm wide tires. Yes. An aero frame with rim brakes that takes 28mm tires.
8419,"The Control Center is flat-out nifty. Found high up the down tube where it is accessible on the fly, it houses an electronic shifting system’s junction box (with Shimano, the junction box button for adjusting trim and to fine-tune shifting is accessible) or, for mechanical, contains a front derailleur cable-tension adjuster. When it’s time to charge the Di2, the charging port is accessed by releasing a catch, popping open the Control Center. Note: The frame is compatible with Campagnolo EPS drivetrains, but the battery must be mounted on the outside of the frame."
8420,"Carried over from Trek’s other models is its chain retention device (though the Madone’s is “more aerodynamic,” of course), DuoTrap speed and cadence sensor pocket, and BB92 bottom bracket."
8421,Trek also incorporated a few Easter Eggs into the Madone’s paint. I don’t want to spoil the surprise so I’ll leave them to you to find.
8422,"Four complete bikes are offered, three with H2 geometry. All use the same brake calipers and integrated bar. Sizing now mirrors the Emonda. Seven sizes, 50-62cm, are offered in H1; and nine from 47 to 64cm in H2.
	- Madone 9.2, $6300, built with Shimano Ultegra 11 mechanical and Bontrager Paradigm aluminum wheels;
	- Madone 9.5 $8400, built with Shimano Dura-Ace 11 mechanical and Bontrager Aura 5 carbon wheels (aluminum brake track);
	- Madone 9.9 $12,600 built with Shimano Dura Ace Di2 11 and Bontrager Aeolus 5 carbon wheels. Also offered in a women’s version."
8423,"Also offered is the Madone Race Shop Limited $13,650, a replica of the bike the Trek Factory Racing team rides, with H1 geometry, Shimano Dura Ace Di2 and Bontrager Aeolus 5 carbon wheels."
8424,"The Madone in H1 and H2 fits are also offered through Trek’s Project One paint and parts customization program starting in August. The amazing, hot-pink abomination you see in the photos (note that Trek painted it in the colors I requested) was a H2 Project One dreamed up by yours truly."
8425,"Also offered is a frame module–brakes, one-piece bar and stem, and seat mast included–for $5,780 for the H1 and $4,730 for the H2."
8426,"How it Rides
	The new Madone H2 Project One came to the office for a couple of our most experienced testers to spend about a week each on the bike. Off the bat, we were impressed by the bike’s ride quality. One tester compared the bike to the Domane Classic, calling the ride “silky and smooth”; another said there was “good, aggressive-type, road and surface feedback with surprising smoothness—there were no instances of rough chatter over the odd bump.” They also noted that the bike felt very connected to the road, and that even when road conditions deteriorated, the tires tracked and stuck to the ground. The IsoSpeed decoupler gave the feeling of occasionally bottoming out—letting us know that it was indeed working. There was also no brake rub under sprinting, climbing, or pedal mashing."
8427,"The new Madone is also surprisingly comfortable: “I could be happy riding it all day, or for an hour crit,” was the comment. The bike handled precisely, and was easy to control over the road."
8428,"And of course, it felt fast. On one race-like weekly group ride, a tester observed that he seemed to be able to pedal less than others in the group, all else being equal, and that on a shallow downhill where he normally coasted at a steady speed, he felt like he was actually accelerating."
8429,"Overall, the impression came back that the Madone didn’t feel like an aero bike in the ways we typically expect: The ride wasn’t harsh and chattery, the bike was stiff, and while it didn’t feel feathery, it wasn’t heavy, either. As one tester put, “This just felt like a really nice road/racing bike.” And as another said, “It’s just an easy bike to like.”"
8430,"The Ultimate?
	Is the 2016 Madone “the ultimate race bike”? Time may tell, but frankly, statements like these are usually unverifiable. Here’s what I know so far: It’s awesome to see Trek finding a bit of swagger and flexing its muscles. I can’t imagine the Trek of just a few years ago going for it they way the company did with the new Madone. This is an impressive bike. And, based on testers’ feedback, it is a great-riding bike. The Bicycling staff races, and loves racing, but we all ride more than we race. And when we ride, we love to go fast on great equipment. The 2016 Madone lets us do both. And it didn’t come cheap or easy—it took a lot of engineering manpower."
8431,"With the $769 Sladda, the mega-retailer hopes to do for urban cycling what it did for Swedish meatballs."
8432,"Ikea, the Swedish home-furnishings leviathan, will be selling a bike dubbed the Sladda starting in August. While this news might immediately inspire images of city noobs in fifth-floor walk-ups attempting to assemble their flat-packed rides using Ikea’s infamous confuse-a-structions, the bike and its design speak volumes about Ikea’s intentions: to create tools that lead to a more sustainable world, and to sell lots of them. Can Ikea—or Bikea, as some are now calling it—do for cycling what its Swedish meatballs did for dinner?"
8433,     RELATED: Cheap City and Commuter Bikes You'll Love
8434,"It’s too soon to say how much assembly will be required, but what we do know is that the $797 Sladda is loosely styled after classic European utility bikes. The design came from high-end Swedish design firm Veryday, known for Baby Bjorn, Koenigsegg sports cars, and more. The bike features a unisex step-through aluminum frame with a 25-year guarantee, a front disc brake, adjustable-height handlebars, a choice of 26- or 28-inch wheels (yes, 28), SRAM’s Automatix two-speed internal-gear rear hub, and perhaps most notably, a maintenance-free belt drive (read: no chain) that the retailer claims will last 9,300 miles. A press release describes Sladda as “the two-wheeled urban mobility solution.”"
8435,"We haven’t had a chance to test the Sladda yet; in the meantime, the name means “to slide sideways,” so perhaps Ikea execs imagine some aggressive fixie-inspired usage. Early photos reveal it to be about as sexy as a Billy bookcase, available only in double-lacquered off-white. Then again, Ikea sells a Billy bookcase every 10 seconds, so maybe we shouldn’t underestimate the appeal of basic. "
8436,"Ikea's move into bike sales is promising for other reasons, too: I for one have eaten plenty of proverbial Swedish meatballs. Despite living in northern New Mexico, where I’m 400 miles from the nearest blue-and-yellow big-box, I have installed three Ikea kitchens in a trio of property renovations over the last decade; have purchased a handful of Ikea home furnishings; and browse its labyrinthine stores whenever I’m in striking distance. I’ve always liked the Scando-modern style, and modest impact on my debit card—and the products aren’t as cheaply made as its particle-board reputation might have you believe. I'm not alone, apparently. The retailer operates 328 stores in 43 countries (42 of them in the US), generating $31.9 billion in sales last year."
8437,"The company seems to see bicycles as a product that could help increase those sales—and boost its efforts toward sustainability. In 2014, the company started selling the Folkvanlig, an e-bike that retailed for around $1,000, but only at a few select stores in Austria. The program didn’t last very long and the Folkvanlig is no longer available. In 2010, as a year-end bonus, the company gave each of its 12,400 US employees an “all-terrain” bicycle, as a thank you and also to further encourage a healthy lifestyle and sustainable transport. The move got a lot of press (Wal-Mart was under fire at the time for curtailing employee perks), but the rigid bikes were so cheap that they made a vintage Huffy look like a Colnago."
8438,"Moreover, Ikea has been vocal about its commitment to sustainable living and reducing carbon footprints. This is no small irony, as many have pointed out, coming from a company that produced nearly 38 million tons of carbon in 2015, according to its own sustainability report. In January, Steve Howard, the company’s chief of sustainability, declared the world had reached “peak stuff”, despite the company’s declared goals of doubling its sales by 2020. Ikea has stated that it intends to be energy independent by that date as well. Nudging its customers toward health and sustainability may be one way it reconciles these ostensibly conflicting agendas. "
8439,"Whatever their motives, Ikea's decision makers did not have to look far or hard for inspiration. Scandinavia is home to the most bike commuter-centric countries around, with Northern European cities regularly dominating bike-friendly rankings; just last month, Norway pledged $1 billion to cycling infrastructure. And that normalcy of bike commuting is burgeoning in other Ikea markets. According to the US Census Bureau, the number of Americans who bike commute jumped from 488,000 in 2008 to 786,000 in 2012; meanwhile, the journal Transport Reviews found bike-share programs grew in number worldwide from 13 to 855 between 2004 and 2014, with 54 programs in the US. "
8440,     RELATED: These 16 City Bikes are the Best We've Seen This Year
8441,"This leaves me—and others, I'm sure—conflicted. Is it possible that mega-corporations create more problems than solutions as they extract increasing environmental resources and trounce independent retailers? Yes. But could these commerce giants, Ikea included, be high-impact change-agents? Yes to that, too. If bikes become an extension of Ikea’s ideal—convenient, inexpensive, low-impact, reliable, cool—it could help cycling evolve beyond an activity still mostly regarded as sport and recreation, at least here in America. Where many urban-cycling companies like Brilliant Bicycle Co. or Public Bikes are starting from the ground up, Ikea already has the bandwidth to reach consumers worldwide, and deliver products in bulk. Cycling has come a long way thanks to all the custom makers, specialty retailers, advocacy groups, and ride clubs fighting the good fight across the country, but maybe we could use an extra push from a big out-of-towner to make bikes as common in our lives as bookcases and meatballs."
8442,"Steel frame relies on grace and spirit, not brute force
"
8443,"Finding the ""right"" bike is a matter of picking your compromise. Even in a sport as unique as cyclocross, there is no one universally perfect race machine. Most top-end race bikes these days are made from either aluminum or carbon, but there's still room for a great steel bike, especially if you’re willing to look to performance factors other than stiffness—and Ritchey's Swiss Cross (CHCX in shorthand) is one of the best steel CX rigs we’ve ridden.Frame Details
Before Tom Ritchey was best known for making handlebars, stems, and seatposts, he was a highly regarded framebuilder. Although his focus has changed, Ritchey is still involved in many aspects of product development at his eponymous company. On the Swiss Cross, Ritchey's global marketing director, Sean Coffey, told us that Ritchey dictated, “the exact size and location of the chainstay dent,"" as well as ""the diameter, taper, wall thickness, and butting profile of the chainstays.” Coffey noted that several early, imperfect versions of the CHCX now hang around in the company’s offices."
8444,
8445,"The newest version of Cannondale’s flagship road racing bike is just as comfortable, but more precise 
"
8446,"When Cannondale engineers set out to better the existing Supersix Evo Hi-Mod, one thing was apparent from the start: They didn’t want to lose the balanced feel of the original, they wanted to improve on it, which is a tall order. The original was a great-riding bike that was able to win any type of race in the WorldTour. From one-day classics to Grand Tours and anything in between. Of course they wanted to chase the holy grail of bike design; lighter, stiffer, faster, but never at the expense of the one thing that set the Supersix apart from other bikes in it’s category: It’s amazing ability to shield the rider from the harsh realities of the road."
8447,"Rather than make a bike that was great in only one area, Cannondale’s designers took a holistic approach and set about to design a bike that would be good over the whole of a race. To start with, they knew they wanted to improve stiffness, both for climbing and sprinting. They wanted to create a bike that was incredibly smooth, a tall order as the outgoing model was lauded for its ride feel, and lastly they wanted to improve on the bikes ability to cut through the wind. In short, according to Cannondale’s Global product marketing director Murray Washburn, they wanted to make the best all-around race bike, from start to finish."
8448,"They started with size-specific layup, something many manufactures have utilized to tune frames to ride the same whether you are 5’0” or 6’1”. The new frame gets a one-piece rear triangle that promises to increase compliance by 15 percent. To do this, seat and chainstays are formed in one piece, including the full-carbon dropouts. A revised layup at the BB has the carbon radiating out into the chainstay to mimic a leaf spring. When paired with the shaped SAVE micro-suspension seatstays the complete assembly should result in an uncompromised ability to soak up road noise and chatter. The seat tube borrows the delta shaping of the Synapse (without the cut-out above the BB shell) and sees a reduction of diameter along its length to further facilitate the movement of the rear end but also keep the same wide stance supporting the bottom bracket. A 73mm-wide BB30A bottom bracket offsets the shell and allows room for the asymmetrical chainstays to fit 28mm tires while further stiffening the frame for more efficient sprinting and climbing. At the front end, Cannondale claims stiffness at the head tube jumps by 11 percent. Something that should add to the already precise control of its predecessor: The company also adopted 25.4mm seatposts with SAVE shaping to increase rider comfort while seated."
8449,     RELATED:Six Tour Bikes You Can Ride
8450,"The new fork features one-piece construction from the formed dropouts all the way to the top of the steerer. This allows the inclusion of a molded-in crown race and the elimination of any right angles in the carbon that can cause stress risers or weaken the assembly. It also gains a weight savings by eliminating a pressed-on, alloy bearing seat. Overall, Cannondale claims a 50-gram weight savings and 21 percent increase in compliance of the new fork."
8451,"With other manufacturers racing to make the most aero bike, Cannondale is not about to forgo some aerodynamic touches. While not as heavily shaped as the new Madone, the Venge ViAS, or Cervelo S5, Cannondale built in subtle aero cues; lowering the head/downtube junction, shaping the main tubes in a truncated aero profile (TAP, for those who like acronyms) and lowering the seat-tube-mounted water bottle so it’s shielded behind the one on the downtube. One way the company curiously sacrifices aero for utility is by running the derailleur cables along the outside of the downtube. Cannondale claims that running the cables internally would have created only minimal drag savings, and was not worth the extra headache the routing creates when it comes time to service your bike."
8452,"The proof is in the ride though. And having many miles on the older model, I was sincerely hoping that the claims were true. I recently tested the Team model in Kirchberg, Austria, over a rolling 45-mile loop with some short punchy hills and a few longer sustained climbs. The end of the route featured a false flat and hard turns into a bit of a headwind back to town. At first, it seemed as if the revamped Evo might not live up to the hype. I felt more chatter and buzz than I was used to, something that could be attributed to different roads, wheels, saddle, and tires than the Black Inc. Nano that is one of my daily rides at home. But as the kilometers ticked by it became apparent that the new frame and fork were going to live up to the claims. There was no loss of the comfort of the old bike. When I pushed the bike, this version felt more precise and it needed a little less input to carve turns, yet it had the same ability to shield me from harsh road conditions."
8453,"As stated, the older model has been my go-to pick for general riding and racing over the last few seasons. It’s light, responsive and fun to ride; so far, so is the new Hi-Mod. The older model has clearance for 25mm tires mounted to wide rims (pushing tire width wider than labeled) and the ability to fit 28mms in the new bike is alluring. I can’t wait to get one home and see what it can really do."
8454,"The new Evo is available in five builds and eight sizes. The geometry mainly stays the same, with reach and stack numbers evened out across the range of sizes. The five models are the top-of-the-line Hi-Mod Black Inc. fitted with Dura Ace Di2, Enve Smart wheels spinning on Chris King hubs and an Enve carbon cockpit and seat post. The model retails for $12,500. The Hi-Mod Team ($10,500) also features Dura Ace Di2 and rolls on Mavic Cosmic pro carbon wheels. The HI-Mod Dura Ace 1($8,000) makes the move to mechanical shifting and Mavic Ksyrium Elite wheels. The Dura Ace 2 ($5,500) features the Mavic Ksyrium wheels, and the Hi-mod Ultegra ($4,500) is equipped with Ultegra components and Mavic Ksyrium wheels. All five models share the same Ballis-tec carbon frame and one-piece full-carbon fork and will be available in the US sometime this fall."

8456,"When Cannondale engineers set out to better the existing Supersix Evo Hi-Mod, one thing was apparent from the start: They didn’t want to lose the balanced feel of the original, they wanted to improve on it, which is a tall order. The original was a great-riding bike that was able to win any type of race in the WorldTour. From one-day classics to Grand Tours and anything in between. Of course they wanted to chase the holy grail of bike design; lighter, stiffer, faster, but never at the expense of the one thing that set the Supersix apart from other bikes in it’s category: It’s amazing ability to shield the rider from the harsh realities of the road."
8457,"Rather than make a bike that was great in only one area, Cannondale’s designers took a holistic approach and set about to design a bike that would be good over the whole of a race. To start with, they knew they wanted to improve stiffness, both for climbing and sprinting. They wanted to create a bike that was incredibly smooth, a tall order as the outgoing model was lauded for its ride feel, and lastly they wanted to improve on the bikes ability to cut through the wind. In short, according to Cannondale’s Global product marketing director Murray Washburn, they wanted to make the best all-around race bike, from start to finish."
8458,"They started with size-specific layup, something many manufactures have utilized to tune frames to ride the same whether you are 5’0” or 6’1”. The new frame gets a one-piece rear triangle that promises to increase compliance by 15 percent. To do this, seat and chainstays are formed in one piece, including the full-carbon dropouts. A revised layup at the BB has the carbon radiating out into the chainstay to mimic a leaf spring. When paired with the shaped SAVE micro-suspension seatstays the complete assembly should result in an uncompromised ability to soak up road noise and chatter. The seat tube borrows the delta shaping of the Synapse (without the cut-out above the BB shell) and sees a reduction of diameter along its length to further facilitate the movement of the rear end but also keep the same wide stance supporting the bottom bracket. A 73mm-wide BB30A bottom bracket offsets the shell and allows room for the asymmetrical chainstays to fit 28mm tires while further stiffening the frame for more efficient sprinting and climbing. At the front end, Cannondale claims stiffness at the head tube jumps by 11 percent. Something that should add to the already precise control of its predecessor: The company also adopted 25.4mm seatposts with SAVE shaping to increase rider comfort while seated."
8459,     RELATED:Six Tour Bikes You Can Ride
8460,"The new fork features one-piece construction from the formed dropouts all the way to the top of the steerer. This allows the inclusion of a molded-in crown race and the elimination of any right angles in the carbon that can cause stress risers or weaken the assembly. It also gains a weight savings by eliminating a pressed-on, alloy bearing seat. Overall, Cannondale claims a 50-gram weight savings and 21 percent increase in compliance of the new fork."
8461,"With other manufacturers racing to make the most aero bike, Cannondale is not about to forgo some aerodynamic touches. While not as heavily shaped as the new Madone, the Venge ViAS, or Cervelo S5, Cannondale built in subtle aero cues; lowering the head/downtube junction, shaping the main tubes in a truncated aero profile (TAP, for those who like acronyms) and lowering the seat-tube-mounted water bottle so it’s shielded behind the one on the downtube. One way the company curiously sacrifices aero for utility is by running the derailleur cables along the outside of the downtube. Cannondale claims that running the cables internally would have created only minimal drag savings, and was not worth the extra headache the routing creates when it comes time to service your bike."
8462,"The proof is in the ride though. And having many miles on the older model, I was sincerely hoping that the claims were true. I recently tested the Team model in Kirchberg, Austria, over a rolling 45-mile loop with some short punchy hills and a few longer sustained climbs. The end of the route featured a false flat and hard turns into a bit of a headwind back to town. At first, it seemed as if the revamped Evo might not live up to the hype. I felt more chatter and buzz than I was used to, something that could be attributed to different roads, wheels, saddle, and tires than the Black Inc. Nano that is one of my daily rides at home. But as the kilometers ticked by it became apparent that the new frame and fork were going to live up to the claims. There was no loss of the comfort of the old bike. When I pushed the bike, this version felt more precise and it needed a little less input to carve turns, yet it had the same ability to shield me from harsh road conditions."
8463,"As stated, the older model has been my go-to pick for general riding and racing over the last few seasons. It’s light, responsive and fun to ride; so far, so is the new Hi-Mod. The older model has clearance for 25mm tires mounted to wide rims (pushing tire width wider than labeled) and the ability to fit 28mms in the new bike is alluring. I can’t wait to get one home and see what it can really do."
8464,"The new Evo is available in five builds and eight sizes. The geometry mainly stays the same, with reach and stack numbers evened out across the range of sizes. The five models are the top-of-the-line Hi-Mod Black Inc. fitted with Dura Ace Di2, Enve Smart wheels spinning on Chris King hubs and an Enve carbon cockpit and seat post. The model retails for $12,500. The Hi-Mod Team ($10,500) also features Dura Ace Di2 and rolls on Mavic Cosmic pro carbon wheels. The HI-Mod Dura Ace 1($8,000) makes the move to mechanical shifting and Mavic Ksyrium Elite wheels. The Dura Ace 2 ($5,500) features the Mavic Ksyrium wheels, and the Hi-mod Ultegra ($4,500) is equipped with Ultegra components and Mavic Ksyrium wheels. All five models share the same Ballis-tec carbon frame and one-piece full-carbon fork and will be available in the US sometime this fall."
8465,A lightweight inverted fork made for cross-country racing—and much more
8466,"After weeks of leaking images and video clips of its new fork, Rockshox unveiled its new RS-1 cross-country fork today. The RS-1 name should sound familiar—it’s the fork that put Rockshox on the map and launched the suspension revolution back in 1988. The most intriguing element of the new RS-1 is its inverted design, in which the fork’s stanchions connect to the front axle and slip up into the fork legs instead of the other way around. Inverted forks have been tried by the likes of Halson, Mountain Cycle, Maverick, Manitou, Marzocchi, and others, but none except perhaps than the recently released, limited production X-Fusion Revel, have achieved much commercial success.Still, there are a lot of compelling reasons to go inverted: Compared to a traditional fork, which has thinner upper stanchions, the wider upper tubes on an inverted model have better fore-aft stiffness and strength. The design also places less stress on the bushings, since they are located closer to the axle, and it keeps the seals bathed in oil (since they’re lower in the fork), both of which reduce friction. In the RS-1, RockShox says, that adds up to better braking feel and improved bump sensitivity.The fork is built for 29-inch wheels, which RockShox believes is still the predominant option for cross-country riding and racing—the RS-1’s intended use. There is intended use overlap with the SID which is still available. According to the company, the inverted design has a better feel than traditional forks, especially in shorter-travel applications. The new model’s one-piece carbon-fiber upper also has the highest bending stiffness of any of RockShox’s single-crown forks."

8468,"Thanks to a flip chip, this transformer of a bike has almost the same geometry when set up with 27.5+ wheels or as a 29er."
8469,"When I realized that 27.5+ wheels fit in 29er bikes, it seemed inevitable that one day most trail 29ers would be built to really work with 27.5+ as well. Santa Cruz is one of the first brands to embrace the concept with its all-new Hightower—a replacement for the 29er Tallboy LT that quietly disappeared from the line last July. The 135mm-travel Hightower is offered as either a 29er or 27.5+ bike."
8470,"From experimenting with 27.5+ tires on 29ers, I learned that the smaller diameter of the plus setup (about a half inch) puts bikes with low bottom brackets very close to the ground. Santa Cruz overcomes this with a flip chip that changes the geometry; combined with a 150mm-travel fork (the 29er version gets 140mm) and 27.5+ wheels, the Hightower ends up with almost the same geometry as when it’s set up as a 29er."

8473,
8474,"The Hightower is vastly improved over the old Tallboy, with a much slacker head angle (by 2.5 degrees) and 15mm-shorter chainstays. It carries eye-watering speed, even when the trail gets choppy, and insane momentum through the corners. Its third-generation VPP suspension design, paired to a RockShox Monarch RT3 shock with DebonAir can, offers Santa Cruz’s best suspension performance to date: It pedals well but is more active and supple at the top of the stroke, which helps the rear tire maintain traction—something previous versions of VPP didn’t always do well. And as before, it eats medium to large hits like it has more than its claimed travel."
8475,     RELATED: The Future of 27.5: Bike Designers Speak Out
8476,"I’d rather have the extra traction of the plus setup on dry or blown-out dirt and on primitive trails with lots of ruts, duff, and litter. But it makes the bike a bit slower and less responsive, while the 29er has more snap and acceleration out of corners. This is why, overall, I prefer the latter. But if I owned this bike, I’d buy an extra set of wheels and the 2017 Fox 36 TALAS fork—which can be set up to adjust on the fly from 140mm to 150mm. It will be available this spring with the wider, 110mm front-hub spacing that works with this bike. With this setup, it’d take five minutes to swap everything out and be ready for whatever trail I’m in the mood for that day—and either way, be on a versatile and great-riding bike."

8478,The revamped 2017 Juliana Joplin becomes the first women’s trail bike that will be sold in—and fully compatible with—both 29er and 27.5+ wheel sizes
8479,"Today, Santa Cruz announced the release of an updated Tallboy platform, and its women’s counterpart, the Juliana Joplin."
8480,"The Joplin shares the same frame as the Tallboy, the first bike to really popularize the 29er wheel size.  In this update, the Joplin morphs from being Juliana’s most XC- or endurance race-ready platform toward what might be our favorite new category of trail bikes: the short-travel trail 29er. Another big change is that, like the Santa Cruz Hightower released earlier this year, the Joplin will be compatible with and sold in two configurations: as a 29er, or a 27.5+ bike. This makes the Joplin the first women’s bike (to our knowledge) to be built for and sold in both wheel-size options."
8481,"From our experience riding the Hightower, we’ve found that the way Santa Cruz has configured its 29er/27.5+ platform enables the bikes to provide similar rider positioning and handling in both configurations when set up properly for each wheel size, so let’s talk first about overall changes to the frame and parts."
8482,     RELATED: Buyer's Guide 2016: The Best Women's Mountain Bikes
8483,"In this update, rear-wheel travel increased from 100mm to 110mm of Santa Cruz’s VPP suspension. In the 27.5+ setup, the Joplin will have a 130mm-travel fork instead of the 120mm spec’d on the previous version. (The 29er setup retains its 120mm travel fork.) The fork is burlier too—a Fox 34 instead of a 32."
8484,"Geometry-wise, the changes fall in line with what we’re generally seeing across the board for mountain bikes: longer, lower, slacker; putting the rider in a position that enables more confident descending. Knowing the head-tube angle tells you a lot about this bike’s personality: It slacked out by 2.2 degrees on average across sizes, to a relatively chilled-out 68 degrees. Reach increased by a significant 40 to 50mm in various sizes (1.7 inches in the size small), while chainstays got shorter by about 11mm across the board, to about 17 inches in a medium. Besides retaining some snappiness in the handling to make up for the longer front-center, the shorter stays also enable the rider to more easily loft the front end to get it over obstacles. A steeper seat-tube angle, by about half a degree, puts her in a more efficient pedaling position. Standover height—often a key metric for smaller riders—got 10 to 30mm lower depending on sizes."
8485,"Other changes that are also in line with what we’re seeing on trail bikes across the industry: The Joplin gets wider hub spacing (148mm in the rear, 110mm in the front), which enables the frame to fit 27.5+ tires as well as rock shorter chainstays without losing stiffness in the rear end. Internal cable routing keeps things looking clean, as does a new, removable front derailleur mount."
8486,"The Joplin will also be Juliana’s first bike that will include a shock tuned for lighter riders. Both Yeti and Specialized have taken this approach with their women’s trail bikes, and we’ve found that this small change does make the rear suspension behave differently for us in a positive way, so we’re stoked to see Juliana incorporate this. It makes plenty of sense: Brand Manager Katie Zaffke told us that, on average, Juliana found that female riders are about 30-pounds lighter than their male counterparts. While the Tallboy got a “medium-medium” tune, the Joplin gets the “light-light,” says Zaffke, which will give it the same plusher feel that Santa Cruz targeted for heavier riders on the Tallboy. On both platforms, the shock rate has been updated for better small-bump compliance—meaning that suspension will be more active over smaller stuff, so you’ll float better and be less jostled over little rocks, roots, and the like—and also better midstroke support, meaning it’s less likely to sink through and make you lose speed when you go through something like a chunky rock garden with big holes. It’s also more progressive at the end, meaning it’ll take a bigger hit to bottom out your shock. (Translation: Go ‘head, send it!)"
8487,     RELATED: First Ride: 2016 Juliana Roubion and Furtado
8488,"Other parts changes include grippier tires, and a dropper seatpost in most build kits where the platform had lacked this before. The Joplin also gets a Juliana women’s saddle, but other parts appear to be the same size-wise as that on the corresponding Tallboy models, including crankset, rims, and handlebar (parts that sometimes are otherwise tweaked on women’s bikes)."
8489,"Like the Hightower, the Joplin gets a flip chip that switches the geometry between a high mode for the 29er, and a low mode to run 27.5+ wheels and tires, so that you get the best riding experience in either wheel size. Juliana recommends running a 130mm fork in the latter mode to retain the targeted handling characteristics, so if you do truly want a bike that can swap between the two, you’ll need a second set of wheels with wider rims and big tires for the 27.5+ setup, plus another fork. On the Hightower, one of our testers estimated that with the right parts, he could do the swap in five minutes or less. At the moment, Santa Cruz doesn't plan to sell wheelset/fork kits, so you’ll have to source those on the side."
8490,"For now, the Joplin will be sold only in Santa Cruz’s top-end, light CC carbon version in small, medium, or large. It’s available now in the Ultraviolet paint scheme (with matching grips) in the following builds:"
8491,"Joplin 29 CC XX1: $7,799Joplin 29 CC X01: $6,499Joplin 27.5+ CC X01: $6,499"

8493,"The Topeak Joe Blow Booster is both a normal pump and a pressure tank, making tubeless tire installs a cinch"
8494,"The Topeak Joe Blow Booster is a double-chambered shop-type floor pump that’s designed to make inflating your tubeless tires easier. It features two aluminum cylinders; one is a normal floor pump, while the second, larger one is a pressure tank. Most of the pump is metal with plastic used in the gauge housing and the cups at the end of the barrels. The hose is long enough (59 inches) to allow access to bikes in a stand, and attaches with a swivel fitting for no-kink use. A simple push-button pressure release is located on the hose swivel, where it attaches to the pump body. That allows for quick tire pressure adjustments should you overinflate. The base is stamped steel and should last a while. Weighing in at a substantial 7.7 pounds, this isn’t your everyday portable pump, but it’s certainly easy enough to tote around for a weekend of racing."
8495,
8496,
8497,How it Works: 
8498,"The Joe Blow Booster has two modes: inflate and charge. The first works much like a normal floor pump. Simply turn the bezel on the large top-mounted analog gauge to “inflate,” attach the pump’s patented Smarthead to your tire’s valve, and start pumping. The Smarthead itself is similar to other offerings in the Topeak line and is compatible with Presta, Schrader, and Dunlop-type valve stems. Simple in design, the inner portion of the head is self-adjusting, which allows use on all valve types without disassembly or a swap of small parts that tend to get lost over time."
8499,"To inflate tubeless tires, change the setting of the bezel to “charge,” directing airflow to the secondary tank. It takes about 45 full strokes of the handle to pressurize it to 160psi. Each charge is enough to seat one tire. "
8500,     RELATED: 4 Ways Your Tire Pressure Is Wrong
8501," Once you are ready to seat the tubeless tire, install it on the rim, pull the valve core from the valve stem (key to getting proper airflow into the tire), attach the pump head, and open the secondary chamber via the bezel ring back to the “pump” setting to let the pressurized air into the tire/wheel.  "
8502,"Of course, seating tubeless tires has its own special list of concerns. The air you’re pumping into the tire needs to push the beads up into the shoulder of the rim, where they lock in place. If the tire/rim interface isn’t tight enough, air can leak out too fast to create enough pressure to do that.

8531,     RELATED: The Quick-Start Guide to Mountain Bike Tire Technology
8532,"The Saber uses a low-profile tread design and grippy rubber compound, along with with hooked-edge knobs, for maximum traction when cornering. Racers at Sea Otter, for example, found the tread to be excellent for the dry, dusty conditions, where the primary technical sections were tricky corners rather than mud pits. We think cyclists who ride and race in areas like the American Southwest, where hardpack is the norm and mud puddles are rare, might find the Saber optimal on their local trails. "
8533,"The Saber comes in two versions in all available sizes. One is Kenda’s tubeless race version—it's the lightest option, but comes with the penalty of more delicate sidewalls that may wear out faster, or puncture more easily than the heftier version.

The Alta HR is great for those looking for something to track all-day fitness in addition to rides, since it tracks steps, sleep, workouts and more, and does so while looking utterly unobtrusive."

8577,Get off your butt with this sweet standing desk—$100 off on Amazon today! 
8578,"Does standing at your desk instead of sitting help you shred a massive amount of calories everyday? No. But, sitting all day can speed up the aging process, ruin your posture, and maybe even increase your risk for heart disease."
8579,"So, get a standing desk. Not for the calorie burn—even though you will burn an extra 8 to 10 calories per hour—but for your overall health."
8580,"Right now on Amazon you can score a height-adjustable, multi-tiered standing desk for $150 with the code GCXI87LL. That’s $100 off its usual price."
8581,Here are some stretches you can try at your desk:
8582,"It uses gas spring technology to make raising and lowering the desk super easy. At 35.6 inches wide, it can hold your monitors plus a cup of coffee. And, it comes fully assembled, so you can’t use the “I don’t know how to put it together” excuse."
8583,"I’ve been using a standing desk from Ergotron with a similar design for a month or so now. Walking around the Men’s Health office, you see these things everywhere."
8584,"While I don’t stand at my desk all day, I’ll raise my monitor if I’m feeling unproductive or tired and I get an instant boost of energy. So, I’m not surprised when I read studies that say standing at work increases productivity. Plus, the ergonomic design has seriously reduced the back pain I get when I sit slouched over a computer for hours."
8585,"So whether you’ve got back pain, want to perform better at work, or want to prevent negative health effects from sitting all day, this standing desk deal is for you."

"
8589,"Giro’s newest helmet offering, the Giro Synthe made its debut in the opening stages of this year’s Tour de France, atop the heads of riders such as RohanDennis and Joaquim Rodriguez.  Now Giro is sharing more details about the Giro Synthe MIPS helmet, which it will soon make available to all cyclists—not just the brand’s sponsored teams."
8590,     Related: How to Shop for a Bike Helmet
8591,"The Giro Synthe MIPS is a version of the existing Synthe updated with MIPS protection. MIPS stands for Multi-Directional Impact Protection System, and testing shows that compared to standard helmets, it better reduces some forces in an impact. That, MIPS claims, can lower the risk of concussions. There are three main components to a MIPS-equipped helmet: an interior foam liner, a low-friction liner, and an elastomeric attachment system between the two. In angled impacts, the elastomer stretches to allow the interior foam liner to rotate independently around the rider’s head and redirect energy. Although the system only moves a few millimeters, it can reduce the amount of rotational force that may be transferred to the brain in certain impacts."
8592,     Related: 11 Helmets that Show How Far Technology Has Come
8593,"Identical in shape to the non-MIPS model, the new Synthe keeps the aerodynamics, cooling ability, easy-stow sunglass ports, and fit of the original. The MIPS version is a claimed 260g for size medium; only 10 grams heavier than the non-MIPs offering. It also uses Giro's Roc-Loc Air retention system, one of the most comfortable options we've tried."

8596,Editor's Note: This article first published in the print edition of Bicycling. Subscribe today!
8597,"As a gadgetry minimalist, I was initially skeptical of the Wahoo Elemnt. Wahoo touts the Elemnt as the most connected bike computer on the market. It has on-board GPS, and ANT+, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi connectivity let it talk to most heart rate, cadence, and power sensors. It wirelessly syncs with programs such as Strava and TrainingPeaks, and setup takes place almost entirely on your iPhone or Android. But I was wary of how difficult it might be to set it up and get it going."
8598,     RELATED: 8 Awesome Cycling Computers That Aren’t Garmins
8599,"True, initial configuration took a couple of extra steps, including downloading the free Wahoo Fitness app and inputting various credentials. But then all that connectivity started to pay off. Setting up my displays using my phone was faster than scrolling through menus on a tiny screen. Once set up, the Elemnt was very intuitive—for example, I could simply zoom in and out to increase or hide data fields."
8600,
8601,
8602,"Like other computers, the Elemnt has turn-by-turn navigation, but I found it far easier to activate than Garmin’s, which can require a long list of steps, depending on the model. On the Elemnt, it took less than five minutes to figure out how to download a GPS file, copy it to Ride With GPS, and wirelessly sync it to my Elemnt. The oversize screen displays a detailed bread-crumb map as well as text directions. And in some remote areas, I’ve had fewer hiccups (such as confusion at intersections) than friends running the same course on their Garmin. Navigation freed me to explore several new routes among the spiderweb of meandering country roads surrounding my home."
8603,"Other fun or convenient features: I can preview incoming messages and calls, and when I’m on a Strava segment, I can race my PR, the KOM/QOM, or a designated Strava frenemy. The firmware auto-updates each time I sync to my phone. And my phone reminds me when I need to recharge my Elemnt."

8605,"Speaking of battery life, it’s respectable (best case is 17 hours, says Wahoo). With navigation, power and heart rate monitoring on, mine has gone for more than 10 hours with juice to spare."
8606,"Ultimately, the Elemnt performs similar functions to its competitors. But it’s so easy to use, you don’t have to be a tech geek to take advantage of them. And once you do, it becomes more than a head unit that records your data—it makes your riding more fun."

8699,1) Clement X’Plor MSO Tire
8700,"Picking gravel tires is about more than choosing a tread. Durability, size, and rolling resistance matter, and because most jaunts include some pavement, overall efficiency is key.Over the last year the 36mm-wide Clement X’Plor MSO has become my go-to for long days that include everything from singletrack to unimproved rail beds to dirt and gravel roads."
8701,"A tight, modified chevron shape lines the middle of the tread for fast rolling in a straight line. The tread morphs outward through a mixture of smaller, siped (split) dots and coffin-shaped blocks for traction on loose surfaces, ending with larger, Y-shaped blocks for serious cornering grip. The tires roll fast and grab well at the low pressures (22–40 psi) that provide the traction you want off-road. When riding through mud, the closely spaced blocks resisted packing up. And the siping helped the tires stick to wet pavement and in icy conditions. A protective belt beneath the tread layer resisted punctures from debris during city rides too. The MSO is available in 700x32, 36, and 40 versions.—Mike Yozell"

8704,"When used with sealant, tubeless tires offer a great ride and better ability to resist flats by sealing up small punctures quickly. Effetto Mariposa’s Caffelatex is one of our favorite sealants because of its foaming action, which helps it to work faster. But rougher surfaces can punch holes in tires that are larger than the quarter-inch limit of most sealants. That’s where the new Zot! Nano catalyzing polymer comes in. Designed to work specifically with Caffelatex, Zot! Nano mixes with the sealant to quickly harden the fluid and close larger cuts—we used it to seal holes up to a half-inch in length. The 10-milliliter bottle sits on your frame in a supplied holder under a bottle cage. When needed, you insert the tip of the bottle at the puncture and squeeze. The seals held up off-road and under the higher pressures associated with road riding.—Mike Yozell"

8710,1) Shimano XT PD-M8000 Pedal
8711,"Road pedals and shoes work fine for riding well-groomed dirt roads, but on adventurous gravel rides, you’re better off with mountain bike pedals and shoes. Off-road pedals resist clogging with mud and debris and are easier to get in and out of in tricky sections. Walking, and even dabbing, is far easier with treaded soles too."
8712,"My favorite pedal for gravel riding is the Shimano XT PD-M8000. Being the cross-country pedal in the XT line, it lacks the outer cage platform of the XT trail pedal, which is less necessary on gravel roads where you have more time to clip in before a rock or tree tries to kill you. But the PD-M8000 maintains a large interface with the shoe’s outsole, providing excellent stability and power transfer that feels close to a road setup. It also plays nice with a variety of shoe treads, and has class-leading feel—and ease—of entry and exit. Although not the best choice for extreme mud, the PD-M8000 clears itself far better than it looks like it would. And with durability and performance that’s nearly indistinguishable from the pricier XTR version, there’s no need to upgrade unless you’re a weight weenie (the XTR version is 13 grams lighter).—Ron Koch"

8714,2) Yokozuna Motoko Road Disc Brake
8715,"Yokozuna’s Motoko disc brake offers an affordable upgrade over the mechanical disc brakes found on most lower-priced ’cross and gravel bikes. These are the best cable-actuated disc brakes I’ve used, with power, modulation, and feel that’s on par with good full-hydraulic systems. In dry, muddy, and snowy conditions, the Motokos were quiet, with a smooth pull and firm engagement. The caliper is lightweight, compact, and attractive."
8716,"Most mechanical disc brakes use a cable-actuated system to push one moving pad against the rotor, which presses the rotor into a fixed pad. This can be noisy and cause a mushy feel. On the Motoko, the brake cable pulls a pump arm, and both pads are hydraulically pushed out of the caliper onto the rotor. It’s a similar system to TRP’s well-regarded HY/RD hybrid disc caliper, but the Motoko doesn’t self-adjust for wear. It just takes a knob twist, but it’s still down to the rider."
8717,"The Motoko also has no system for dealing with heat-induced fluid expansion like the HY/RD does. Representatives at Yokozuna USA told us that while they didn’t have data on it, the brake may not resist heat-induced fade on superlong descents as well as some other designs. However, they maintain that it is “ample” for ’cross and trails. I tested it exclusively for ’cross and gravel riding, which doesn’t generate as much heat as road descending, and it performed flawlessly. But at this point I can’t recommend it for pure road use."
8718,"The biggest advantage of a cable-actuated caliper is value: You can use your existing cable-actuated shift/brake levers, rather than switching to a full hydraulic system. Included in the Motoko’s price ($125) is compressionless brake housing, a brake cable and rotor, and an adaptor. The HY/RD caliper is also $125, but does not include those extras.—Matt Phillips"

8722,"Specialized estimates that you make as many as 10,000 or more pedal strokes during the average trail ride—which means that a heavier shoe could contribute to earlier fatigue. The company set out to lighten and improve its 2FO shoe, and recently introduced the new Cliplite version. It's 50 grams lighter per shoe (size 42) than the standard 2FO (the Cliplite weighs in at 389 grams) and comfort, fit, and efficiency are improved as well. The Cliplite is a little slimmer and snugger in the toe area than the original for a more performance-oriented fit. The upper features lightweight thermo-bonded construction that resists water absorption and a pair of cartridge replaceable S2 Boa dial closures. A reinforced toe area wards off rock strikes while a ceramic impregnated coating resists abrasion.The 2FO is designed to clip in and out as fast as possible, so the sole has a rounded inner edge to prevent catching on the pedal. A deep cleat pocket that Specialized calls the Landing Strip helps guide the pedal over the cleat for fast engagement. Slipnot rubber maintains grip on pedals when you're walking or riding while not clipped in. That rubber was reduced in the midsole sides to reduce weight. A ¾ lollipop-shaped nylon shank offers stiffness for pedaling but allows a bit of toe and heel flex for walking."

8724,"I tested the 2FO Cliplite shoes in the town of Graeagle, California—a mecca for pristine trail riding. I was impressed from the moment I put them on. With the addition of a blue Specialized Body Geometry foot bed, I had what felt like a perfect fit. The sole feels efficient while pedaling, with a bit more stiffness than most shoes in this class. Its upper steals the show with a snug yet comfortable fit that really transfers power. My foot felt as locked in as it would in a racing shoe, but even with the Boa fasteners cranked down, I never felt painful pressure points. My toes had the perfect amount of wiggle room and the heel cup lever let the back of my foot lift."
8725,
8726,
8727,"After riding in the Cliplites for the three weeks following the launch, I can say that these just might become my new favorites—they’re that good. Clipping in is super easy, and walking is tops too, with the perfect amount of flex and sole grip. I was a bit put off by the looks at first, but they’re starting to grow on me. Durability is still to be determined, but so far things look pretty good on that front. My only concern is with the top of the toe area where one shoe already has a pretty good gouge and scuff from a rock that got thrown off the front tire. That said, I barely felt the impact from the baseball sized stone—little piggy protection is very good.The men’s 2FO Cliplite model will be offered in four colors. The women’s shoe has the same construction as the men’s, but is offered in a different size range and two different colors. Expect these in shops by July 15 with a retail price of $180."
8728,"Following a temporary ban of disc brakes by cycling's governing body, we dig into the real and perceived safety concerns swirling around the new tech"
8729,"A few weeks ago, professional road cycling’s tentative foray into the world of disc brakes came to an abrupt stop after Francisco Ventoso, a racer for Movistar, claimed to have suffered a gruesome, deep cut to his leg at Paris-Roubaix due to contact with a disc rotor in a crash. The UCI reacted swiftly, immediately calling a halt to the use of disc brakes in professional racing."
8730,"If that’s where the story stopped, it might have been a footnote for cycling in general; pro racers have long operated under strict equipment rules that don’t apply to non-competitive riders. But the French Cycling Federation promptly banned disc brakes from not only domestic racing, but also sportives: non-competitive events it organizes, like the highly popular l’Etape du Tour. Just a few days ago, the Spanish federation followed suit. Other organizations are reevaluating their own rules. What started as a minor equipment rule change that affected fewer than a couple thousand pro racers morphed, in a matter of days, into a major fracas affecting thousands of amateur racers, as well as countless more everyday riders investing in new technology. And all of it rested on one simple question, which the bike industry has not definitively answered: Are disc brakes even safe? "
8731,     RELATED: Never Make These 5 Road Disc-Brake Mistakes
8732,"The Risks of Discs
	Ventoso’s injury might be the first example of a scenario that pro racers had publicly worried about in the disc-brake trial period: that the rotors could cut riders in a crash, or burn them. If that’s a risk, though, it’s a slight one. Of the sources we spoke with—racers, component company representatives, event organizers, and beyond—none except multiple-time national cyclocross champion Jeremy Powers can recall an injury that was due to disc brakes, and even Powers isn’t clear on the details. "
8733,"“One year at the World Cyclocross Championships, Ryan Trebon apparently hit the back of a disc rotor with his leg and it opened him up,” says Powers. But there’s a caveat: “Ryan says it was a chainring. But I was behind him and from my perspective, it was a disc.” "
8734,A chainring is dangerous; a foot in the spokes is dangerous; traveling by a tree at 50mph is dangerous
8735,"A second Paris-Roubaix injury originally thought to implicate discs, involving Etixx—Quick-Step rider Nikolas Maes, was actually caused by other factors; photos of the crash show Maes hitting the ground, and that there were no riders on disc-equipped road bikes involved."
8736,"Chuck Hodge, technical director for USA Cycling, says the federation keeps fairly detailed incident reports about injuries in its events. He says USAC was in the process of reviewing data from the past few years to determine if any injuries were related to disc brakes and would engage its new Safety Commission and Technical Commission to study the issue. He hesitated to offer an assessment before that process is complete, but says that he could not immediately think of a serious injury that resulted from contact with disc brakes."
8737,"On an even broader scale, discs have been widely used in mountain biking for decades, and more recently in cyclocross, without similar reports of injury. They’re different disciplines than road, to be sure, but ‘cross and mountain-bike XC racing feature chaotic, high-speed starts with sometimes more than 100 riders racing at speed in close quarters, and crashes are not uncommon. If disc injuries occur, they don’t make news."
8738,"The same is true of disc brake-related injuries in the general population; if they’re happening, they’re happening under the radar."
8739,"That’s not to say rim brakes don’t have their own safety issues: greatly reduced stopping power in wet conditions, for example; or the risk of overheating a rim, particularly carbon-fiber ones, and bursting a tube or blowing the tire sidewall off the bead hook. And some riders consider the disc-brake issue in the context of cycling safety overall. Injuries from other bike parts are documented in road racing. Riders have maimed fingers in spokes; earlier this year, Cannondale pro André Cardoso tweeted a photo of a nasty injury on his inner thigh with six parallel gashes, caused by a chainring. Neither scenario is common, but they aren’t unknown. "
8740,"“On rides, I get this question a lot now about discs,” says Ted King, an ex-teammate of Cardoso’s who raced seven years at the top level of the sport before retiring last June, and is now on USA Cycling’s Safety Commission. “A chainring is dangerous; a foot in the spokes is dangerous; traveling by a tree at 50mph is dangerous.”"
8741,"Concerns Outside Pro Cycling
	In the wake of the UCI ban, Hodge says he’s been fielding questions from racers concerned that their new disc-equipped bikes may suddenly become illegal for race use. Hodge cautions that USAC is studying the issue and has yet to reach a conclusion regarding amateur racing. (Pro/elite races run under UCI rules will not allow discs.)"
8742,"For amateur race categories, any rule change has to be approved at the board of directors’ level. “The data mining will take some time,” Hodge says, and the results will help determine the speed of action. On the other hand, Hodge points out that USAC views equipment rules from a much different place than the pro-centric UCI . In terms of a disc-brake ban, he says, USAC will need compelling evidence of a safety issue. Without it, “does that serve our members if you have a junior racer, whose mom just bought her a bike and all of a sudden it’s illegal?”"
8743,"Even non-competitive riders may pause over the uncertainty. As of now, anyone signed up for l’Etape du Tour, the Tour de France’s one-day fondo, needs to have a rim-brake bike. And entrants to other organized non-competitive events are wondering if equipment rule changes cascading down from the UCI might affect them."
8744,I look at a rim-brake bike now and it looks like antiquated technology
8745,"Organizers of such events may be waiting, in part, for direction from federations like USA Cycling, whether or not they work together. Uli Fluhme, founder of the Gran Fondo New York event series, which does work with USAC, says for this year, discs will be allowed in the GFNY New York event on May 15. (GFNY operates nine fondos, but only one, June’s GFNY Ventoux in France, is in a country affected by the ban.) He’s been asked questions similar to those Hodge gets, and notes that discs have been used without incident at GFNY events for two years. “But if USA Cycling decides they’re not allowed in amateur racing, we will ban them” for 2017, he says."
8746,"The bike industry is certainly concerned that further bans could be problematic and come at a delicate time, just as road discs are poised to win broad acceptance. A recent poll of bike-shop owners by Bicycle Retailer and Industry News found that 36 percent of respondents thought the UCI ban would hurt sales of disc-equipped bikes. Also unscientific, but interesting: I posted a Twitter poll asking my followers if the Ventoso crash made them reassess whether discs were safe for their own riding; 67 percent said no, 20 percent said yes, and 13 percent said not yet, but they might in the future. "
8747,     RELATED: Buyer's Guide 2016: The Best Disc-Equipped Road Bikes
8748,"Possible Solutions to Disc-Brake Safety Concerns
	If we accept the possibility that disc rotors can pose a safety risk, there are a couple of technical fixes that might help. One: adding a radiused curve to the edges of the rotors, which some manufacturers, like TRP, already do. It’s of debatable usefulness; rotors are only about 1.8mm wide, similar to a conventional spoke, so any bullnose profile will be minor. But even a slight rounding might aid in helping the rotor to slide rather than catch on and slice the skin as a more abruptly cornered edge might."
8749,"Another possible fix suggested by observers is a cover of some kind, like those used in motocross. A cover would add weight, but perhaps not much. Another concern with a cover is heat management, since the brake calipers and rotors are air-cooled to prevent overheating and boiling the hydraulic fluid. Paul Kantor, category manager for disc brakes at SRAM, was unequivocal when asked if a cover was an option: “I believe we could come to a reasonable solution that didn’t negatively impact the gains, like power and heat management, that we spent so much time and money achieving,” he says, adding that SRAM would pursue all possible safety improvements, and that any modification required for UCI racing would be available for sale to the public."
8750,"The Bottom Line
	To the extent that road discs may pose an injury risk, sources say uniformly that the issue is almost certainly limited to road racers, and within that subset, to elite road racers and perhaps even WorldTour events. “There are more people in a closer proximity in a WorldTour event than, say, a fondo,” says King. WorldTour riders have better handling skills, he notes, but adds that racing at that level is qualitatively different. Rider concerns there should be listened to, but might not be that relevant for riders in other events."
8751,"Fluhme, who volunteers that he’s no fan of discs, says that amateur racing simply isn’t as aggressive as pro-level racing. Fields are smaller, riders are spaced out more, and they ride more slowly. European pro racing, with its 200-rider fields on narrow roads, is simply a different animal and may require special measures."
8752,"One factor that may be playing an outsize role: tradition. Opinions on disc brakes very much come down to “your approach and perspective on the sport,” says King. “If you’re a traditionalist, whether you’re an organization like the French Federation or a person, you don’t want them.” "
8753,"But tradition is a poor substitute for technological advancement, he thinks. “I raced my entire career on rim brakes,” King says. “Since I retired, the only thing I’ve used is discs. I look at a rim-brake bike now and it looks like antiquated technology.” He regularly tells riders that, unless they’re racing, the right bike for them probably looks more like the Cannondale Synapse he rides these days: disc-equipped, with more upright geometry, and 28mm or wider tires."
8754, I have a desk job -- this just happens to be my desk. I love my job.
8755,"A post shared by  Ted King (@iamtedking) on Mar 3, 2016 at 9:22am PST"
8756,Powers feels similarly. 
8757,"“If I bought my mom a bike tomorrow, it’d have disc brakes,” Powers says. “Not that rim brakes are insufficient, but discs just stop better than any other system out there. The ride quality and enjoyment are enhanced by better, more consistent braking.”"
8758,"Powers suspects that the reaction to the Ventoso incident is overblown. “We’re a passionate bunch,” he says of cyclists. “This plays out on social media and group rides and, it’s like, some people like their coffee black, and some like it with cream and sugar. I think in a year, we’ll look back at this and it’ll be blown over.”"
8759,"It may be sooner than that. The UCI Equipment Commission convened a special meeting last Thursday, in part to examine the Roubaix crash. James Huang, reporting in CyclingTips, cited leaked notes from the meeting indicating that the UCI may restart the disc-brake trial as soon as June.” Ventoso, for his part, wrote in an open letter that he did not see what caused the deep laceration in his lower left leg. Although he was caught in a crash, he did not go down, instead running into another rider. He does not recall the injury, only seeing it moments later when he was racing again. We may never know exactly what happened, and in the absence of definitive proof of what caused the injury, we have to take Ventoso at his word. And it’s hard to argue with the idea that if there’s something that can make the sport safer—such as a cover—that it should be employed, at least for elite-level racing."
8760,"But for almost all riders, discs for the road are no more dangerous than in mountain biking, where they’re accepted, trusted, and even essential technology for anyone who’s bought a bike in the past decade or more. The risk, if there is one, is over-reaction to a single incident."

8770,"There is a guy, Ralph, on my ride. You can't draft him unless there's a breeze refreshing the gap between his jersey and your nose. When I told Ralph I was writing about smelly packs, he said, ""I know what you mean. If I ride behind Mitch, I can't believe it. The ride's just started and he reeks."" Then it occurred to me: If everyone thinks the other guy stinks, chances are good that I do too, or at least some of my cycling clothing does."
8771, 
8772,"The nasty truth is that this invisible affront to cycling etiquette is nearly universal—at least some of your riding gear has a stench that just doesn't go away, even after washing. ""We call it 'permafunk,'"" says Sandy Nicholls, marketing director for Giordana clothing and other brands. Here's what you can do to defeat permafunk—and what to wear so it doesn't happen in the first place."
8773, 
8774,"MECHANICS OF STINK Technical clothing, especially when it's synthetically based, has very tightly woven fibers. The tight weave makes the garment relatively rugged and lightweight, and can contribute to the fabric's stretchiness as well as durability. But a tight weave has a potentially ugly downside: a million tiny spaces that promote bacterial growth. The good news is that it's not you who smells, it's your stuff. The better news is that killing the bacteria, or at least inhibiting its growth, even on synthetics, isn't that difficult."
8775, 
8776,"STOP THE STENCH Some of the solutions are obvious. ""Don't leave your just-worn clothing in a gym bag overnight and don't wear it for several rides in a row without washing it,"" says Castelli's brand manager, Steve Smith. Instead, do wash it right after riding, ""and hang it on a line to dry, because these fabrics do better air drying than being broken down by the heat of a dryer,"" Smith says."
8777, 
8778,"It may smell fine dry, but if the stench returns 15 minutes into a ride, you didn't defunk it enough. To take it to the next level, try using hydrogen peroxide along with your regular laundry detergent, or use a color-safe anti-stink detergent such as No Sweat ($37/2 liters, or 64 washes; nosweatlaundry.com), which contains hydrogen peroxide in a low concentration. As for other so-called eco ways to stifle bacteria, we found no evidence that adding citronella, peppermint, tea tree or other oils to the wash does anything but temporarily mask the smell. And whatever you do, avoid the use of fabric softeners, cautions Castelli's Smith: ""The chemicals in fabric softeners really damage the breathability of high-performance fabrics."""
8779,"A shockingly good full-suspension trail bike from an unexpected brand
"
8780,"I first learned about Spot’s Living Link suspension from my colleague Matt Phillips’ first look at the brand's Rollik and Yobbo mountain bikes, but I still questioned its function as I pulled the 27.5-inch wheel, 140mm-travel Rollik 557 trail bike out of the box. At first glance, the suspension design looked a lot like some sort of single pivot, even though I knew it’s not. Still, I was starting to form an opinion on how it would ride based on how it looked. The leaf-spring pivot may give this dual-link bike a unique look, but all it took was one ride to realize that it’s no gimmick—rather, it’s a stunningly good suspension surrounded by a really dialed chassis."
8781,"Since we already went over the bike’s details in the previous story, let's focus on its ride. I spent a couple of weeks with the bike. The size-large test bike weighed in at 27 pounds and used Spot’s one standard build, with upgraded Enve carbon wheels. Setup is as simple as setting sag at 25 to 30 percent, and you're off and riding. "
8782,     RELATED: The Best Trail Mountain Bikes of 2016
8783,"The first thing I noticed was how crisp the Rollik feels at the pedals. It’s quick to accelerate and resists suspension movement well enough that I could leave the shock in the open mode everywhere but on paved climbs. Like my favorite short dual-link suspension systems, this one remains active under pedaling and braking forces, allowing the rear tire to follow the contours of the trail and seek traction at all times. I never felt any feedback or tugging through the pedals when smacking into rock ledges while climbing. The combination of ultra-efficient pedaling suspension and climb-friendly geometry (more on this later) means this bike absolutely flies uphill."
8784,
8785,
8786,"Climbing is just half of what the Rollik is good at—it also rips on the downhills and flats. Like other greattrailbikes, the Rollik seems to almost sprout longer-travel suspension when you need it most, while staying crisp and light on smoother stuff. On the trails I ride regularly, there’s one rocky G-out creek crossing with a rather violent compression at the bottom; riding up the other side has proven to be a significant challenge. The Rollik made it almost easy, allowing me to clean it every time I tried. Spot says that the Living Link’s leaf spring adds a little resistance right in the middle of the suspension’s stroke; perhaps that’s what gives this bike so much pop and spunk. 'Wallow' is simply not in the Rollik’s vocabulary. "
8787,"Not once did I feel any kind of lateral flex or odd characteristics from the lower leaf-spring pivot. In fact, the whole frame feels rather stout and solid. Just to make sure it wasn’t my 165-pound weight responsible for that, I put the Rollik under a few other testers including a 200-plus-pound rider—he came away just as impressed as I am. "
8788,
8789,
8790,"As good as the suspension is, the Rollik’s geometry is just as impressive. A 67-degree head angle paired to a 13.4-inch-high bottom bracket and 17-inch-long chainstays is pretty much in line with the best 27.5-inch trail bikes on the market right now. Where things get interesting and perhaps a little unique is the Rollik’s ultra-steep 76-degree seat angle. Spot feels that this puts the rider in a more powerful, more comfortable position for tackling the sharp grades mountain bikers often face. I completely agree with Spot’s thinking and found the rider position on this bike to be exceptionally good for such climbs. Another twist comes in the form of 0.4-inch-longer chainstays, and an even steeper seat angle on the XL size for more balanced weight distribution. Although I rode a size large, this theory makes sense to me and I’m a huge fan of the concept."
8791,
8792,
8793,"It’s hard to believe that the small and almost imperceptible amount of movement in the Living Link’s leaf-spring system can add so much to suspension, but it really does. It’s probably no coincidence that Yeti’s Switch Infinity link system also moves very little yet offers huge gains from the handful of millimeters it travels. Not surprisingly, Yeti’s SB5c is the bike that the Rollik reminded me of most. They’re both incredibly capable trail bikes that climb as well as they descend. The fact that I’m comparing Spot’s first full-suspension mountain bike to one of the best trail bikes currently being sold, after just a handful of rides on it, is a rather impressive feat and should tell you just how good this bike is."
8794,"The Rollik is available as a frameset costing $2,999, or as a complete bike with SRAM X1/X01 drivetrain, Guide RSC brakes, and a Pike RCT3 fork for $6,499. Look for an upcoming long-term review on Spot’s Rollik or 165mm-travel Yobbo in the near future."

8802,Stoke your dream of riding across the country with this well-appointed touring bike
8803,"Back when I was leading bike tours across the US, I spent years putting together my idea of the perfect touring bike, from the steel cyclocross frame and apocalypse-proof wheelset, to top-shelf rack and fenders. Had the Kona Sutra been around back then, I could have saved some time. The Sutra is a dangerous bike—not because of any structural issues, but because it’ll make you want to ride out of your office on a Tuesday and keep riding until you’ve reached the opposite coast. (My boss hates when I do that.) With a chromoly butted frame and geometry that puts the rider in a more upright position, the bike was stable and comfortable from the first ride, and came loaded with all my favorite touring features, like full fenders with mudflaps and bar-end shifters that are easy to access when you’re rocking a handlebar bag."

8805,
8806,
8807,"I took the Sutra out on a few of my favorite roads and put panniers and a week of groceries on it to see how it handled standard touring conditions, like climbing twisty back roads with what feels like the weight of two toddlers on board. The Shimano Alivio 11-34t 9-speed cassette and 28/36/48t triple chainset—a must for touring the hilly eastern US fully loaded—helped me crank up a 7-percent gravel climb, and the slightly swept-out flare drop bars made it easy to get great leverage under load. Sturdy 700x40c tires helped the bike roll smoothly on and off-road and copious mounts on the fork (the bike comes equipped with a rear rack and fenders) opened up tons of options for front racks or bikepacking setups with extra cargo cages. The bike also comes with Hayes CX Expert hydraulic disc brakes for better stopping power in miserable weather. Touring purists will be stoked on the Brooks B17 leather saddle, but personally, I’ve never been able to break one in, so I switched it out for something a bit less classy and photogenic."
8808,"It bears mentioning that the sizing is a bit weird—at 5’8”, I typically ride a 52-54cm frame but felt perfectly happy and comfortable floating along on the 48.5cm Sutra.  At 29.4 pounds including the rack, the whole bike is a bit of a tank but in the best, most ultra-comfortable way—and no more so than any other purpose-built touring dream bike.

8815,"So it should come as no surprise that Specialized is tossing its hat in the ring. The company has offered the road-going Turbo-S urban model for a number of years, first in Europe, then in the States. And now, the company is going all in with its electric off-road line: There will be 10 models available, including a women’s version, fat bike, hardtail, full suspension 29er, and full-suspension 27.5-plus (6Fatty) model.

You can customize the amount of power available and receive feedback in the form of battery information, usage, GPS direction finding, and many other metrics. To do all this, Specialized developed a free app called Mission Control for both iPhone and Android. The battery is chipped for use with both Bluetooth and ANT+, so connecting with a smart phone or GPS is simple. You can customize the wattage of each of the three power modes, (Eco, Trail, and Turbo), or program in the duration of your ride in hours or miles or kilometers with “Smart Control,” to best manage battery life and give you the most useable wattage for a given ride. For the latter, the app monitors the battery in 10-second intervals and meters its life accordingly. There is a built-in power meter, and the battery constantly communicates with your Garmin or other GPS over ANT+ on a “fake” channel—one that’s currently unused, but can be set to pick up the battery. Once paired, you can monitor battery life or toggle between power modes from the Garmin. In the future, Garmin will be updating software to handle the new bikes and will include dedicated channels for e-bikes."

8818,"And for those concerned, Strava has gotten in the game too with a new category specifically for e-bikes—though how that will get policed is still a mystery. We reached out to Strava to get some more info on the new category but haven’t heard back yet."
8819,"A set of three buttons in the side of the battery case houses an on/off switch and +/- buttons to choose the power output (usable even if you are paired to a GPS or smartphone), all ringed with LED telltales for mode and battery charge. Claimed recharge time is about 4 hours. Since the battery snaps into the bottom of the downtube, Specialized added an extra precaution against accidental ejection: The battery bolts through the sides of the frame, much like a thru-axle clamps a wheel to a fork. The motor is rated at 250watts, with a max output of 580 watts."
8820,"I test rode the FSR Expert 6Fattie. Like all the Levo models, the frame is made from M5 alloy with the motor and battery hidden inside the frame. The frame and fork use 148mm rear and 110mm front Boost spacing, and the 3-inch-wide Purgatory tires reside on 38mm (internal width) Roval Traverse rims. The rear stays get beefed-up main pivots and double-row bearings compared to the standard, non-assist fat bike. Bridges between the stays, absent on their non-motorized counterparts, help handle the extra weight of the motor and battery. A 140mm RockShox Pike RC fork and custom-tuned Fox DPS shock with AutoSag handle suspension duties. Rear travel is 135mm"
8821,"The trails around Leogang, Austria, are some of the most fun I’ve ever ridden. They are high alpine, and have an interesting mix of fire roads and miles of difficult, root-strewn singletrack that wind in and out of forested glades. There is gondola service all over the area to access both the trail system and the bike park that serves as a stop on the World Cup circuit. And while we did take a few trips on the aerial tramways, having a bit of power at our disposal made us think twice before using lift service."

8823,"Prior to this trip, I'd been underwhelmed by the e-mountain bikes I tried. Most did a poor job of manging how power was delivered to the wheel, were heavy, and came with underwhelming parts, and felt unbalanced due to the battery placement (generally on top of the downtube where a water bottle normally resides). They do some things well: They'll get you further out on the trail than you might get on your own, and they can make tough, boring climbs whiz by. But overall, I’ll take a pass."
8824,"By designing the Turbo Levo as an e-bike from the beginning—rather than slapping a motor on an existing frame design—Specialized has addressed many of my issues with e-mountain bikes—it's the first one I've found genuinely fun to ride. To help with balance, Specialized designed its own motor and uses a battery that’s similar to the one found on its Turbo S urban bike. The motor on the Levo is much more compact than those found on other bikes in its class and resides inside a frame shaped specifically for this particular unit—something other builders are constrained by when using off-the-shelf third-party motors. And because of the motor’s diminutive size and the fact that it’s built into the frame without an added housing, Specialized could move weight slightly further forward of the bottom bracket and neatly tie it into the weight of the battery nestled in the underside of the downtube for one cohesive package. By design, it also allows shorter chainstays than most of the competition while putting all the weight where it will least affect the bike's feel."
8825,"Don’t get me wrong, the bike still weighs upwards of 40 pounds (a bit lighter than most of the other e-MTBs I’ve ridden) and I was aware of its heft during most of my ride. But, after I got used to the manners the bike exhibited—it was balanced and generally easy to get traction on technical trails, though part of that is undoubtedly due to the huge tires—I was still able to let it hang out on the many twisty roots and bogs we were riding through, float over drops and jumps, and whip the tail of the bike around at will, for the most part."
8826,"An added bonus: When I mistimed a stair-step set of 2- to 3-foot drops, the motor casing acted as a 5-inch-wide slide-plate of sorts and I slithered over the offending root that formed the top of the drop, rather than getting hung up and pitched sideways as I possibly would have without it. Anyone that has ridden a motorcycle off-road on technical trails will instantly know what I mean."
8827,"The key to piloting the Levo is a smooth constant pedaling style. Mashing on the pedals or stalling to ratchet the cranks around roots or stones causes the power band to fluctuate and leaves you momentarily fighting the bike. Smooth, even strokes are crucial. Regardless, the power won’t shut off, which helps you to clear more than you might think on a regular bike. It takes a bit of learning, but the curve was short and I had it mastered after about an hour on the bike. There are times you may need to clip out (or put a foot out when riding flat pedals) and a trick I found myself employing was to clip out as needed but keep the crank rotating with the other foot, which enabled the motor to help me along. In that regard, it was a bit like feathering a throttle, just with a foot."
8828,"Battery life was excellent. The first day’s rides were two and three hours long, and on day two we rode over four hours and I still had plenty of juice left. I spent the bulk of time in the Eco and Trail modes—which gave me plenty of extra power—only resorting to Turbo for an extended climb from one valley to the next to see how easy I could make the climbing. It turns out that it was almost too powerful—I would have been fine with using the Trail setting to conserve battery power."
8829,"Specialized set out to make an e-bike that handles as much like a non-motorized bike as possible. And despite the weight and added complexity of the systems, it has gotten closer than any other e-bike I’ve seen—so far. With this updated technology, e-MTBs could be great news for ski areas—riders could access parts of the mountain where lift service is unavailable or forgo lift service altogether. The bikes could also help partners or families of unequal abilities looking to ride together."
8830,"Currently the bikes are set to debut in the spring of 2016. They will be launched simultaneously in both Europe and the United States. As of this writing, Specialized has not yet set pricing."

Add a pop of streetwise style and you have a comfy commuter shoe that allows you to pedal anywhere and leave the spare shoes at home."
8855,"You either want to be clipped in or you don’t. There are pros and cons to each, so consider this."
8856,"Shoes with a two-bolt cleat in the sole can improve your pedaling efficiency. They allow you to pull up as well as push down on the pedal to maximize your riding motion. The act of clipping in and out by turning your foot rather than simply stepping off can take some getting used to, but once you are comfortable, riding will seem easier—and you might be a little faster. Off the bike, you’ll still have cleats underfoot, but the ones on the shoes included here are recessed, meaning they won’t get in the way of a comfortable walk."

Easy on, easy off makes for a better stop-and-go commute, especially in traffic where you’ll likely find yourself putting a foot to the ground often. "

For city touring, there was nothing to dislike about the bike: It offered a comfy upright riding position, forgiving thick tires, fenders, chainguard, and a stylish, urban look. What did leave something to be desired, though, was the cheap U-lock the bike came with—with my bare hands I was able to pull it apart. But three days and countless tourist attractions later, I returned the bike and its flimsy lock safe and sound."

8881,"Park in a highly visible place. 
	Avoid locking up in front of movie theaters, museums, schools, train stations, or any other place that requires a lengthy visit. I aim for a spot in front of a coffee shop or restaurant filled with customers sitting behind windows looking out on to the street."
8882,"Find a secure anchor.
	It should go without saying, but sometimes even the most obvious anchors turn out to be duds. One time I absentmindedly locked my bike to a topless parking meter. In my previous hometown I discovered that most city signposts could be lifted out of the ground."
8883,         RELATED: How To Get Your Stolen Bike Back
8884,"Avoid crowded bike racks. 
	Jam-packed racks are not just stages for lots of tangling and scratching—to a thief they also provide good cover. It’s far riskier to steal a lone bike than it is pinching one from a bunch."
8885,"Rotate parking spots. 
	If you lock up in the same place all the time, change locations to prevent nefarious observes from catching on to your routine. Better yet, become a regular at a local business and ask the workers there to keep a casual eye on your bike whenever it’s locked out front."
8886,"Keep some distance from the curb. 
	Even wonder how those abandoned bikes on the sidewalk get all mangled? Protect your bike from street cleaners, buses, and careless drivers by storing it a few feet away from the curb. Position the bike on the sidewalk side of signposts with the wheels parallel to the gutter."
8887,         RELATED: How the Dutch Police Bait Their Bike Thieves
8888,"Be clever about attaching the lock. 
	My go-to configuration is to hook a U-lock around the rear wheel only, right where it passes through the frame’s rear triangle. In this configuration, both the frame and wheel can’t go anywhere. Conveniently, the lock keeps the wheel from rolling, which prevents the bike from sliding down the pole and tipping over. Plus, if the anchor is tall enough, the edge of your saddle leans against the pole instead of your frame. You can further increase stability by orienting the bike downhill so that the front wheel doesn’t flop sideways."
8889,"Consider the message your parking job sends. 
	I carry only one lock, a mid-weight U-lock. I don’t bother with a second cable or something to secure the wheels; I believe using multiple locks only signals that you won’t return for a while. Instead, I use aftermarket skewers that require a special wrench to remove."

8892,"That fine layer of padding in your cycling shorts, which protects your nether region from saddle pain, is way more intriguing than you'd think"
8893,One of the first pieces of advice given to new riders is to buy a pair of cycling shorts padded with a chamois. This isn't some widely protected hazing plan by seasoned cyclists to get beginners wearing the athletic equivalent of a diaper—chamois padding will often be the piece of gear that makes or breaks your ride.
8894,"That's because your bottom serves as the biggest contact point with your bike. Have a good chamois, and you can ride comfortably for hours pain- and chafe-free; go without, and you're looking at a memorable case of saddle sores."
8895,"But the padding within your chamois is filled with as much mystery as closed-cell foam. Here are six things you might not know about your chamois, which will help you get the most out of your cycling shorts (and prevent some embarrassing kit mishaps)."
8896,     RELATED: Why I Rode Across the Country Without a Chamois
8897,"An old chamois had more in common with a baseball glove than today’s materials.
	Chamois padding was introduced nearly a century ago as a solution to chafing for endurance cyclists. Longtime riders will remember these first chamois pads were made of leather, not the hi-tech synthetic kit materials of today."
8898,"“At that time, racers were wearing wool shorts that would bunch up and cause friction,” says Mike Herlinger, founder of Club Ride Apparel. “Having a suede-type material inside the shorts added just enough glide to offer racers some relief from chafing, but little-to-no effect on road vibrations.”"
8899,"The first synthetic chamois was developed by Maurizio Castelli around 1980, says Steven Smith, brand manager for Castelli. Nearly every clothing manufacturer today uses synthetic materials—a mixture of open- and closed-cell foam and gel insets—that reduce both chafing and road noise."
8900,"Squishier doesn’t mean better.
	Walk into any bike shop and you’ll see riders poking and prodding the chamois pads in various cycling shorts, looking for the softest, squishiest padding they can find. That’s a mistake. "
8901,"“Pad density is the key,” Herlinger says. “Between eight and thirteen millimeters is an ideal thickness. Over time, pillowy padding is going to compress; it might not make it two months before it compresses down to almost nothing and is nearly unusable.” That's because the more the padding compresses, the more pressure it places upon the exact area you're trying to keep pressure-free."
8902,"While you're at it, Herlinger suggests buying a breathable, anti-microbial chamois that will eliminate moisture and friction, the two biggest chafing culprits. You should also pay attention to the seams attaching the chamois to the shorts. Look for flatlock stitching that lays flat."
8903,"“You don’t want a raw edge (of the stitching) down below,” Herlinger says, unless you'd like to rip up some skin. "
8904,     RELATED: Read This Before You Buy Bibshorts
8905,"You can borrow women's cycling shorts if you're a man, and vice versa.
	With advances in molding techniques, companies are able to mold chamois to more anatomically correct shapes. Both a male and female chamois typically will resemble an elephant’s head, with the female chamois having wider ears to accommodate women’s larger hipbones, and a shorter, rounder nose. Many cycling shorts use multiple densities and thicknesses of chaomis padding specifically chosen for the unique demands of different anatomical locations, says Simon Fisher, Giro's apparel product manager."
8906,"“The contours between a saddle and the human body are incredibly complex and it’s impossible for a completely flat chamois to properly follow those curves,” Smith says. Noticeably, many chamois place higher-density foam underneath your sit bones, and thinner foam situated against more sensitive areas."
8907,"While there are significant differences between chamois, Smith says, men can still wear women’s shorts and vice versa, if need be. It definitely beats the commando-riding alternative."
8908,"You can tailor chamois padding to your riding style.
	Club Ride offers chamois of different thickness and contours based on the number of hours you expect to ride, while POC makes different chamois based on the type of riding you do."
8909,"“POC has six different chamois, and each is built to optimize comfort for different types of riders and riding,” says POC representative Patrick King. “POC’s Chrono chamois, built for TT racing, uses longer inserts of silicone padding to support an aero position, while the Fondo chamois has more silicone padding on towards the back of the chamois to support a more comfortable, upright riding position for longer, mellower rides.” "
8910,"How much does the shape and contour of the chamois matter? A great deal, which Herlinger found out the hard way when he put his shorts on backwards by accident."
8911,"“It was early in the morning, and I was getting changed in the back of a dark van,” Herlinger says. “We’d just started our five-hour ride, and I knew right away that something was wrong. I finally figured out what I’d done and corrected matters, but it was a bit too late. There was a lot of rubbing happening in all the wrong places.”"
8912,"Wash those shorts!
	No one likes to do laundry, but you should rarely, if ever, wear a pair of shorts twice without washing them first. (Learn how to wash your cycling kit.)"
8913,"“That’s a prime place for bacteria to grow, and with a bit of abrasion on the skin from riding, it’s an easy place to start an infection,” Smith says."
8914,"Although many shorts have some anti-microbial properties built into the chamois that might protect you when riding in the same shorts multiple days in a row, those properties eventually fade away after repeated washings."
8915,     RELATED: The Best New Cycling Shorts of 2016
8916,"Nothing lasts forever, not even your chamois.
	So what’s the typical lifespan of a chamois? It really depends on the rider—how much saddle time they’re putting in, their weight—and the type of short they’re wearing.  "
8917,"“The best indication it’s time to replace your chamois is discomfort. Over time, chamois padding will eventually become ‘packed down’ and become unable to perform its function,” says Fisher. “But eventually even the best chamois won't have that same supple comfort it once had. Basically, a good chamois should 'disappear' during your ride. If you're actively noticing your chamois, it's time for a new one.”"

8919,"These performance road shoes are durable, efficient, comfortable—and great on really long rides"
8920,"The Audax is a shoe that hits right to the heart of how I ride: I don’t race, so I don’t need the absolute stiffest sole; I find that they’re so unforgiving, I get hot spots. But I do want a durable and efficient performance road shoe that’s comfortable on really long rides."
8921,"The Audax, which Specialized created expressly for that kind of riding, is a good candidate. It’s also the rare shoe that requires almost zero break-in time. The synthetic leather upper was mostly comfortable on the first ride, with the lone issue the tall, un-notched heel cup. But after about five hours of ride time, it wore like a shoe I’d owned for a year."
8922,     RELATED: 9 Tips for Happy Feet
8923,"Like all Specialized shoes, the Audax is built on the Body Geometry platform, which for its shoes means a few things: 1.5 degrees of Varus angle (an upward tilt from the outside of the foot to the big toe) built into the shoe, three tuneable levels of arch support via different footbeds, and a metatarsal “button” or bump, between the ball of the big toe and the second toe."
8924,"The button spreads the forefoot to help prevent neuromas and “hot spots” that develop with crowded toes; the arch support and Varus canting are meant to correct over-pronation, an inward roll of the foot when weighted that, on a bike, can cause lateral motion in the knee while pedaling that can lead to knee pain or overuse injuries. Most people pronate to some degree, so BG works fine; if you’re in the minority whose natural gait is to supinate, these are not the shoe for you."
8925,"They’re also not the shoe for you if you have really narrow feet. The Audax fit my D-width, moderate volume foot comfortably, without crowding or pressure points from the closure system. Not wide enough? There’s also a special wide-last version."

8927,"Specialized has been on the Boa closure system bandwagon a while, using the steel lace-and-reel system on a number of shoes. The Audax gets a single Boa reel closure across the top of the midfoot, with Velcro closures to fine-tune fit elsewhere. Boa has its detractors, but I’ve been happy with how Specialized uses the system. It tightens evenly and securely and never cut into my foot."
8928,"At Bicycling’s recent Editors' Choice test camp in Healdsburg, California, I wore the Audax for up to six hours a day, during lots of riding and no small amount of off-bike time spent fettling and faffing with bike fit as we switched steeds. I never thought about these shoes, that’s how comfortable they were. Climbing the 20-percent grades of Mill Creek, I got zero hint of flex or warping around the pedals from the carbon/glass fiber composite sole. Trying to stay on tech editor Mike Yozell’s wheel as he motored home from Geyserville in the gathering dusk of the day’s last ride, I fidgeted in the saddle to find a comfortable position on the busted chipseal pavement, but never had to touch the shoe straps to loosen the shoe or relieve pressure."
8929,"The things I find wanting in the Audax aren’t really performance-oriented, although I’m curious to see how they do in hot weather. What I want are minor design tweaks: a slightly grippier fabric in the heel cup, for instance, and the replaceable heel tread is a little slippery on hard floors. There’s no fore-aft adjustment on the three-bolt cleat attachment, a nice feature we’ve seen on (a few) other shoes at this price. And, I’d like reflective elements on the heel that are large enough to make a difference; the thin stripes that are there seem like a token—too small to really stand out. But those are minor issues. I’ve long trusted Specialized shoes to fit my feet well and perform and last. The Audax are another in that long line of dependable performers."

8931,"Fresh bar tape can add comfort and control. Here's how to choose the right stuff.
"
8932,"Size It Up
Tape changes the effective diameter of your bike's handlebar and adds a degree of cushioning. Thicker tapes, like those made of natural cork or synthetic foam, create a fatter, more forgiving platform to rest on, although thinner ones (plastic, leather, and some rubber options) might better fit small hands. Thicker padding helps absorb some vibrations and chatter but can make you feel less connected to the road.Get Control
The tape's outermost layer affects your grip, so choose your material mindfully. Though foam and cork offer more purchase than plastic and leather, they can become slippery when wet. Versions with microfiber (see ""Three Key Features,"" right) can feel more secure in humid and rainy conditions. Sticky rubber tape works best in wet weather, but it can hinder your ability to slide easily to different handlebar positions.Stick To It
The price of bar tape typically ranges from $7 to $30. ""The difference between cheap and expensive is often the adhesive on the back,"" says Scott Junker, product manager for Easton Cycling. The least-expensive varieties have no adhesive and require a tight, expert wrap job to keep them intact. More expensive tape is often padded and has something sticky on the back to hold it in place.Our mechanic demonstrates how to wrap tape on bars"

8942,This multitalented road bike is both spirited and smooth
8943,"For a little over a decade as carbon fiber became the dominant frame material for performance bikes, the bike industry was consumed with a design mania focused on racing. Road bikes in particular prized light weight, stiffness, and aerodynamics—sometimes to the detriment of ride quality and often to versatility. A popular fork of the time—the Alpha Q—famously had such narrow clearance that only 23mm tires would fit. Those days were not entirely fruitless; the design gains around stiffness and light weight, in particular, continue today. But thankfully, the industry has moved past that narrow focus on racing and begun to produce bikes that are far more versatile and, well, fun to ride. This is one."
8944,"Who’s It For
	The Paralane is most intended for a road rider who wants a bike that can handle any number of types of riding, short of perhaps full-on racing. With a carbon fiber frame and quality wheels, it’s suited for long climbs, but the disc brakes, wide tires and more upright rider position give it the flexibility to venture off the paved routes."
8945,     RELATED:  6 Ways To Climb Hills Better Right Now
8946,"What We Liked
	The frame is the heart of any bike and Focus’s road bikes have long impressed us with their blend of stiffness and ride quality. The Paralane in particular has a smooth, comfortable ride. The rider position is more upright, like many endurance-focused bikes, but Focus gets there with a slightly different approach than many brands. Rather than just lengthen the head tube, Focus drops the bottom bracket slightly, which places the rider a bit lower relative to the frame. It’s the same effect, with the optical trick of a slightly racier-looking front end. Focus also put slick, hidden front and rear fender mounts on the frame and includes fenders with the bike."
8947,"The Paralane climbs very well, with a 34x32 low gear and plenty of lateral stiffness under hard pedaling. And while some of the excellent ride quality comes from the frame, the 28mm-wide tires offer far more effect in this department than if the bike had come with 23s or even 25s."
8948,"The extra BB drop has another, welcome effect: With the rider’s center of gravity slightly lower in the bike, the Paralane is an agile descender. The carbon frame provides excellent torsional stiffness that helps ensure the bike stays on a chosen line in hard cornering, and the wide tires offer sure grip, a smooth ride, and good control on even choppy pavement or dirt surfaces. We’re big fans of the Shimano Ultegra group, and the hydraulic disc brakes are, for almost any conditions, far superior to rim models."
8949,"Watch Out For
	There’s little not to like about the Paralane. Two things we’d note for long-term owners: The Paralane uses Focus’s own Rapid Axle Technology, which uses a thru axle skewer with a T-shaped “key” that fits into a proprietary dropout. All 142x12mm rear and 100x12 front thru axle wheels are compatible, but you’ll need extra RAT axles for any additional wheelsets or to replace a damaged or lost axle."
8950,"Similarly, the Concept-branded seatpost (a Focus house brand) is 25.4mm in diameter, an unusual size that could be difficult to replace if it’s ever damaged. Neither of these are dealbreakers and, in the case of RAT in particular, we’re fans of it because it’s a secure wheel attachment that’s a bit speedier than threaded thru axles. But for long-term owners, both issues bear mentioning."
8951,"The Takeaway
	The Paralane is an excellent representative of the bike industry’s emerging focus on versatile performance road bikes. It’s a fast, spirited bike that’s fun to ride on pavement in a group, or on dirt on a long solo adventure. And at $3,500, it’s an excellent value; you can spend more (much more) on a bike, but you don’t really need to."

8953,"Often overlooked as an afterthought, the handlebar grips you slip on your mountain bike bars can make the difference between a great ride and one that you can’t wait to end. There are essentially two different styles of mountain bike grip: slide-on and lock-on. As the name implies, slide-on grips slip over the ends of your bars. They often require some form of lubrication—hairspray is a popular trick—to push them into place. The inherent risk with slip-ons is that they may rotate or slip off."
8954,RELATED: This Simple Pre-Ride Inspection Will Keep You From Walking Home
8955,"Riders who frequent rugged terrain will often opt for lock-on grips instead. These stay-put grips generally feature an inner alloy or plastic liner beneath the rubberized material, and the entire system mounts to your bars via metal lock rings that you screw tight against the bars. Once on, they don’t budge. They’re also easy to remove and replace by simply loosening the screws."
8956,"Once you’ve got the right grips, learn how to set up your mountain bike’s suspension:"
8957,"It’s also important to consider the material and texture of the grips. Popular materials include rubber compounds (which can range from very soft to quite hard), Kevlar, and foam. Some grips are ridged or patterned for a “stickier” contact patch with your hands, so you can hold on tightly through technical terrain. You also want to be sure the grips fit your hand size."

"
8996,"Get Watertight If you'll be riding in rain, choose a waterproof jacket instead of a water-resistant one (which might protect you against a light sprinkle, but will let a deluge soak through). Turn the coat inside out and make sure all the seams and stitching are sealed with tape, because even waterproof garments can leak in areas punctured by a sewing needle."
8997," Air It Out 
	""It's critical that a jacket releases body moisture,"" says Bill Rudell, public relations manager at Sugoi. Otherwise your sweat won't evaporate and you'll get cold when you stop moving. Vents can help, as will fabrics like Gore-Tex that act as a one-way membrane, allowing heat and perspiration to escape without letting moisture in."
8998," Go Slim 
	A rain jacket should fit snugly without restricting movement. In colder temperatures pair it with a wool or synthetic base layer, which will help pull moisture away from your body so it can evaporate through the coat. A few millimeters of air between layers can help make this magic happen. If the jacket is too tight or too loose it won't allow proper airflow."

9008,This university research project aims to build a bike that would make cycling accessible to 73 million more Americans
9009,"Riding a bike is one of the most recommended forms of exercise for overweight Americans, yet not a single mainstream bike company in America makes a bike designed specifically to accommodate riders over about 300 pounds. "
9010,"This is the Catch-22 Dr. Rodger Kram found himself considering last year when contemplating a bold research project: making a bike for adult Americans between 18 and 65 who qualify as obese, which the National Institute of Health defines as having a body mass index of 30 or greater. That’s a market of about 35.7 percent of the American adult population, or approximately 73 million people."
9011,"“Cycling is an obvious exercise choice for obese people, except that bikes aren’t made for them,” says Kram, an associate professor of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado Boulder. “In fact, a lot of bikes are sold as, ‘Here’s the rider weight limit.’”"
9012,"Making a bike for big people isn’t as simple as outfitting a frame with sturdier wheels and tires, or swapping to a larger, more supportive seat, although that’s a good start. Kram, whose team comprises students from both the physiology department and CU’s engineering school, points out three current challenges that bikemakers are largely not dealing with: safety, comfort, and durability. The obesity bike project aims to address all three."
9013,     RELATED: The Best Bikes and Gear for Bigger Riders
9014,"What Overweight Riders Need
	Obese riders have particular challenges when cycling, which Kram’s research assistant Rob Foster knows first-hand. Foster, who is about 5’11”, weighed as much as 327 pounds a few years ago before using cycling, running, and attention to diet to reach his current 160 pounds; the weight loss would have gone more smoothly with the right bike.  "
9015,"“When I started riding I was already down to about 260, but I still had issues even at that weight,” says Foster. “It was uncomfortable and hard to ride, and the cheap bike I had didn’t last very long.” "
9016,"Kram’s team interviewed obese people who’ve used bikes for exercise to gather information about their experiences on the bike, and found that broken seatposts and wheels are common issues. “A taco’d wheel is obviously a problem, but a broken seatpost is extremely dangerous,” says Kram. Almost every place on a bike that carries a load—from crankarms to pedals to the chain—could wind up a hazard if it’s not built with very large riders in mind."
9017,"It’s not enough for a bike to simply be bombproof: It has to be comfortable to ride, too, if it’s going to see use, and an obese person’s body requires different considerations from a design team. For one, a saddle must be the right size and shape to properly support them. Rider position on the bike is key in alleviating stress on the spine that could cause issues with disc tissue. Even something as specific as handlebar height helps fine-tune a rider's wrist angle to prevent against fatigue. "
9018,"Given the concerns, why recommend that obese people ride at all? Why not just advise them to walk, another form of exercise commonly recommended to severely overweight people? About a decade ago, recalls Kram, then-doctoral student Ray Browning (also a former professional triathlete) looked into walking’s mechanical load on leg joints and found that even brisk walking put enormous strain on obese people’s joints, particularly their knees. Walking at a gentle pace on a slightly inclined treadmill was fine, Kram says, but it’s not nearly as inspiring as riding outside. Cycling, as a generally non-load bearing aerobic exercise, could be a better choice, if it were safer and more comfortable."
9019,     RELATED: How to Find Cycling Clothes That Fit When You're a Bigger Rider
9020,"The Paradox of Bike Design
	But to actually design a bike that meets comfort, safety, and durability needs is a challenge for many reasons: Comfortable bikes aren’t always sturdy enough, and vice versa. And it’s important to note that obese riders are qualitatively different from very tall riders of a similar weight in a very important respect—getting on and off."
9021,"The classic double-diamond frame is difficult for obese people to mount, but a standard step-through frame doesn’t always offer the torsional rigidity that these riders need. Past studies by Kram’s lab show that, partly because their musculature has to support such a large load, obese people generate tremendous amounts of power doing something as simple as standing up, so they also create lots of torque when pedaling."
9022,"Working with Mosaic Cycles, a custom framebuilder in Boulder (founder Aaron Barcheck is one of Kram’s former students), the team built a prototype and discovered that moving the traditional top tube to a spot midway down the seat tube—and connected horizontally to the middle of the down tube rather than up at the top of the head tube like a normal step-through design—produced good torsional rigidity while preserving a step-through’s easy-to-mount attributes."
9023,"Perhaps the most overlooked issue—and the one presenting the most problems for the team—is safety, namely for braking. A few of the bikes marketed toward 300-plus-pound riders use antiquated braking technology like a coaster brake. Even some modern systems may still need tweaking. Using a borrowed downhill bike with 200 mm rotors, Kram’s team tested the stopping distance from 15 mph with an increasing amount of weight on a trailer behind the bike. The results: At 450 pounds total rider weight, stopping distance was almost three times farther than for a 180-pound rider."
9024,"At one level that’s understandable; it’s three times the mass. But it’s troubling from a safety perspective because it means larger riders may not be able to stop in time to avoid obstacles. “Even hydraulic disc brakes aren’t giving us the amount of braking power we need,” says Kram."

9026,"The Industry’s Oversight
	Despite the obvious potential market of 73 million Americans, the bike industry hasn’t shown much interest in making a bike for severely overweight riders. "
9027,"That’s not to say there hasn’t been any; it’s just that these designs are at the fringes of the industry. Custom builders like Zinn are experienced at making bikes for big and tall riders, but they come with custom prices. A handful of small companies (Zize, Worksman and Day 6, to name a few) make bikes expressly intended for riders over 300 pounds, but not everything about them is necessarily appropriate; a couple of models from Worksman and Day 6, for instance, use coaster brakes, and some still use the double-diamond design overweight cyclists find difficult to mount.
	 
	Regardless, none of the “big four” brands—Trek, Specialized, Giant, and Cannondale—make bikes expressly intended for riders over 300 pounds. In fact, all four manufacturers use cautionary language in their owner's manuals that hint at rider weight limits, such as not guaranteeing the warranty for riders past a certain weight (typically 300 to 325 pounds, depending on the make and model). All the bikemakers we spoke with added that the weight limit, if it can be called that, is there primarily out of an abundance of caution and to limit legal liability. They characterized it as a recommendation, not a requirement, but it’s there nonetheless. "
9028,"As well, the independent bicycle channel has done little to market to this prospective buyer for a number of reasons. One: major bikemakers' product lines are often global, with only small tweaks for different markets, and obesity isn’t quite as much of a public health problem in other bike markets like Europe. (That’s not to say it’s not an issue; more than 20 percent of adult Europeans qualify as obese, according to the World Health Organization). Also, in the US especially, the bike industry is chiefly made up of lifelong enthusiasts who market and sell to other enthusiasts in turn. "
9029,"Eric Bjorling, a spokesman for Trek, recognizes that the bike industry hasn’t historically pursued non-traditional markets well. While Trek has worked with overweight and obese riders (both individually and via outlets like the reality TV show “The Biggest Loser”), and CEO John Burke has spoken bluntly about the challenge of obesity for employees and employers, Trek hasn’t made a concerted push to design for or market to the overweight—although its Shift line has some of the attributes Kram’s team is targeting."
9030,"“We as an industry need to take a hard look at what we’re doing to grow cycling,” Bjorling says. “I say that not looking at [overweight riders] as a category, but to make cycling accessible for as broad a range of people as possible. Companies are starting to look at how the market is aging, with things like e-bikes, but that shift hasn’t happened on the weight side.” He admits he “doesn’t have a great answer yet” for why that hasn’t happened. “I hope to soon though,” he says."
9031,"The engineering horsepower certainly exists at bike companies to create bikes for big riders, Bjorling says: University efforts like the CU research project might offer some valuable insight. Kram says the team’s intention is to put their research results in the public domain for any bikemaker to use. Partly for that reason, he’s crowdfunding the final phase of the project, with proceeds going to create a final prototype based on what his team learns. The team’s crowdfunding campaign ends May 16 and has a relatively modest $3,000 goal. (Because CU is a public university, donations are tax-deductible.)"
9032,"Strong Potential 
	Bikemakers aren’t entirely convinced that the market for overweight-specific bikes is there, despite the potential numbers involved. But Kram is. Early in the project, his research team led a focus group with about 60 hospital patients who were both morbidly obese, and yet motivated enough to change that they’d had bariatric surgery. "
9033,"“We asked how many of them rode a bike as a kid, and about 60 hands went up; practically everyone likes to ride bikes,” he says. “Then, we asked how many of them had ridden in the last year. Maybe two, three hands.” It hurt to ride, attendees said. Finally, Kram’s team asked, how many of you would ride to lose weight if it were safe and comfortable?"
9034,“About 60 hands went back up.”
9035,"The new generation of the Tarmac is unlike anything else on the road
"
9036,"The roads through Henry Coe State Park form a favorite testing loop for members of Specialized's product-development team, who work a few miles away in Morgan Hill, California. Gaining about 3,000 feet over 10 miles, the climb gives riders time to settle into a steady rhythm before short pitches as steep as 14 percent encourage them to stand and push hard into the pedals. From its highest point, the road descends back toward town following several sharp switchbacks and a few wide-open sweepers. Along the way, the surface transitions from ragged asphalt to smooth pavement. These variations make the loop ideal for exposing how well a bike climbs, descends, corners, and absorbs road shock."
9037,"In mid-April, weeks before the company introduced the 2015 Tarmac to the public, I follow two Specialized engineers through Henry Coe, trying to match their speed as we arc around the switchbacks. In the preceding 15 months, these engineers had spent countless miles on this loop, testing prototypes of a new Tarmac, the company's elite road-race model. By the time I've joined them, they have descended this road so frequently that they know how their bikes will respond to almost every crack and corner—but I'm a newcomer here, riding an unfamiliar bike. I feel uneasy as speeds spike above 40 mph, but the frame, even at this prototype stage, feels steady and calm. In some situations it behaves much like the existing Tarmac SL4 (a longtime favorite of our test staff), but I notice subtle differences I can't quite pinpoint."
9038,"After our ride through Henry Coe, we return to Specialized and regroup inside the Alberto Contador conference room—one of many that pay homage to racers, including Ned Overend, Mario Cipollini, and Sam Hill. Sitting below a wall-size photograph of perhaps the greatest stage racer in the past decade resplendent aboard an SL4, engineers Chris D'Aluisio, Sam Pickman, Chris Yu, and Ty Buckenberger tell me that the process of designing the new Tarmac was unlike anything they had previously undertaken. Typically when companies like Specialized update a model, engineers and designers focus mostly on reducing weight, increasing stiffness, adding compliance, and perhaps making it more aerodynamic. Specialized did some of that with the new Tarmac, but the latest version was already quite light and plenty rigid. They had something else in mind for the 2015 model."
9039,The updated seatstay bridge has clearance for 28mm tires.
9040,"Specialized introduced the Tarmac in 2003 as a rarefied road bike designed to help its sponsored teams win ProTour races. Company officials hoped this model would elevate the brand into the top echelon of road-bike makers, and it has: The Tarmac has been ridden by Tom Boonen, Contador, and others to victory in the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Tour of Flanders, and other races. Since its introduction, Specialized revised the bike five times, each successive version lighter and stiffer than the previous one. The most recent iteration, the SL4, had a nearly ideal blend of low weight, quickness, comfort, and sharp handling. In fact, Bicycling has named it our top race bike as part of our Editors' Choice awards three times."
9041,The disc-ready frames weigh only 80 grams more than rim-brake versions.
9042,"As good as the SL4 was, the engineers who work on the Tarmac suspected that they could further improve its handling, especially in the largest and smallest sizes. Each of the previous versions was designed around riders of average height—engineers plotted specific stiffness, handling, and compliance goals for the 56cm frame, then based changes to the larger and smaller frames on those numbers. The approach is not uncommon among bike manufacturers, but members of the design team came to the conclusion that this compromises performance at either end of the size spectrum. Smaller frames felt more rigid than was optimal while cornering; the larger sizes flexed more. The 2015 Tarmac fixes that discrepancy, says D'Aluisio. Every size across the line, in disc-brake and rim-brake options, will have the exact same ride character—that's 13 distinct frames without counting the S-Works versions, which use lighter carbon fiber."
9043,"The idea had crystallized within Specialized's design department about 15 months earlier, following several discussions between D'Aluisio and Pickman. Both are fast, skilled riders, but at 6-foot-4, Pickman has about 9 inches on his colleague. After comparing notes, the two engineers realized that their bikes reacted differently in similar situations, including some of those turns on the descent through Henry Coe. In fast, smooth corners, D'Aluisio's 52cm bike would tip in precisely then hold a steady line. Pick-man reported that his 58cm bike initiated with less precision and required more effort to maintain his line. The situations reversed in bumpy corners."
9044,"Around that time, Specialized began hearing similar reports from cyclists on the professional teams. Shorter riders like Contador wanted the bikes to chatter less as they cornered, while taller riders asked for more responsiveness. ""That was subjective feedback, so we had to put some numbers to it,"" says Pick-man. ""The old way of just testing a bike on the stiffness table was not enough."""
9045,"New, stouter dropouts improve drivetrain stiffness."
9046,"Designing size-specific frames sounds intuitive, but it's a complicated process. To even understand how the different-size frames behaved, Specialized had to devise new tests and new methods for evaluating performance. It took a year and a half of work, but the company emerged with hard data that showed exactly what was going on. Most significantly, the results demonstrated that while frame geometry was an important factor of bike handling, two other metrics played a larger role. The first was something D'Aluisio calls leaned-over stiffness: the ability of a bike to absorb shock from the road when it's tipped into a corner, which affects traction and the bike's ability to hold its line. The other was steering responsiveness, a measure of the frame's front-end stiffness."
9047,"The larger-size Tarmacs flexed more than the smaller models, which reduced steering responsiveness. ""It wasn't delivering the traction I needed quick enough for me to use it,"" Pickman says. The smaller frames had their own problem: They were relatively stiff, so they chattered more across dimples in the road, reducing traction and pushing the rider wider than necessary in corners. Larger bikes, Specialized learned, needed more responsive steering; smaller ones needed less leaned-over stiffness."
9048,"The company intends for the 2015 Tarmac to remedy those shortcomings. The bike is a first for Specialized, and perhaps in the bike industry—a single model with distinct frames for every size, each with its own tube dimensions and carbon layup based on specific performance targets. The goal: to have every one of them perform as well as the benchmark 56cm model and improve handling across the range. Many of the differences lie beneath the surface, but others are more noticeable. On the 2012 Tarmac, the down tubes on the 49cm and 61cm frames measured 66cm wide at the head tube. But on the 2015 model, the proportions change significantly—the down tube on the 49cm model is 49.4mm wide; it swells to 62.8mm on the 61cm bike. The frames also come with size-specific forks—three versions that use different steerer diameters, which D'Aluisio says helps create the appropriate steering responsiveness for each size."
9049,"Measured at the head-tube junction, the down tube on a 61cm frame (left) is nearly 50 percent taller than the one on a 49cm frame (right)."
9050,"""No company had really dug into understanding the differences, just the very pure physics of how riding a bike differed between a big rider and a small rider,"" says Pickman. ""To separate out your line this way takes an incredible investment in time and resources."""
9051,"As potentially groundbreaking as those size-tuned frames might be, Specialized made several other significant changes to its flagship road offering. Notably, the 2015 Tarmac comes in a disc-brake option. Buckenberger says that in addition to using extra material around the disc mounts, Specialized altered tube shapes to handle the stresses generated by hydraulic brakes. The frames weigh about 80 grams more than their rim-brake counterparts, but they have a ride quality that's ""nearly indistinct"" from those models, says Buckenberger."
9052,"The Tarmac is not an aero bike, but Specialized sculpted the head tube and other parts of the frame to reduce drag."
9053,"Engineers also put Specialized's in-house wind tunnel to use. Aerodynamicist Yu was able to subtly shape some frame tubes to reduce drag without significantly altering the bike's balanced ride. ""The Tarmac is not an aero bike and not a semi-aero bike,"" Yu says. But it is about 5 percent more slippery than the Tarmac SL4."
9054,"With the exception of disc brakes on some models, the 2015 Tarmac appears similar to the current SL4 at first glance. One of the few visible differences is its lack of a seatpost clamp. The latest version has an internal wedge system that sits lower on the seat tube than a traditional clamp, leaving more of the post exposed. That increases the tube's bending length so it can flex more on rough roads, potentially increasing comfort."
9055,"The designers say they also boosted pedaling stiffness by about 12 percent across all sizes compared with the SL4. The smaller models weigh about the same as comparable SL4 versions because their frame tubes are relatively slender; larger frames are a bit heavier than their predecessors. The bike is so distinct from previous versions that Specialized considered calling it something other than Tarmac; instead the company kept the name but dropped the SL designation. The 2015 Tarmac comes in S-Works, Pro, and Expert models—the versions are equally stiff, says Specialized, but the S-Works options use higher-grade composites that weigh 100 to 120 grams less than the others. At press time, Specialized had not yet provided frame weights or prices."
9056,"My initial ride on this new model lasted a little more than 90 minutes. Even in that brief time, I detected many of the same pleasing characteristics that made the SL4 great, but also some new sensations. The bike climbed as crisply and as smoothly as its predecessor. It jumped just as quickly when I pedaled hard, and the frame felt as robust when I rocked the bike from side to side while driving up a steep pitch. Exiting turns, it reacted precisely when I directed it to change lines, and it seemed a bit better at limiting chatter as I sped over broken pavement."
9057,"A carbon cover on the underside of the bottom bracket hides the derailleur cables, protecting them from grit and improving aerodynamics."
9058,"When speeds increased on the descent, I noticed more revealing differences. Trying to follow D'Aluisio and Pickman through Henry Coe, I entered several corners late and had to lean the bike over at a sharp angle to find the tightest line. It transitioned between turns a touch quicker and felt noticeably calmer through the apex of bumpy corners, which is perhaps why I felt relaxed and confident on the unfamiliar roads."
9059,"With the latest Tarmac, Specialized has shown that improving a bike, even a race model designed to win the Tour de France, requires more than increasing stiffness and reducing weight. The company has demonstrated that the next step for product developers is to create frames based on smart data—not guesswork—that improves the rider's control, comfort, and satisfaction. It's a leap forward in frame design with substantial benefits that we hope continues beyond this impressive bike."

9062,"The new generation of the Tarmac is unlike anything else on the road
"
9063,"The roads through Henry Coe State Park form a favorite testing loop for members of Specialized's product-development team, who work a few miles away in Morgan Hill, California. Gaining about 3,000 feet over 10 miles, the climb gives riders time to settle into a steady rhythm before short pitches as steep as 14 percent encourage them to stand and push hard into the pedals. From its highest point, the road descends back toward town following several sharp switchbacks and a few wide-open sweepers. Along the way, the surface transitions from ragged asphalt to smooth pavement. These variations make the loop ideal for exposing how well a bike climbs, descends, corners, and absorbs road shock."
9064,"In mid-April, weeks before the company introduced the 2015 Tarmac to the public, I follow two Specialized engineers through Henry Coe, trying to match their speed as we arc around the switchbacks. In the preceding 15 months, these engineers had spent countless miles on this loop, testing prototypes of a new Tarmac, the company's elite road-race model. By the time I've joined them, they have descended this road so frequently that they know how their bikes will respond to almost every crack and corner—but I'm a newcomer here, riding an unfamiliar bike. I feel uneasy as speeds spike above 40 mph, but the frame, even at this prototype stage, feels steady and calm. In some situations it behaves much like the existing Tarmac SL4 (a longtime favorite of our test staff), but I notice subtle differences I can't quite pinpoint."
9065,"After our ride through Henry Coe, we return to Specialized and regroup inside the Alberto Contador conference room—one of many that pay homage to racers, including Ned Overend, Mario Cipollini, and Sam Hill. Sitting below a wall-size photograph of perhaps the greatest stage racer in the past decade resplendent aboard an SL4, engineers Chris D'Aluisio, Sam Pickman, Chris Yu, and Ty Buckenberger tell me that the process of designing the new Tarmac was unlike anything they had previously undertaken. Typically when companies like Specialized update a model, engineers and designers focus mostly on reducing weight, increasing stiffness, adding compliance, and perhaps making it more aerodynamic. Specialized did some of that with the new Tarmac, but the latest version was already quite light and plenty rigid. They had something else in mind for the 2015 model."
9066,The updated seatstay bridge has clearance for 28mm tires.
9067,"Specialized introduced the Tarmac in 2003 as a rarefied road bike designed to help its sponsored teams win ProTour races. Company officials hoped this model would elevate the brand into the top echelon of road-bike makers, and it has: The Tarmac has been ridden by Tom Boonen, Contador, and others to victory in the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Tour of Flanders, and other races. Since its introduction, Specialized revised the bike five times, each successive version lighter and stiffer than the previous one. The most recent iteration, the SL4, had a nearly ideal blend of low weight, quickness, comfort, and sharp handling. In fact, Bicycling has named it our top race bike as part of our Editors' Choice awards three times."
9068,The disc-ready frames weigh only 80 grams more than rim-brake versions.
9069,"As good as the SL4 was, the engineers who work on the Tarmac suspected that they could further improve its handling, especially in the largest and smallest sizes. Each of the previous versions was designed around riders of average height—engineers plotted specific stiffness, handling, and compliance goals for the 56cm frame, then based changes to the larger and smaller frames on those numbers. The approach is not uncommon among bike manufacturers, but members of the design team came to the conclusion that this compromises performance at either end of the size spectrum. Smaller frames felt more rigid than was optimal while cornering; the larger sizes flexed more. The 2015 Tarmac fixes that discrepancy, says D'Aluisio. Every size across the line, in disc-brake and rim-brake options, will have the exact same ride character—that's 13 distinct frames without counting the S-Works versions, which use lighter carbon fiber."
9070,"The idea had crystallized within Specialized's design department about 15 months earlier, following several discussions between D'Aluisio and Pickman. Both are fast, skilled riders, but at 6-foot-4, Pickman has about 9 inches on his colleague. After comparing notes, the two engineers realized that their bikes reacted differently in similar situations, including some of those turns on the descent through Henry Coe. In fast, smooth corners, D'Aluisio's 52cm bike would tip in precisely then hold a steady line. Pick-man reported that his 58cm bike initiated with less precision and required more effort to maintain his line. The situations reversed in bumpy corners."
9071,"Around that time, Specialized began hearing similar reports from cyclists on the professional teams. Shorter riders like Contador wanted the bikes to chatter less as they cornered, while taller riders asked for more responsiveness.

Are the majority of your rides spent on roads or trails? Determining the terrain you ride most often allows you to zone in on the features your bra should have, explains Paula Dyba, vice president of marketing at Terry Bicycles. While road cyclists should choose adjustable straps and fabric with ventilation, mountain bikers should look for a bra that also has ample compression and molded cups, which provide more support during bumpy rides.Cut Is Key
When searching for a bra, keep coverage and mobility in mind. “A sports bra with a medium to high-cut neckline provides the best coverage, especially when riding in the aero position,” says Robin Bylenga, owner and founder of the women’s cycling boutique Pedal Chic, in Greenville, South Carolina. Racerback-style straps allow for a wide range of motion and fit comfortably with your backpack or hydration pack.Size Yourself Up
Bust size is an important, if not the most important, factor when buying a sports bra. If you’re well endowed, look for a bra that is sold in cup sizes, rather than by a small-through-extra-large sizing scale. Bylenga recommends Enell bras, which are sized using bust and rib measurements. “It has a corset-like closure and comes up high to provide coverage for bigger chests,” she says. No matter your size, you should feel supported, but not restricted.Key Features1. Adjustable straps: Look for sliders that sit at the front of your shoulders so you can easily lengthen or shorten the straps to create the perfect fit—without having to remove the bra.2. Flatlock stitching: This type of stitching joins fabric in a single layer so it lays flat on your skin, making chafing less likely.3. Breathable fabric: Look for a lightweight, moisture-wicking polyester blend. Some brands also offer fabrics with anti-odor and anti-microbial properties.

"
9136,"Equal Protection
Most helmets sold in the US must meet the Consumer Product Safety Commission standards and offer the same level of basic protection regardless of price (make sure yours has the CPSC logo). They work the same way, too: Nearly every model has a hard exterior shell molded to an inner layer of EPS foam, which crushes upon impact to dissipate force during a crash.Choose Your Style
There's a helmet for every type of rider. Road helmets prioritize weight savings and ventilation. Mountain bike helmets often have larger profiles to protect the back and sides of your head, and larger vents that encourage airflow at slower speeds. Stylish city-riding models can be heavier, but tend to have more durable exteriors to withstand the rigors of daily urban riding.Find the Right Fit
""A helmet will only protect you if it fits correctly,"" says John Thompson, Scott's helmet product manager. It should distribute pressure evenly and stay on without help from the chin strap, even if you turn your head upside down. Each brand fits differently, so try several in your price range. More expensive helmets are typically lighter, ventilate better, and have a more refined fit.Three Key Features1. Trauma-Reducing Designs
A few helmets offer protection beyond what the CPSC requires. By using integrated slip plates, like those designed by Swedish firm MIPS, these models have been shown to reduce the rotational forces from a crash that can cause a concussion.2. Retention Devices
More expensive models have adjustable systems that allow you to fine-tune the fit. They can also improve air flow and reduce hot spots.3. Accessory Mounts
Several helmets come with special fixtures to hold your sunglasses. And some mountain bike and commuter models have mounts for attaching GoPro-style cameras or lights for night riding."

Thigh vents are excellent for hot days, and there are four points of reflective material to provide low light visibility.  A Durable Water Repellent finish provides light rain protection—my butt stayed dry through scattered showers and drizzly rides, though I did get soaked in a downpour—and the claim of “quick dry fabric” is accurate: Despite being totally drenched during one ride, I was nearly dry when I got back to the car 45 minutes later.  A zippered pocket is a final bonus feature—great for stashing that emergency gel. "
9142,"The shorts do ride up a bit as you adventure, especially on the mountain bike when you’re moving around a lot. And they are fairly short—mine ran just to the bottom of the chamois shorts I was wearing under them—so if you prefer longer models, these may not be for you. "
9143,"For a woman looking for a pair of shorts to shred or to tour, the Gravel Shorts are an excellent, reasonably-priced option. "

9145,"New lid combines best of the aero Air Attack and lightweight Aeon
"
9146,"
	When Giro re-introduced the Air Attack as an aero offering two seasons ago, it electrified the helmet market with its industrial styling and function over form looks. Consumers were polarized, some glomming on to the aero benefits and others coming down firmly on the side of sartorial traditionalism."
9147,"	Jump ahead two years and Giro's newest helmet, the Synthe, has launched as an every-day helmet for racing and training with excellent cooling abilities and an aero bent. The Synthe takes cues from both the Air Attack and the more conventional Aeon while claiming better cooling than both lids. The Synthe is lighter weight than the Air Attack and more aerodynamic than the Aeon."
9148,"
The Synthe ues the same RocLoc Air retention as the Air Attack. The retention system positions the helmet slightly over the head and allows unimpeded airflow over the brow for extra cooling ability. (Giro Sport Design)"
9149,"	Looking much more like a traditional offering, the Synthe has some tricks up its sleeve. With 19 tuned vents—the Aeon has 24—Giro claims the Synthe better prevents heating from direct sunlight while also moving more air over the head to better cool the rider. Internal channels combined with perforated covers on some vents and the RocLoc Air retention system make the Synthe pull more air through the helmet. Impressively, the new shaping still offers a 16-percent reduction in drag over the Aeon at 25mph—an industry speed standard for wind tunnel testing—and at a 30 degree rider angle, about the same as a rider on the hoods or bar tops. In other words, at the same position most of us ride in day in and day out."
9150," Cooling, Not Just Venting
	Giro utilized wind tunnel time to not only make the Synthe aerodynamic but to also study how the cooling properties could be optimized. For this they used a head model called they call the Therminator. Equipped with 24 temperature sensors, the form is heated to 100 degrees then temperature changes are charted in the wind tunnel."
9151,"
Giro’s Therminator head-form is covered with 24 sensors that allow designers to pinpoint hot spots and chart temperatures. (Mike Yozell)"
9152,"	Airflow was also charted over the whole of the head form and channels were designed to move air not only front to back but to communicate side to side. Combined with the perforated panels on the side of the helmet, Giro claims they are able to increase negative air pressure on the outside of the helmet to draw more air in, and in turn help the flow of air at all speeds to cool the rider. Part of the cooling equation is the RocLoc Air, the same retention system found in the Air attack. This system allows greater airflow over the head by allowing a gap between the wearer’s forehead and the inside of the helmet and by virtue of suspending the helmet slightly over the whole of the head."
9153," Test Riding the Synthe
	Phoenix, Arizona in the end of June is an unusual choice for a product debut. But with temperatures in the 100s it would be a real opportunity to see if the helmet cools as well as claimed."
9154,"
A smoother, more rounded shape is reminiscent of the Air Attack but offers traditional styling and great cooling. (Giro Sport Design)"
9155,"	The first thing you notice about the new lid is the fit. It stays true to Giro’s shaping, sitting narrow at the side of the head and providing great adjustability via the RocLoc Air. It also sits light on the head, and did indeed feel like it was suspended over the top of my skull. Over our four hours of test time, I noticed the helmet allowed massive airflow at all speeds and a comfortable fit. It also was noticeably quieter, with less static-like wind noise while moving at high speed—an added side benefit—allowing greater ease for conversation and better enabling me to hear the world around me. The end of our test ride on day two included a long exposed climb with changing wind directions. True to what Giro claimed, the helmet felt breezy with a noticeable flow at all speeds."
9156,"	Giro also incorporated eyewear docks in the side panels, which they claim accommodates most popular eyewear. The docks did a great job of holding my Oakley Radarlock sunglasses in place when they weren’t being worn."
9157,"
Giro added ports to the side panel designed to hold most popular eye ware when not being worn. (Giro Sport Design)"
9158,"	The Synthe is slated for sale in late fall 2014. It will be available in eight colors and sizes small, medium, and large. Weight is 250 grams (medium) and pricing is set at $250."

9210,An insanely light race bike that's crazy-stiff too
9211,"As I stare down the barrel of my 45th birthday, and as a father of a 3-year-old, my riding can be summed up in this line from country singer Toby Keith: “I ain’t as good as I once was, but I’m as good once as I ever was.” Ask anyone who rides with me and they’ll tell you I love to randomly lay down attacks from the group as hard and long as I can—these days, that amounts to about eight seconds of all-out sprinting before I blow up. But when I rode the Cervélo Rca, a part of me couldn’t help but feel like it turned back time. (A is for Attack in Eddy Merckx's alphabet...)"
9212,Watch our review of the Cervelo RCA:
9213,"Who It’s For
	Weight weenies, racers at the highest level (Ryder Hesjedal won the Giro d’Italia on an R5ca in 2012), or anyone who wants to ride a cutting-edge carbon race bike."
9214,     RELATED: Find Your Next Bike in Our 2017 Buyer’s Guide
9215,"What We Liked
	The Rca is Cervélo’s pinnacle product. It was preceded by the R5ca, which was so cutting-edge when it was introduced seven years ago that it's still be among the lightest and best-riding race bikes today. And yet Cervélo surpassed it with the latest Rca, shaving 63 grams of weight while improving stiffness, ride quality, and aerodynamics. The Rca is an incredible 667 grams for a 54cm frame, with all hardware. Its fork is just 277 grams, with an uncut steerer tube."
9216,
9217,
9218,"But it’s not just the light weight that makes this bike great. It also has excellent overall frame stiffness, especially at the bottom bracket—even more so than the next race bike in Cervélo’s line, the R5. Cervélo also claims that the Rca fork is its stiffest laterally—for accurate handling—yet at the same time its most flexible front to back, for a smoother ride."
9219,"Cervélo achieves this otherworldly combination of ride quality, stiffness, and low weight with exotic stuff not used in its other bikes, like boron filaments, which allow engineers to use less material in the fork while maintaining its strength and ability to resist compression. The Rca also has roughly twice the carbon plies in its layup than the R5 to more finely tune stiffness, strength, and ride characteristics. Although you know what’s going on under the tires, the ride has a pleasing tone. It’s not muted or quiet, but still quite comfortable by race bike standards. Finally, it is built in Cervélo’s Southern California facility—hence the ca after the R. According to Cervelo, the Rca takes roughly five to eight times as long to manufacture when compared to the R5. Whether or not this justifies a price tag that’s just more than double the R5’s is debatable, but it certainly adds some perspective."
9220,RELATED: The Ten Things You didn't Know About Carbon Fiber
9221,"Watch Out For…
	Cervelo has traditionally put taller headtubes on its bikes and the RCA is no exception. This means few if any spacers under the stem for most folks and an aggressive negative-rise stem for many hard-core racers."
9222,"The Takeaway
	I’ve never been shot out of a cannon, but the Rca made me feel that way at times. It rode so light and stiff that it seemed to defy gravity—I’d shift to a harder gear on the approach to climbs and in the middle of them. I’m well aware of the placebo effect of knowing how light a bike is, but if the end result is more aggressive riding, does it really matter?"
9223,"The Rca reminded me why even these days, it doesn’t matter who I am riding with or how strong they are, I still attack. Even if I can’t follow through with it, I just want to feel that sensation of speed that I once had, and the Cervélo Rca gives me that feeling more than any bike I’ve ridden in recent memory. It’s enough to make you think that maybe you still got it, even if you don’t."
9224,"Why tubeless tires are ideal for your off-pavement rides, which ones to try, and how to set them up for gravel success"
9225,"As more roadies begin to venture away from the asphalt and onto the gravel, off-road technology is popping up in the traditionally conservative world of road cycling. With wider tires, lower pressures and gnarlier surfaces, more terrain is accessible than ever. "
9226,"Once you leave the confines of the road behind, there’s a lot of fun to be had— along with a whole new world of obstacles poised to deflate your day, and potentially your tires. That's where the new generation of tubeless gravel tires can make or break your ride. By eliminating the tube they eliminate pinch flats, dramatically reduce punctures, and let you run the kind of low tire pressures that make dirt grippy and enjoyable for even the most tarmac-addicted roadie."
9227,"RELATED: Less Grind, More Grin: 7 Ways to Upgrade Your Bike for Gravel Rides"
9228,"Tubeless tires, as the name suggests, mount to the rim without an inner tube. Unlike a tubular tire (which contains an inner tube), tubeless tires use the pressure of the air within them to form a seal with the rim. These tires are then filled with sealant, which plugs any punctures in the casing, making the system much less prone to failure. Mountain bikers have been running tubeless systems for years now, but on the road, issues with maintaining high pressures and sealing punctures have made tubeless tires much less common. Gravel tires, which are usually run at lower pressures, and have higher volumes than road tires, represent sort of middle ground—and a natural home for tubeless tech. "
9229,Want to know how to properly install a tubeless tire? Check out this easy guide:
9230,"Going tubeless will require that you change your tires and possibly your wheels, but upkeep costs are low—you won’t be buying nearly as many tubes— and the convenience can't be beat. We’d still suggest carrying a tube so that, in the event of a catastrophic tire slice, you can still make it home, but to put it in perspective, we’ve been running tubeless all summer and (knock on wood) have yet to fix a flat!"
9231,
9232,
9233,
9234,"Donelly Xplor MSO – Donnelly (which previously sold tires under the Clement brand) has continued making great products under its new name. The X'PLOR MSO is perfectly suited to mountain gravel roads, with its name coming from the airport code for Missoula, Montana. The closely-packed central tread rolls well on hardpack and tarmac, and the bigger knobs on the sides of the tire hook up well on sand, mud, and grass. The 40mm volume provides plenty of cushioning across rocks, washboard and roots, but slimmer models are available for those whose frame lacks the clearance for such huge volumes.Buy the Donelly Xplor MSO: $65 at REI"
9235,"Kenda’s Flintridge – Coming in both 35c and 40c, we prefer the larger Flintridge, which fits fine on the more capacious gravel frames we have been riding recently. The stiff sidewalls set up easily on our test bike and the central tread pattern, which looks like striped lines on a road, and rolls almost silently on the tarmac. These are a little less supple than some of the other tires we tested, so they weren’t quite as comfortable on really bumpy trails, but they felt fast on the roads, and gripped well on smoother singletrack.Buy Kenda's Flintridge: $59.99 at Performance Bike"
9236,"Maxxis Rambler/ Re-Fuse Combo – Gravel legend Rebecca Rush likes to run a custom combination of front and rear tires to maximize efficiency and speed in the kind of long gravel races at which she excels. Rusch prefers a slick rear tire like Maxxis Re-Fuse on the back and a more grippy Rambler on the front for traction. This works well in gravel races where low rolling resistance is a priority and rear traction isn’t as important. For those of us looking to hit the trails, a pair of 700x38 or 700x40 Ramblers provide great traction, even if they cost a little speed on the smoother surfaces.Buy the Maxxis Rambler: $49.99 at Backcountry.comBuy the Maxxis Re-Fuse: $50.00 at Amazon.com"

9241,"Plug Kit – Although tubeless tires filled with sealant will seal most punctures, really big cuts might prove too much for the polymers. In these situations, a tire plug can give the sealant particles something to bind to and stop the flow of air. It works kind of packing gauze over a bad wound to help blood platelets form a scab. Blackburn’s Plugger kit is small, lightweight, and easy to use, getting you back on the trail in a matter of minutes. (The alternative is putting an inner tube into your tire, like a standard flat change.)Buy the Blackburn Plugger Kit: $19.99 on Blackburn.com"
9242,"Maintenance – Stan's was one of the first brands to innovate tubeless-ready rims and conversion kits for clincher wheels, and the brand's tubeless sealant, valves and valve core extractors remain some of the best in the game. We love the reliable and lightweight Grail wheels, and the included tubeless valves that fit most other brands—including aftermarket tubeless conversions. Once those valves are installed, Stan’s valve core extractor will save your hours of fiddling around with pliers when removing valve cores to refresh sealant, and its bright red anodizing makes it easy to fish out from the depth of your toolbox. With the valve cores are removed, Stan’s syringe injector and sealant do a great job of providing a mess-free solution to would be punctures from goathead thorns to windshield glass, it even got us home with a pretty nasty looking nail in our tire. Stan’s suggest topping off the sealant every two months or so to make sure you always have plenty in the tire when you need it.Buy Stan's tubeless sealant: $14.99 at Amazon"
9243,"Pump—To mount tubeless tires, you need to deliver a large volume of air into the tire very quickly. This pops the bead of the tire outwards onto the edge of the rim and creates the seal. In some cases, a normal hand pump will work, but most of the time a compressor is needed. Unfortunately electric compressors are bulky, noisy and costly and pretty hard to take to the trailhead for last minute repairs. Enter the Lezyne Digital Pressure Overdrive. This sturdy pump does double duty as a floor pump and a compressor. About 50 strokes will charge the pump chamber, and a throw of the satisfyingly-solid lever sends a quick blast of air into your tire to help seat the bead. The digital gauge is perfect for dialing in tire pressure for the perfect trail-riding experience. Invest in one of these, and you won't have to stop at a gas station or bike shop every time you want to switch tires. Buy the Lezyne Digital Pressure Overdrive: $163.99 at Amazon"

9254,Transonic supersedes old SST with modern updates
9255,"As bike brands diversify their options, they’re designing road bikes with an eye toward a specific goal: comfort, light weight or aerodynamics. Fuji’s Altamira fulfills the lightweight niche, but the company hasn’t had a true aero road bike until now."
9256,"Fuji spent two years developing the Transonic, using much of what it learned in creating its Track Elite velodrome bike and Norcom Straighttriathlon bike. The result is a frame that is much more aero than its SST, but close in weight to the Altamira."
9257,"Rather than introduce a small selection of high-end models, Fuji will offer the Transonic in a wide range, from the $6,300, Dura-Ace Di2-equipped Transonic 1.1 down to the $1,800 Transonic 2.9, with a Shimano 105 drivetrain. Most of the bikes make liberal use of Fuji’s house brand Oval Components parts."
9258,"The old SST had some aero cues, but the new Transonic, unveiled at the Tour de France in Leeds, is designed as a pure aero road bike. There are the requisite airfoil tube shapes, and Fuji tucks the rear wheel in tight to the contoured seat tube, but engineers used a light hand on other integration, choosing function over pure aero form in places they felt it counted."
9259,"
Fuji used much of what it learned on the multisport-oriented Norcom Straight, sculpting the fork crown to fit smoothly into the down tube. (Joe Lindsey)"
9260,"As with some other bike brands, Fuji is making use of two-post “direct mount” brake calipers, rather than using linear-pull cantilevers as on its Norcom. The direct-pull design is slightly more sculpted than conventional single-bolt sidepull calipers, so the brake caliper fits better in the aerodynamic silhouette of the frame, while the direct-mount attachment offers good modulation and power."
9261,"Fuji product manager Steve Fairchild admitted that the integrated linear-pull models are slightly more aerodynamic, but said that they went with the direct-mount model to take advantage of better power and tire and rim clearance (a happy side effect of direct-mount designs, incidentally, is the ability to run larger tires, and the Transonic fits wide rims and tires up to 28mm). Fuji also placed the rear brake on the seatstay rather than under the chainstay, because the orientation is far easier for mechanics to access. Both the fork and seatstays are slightly contoured around the calipers."
9262,"
The Transonic uses direct-mount brake calipers, which fit more cleanly to a frame; the seatstay is shaped to improve airflow over the rear of the bike. (Joe Lindsey)"
9263, Fuji curves the seat tube to create a modest cutout for the rear wheel. Tucking in the wheel helps keep air flowing around the wheel/tube area. (Joe Lindsey)
9264,"Claimed frame weight is 980 grams (the Altamira is 920), and Fuji says that, compared to the SST, the Transonic has 121 fewer grams of so-called wind averaged drag (WAD) at 25mph. (Fuji’s numbers actually suggest that the SST wasn’t all that fast; it’s WAD number is slower than the decidedly non-aero Altamira). That saves roughly 12 watts at 25mph; a general rule is that 10 grams of drag at 25mph is roughly equivalent to one watt."
9265,WAD is a relatively new term in cycling; it’s an equation that takes into account rider speed and drag across a varying range of wind angles (typically 0-20 degrees) to create a general drag number. Advocates say it’s a more realistic assessment of aerodynamics than simply cherry-picking the lowest single drag number at a particular wind angle. Expect to see more brands use this terminology.
9266,"One of the most welcome aspects of the Transonic is the wide six-size range, from an XS 46cm to a L/XL 61cm offering. The three smallest sizes use a fork with 52mm of rake to keep the trail at a constant 56mm across all sizes. Because bikes have different head angles, using a constant fork rake, as some brands do for cost reasons, creates widely varying handling characteristics across a size range."
9267,Fuji expects the bikes to arrive in stores sometime in September.
9268,"
As with many modern bikes, the new Transonic features an integrated chainkeeper to prevent dropped chains and protect the frame. (Joe Lindsey)"

The aero seatpost uses a wedge-style clamp with a very clean look. The rough-looking front section improves the grip to prevent seatpost slippage. (Joe Lindsey)

9270,"It’s cycling vacation season, so we asked American racer Megan Guarnier to share her packing list
"
9271,"
Summer is the time to get away with our bikes, and nobody travels more this season than pro racers. We asked 2012 US road cycling champion Megan Guarnier, a competitor at the 2014 Giro Rosa with team Boels-Dolmans, for her travel essentials of choice.Sunscreen
“Getting a sunburn saps your energy,” says Guarnier. When you need to put all your resources into muscle and mental recovery so you can ride another day, you don't need the added stress of healing your skin.” (Here are some of Bicycling’s favorite sunscreens for cycling.)RockTape
“Putting your body through the wringer day after day can lead to unexpected aches and pains,” Guarnier says. “Physio tape helps stabilize or activate your muscles when you start to fatigue.” If you’re not familiar with the sticky stuff, read our Fit Chick’s handy physio tape guide.Earplugs
“Hotels can be noisy and if you are sharing a room, you may not always be on the same schedule as your roommate,” says Guarnier. “Good sleep means better performances on the bike.”Instant Oatmeal
“A nutritious breakfast is crucial before a long ride,” says Guarnier. “It’s important to have something that’s easy to digest and that you are willing to eat every morning.” Guarnier travels with Quaker instant oatmeal packets and adds hot water, fruit, yogurt and cinnamon from the hotel breakfast buffet. “It’s definitely not glamorous, but it is filling,” she says.Osmo Pre-Load
If you’re riding hard or in the saddle all day like Guarnier, Osmo’s high-sodium Pre-Load can help you perform in the heat. For shorter, easier rides, here are some other good hydration-drink options.Sound-Canceling Earphones
“Stage racing often requires driving long transfers between stages,” Guarnier says. “It can be tedious, but it’s also a great time to relax and recover. When you need to completely zone out, pop on your earphones and turn up some good music.” (Bonus: This will also help you tune out annoying bike-tour van mates or airplane snorers.)A Good Read
“It’s a nice way to unwind your mind at the end of the day before you sleep. It can be hard to take your mind off the race. Open a book, and it’s easier to fall asleep without thinking of the coming days.” Guarnier is a fan of Laura Hillenbrand (author of Seabiscuit and Unbroken)—and we think these Tour de France books make great beach reads."
9272,"Yearning for a ride made by one of mountain biking's most colorful, established brands? Pick this excellent women’s trail bike."
9273,"As far as mountain bike brands go, few have an image as colorful as Yeti. The Colorado-based company was founded in 1985, making it one of the OGs of mountain biking. The brand has maintained a solid racing presence since then, with team riders like Richie Rude crushing on the Enduro World Series circuit in 2016. And the company has a laid-back mountain vibe that’s focused on community—Yeti even hosts a yearly weekend of riding and fun for people who own its bikes, called the Tribe Gathering.  "

9275,"Of course, all this camaraderie doesn’t mean much if the bikes don’t live up to the hype. But they do. We particularly like the Yeti Beti SB5, which shares a frame with the men’s version of this five-inch-travel trail platform but is optimized for women who rip: Decreased rebound damping in the shock helps the suspension to feel lively for lighter riders, and parts spec has been tweaked."
9276,"The Beti SB5 is light and snappy to accelerate, and the X01 Eagle drivetrain provides excellent, crisp shifting performance with a mountain-conquering range of gears. But I was struck most by the Beti’s personality—it goaded me up climbs, into rock gardens, and down sketchy descents with saucy confidence. And the Switch Infinity suspension really is fantastic: After I dialed it in, I barely noticed small bumps. Bigger hits felt seductively plush—as if the rocks I was riding were composed of something fluffier."
9277,Salivate over the Yeti SB4.5c:
9278,"And there’s awesome news for those who might not be able to spend quite so much—Yeti recently introduced lower-priced carbon versions of all its models. They’re identical to the top-tier carbon frames (which are now denoted “Turq”) and offer the same stiffness, but come with a weight penalty (about 250g on a size small) with a substantial price difference: The Carbon Beti SB5 starts out at $4,699—almost two-grand cheaper than the entry-level Turq model."
9279,"The Beti SB5 is a dreamy bike, the kind of ride that’s so stoke-worthy you’ve just got to talk about it. And if you end up buying one, I know where you can find some people who get just what you’re saying."
9280,The new Giro Empire SLX road shoe continues the lace-up trend
9281,"When Giro’s lace-up Empire road shoe debuted two years ago, many cyclists took it as a one-off retro offering. But as the company explained in introducing a new edition, that was never the intention."
9282,Its new Empire SLX is an unapologetically expensive ($350) pair of shoes with stylish flourishes that would not look out of place in a Milan boutique.
9283,"Pro racers and others are asking for the shoe, said Giro footwear product manager Simon Fisher, because the design creates a close fit that isn’t disturbed by straps, buckles, D-rings, and the plastic armor that many modern road shoes have—additions that, for some riders, can cause painful hot spots."
9284,"“If you think about it, the laces (on the Empire SLX) create seven adjustment points, while straps and buckles and dials usually have only three,” he said at the introduction in Harrogate, England at the Tour de France. The increased adjustability lets riders with oddly shaped feet fine-tune fit."
9285,"Fisher added that the move away from laces, which began about 30 years ago, had nothing to do with the quality of the closure system itself. The old upper materials like natural leather and early synthetics were prone to stretching, and the straps and buckles helped improve efficiency by keeping riders’ feet from moving around inside the shoe. Today, said Fisher, modern synthetics don’t stretch, so laces—which are lighter and more adjustable—are a viable option again."
9286,The detailed perforations add a striking aesthetic that’s like a high-tech wingtip. (Joe Lindsey)
9287,"The new Empire uses a one-piece upper made with a sandwich construction Giro calls EvoFiber. The outer layer is a new synthetic leather with a distinctive pebble grain, bonded to a breathable mesh inner that helps wick moisture. The leather itself is waterproof but breathable, so your foot stays cooler on hot days without the need for mesh inserts. Perforations obviously let in water, but add a beautiful visual touch."
9288,"Giro claims the new Easton EC90 SLX 2 outsole, which fits all three-bolt pedal systems, is its stiffest yet. Although the two brands are no longer part of the same company, Giro says the collaboration will continue. The final touch is the customizable SuperNatural Fit Kit insole system, which is unchanged from past editions."
9289,Just two colors will be offered: a brilliant hue called “Anodized Glowing Red” and a more traditional white. (Courtesy)
9290,"The lighter sole, titanium cleat hardware, and new upper reduce the weight to 175 grams per shoe (size 42.5), which Giro claims is the lightest production road shoe made. They’ll come in sizes 39–48 (sorry, small-footed folks) with half sizes from 39.5–46.5. Colors are a snowy white and a fiery color called Anodized Glowing Red, both with black logos. Giro says that they’ll be in stores in October."

9312,This fun e-bike embraces its identity
9313,"During my half-a-year test period, all kinds of people asked to ride the Elby, an electric, pedal-assist bike with unique styling that manages to look non-intimidating while also promising fun. (And the ride delivers). Everyone who tried the Elby loved it. I loved the Elby, too. I love it so much I like saying the words the Elby. Just saying the Elby makes me a happier person. I have extensive time on the Specialized Turbo, the Stromer, the Faraday and other pedal-assist e-bikes, and the Elby is by far my favorite non-cargo option."
9314,"Who It's For
	Anyone who wants to make it a little simpler, easier, less sweaty, quicker, or more convenient to get to work or into town, do errands, or just enjoy a recreational spin."
9315,"What We Liked The Elby is the first e-bike that fully is what it is—it’s not trying to look moto souped-up and hard-ass, doesn’t masquerade as just an elegant bicycle by hiding the motor and battery in a traditional-looking frame, but also doesn’t awkwardly and visibly graft its battery and drive system onto a stock frame like some kind of goiter or parasitic abomination. By embodying its purpose—to help you ride around town comfortably, safely, and quickly—it achieves an admirable kind of coolness."

(I routinely exceeded 50 miles on a charge when I carefully modulated between power levels.) Top speed is 20 mph, and there's an IOS & Android app to monitor and control stuff like setup, display, charging and navigation."
9320,"Lots of details take the bike to another level: Superbright integrated LED lights front and back; a USB charging port; hydraulic disc brakes (paired with a 9-speed SRAM drivetrain); the ability to legitimately fit riders, with seatpost and stem adjustments, from 5-feet-nothing to 6-foot-5; a foolproof kickstand; and an integrated rear rack (and pannier mounts) and fenders."
9321,"One of the more interesting—and controversial—inclusions is the throttle lever, which lets you accelerate without pedaling. In one sense, this is a real departure from the idea of what a bicycle is—one ought to pedal. But two things: First, I learned that I only really used it in one scenario, and it was a common situation tht made riding feel much safer: to get up to speed after stopping at intersections. And second, every non-cyclist who tried the Elby said the throttle option gave them much more confidence and made the idea of riding more enjoyable and appealing."
9322,Get where you're going in style in the Parker Dusseau x Bicycling Work Shirt. 
9323,"Watch Out For
	Weight is the only real drawback. The Elby weighs 57 pounds, which isn’t unreasonable, and is spread so well that it never detracts from the handling or the ease of kickstanding the bike. Yet, it is enough that make the bike impractical for anyone who deals with stairs at home or work, or will need to manuever in tight spaces that require lifting the bike or pivoting it around. And if you do run out of battery power, the Elby is a lot to pedal."
9324,"The Takeaway
	The Elby is a great choice for anyone interested in electric power, and one of the first to really integrate power into a complete, well-styled, and inspiring package."
9325,Hydraulic disc brakes for SRAM’s wireless electronic eTap drivetrain
9326,"When SRAM launched the eTap wireless electronic group, it was a road racing group for cable-actuated brakes, and a two-ring drivetrain. Though wireless implementation was certainly progressive, the rest of the group was still somewhat old school, especially considering that SRAM pushed hydraulic braking options—primarily disc—and alternative drivetrain options like wide range cassettes (WiFLi) and 1x drivetrains."
9327,RELATED: SRAM Red eTap is a Step Forward for Electronic Shifting
9328,"At the eTap launch, I asked SRAM representatives what was next for eTap now that the group had reached production status. The response was, “You can get a good idea of what’s coming next by looking at our other product offerings.” Translation: “Dude, hydraulic braking, 1x, and WiFLi, are coming to eTap. Be patient.”"
9329,  
9330,
9331,"Apparently they weren’t bluffing, because in mid-May I spotted the Pinarello K8-s Disk you see in these photos with a production-looking eTap hydraulic disc brake group. And today, SRAM has officially announced hydraulic braking for its Red eTap group: they call it HydroHC."
9332,"HydroHC is really one new thing: the shift/brake levers for eTap wireless electronic shifting and hydraulic braking. Otherwise the “group” is made up of SRAM’s existing eTap derailleurs, and existing Red 11-speed cranks, cassette, and chain."
9333,
9334,
9335,"The HydroHC’s hoods are notably more sculpted than SRAM’s existing HydroR hoods for mechanical drivetrains. I have a HydroR-equipped bike in my stable, so I’m very familiar with the hoods. I was able to put my hands around the HydroHC hoods in the Pinarello seen in the photos, and they are noticeably smaller in diameter than HydroR. They feel much like eTap hoods, and that’s a good thing, because eTap’s ergonomics are great."
9336,
9337,
9338,"Among HydroHC’s features are adjustable reach, and contact-point adjustment. Reach sets how close the lever is to the bar, of course, while contact point adjustment lets the rider set how much the lever moves before the brake engages. SRAM has offered contact point adjustment in its hydraulic disc brakes for mountain bikes for many years, but this is its first appearance in the company’s drop-bar hydraulic brakes."
9339,
9340,
9341,"Though the graphics are new, a SRAM representative confirmed that the Red HydroHC brake calipers are the same as those recently introduced with the Level Ultimate mountain bike brakes, albeit with a flat-mount caliper in addition to a post-mount caliper. The one-piece aluminum calipers have SRAM’s new Bleeding Edge system, which is claimed to improve the quality of a bleed, and stainless steel heat shields claimed to reduce the fluid temperature in the caliper by 20 degrees Celsius during extreme braking."
9342,
9343,
9344,One feature not covered in the HydroHC product information released today is the Stealth-A-Majig connector seen in the photos. I asked SRAM representatives for further information and was told none would be available until the Eurobike trade show in late August.
9345,
9346,
9347,"However, Stealth-A-Majig is part of SRAM’s existing mountain bike technology suite, so the premise is likely the same. This part allows the brake lever, the brake caliper, and hose to be pre-bled so they may be connected without requiring a final bleed. It is essentially a tool to speed and simplify the assembly of frames (primarily at original equipment level) with internal control routing. In the example shown, it tucks neatly into its own pocket in the hoods."
9348,"With SRAM’s mountain bike brakes, dedicated levers are offered for Stealth-A-Majig and for a traditional compression nut/olive/hose barb assembly. We’ll need to wait until late August to find out if it’s the same for HydroHC."
9349,
9350,
9351,"Though SRAM’s current HydroR drop-bar hydraulic braking system offers disc and rim brake options, SRAM is, at this point, only showing disc calipers with HydroHC. I asked a SRAM representative about HydroHC rim brake options, and he refused to comment."

9356,"When Giant introduced its Defy endurance road bike in 2008, the bike was part of a broader movement to return more real-world abilities to bikes that had been designed chiefly around race-worthy attributes less relevant to regular, enthusiast cyclists. While other road bikes chased unyielding stiffness and marginal aerodynamic gains, the Defy offered greater comfort and versatility with a performance-focused frame and fit that didn’t require the slinky spine of a pro."
9357,"	In its latest version, Giant makes more bold moves, creating a bike that serves the broad and varied needs of road cyclists. In doing so, they jettisoned much of what defined the previous Defy (a five-time  award-winner), keeping only a few dimensional standards like the 86mm press-fit bottom bracket and the geometry."
9358,"	The 11-bike line—seven Advanced-branded carbon models, four aluminum offerings—covers an expansive retail range of $620 (Defy 5) to $10,300 (Defy Advanced SL 0) and is intended as an endurance bike, belonging to the same growing family as Trek’s Domane, Specialized’s Roubaix, and Cannondale’s Synapse."
9359," The New Defy Design
	The tube shapes are different, subtly in some places and more dramatically in others. The old aero-shape seatmast (or seatpost, depending on the model) is gone in favor of a flat-backed profile Giant calls D-Fuse, which first saw use on the TCX cyclocross model. The seatstays narrow to gossamer thinness, and attach lower down the seat tube to help prevent vibration from traveling up to the saddle."
9360,"
Giant reconfigured the rear triangle on the Defy, using a D-shaped seatmast and attaching the seatstays lower down to keep vibration from traveling up to the rider. (Joe Lindsey)"
9361,"	The company studiously avoids the word “comfort,” when discussing the new bike, but Giant proudly points out that it does not rely on mechanical elements or frame additions—like dampers or couplers—to achieve a more balanced ride quality than race-oriented frames. That allows them to say that the new frame is the lightest they’ve ever made (890 grams for the Advanced SLR version). It’s lighter even than the race-bred TCR Advanced SL."
9362,"	Giant also stepped into the new disc-brake road world. All seven carbon-fiber models are disc-only (all four aluminum versions are rim-brake). A notable choice: While disc-brake bikes are inching toward use of through-axle wheel attachments (Giant’s TCX uses a through-axle fork), the company chose to stay with conventional quick-release skewers on the Defy. That’s despite an expansion of its house-brand P-SLR wheelsets, which would allow Giant to do whatever it wanted for axle attachments."
9363,"	“I don’t believe current through-axle standards are applicable to road bikes,” said engineer and road product manager Jon Swanson, of the company’s decision. “It’s completely overbuilt; it works for ‘cross but for road it’s not where it needs to be.”"
9364,"	Swanson believes that new, road-specific through-axle standards will eventually develop, but even given Giant’s singular ability in the bike industry to drive that development, he wasn’t comfortable driving that and locking in buyers to a potentially proprietary standard."
9365,"	As with many new bikes, Giant presented information from laboratory testing attesting to the bike’s stiffness and vibration absorption. But past the direct (and favorable) comparisons to other brands, Giant’s biggest point is that modern carbon bicycles may be attaining maximum practical levels of stiffness."
9366,"	As with all Giants, the carbon models are built in Giant’s own C-Tech factory. Giant is one of just a few bike makers to control its own framebuilding from raw carbon thread to complete bikes. (The aluminum bikes are also made in-house.)"
9367,"	While the showstopper is the $10,300 Defy Advanced SL 0, the sweet spot of the line is the Advanced Pro series, which uses a conventional seatpost (as opposed to the SL’s seatmast), but features electronic or mechanical shifting and hydraulic disc brakes and starts at a far better $3,500. Bikes will be available this fall."

9370," Advanced SL Performance
	Most of the bike industry relies on standardized lab tests for stiffness. Within the test for pedaling stiffness, Giant’s Doug Barnett said that, past a certain point, a bike is so stiff that almost no rider can actually flex the frame. He said that in the past, Giant had made pro-only versions of frames with stiffer carbon layups for certain riders like Mark Cavendish, but that current Giant-Shimano team riders—even powerful sprinter Marcel Kittel—ride standard production frames."
9371,"	Because of that, Giant focused most on improving torsional stiffness, or how the bike and particularly the wheels stay aligned under forces like high-speed cornering. There, Barnett said, Giant hasn’t yet defined a maximum practical stiffness, but one likely exists."
9372,"	Swanson isn’t given to understatement, and clearly feels that the use of frame elements like elastomeric inserts or couplers to reduce vibration is a compromise. While that’s a matter of opinion, what Giant’s insistence on avoiding them does offer is the benefit of weight savings."
9373,"	There’s no single factor to point to in the weight reduction. Swanson said that instead, it’s the accumulation of many little factors. On the top-end Advanced SL, all internal brake cable routing goes through a single port in the head tube (every hole in a carbon frame must be reinforced, so fewer holes means less weight). The rear dropouts are hollow carbon fiber, while the front left dropout tab and disc brake mount are a single unit rather than separate pieces bonded around an aluminum sleeve."
9374,"	While the Advanced SL’s bare frame is 890 grams, Giant also says that the complete frame package—the frame, seatmast and clamp, derailleur hangers, headset hardware, and fork—is just 1,505g in a size medium."
9375," On the Road
	We’re hesitant to draw conclusions about a bike after testing it only at a press event. That said, Giant lined up two days of spectacular riding around Pitlochry, in Highland Perthshire, Scotland, where we put in 120 hilly miles on the Defy Advanced SL 0."
9376,"	In the brilliantly sunny weather we experienced (a rarity even in summer), the Highlands provides world-class road riding. The sparsely populated region offers any number of routes. Small secondary roads undulate over relentless leg-breaking rollers as they circumnavigate the many lochs, while longer climbs ascend passes through the giant, glacial-cut valleys and around peaks like Schiehallion, an imposing triangular summit where contour lines for topographical maps were invented."
9377,"	The roads range from standard two-lane arterials to tiny, six-foot wide paths with lumpy, pebbled pavement and technical descents with sharp corners around blind curves (and errant sheep to further keep you on your toes). In short, it’s the perfect spot to test an endurance road bike."
9378,"	Keeping the Defy’s existing geometry was a wise choice. Compared to the race-oriented TCR Advanced SL, our size medium tester has a wheelbase that’s 1.5cm longer courtesy of longer chainstays, a 1.5cm taller head tube and a half-degree slacker head tube angle. The seat tube angle steepens by half a degree as well."
9379,"	It’s a solid combination that produces a confident-feeling bike in nearly every situation. At speed, it’s stable, but I was able to make quick and assured line changes in unfamiliar terrain to adjust for situations like gravel on the centerline or broken pavement (both fairly common occurrences)."
9380,"	The descents showcased the power and modulation of Shimano’s hydraulic disc brakes. On our first ride, a rollicking descent to the far end of a loch included a fast run-in to a tight left-hand corner, in the shade, with gravel. I quickly scrubbed speed even as I came in a bit too hot, adjusted my line inside the patch of loose grit and rocketed out the other side. Could I have done the same on a rim-brake equipped bike? Probably, but perhaps not without wheel skid or at least a spike in my pulse rate."
9381,"	More surprisingly, the bike felt great on climbs. I didn’t detect any rear-end wag from the longer chainstays under full power in or out of the saddle; nor did I hear complaints from even the bigger riders at our event. (We were on the flagship Advanced SL 0 model, a $10,000 dream bike with Zipp 202 clinchers; the true test of the line is whether lower-trim models feel light and snappy.)"
9382,"	There were a few issues: The bikes in our fleet were uniformly noisy, with clattering from the internal cables, the weighty Shimano hydraulic brake lever blades and integrated master cylinders, and, for a few testers, slightly loose Di2 battery mounts inside the ISP seatmast. Time and tinkering will tell if noise will be a real issue or if it was confined to our test fleet."
9383,"	I’m torn on the through-axle issue. On one hand, I believe Swanson is right that the 15mm standards borrowed from mountain bikes are probably not ideal for road disc brakes. But neither are quick releases, and the difference is that a 15mm through-axle can be stepped down with adaptors should other standards emerge in the future; with quick releases, you’re stuck."
9384,"
Near Schiehallion, where contour lines were first used, the rugged Highlands revealed themselves under rare, brilliant sunshine. (Joe Lindsey)"
9385,"	While through-axles can improve frame stiffness, I mention it because they offer a more uniform attachment point with less rotor rub, and because they are far better suited to the huge forces that disc braking generates on the axle attachment point to the fork. Right now, the industry seems split; Trek opted for a 15mm front and 12x142 rear through-axle for its new Domane Disc, but Specialized stuck with quick releases for the disc version of the new Tarmac."
9386,"	As well, like a lot of endurance road bikes, the Defy feels a little unbalanced in ride quality. The rear end soaks up vibration beautifully, but the front seemed to transmit a bit more road buzz. This is a common phenomenon in this category, and the bike still rides more comfortably than a race-oriented model, but we’ll need a long-term test to deliver a more complete verdict."
9387,"	Giant calls the Defy an endurance road bike—I’m not so sure that such classification is necessary. Much like modern trail bikes are to the world of knobby tires, the Defy seems to me to be a bike you’d choose to ride on almost any ride, any day, on any terrain, and feel confident and comfortable the whole time."
9388,"	It’s the category of bikes that’s most broadly suited to most riders, whatever you’re doing. I think it’s where most of the action, growth, and development, will be in road bikes in the coming five to 10 years, and is Giant right in the mix with the Defy."

9392,This classic build could be your lifelong partner
9393,"There was a time when bicycle technology was less complicated. Things like headsets and bottom brackets were simple pieces that could be moved from bike to bike. Today’s technology is impressive, but it’s evolving at a pace that can feel difficult to keep up with. "
9394,"So what if you want a bike that will last? One that you will very likely be able to repair and maintain with little fuss, for its long life? Something that nonetheless comes in a modern configuration that won’t make you look like you are riding in from the turn of the century. And that (with a swap of wheels or tires) will do anything from club rides, to dirt and singletrack, or road races. 
	I know what kind of bike I’d choose, but it would look similar to the Seven RedSky. "
9395,     RELATED: Find Your Next Bike in Our 2017 Buyer's Guide
9396,"The RedSky is custom-only and available in a steel model, a titanium/carbon version (ti lugs and carbon tubes), and a ti version with three tubing options: straight gauge (S), double butted (SL), and what Seven calls ultra-butted tubes (SLX) that differ in weight and ride feel. We tested a ti version with the double-butted SL tubes. Titanium is a material that can last virtually forever. It’s resistant to corrosion, keeps its ride quality for decades, and tube replacement and repairs can be carried out easily."
9397,"For fittings on the RedSky, Seven sticks with what works and will likely remain unchanged and available for a long time: The bottom bracket is English threaded and the headset is external and pressed in. The frame is built around midreach caliper rim brakes (our test model had stoppers from Velo Orange) for clearance for up to 33mm tires."
9398,
9399,
9400,"The RedSky is fun because it is versatile. In the ’90s, everybody wanted to be a Tour de France racer. Now we all want to ride dirt roads. When fashion swings again, this bike will be ready. It can accept a wide range of tires, and it has covert fender and rack mounts. The geometry is adaptable to a variety of terrain, comprising a bike that is steady when you’re plowing through miles of wet clay and still feels at home whipping in and out of a paceline. Toss on a set of fat 28- or 32mm smooth road tires, and it can serve as an all-day randonneuring bike. Swap to 32mm Clement X’plor MSO knobbies and hit the gravel—there’s ample clearance for mud if things get wet. Want to get some speed work in? With a pair of 25mm Vittoria Corsas on the bike, it’s suitable for fast group rides. "
9401,"Fashion and technology crazes will continue to march on, but thanks to a bit of forethought and a nod to trends that still serve us well, the RedSky will stand the test of time."
9402,Autumn weather can swing wildly from frosty mornings to sun-soaked afternoons. Be ready for anything with this simple guide.
9403,"Even experienced, tough veterans can find this matter of dressing for fall rides vexing. Head out early on a late-October morning and temps can soon warm by 25 degrees or more. Other times, the mercury suddenly plummets, showers roll through and breezes morph into gales. Showing up at a ride smartly dressed doesn't only ensure a comfortable outing and add to your enjoyment—it also marks you as a smart rider. Being able to calmly and smoothly respond to the fickle skies of autumn is as impressive and satisfying in its own way as perfectly executing a town line sprint. Here's a what-to-wear guide, plus four simple rules that should guide all fall clothing decisions."
9404,"Rule 1: Value Versatility
	Have several wardrobe items that can perform under a variety of circumstances: Combining a thermal undershirt, arm warmers and a short-sleeved jersey beats a long-sleeved jersey, because the warmers can come off when the day heats up. Same goes for warmers, a base layer, a wind vest and embrocation."
9405,    Related: How to Bike Through the Worst Weather
9406,"Rule 2: Look To Layer
	Once you've acquired a versatile wardrobe of fall and spring gear, start experimenting with different combinations to find the ideal mix for a variety of conditions. Dress in layers—the last thing you put on should be the first thing you'll want to take off."
9407,"Rule 3: Use Breathable Fabrics
	Make sure whatever you buy is made of a material that won't trap moisture. Any base layer's primary job is to wick sweat and moisture from your skin. Consider starting with two: one made from mesh or CoolMax for warmer days and one constructed from thermal micropolyester for cold, wet rides. Experiment with these to find the best combinations for different conditions."
9408,    Related: Get Ready for Winter with These Cycling Accessories
9409,"Rule 4: Remember Your Extremities
	Many newer helmets accommodate a cycling cap or headband—often all you need to keep your head warm. A good rule of thumb: If it's cold enough to make you wonder if you'll need a cap, put one into your pocket. For hands, begin with a thin glove or liner made from wool or CoolMax, then add a thicker, more waterproof glove as needed. The same logic applies with feet: Socks made from fabrics like wool are light, comfortable and breathable; add a weather-resistant overshoe or bootie when temps drop."
9410,It looks and feels like a traditional trail bike​—and lets you climb impossibly steep pitches with ease
9411,"Specialized has never been a brand to sit around waiting to see how things play out. In designing its 140mm-travel Turbo Levo e-mountain bike, the company really went for it, delivering a bike that looks and feels similar to a traditional trail bike."
9412,"Prior to the Levo, the e-mountain bikes I’d ridden made it seem as though components, geometry, and suspension design took a backseat to the electric-assist motor. On the Turbo Levo, everything from its long, low, trail-focused geometry to its stellar FSR suspension is what you’d expect of a modern trail bike. Generous 2.8-inch-wide tires support the extra weight and power of an e-mountain bike, adding traction and rim protection when plowing through rocks. A clean, down tube–integrated 460Wh battery maintains close-to-normal looks, and a smartphone app allows for custom tuning output. A Smart Control feature within the app lets the system automatically distribute power output based on ride length."
9413,
9414,
9415,"The first Turbo Levo, launched in 2016, was good enough to migrate forward with a few small tweaks. It had effective suspension, superb handling at speed, and electric-assist that came on smoothly, quietly, and predictably, even in Turbo mode. For 2018 Specialized still gave the platform a serious refresh including carbon frames on some models, a more powerful motor, a longer-travel fork, and updated software. Not only is the full-carbon frame 650 grams lighter (500 grams on the Comp Carbon we tested, with a carbon front triangle and aluminum stays) than last year’s aluminum frame, it’s 40 percent stiffer in the rear and 20 percent more rigid overall (claimed)."
9416,Here are 10 things you probably didn’t know about carbon fiber:
9417,"The new Turbo 1.3 motor has 15 percent more power due to new magnets and new electronics. Power output drops off less over the course of a ride, too. A new walk mode provides a little boost when you’re pushing the bike, and a new handlebar-mounted remote, for toggling the three pedal-assist modes and walk function, adds a second control center in addition to the battery-mounted buttons."
9418,
9419,
9420,"On the trail, the Levo isn’t radically different from the original—and that’s a good thing. There are still no surprises as the assist kicks in or out—the highest mode, Turbo, roughly doubles your power output until you hit 20 mph, where it gently tapers off. Most of the motor improvements relate to heat management and battery life, so you won’t really notice them on the trail. What you can feel is a steady boost that lets you climb impossibly steep pitches with ease, so you can quickly spin to the top of your favorite descent. (Proclaim your love of downhills with Bicycling’s “Gravity” Periodic Table of Cycling T-shirt!) Testers estimated getting twice the mileage for the same effort on a traditional trail bike. And you actually do get a workout—the Levo is good at getting you to pedal hard, because that’s when it gives back the most."
9421,This sleek singlespeed is a no-frills ride for short city riding
9422,"Electra is perhaps best known for its candy-colored cruisers and coordinating components, but this minimalist steel singlespeed bike is just as much of a treat for the senses. Go ahead and stroke the raised stitching on the synthetic leather grips. On wet days, raindrops bead beautifully on the shiny nickel-plated frame. The Loft comes in internally geared, three- or seven-speed versions as well as with a traditional seven-speed drivetrain, and all models other than the Loft 1 are available with step-through frames. (Check out 16 of 2016's best City Bikes)"
9423,"Who It’s For
	People looking for a no-frills ride for short commutes or errands. The Loft also makes a great guest or loaner bike—riders don’t need to be comfortable with shifting or hand brakes."
9424,"What We Liked
	Coaster brake FTW! No-hands braking means you can enjoy your morning brew on the fly—without spilling, even. (It also makes it easier to signal turns, wave at pedestrians, or throw your arms in the air and yell “Whee!”) There are no brake or shift cables to clutter up the frame, and the low-profile drivetrain not only keeps the weight down, but also makes the bike easier to lift or walk alongside. The only included commuter accouterments are a chainguard and kickstand, but if you feel the need to add some flair, Electra sells a wide range of inexpensive accessories, from anodized cup holders ($20) to jumbo bells ($16, and yes, they come in Taco) to cheery handlebar dahlias ($10). Think of this bike as a blank canvas."
9425,"On the road—and occasionally, in the woods—the Loft was a fun companion on flat-to-rolling roads (gearing is 44/20). The 35mm tires smoothed everything from bumpy pavement and wooden boardwalks to dirt paths that included the occasional pebbly or rooty patch. The upright position helped me keep tabs on traffic as well as friendly deer."

9427,"Watch Out For
	If you haven’t used a coaster brake since you were seven years old, take some time to get used to the sensation (and increased stopping distance). Sudden stops will require more core strength than the hand-brake variety."
9428,"The Takeaway
	The Loft is a simple, low-maintenance ride that boasts an excellent smiles-per-dollar ratio."
9429,"Giant’s women’s bikes get their own brand
"
9430,"The big story out of the Liv launch was that it was a Liv launch—not Liv/Giant. The women’s branch of the company has splintered off and grown into its own entity, which is entirely piloted by women from design to production and features women’s apparel, Liv retail stores, and, of course, bikes."
9431,"With the brand evolution, Liv unveiled its Avail series, an all-new range of women’s endurance road bikes. The Avail name carries over from Giant’s old women’s line, but the bikes have been completely redesigned. The company aimed to offer the best balance of light weight, control, efficiency, and compliance of any existing women’s road bike. To accomplish that, they started from scratch and designed a women’s bike that was based not on a Giant’s men’s version, but on data about female riders."
9432,"“We are not taking an inline model and changing the length of the top tube and head tube and calling it women’s specific. We start with a blank piece of paper and go from there,” explained Abby Santurbane, Liv’s global category manager when asked how the Avail compares to the unisex Giant Defy. “The geometry is developed through our global dimension database, intended usage and rider goals (which equate to rider body angle), and feedback from athletes, brand ambassadors, and typical consumers. The primary goals when designing the bike were control, low weight, efficiency, and compliance.”"
9433,"The most important step toward accomplishing all those goals is centering the rider’s weight over the bottom bracket, explains Santurbane. “We understand that a woman can ride her bike differently from a man, which affects geometry and frame layup.” Women in general tend to carry their weight lower and tend to power the bike with the strength of their lower bodies, relying less on their upper bodies."
9434,"Liv tuned the Avail geometry, which is slightly different from past models, to create a bike that is quick and light yet still comfortable on long rides. The seat angle was raised 0.5 degrees to a relatively steep 74 to 75 degrees, depending on the size, which increases responsiveness and power transfer when you put the pedal down and helps avoid toe overlap on smaller frames. The head angle, however, remains a considerably slacker 70 to 72 degrees, which adds an element of stability."
9435,"
Liv’s new Integrated D-Fuse Seatpost saves weight over a traditional seatpost/seat tube junction. (Joe Lindsey)"
9436,"New to the Avail bikes are disc brakes, which the company believes are the future of road bike braking systems, as they offer superior control over rim brakes. Notably, the company was able to add discs while still shaving weight compared to the previous version of the Avail. The flagship Avail Advanced SL frame tips the scales at less than 900 grams (claimed, size small), making it the lightest bike in the lineup."
9437,"Liv kept the weight low through a series of design elements, including a hollow carbon dropout with an integrated disc-brake mount. There’s also the proprietary Integrated D-Fuse Seatpost, which is considerably lighter than a standard round seat tube/seatpost connection and allows up to 12 mm of flex to dampen road vibration."
9438,"The new Avail is available in four models with multiple component options: the carbon-fiber Avail Advanced SL ($5,150 to $8,750), Avail Advanced Pro ($3,500), and Avail Advanced ($1,750 to $2,600), as well as the aluminum Avail ($620 to $1,375) with rim brakes. All bikes in the line have compact (50/34) chainrings and a women’s saddle; stem length, handlebar width, and crankarm length, vary with frame size. “We choose which component size is best based on our target body angle for the bike,” Santurbane says. The Advanced SL and Advanced Pro models come with Giant’s new SLR 0 tubeless-compatible disc wheels."
9439,"First Ride Impressions
	At the Liv launch, I spent two days riding the top-of-line Avail Advanced SL 0. On the road, the bike was extremely efficient. The Avail responded instantly to a push of the pedals, getting up to and holding speed quickly. It was a seemingly effortless climbing machine. I never looked for an extra gear to get up a steep grade and could climb comfortably in the saddle and out. The bike did an admirable job of absorbing vibration on some seriously rough and choppy country lanes. It’s quick, yet stable through corners and is responsive without being twitchy."
9440,We’ll be putting in more miles on the Avail Advanced SL 0 on our home roads for a full review later this year.

9442,"Stylish, flattering skinny jeans that also work beautifully on the bike"
9443,"The phrase “commuter jeans” seems to describe jeans that are designed specifically for riding to and from work, and they usually include features like zippered pockets, reflective bits, and weather-resistant fabric. But jeans are for wearing all day (and night), and because of that, I’m more likely to just buy normal jeans that look and fit great, without thinking too much about how they’ll ride."
9444,"And looks were the first reason I fell in love with the Dish & Duer L2X, because—how else can I put this—these jeans are super cute. The dark wash and skinny fit means you can easily dress them up or keep it casual. I got mad compliments wearing these jeans, and they’re by far my current favorite. But, they also fit my larger thighs and calves, and worked great for riding a bike. If I had the spare funds to buy three more pairs, I would. "
9445,"It’s not an accident that the L2X turned out to be a good riding jean. While it wasn’t specifically designed for riding, it was purpose-built for an active lifestyle, including cycling. The jeans have the essential features to be very riding-friendly, while not being overbuilt with bells and whistles I don’t need when I’m just going through my day-to-day. "
9446,      RELATED: Quad-Friendly Women's Commuter Jeans
9447,"It mostly comes down to the fabric. The proprietary, 360-degree stretch denim (developed by Dish & Duer) enables a flattering, next-to-skin fit while accommodating muscular quads and calves. Dish & Duer says the pair is also designed to give you maximum mobility and range of motion, and the L2X were very comfortable to pedal in. The waistband is cut higher in the back, which kept me modest when I was pedaling around town, and lower in the front so that the jeans still looked normal when I was off the bike, without the dramatic, high-waisted look of some other made-for-riding jeans. The sloped cut also kept the waistband from being constricting in the front when I was on the bike."
9448,"The fabric is also designed to be highly breathable and wicking, quick-dry, and anti-bacterial, and to help moderate temperatures. I wore these regularly on hot, humid summer days—they were the most comfortable (least sweaty) jeans in my closet, and I could wear them out, ride a bike in them, and not just be thinking about how I couldn’t wait to get home and tear my jeans off. Yet the fabric is also durable—after eight months of being my go-to pants, the L2X is still wearing and looking great. My only criticism: The legs did start to stretch around my calves, exposing a two-inch long, thin strip of lighter, undyed denim around the seam. But it’s fairly subtle, and it hasn’t stopped me wearing the L2X.  They’re not water-resistant, but that helps keep them breathable, and the few times I have ridden them in light rain, they’ve dried fast enough for me to quickly move on from the wet weather once I was inside."
9449,"The best part? The Dish & Duer L2X comes with a reasonable price tag of $119. Sizing runs true, and it comes in two inseam options: 28 and 31. You know what, now that we’re talking about it, I just might go get myself another pair."

9460,A single ride on a Brompton proves that folding bikes can steal your heart and make commuting an anticipated part of your day
9461,"As riding for transportation gains popularity here and abroad, more commuters are turning to folding bikes to get where they need to go. There are a variety of folding-bike options, but few companies have done more to make the bikes look cooler than London-based Brompton. I tested one of its folding bikes for an outing in Washington D.C., to see how convenient a foldy made getting around town (and because they looked really fun). "
9462,RELATED: The 50 Best Cities for Bikes
9463,"To understand folding bikes you first have to ask: Why fold a bike at all? At first, to me it seemed like more of a party trick than an actual function. But when I had to stay mobile in the city, where traffic can be infuriating and finding a parking space is rarely convenient, having comfortable transportation that I could tuck away safely in a hotel or meeting room made a huge difference in the time, cost, and efficiency of travel. "
9464,"Folded, a Brompton is about the size of a large stuffed backpack—so it fits nicely under a desk or next to you on, say, a bus seat. This function is especially important for those who use multiple modes of transportation to get around (bike to train, for example). Although the bike I rode weighed about 25 pounds, when folded it felt fairly heavy to lug around. You can use the wheels attached to the rear triangle to push the bike around like a roller-bag— but varied surfaces or stairs can make this challenging. These are definitely things worth considering if there's a lots of un-bikable distance on your route."
9465,About the brand:
9466,"When it comes to setup, a folded bike can seem like an intimidating bundle of wheels and tubes. But Brompton's instructions are clear, helpful, and so easy to follow that I had it ready to ride quicker than I had expected. Every step feels fool-proof—and some are weirdly satisfying, like flinging the back wheel into place. With a little practice I whittled my setup time down to a few minutes. "
9467,"The Brompton I tested was a great example of the brand's aesthetic, painted in a rich matte orange that turned heads as I rode. Bromptons are among the more expensive folding-bike options, but can be customized with some neat features, colors, and components. This year, the company is also offering more refined handlebar shapes, improved shifter location and grips, and a variety of saddle widths for comfort. Mine came with a pump attached to the frame and Cateye integrated USB-chargeable lights, both of which I'd recommend. The steel model I tested was 1kg heavier than the Titanium model below, but also significantly cheaper at $1,695. (You can explore all the options on brompton.com.)"
9468,"Like most folding bikes, Bromptons have small 16-inch wheels and a single bar for a frame rather than a traditional triangle. The seatpost and handlebars extend what looks like an absurd distance from the wheels to create a natural-feeling riding position, but the low center of gravity means you don’t feel as top-heavy or tippy as you might expect. "
9469,RELATED: 7 Ways to Make Your Commute Easier
9470,The smaller wheels and steep head angle create a slight a sensation of oversteering—your input will turn a 16-inch wheel much faster than 29-inch one—and the front tire' smaller contact point can feel a bit like an axis until you get used to it. But after riding just a few blocks I found myself popping over little bumps and even attempting skids (old habits).
9471,"Which brings me to another important observation: Zipping through gridlocked traffic may always be a little unnerving, but this nimble folding bike made it so enjoyable that I found it hard not to smile. There’s just something about the Brompton's playful look and impressive functionality that make it totally endearing. Sure, the goal it accomplishes (getting to work, or anyplace else) is a utilitarian one, but that doesn’t mean you can’t feel like a little kid and enjoy some fresh air along the way. "
9472,An original record-holding champion fat bike gets even better
9473,"The Iditarod Trail Invitational is an epic winter race of insane proportions—demanding fat bikers navigate the historic 1,000-mile Iditarod Trail across the merciless Alaska Range from Knik to Nome, Alaska. Few even finish the feat. The original Fatback Corvus has not only piloted multiple riders to the finish line, but has set the course record. Last year the company, with an eye on changing technology and rider needs, redeveloped this snow-slaying beast to roll out an upgraded ride that brand manager John ""Fuzzy"" Mylne calls “leaps ahead of the original.”"
9474,"Who It’s For
	The intrepid fat biker who demands elite-level race performance without compromising full-adventure functionality."
9475,"What We Liked
	The best part of the Fatback Corvus is that it recognizes that it’s going to need to take care of its rider in a whole host of harsh conditions. Some of these fat biking races are held in temperatures well below zero. To help protect your hands from turning to blocks of ice, Fatback outfits the Corvus with a carbon bar and insulating ESI grips. You may need to get off your bike and push through slush and deep slop—sometimes for miles. So Fatback developed and dressed the bike with its own saddle stuffed with special foam that won’t freeze hard as a rock when your rump isn’t on it to keep it warm. The bike is also outfitted with integrated rear rack mounts and numerous “anything mounts” on the fork to allow you to carry pretty much anything on your bike, pretty much anywhere you want it, which is pretty important when you’re going to be in the backcountry for days on end."
9476,"But those are just the small touches. The revised geometry is the big story. The new Corvus was built around the brand's new carbon fiber rigid fork. The headtube is angled at 69 degrees and the fork is designed with a 150x15mm spaced front hub. This configuration allows not only for massive five-inch tire accommodation, but also allows the rider to swap out the rigid fork for a suspension fork, which vastly increases the utility—and enjoyment—of the Corvus over rough terrain in all seasons.  Fatback also kept a keen eye on the Q-angle, which can be very wide on fat bikes, resulting in a horseback riding sensation as your legs bow out a bit. Fatback uses narrower q-factor cranks, for more of a natural bike ride feel."
9477,"The company also shortened the chainstays, which is noticeable on climbs. On my first long ride after a blizzard had dumped 14 inches of icy snow, I was pedaling inside a set of massive tractor tracks when I hit a 10 percent incline. The bike didn’t flinch, slide, or spin out as I pedaled up the steep grade. Thanks to what the company claims is “the most sure-footed fat bike” design it's ever produced, it also hugged those tracks with little effort as I slalomed through an S-curve down the other side."
9478,"As a smaller rider, I fully appreciate that Fatback is the only manufacturer to produce a 14-inch carbon fat bike, which is new to the redesigned line, along with a 22-inch bike on the opposite end of the spectrum for taller riders. There are a variety of build kits to choose from in every size, including the one I tested: X01-4 Season with 1x11 gripshift."
9479,"Watch Out For…
	The super wide rear triangle allows for enormous tires and tire clearance. But riders like myself with very muscular calves may find themselves brushing against the frame in certain seated positions. I noticed this intermittently as I shifted my weight on the saddle to maintain traction in tricky snow conditions. It bothered me a little at first, but then became largely unnoticeable as I got used to it."
9480,"The Takeaway
	Fatback is a fat biker's fat bike company. They know what the hardcore will put these machines through and build these machines to withstand and win. If you’re all in forfat biking, the Corvus is all in for you—wherever and however you go."

"
9505,"After launching an overhaul of the company’s high-end Super Deluxe and Deluxe air shocks in April 2016, RockShox has followed up with a revised line of coil-spring shocks."
9506,"Like the air-sprung shocks, the new Super Deluxe Coil shocks use a “metric sizing” platform. Confusingly, metric sizing doesn’t simply refer to how the shock’s dimensions are given; pre-metric, most companies already provide their shock dimensions in millimeters. Instead—as I explained in my review of Yeti’s new SB5—it’s a redesign of the shock’s architecture: RockShox diverted from the established ratios of stroke length to eye-to-eye length (the latter being shock length from the middle of one mounting eye to the other), resulting in a longer eye-to-eye."
9507,     RELATED: The Lyrik Might Be the Best Fork RockShox Has Ever Made 
9508,"The benefits: more bushing overlap (claimed to improve stiffness, smoothness, and durability); more room for new damping and spring technologies; and the ability to design different mounting systems (which can recoup some of the metric platform’s shock-length increase)."
9509,"The bad: heavier shocks (because they’re longer overall), and metric shocks that can’t be plugged into frames designed without them in mind."
9510,"In addition to the new architecture, RockShox is bringing some options more commonly associated with air shocks to the company’s coil-spring universe: climbing switches and handlebar remotes."
9511,Here's how to set up your shock correctly in the first place:
9512,"These features quickly firm up a shock for crisper-feeling pedaling, and traditionally are more associated with lighter air-sprung shocks. But coil shocks (if installed on a bike that’s designed to ride properly with one) have some attractive advantages."
9513,"And now, a quick diversion into the (typical) differences between air and coil-sprung shocks."
9514,"Coil-spring shocks—because they don’t have the added friction of the sealing required to capture an air spring—are usually more sensitive than an air shock. Coil shocks also run cooler (again: fewer seals, less friction), and they’re more consistent when pushed hard: If an air spring gets hot enough, the spring rate will change, altering the way the shock performs. Some of the extra heat created by the air spring also transfers to the shock’s damper oil, which, in extreme cases, can affect the shock’s damping performance."
9515,     RELATED: Tested: Transition Patrol Carbon 2
9516,"Because they run cooler, and don’t have the additional seals of an air shock, coil shocks are usually more reliable and require less maintenance than an air shock. Coil shocks are also typically less expensive than an air shock. (Get the skills to tackle any bike maintenance task by reading The Bicycling Guide to Complete Bicycle Maintenance & Repair.)"
9517,"So, coil shocks have a lot of advantages. Air shocks have advantages too: They’re significantly lighter, and an air spring’s spring rate can be tuned more finely—fractions of PSI with a digital air pump, versus coil springs, which RockShox offers from 350 to 650 pounds in 50lb increments."
9518,"By adding remote lockout and climbing switches to a coil shock, RockShox is providing riders with the combination of a coil-spring shock’s sensitivity, consistency, and reliability, with an air-shock’s ability to quickly dial up a firm pedaling feel. Not everyone will want that, but I think enduro racers and gravity-centric riders who like to earn their turns will be excited to have the option. "
9519,"Though not as flashy as a switch or remote, the new sag gradients etched onto the Super Deluxe Coil’s shock shaft are a welcome feature because they will help the rider dial in proper sag (though they won’t be as easy to read as the gradients on RockShox air-sprung shocks). "
9520,The Super Deluxe Coil will be offered in four models:
9521,"• Super Deluxe Coil RCT with open/pedal threshold lever (AKA climbing switch) on the shock body and externally adjustable low speed compression (for open mode)
	• Super Deluxe Coil RT Remote with handlebar remote for toggling between open and pedal modes
	• Super Deluxe Coil RC World Cup for downhill racing bikes with external rebound and low speed compression adjustments. RockShox’s documentation calls it is the metric replacement for the company’s Vivid shock.
	• Super Deluxe Coil R is the simplest (least expensive) model. The only external damping adjustment is rebound."
9522,"So far, RockShox has only indicated that the above Super Deluxe Coil models will be available to OEMs (in three mount options: trunnion, eyelet with DU bushings, and “bearing mount”). Aftermarket options will be announced later."
9523,"In addition to the new Super Deluxe Coil, RockShox rolled out a few updates to its Super Deluxe and Deluxe air shocks."
9524,Super Deluxe Air Features:
9525,"• Added an etched line to the shaft which marks the shock’s full stroke
	• New RCT model with open/pedal threshold lever, and externally adjustable low speed compression (for open mode)

	• New RC World Cup model with external rebound and low speed compression adjustments. It’s a metric sized Vivid Air: an air shock for downhill race bikes."

9639,You deserve a 29er this good
9640,"Back in April, Santa Cruz released the new version of its Tallboy and Juliana Joplin platforms. We ran through all the updates when the bikes were announced, but here’s the TL;DR version:"
9641,"Still (mostly) the same: The Tallboy and Joplin share identical, updated frames. The Joplin has a women’s saddle, and the shock is tuned for lighter riders.More versatile: Both are sold in either a 29er or 27.5+ configuration; the frame has a flip chip that allows you to swap the geometry for each setup.More travel: The travel was increased to 110mm rear, in the 120mm front (130mm fork in 27.5+ setup). Longer: The reach increased by 40 to 50mm, depending on the size (the chainstays got shorter). Lower: The standover height is now 10 to 30mm lower, depending on size. Slacker: The head tube went from about 70 to 68 degrees. Better suspension: Rear wheel suspension is now more sensitive, supportive, and difficult to bottom out. In front, the bike gets a burlier Fox 34 fork. Drop it! All builds now come with RockShox Reverb Stealth droppers, ’cause it’s more fun if you can drop it. More purple: The Joplin's color is called Ultraviolet. "
9642,     RELATED: First Look: Santa Cruz's New Tallboy 
9643,Now let’s talk about how it rides. 
9644,"Let’s just come out and say it: This bike is rad. The Joplin takes everything that’s good about 29ers and amplifies those qualities, while fixing some of the issues some riders have had with 29ers in the past. "
9645,"The first thing that impressed me was the rollover. The efficacy with which the bike crawls over tangled piles of roots and skips over stepstool-high boulders is exceptional, and it’s not just the big wheels. The Joplin is no monster-truck; it has excellent traction and a very loftable, precise-handling front end that almost wouldn’t be out of place on an XC bike. On our rocky and technical Pennsylvania trails, bikes with a 68-degree head tube angle seem to strike the sweet balance between enabling confident descending, while maintaining the ability to aim and shoot predictably, and the Joplin fits that bill. In slow, technical terrain, this 29er proved to be nimble and maneuverable—yes, you just read “29er,” “nimble,” and “maneuverable” in the same sentence—slipping around and over hazards with agility and ease. Tight switchbacks were also no problem—the difference between this bike and my personal bike (the 27.5-inch Yeti SB5c) felt immaterial. This is thanks in part to the Joplin’s relatively short wheelbase for a 29er: just 43.9 inches in a size small. (For reference, compare this to the SB5c’s 44.5-inch wheelbase in a size small. Even after compensating for the extra 1.5-inch in wheel size on the Joplin, the two end up close enough in length that the 29er wasn’t noticeably harder to muscle around a sharp corner.)"
9646,"With the light carbon Enve wheels, climbing is a joy. Even if you forego that $2,000 upgrade, VPP is a firm pedaling platform, and the new geometry further helps you make watts with a steeper seat angle that puts you in a more efficient pedaling position. "
9647,"On long straightaways, it hauls ass so quick that it’s almost frightening, but that emotion quickly turns to exhilaration once you realize how stable it feels."
9648,"What’s new with the suspension is a sense of added plushness in the rear. Compared to the latest Roubion and Furtado, both of which I’ve ridden extensively, I noticed a little extra forgiveness in slower speed, rougher terrain, and even going over obstacles on climbs, where the VPP suspension has felt firmer in the past. Yet the suspension stayed supportive enough that it didn’t sink through or wallow in bigger holes or dips. Part of this may be the shock tune—the Joplin is Juliana’s first bike that incorporates a shock tuned for lighter riders, and brand manager Katie Zaffke had told us that plushness was a targeted quality."
9649,"On descents, it becomes clear that the Joplin was designed to slay the fast, flow-state stoking trails so common to the mountains out west. On long straightaways, it hauls ass so quick that it’s frankly almost frightening—an emotion that quickly turns to exhilaration once you realize how stable this bike feels. Again, it’s not just the big wheels here—even for riders accustomed to riding 29ers, the feeling of speed was noticeable. Part of the update to the VPP suspension aimed for better small-bump compliance, and the bike floats over chunder very well, so that it maintains and builds momentum. And it’s not just a sensation: I uploaded one test ride from a popular local trail and took three Strava QOMs. That doesn’t happen every day. Cornering was also very good, thanks in part to the grippy 2.3-inch Maxxis Minion DHF Exo tire in the front, paired to a 2.35-inch Maxxis Ardent Race Exo in the back. Flat, fast cornering is a weakness of mine, but with these tires, I could lean the bike over harder and take turns faster than usual."
9650,
9651,
9652,"Like the Tallboy, the Joplin is sold in either 27.5+ or 29er configurations, and if you buy the second set of wheels and another fork (the plus-size setup requires a 130mm fork for the best handling, the 29er version rides best with a 120mm-travel fork), you can swap between the two. "
9653,"You get all the best aspects of the big wheels, and the fun factor of a smaller bike."
9654,"In the plus setup, the Joplin is $6,499 with SRAM X01 and 2.8-inch-wide Maxxis Rekons on Easton’s alloy ARC 40 rims. Set up as a plus bike, the Joplin rode surprisingly similarly to the 29er version. Though the bike felt slightly little heftier on climbs (but that’s compared to the 29er with Enve wheels), it still rolled respectably light and quick—certainly good for a trail bike even on normal-width trail tires. The added traction on climbs was subtler than I’ve experienced on plus bikes with three-inch-wide tires, but most definitely there: Quick bursts of power would boost me up to faster riders with what felt like less energy than usual; I cleaned one tricky, rocky uphill that’s always greasy and muddy with more ease, and the extra rubber even provided some added forgiveness in rougher downhills, making the Joplin feel slightly more settled in the type of mid- to high-speed chunky terrain that had jarred it a bit as a 29er. What you give up: The slightest smidge of handling precision, though I was very impressed by how little that was. I’ve ridden another plus model that had 2.8-inch tires, too, and constantly felt like I had to guess where my rear tire would end up. On the Joplin, those sidewall scrapes on the back end happened very rarely when I had to slip through tight gaps between obstacles. And I felt like a superhero crawling over boulders and grinding up rough steeps."
9655,"Plus or 29er? It simply depends on your preference. If I had to pick one, I’d choose 29, but that’s because I think this bike really shines in its sharp handling, and while the plus setup maintains an impressive amount of this characteristic, it doesn’t showcase it to its fullest. But if you prize a little extra forgiveness and technical climbing help, the plus setup wins."
9656,"In the past, I’ve preferred 27.5 bikes for trail riding, but the Joplin is making me seriously reconsider this. On this bike, you get all the best aspects of the big wheels, and the fun factor of a smaller bike. For now, it comes with a price: Though Santa Cruz does have a mid-tier grade of carbon, the Joplin is currently only available in the top-end CC carbon frame. The Joplin CC that we tested, built with SRAM XX1 and the Enve carbon wheels upgrade ($2,000 extra) runs $9,799; the lowest-priced option (with X01 and alloy rims), is $6,499. But in the past, the company has brought bikes down to the C grade carbon level with lower-priced parts, and I would expect it to do the same eventually with this platform. And that’s great news, because more riders deserve to try a trail bike this good."

9725,"From its inception, Trek’s Domane was designed for the rough stuff. But perhaps because of the Domane’s history as a bike made to win Classics like Paris-Roubaix, Trek found that most buyers still thought of the Domane as a road bike for paved roads."
9726,Check out these mountain bike skills for loose gravel riding:
9727,"So with a couple of component tweaks and some new model names, Trek is making it clear: take this bike off the tarmac. Please. To get the message across, Trek this week launched three new Gravel variants of popular Domane models, ranging in price from $1,800 to over $6,000."
9728,"The new models are largely similar to their “mainline” disc-brake companions. In the case of the top offering, the Domane SLR 6 Gravel, the only difference to the Domane SLR 6 Disc is the tire spec, which goes from 32mm Bontrager slicks to 35mm Schwalbe G-One tires, with a low-profile pebble tread."
9729,
9730,
9731,"That, says Trek’s Tony Lemke, is part of the point. “We wanted to draw attention to the fact that the Domane can be set up as a super capable gravel bike,” says Lemke, who is the Assistant Road Product Marketing Manager. So the Domane Gravel versions share the exact same frames and geometries as their regular Domane disc counterparts; they simply make use of the bike’s spacious tire clearance, which goes up to 35mm (less with fenders, depending on the fender brand and type)."
9732,"You won’t find the SLR 6 Gravel in the main Trek lineup; it’s available only through Trek’s semi-custom Project One program, where buyers can customize paint, personalization and parts kits. And the other three Domane models offered through Project One—the Domane SLR 6 Disc Women’s, SLR 8 Disc and SLR 9 Disc—can also get the gravel tire treatment if you want. The SLR 6 Gravel starts at $6,000."
9733,RELATED: First Look: Trek Domane SLR
9734,"For stock bikes, there are two options: the $2,500 Domane SL 5 Gravel and the $1,790 Domane ALR 5 Gravel. These two bikes feature a few other parts tweaks from the mainline versions that are small but worth noting when you’re making a buying decision."
9735,"The ALR 5 Gravel features the aluminum Domane frame, which has the rear IsoSpeed decoupler for smoothing the ride, but not the front decoupler that’s only found on some carbon models. The Gravel variant is $100 less expensive than the mainline ALR 5 Disc, but aside from the tire swap, it uses Tektro cable-activated disc brakes instead of Shimano RS505 hydraulic versions. Lemke said that Trek wanted a slightly lower-price option. Our pick if you want gravel? Honestly, go with the ALR 5 Disc and swap the tires; the hydraulic brakes are worth the extra $100. (Whether you're making tweaks or repairs, our custom Silca HX-One toolkit has you covered.)"
9736,"The sweetest spot might be the SL 5 Gravel, though. For $2,500, you get a 500 Series carbon frame with front and rear IsoSpeed decouplers and a full Shimano 105 drivetrain. But where the standard SL 5 Disc uses 105-level (non-series) shifters and hydraulic brake calipers, the SL 5 Gravel gets Ultegra-level (non-series) shifters and calipers. It’s a solid upgrade, and Lemke confirmed both versions are the same price even with the different shifter/brake spec. The only other difference is the tires. Here, we’d opt for the SL 5 Gravel for the free shifter/caliper upgrade."
9737,RELATED: Editors' Choice: Trek Domane 6.9 Disc
9738,"We’re noted fans of the Domane; a previous version was an Editors' Choice winner. And we were fans of the redesigned version with front IsoSpeed. It’s a remarkably well-rounded bike, capable of road racing, but also for lighter gravel duty. That was always a possibility, but up to now, Trek had always hedged a bit on its range (officially, tire clearance had been listed at 32mm, even as Trek allowed it to fit wider rubber). Now, Trek’s thrown that conservative call out the window and fully embraces the Domane as an all-road bike with clearance for fatter knobbies. All of the new Gravel variants are available immediately. "

Here's good news if you wear glasses: Advances in lens design have led to an abundance of corrective-eyewear choices. Now, only the strongest prescriptions require lens inserts, which can limit frame options. Look for lightweight, fog-resistant, full-wrap models. Check to see if your optometrist carries sport-specific eyewear, or shop online—Rudy Project has a robust web store, and third-party vendors like SportRx offer more choices from Oakley, Smith, and other brands.Find the Right Fit
If you ride mostly on the road, select a frame that sits higher on your face so you look through the lens—not over it—while in the drops. A poor fit can cause you to crane your neck, compromising comfort. Mountain bikers should look for grippy rubber pads on the stems and a nosepiece that will prevent the glasses from sliding during bumpy rides.Consider Your Tint
You want a lens color that provides a lot of contrast, says Rob Tavakoli, from SportRx. ""Stay away from a gray tint—the road is gray, the potholes are gray, the sky can be gray,"" he says. Instead try amber, rose, or brown.Key Lens Features1. Photochromic: These chameleon-like lenses change their tint to match varying light conditions—going from nearly clear to very dark. They work well for commuting, 24-hour races, and early-morning and sunset rides.2. Polarized: A filter applied to the lens helps reduce glare from the road and other reflective surfaces.3. Progressive: If you wear bifocals or ""readers"" to help you see objects up close, consider progressive lenses. Not everyone needs them for cycling, but they can make roadside repairs easier if you have presbyopia, common in people older than 40."

A pair of elastic back pockets and two more on the waist belt offer some storage, even when you’re not using the cargo pack.

It’s also lighter, more aerodynamic (saving 2 watts at 45kph, says Canyon), and the two smallest sizes sport 650b wheels. Canyon says this allows the smaller bikes to have similar geometries—and thus handling—as larger sizes."

Both these models can simulate up to a 20 percent grade, with 2,000 watts of power output, while the Direto maxes out at a 14 percent slope and 1,400 watts.

On the top-tier Pro model I tested, the 1x-specific carbon frame includes a carbon swingarm and upper rocker link (both pieces were aluminum before), saving weight and increasing stiffness. The Maestro suspension design now has a lower leverage ratio and less travel, yielding a firm-feeling suspension that tends to move only on bumps that are too big for the tires to handle or ones that actually disrupt your pedaling. Because it “saves” the suspension for impacts that really matter, the 90mm of travel feel more like 100mm. This model also comes with a handlebar-mounted lockout for both the fork and shock."

Reach grew while stack shrank, for a noticeably more aggressive rider position. A shorter stem and 780mm-wide bar complement the longer reach.

According to Giro, this brings the Vanquish within 13 percent of the aerodynamic savings of Giro’s Aerohead TT helmet, and beats Giro’s Synthe road race helmet by 13 percent and its Air Attack track helmet by 7 percent. Deploying the shield bumps these last two numbers up by 2 percent. The helmet also features two densities of EPS foam (most cycling helmets have just one). Giro can’t legally say this better protects against impacts, but that’s the goal."

There’s a strong focus on practicality and versatility, with external cable routing for easy maintenance (yay!) and a full suite of rack and fender mounts (even on the carbon fork) as well as a third bottle-cage mount and top-tube mounts for a storage bag. It’s sold frame-only or complete in either wheel size. There’s little for which this bike can’t be outfitted: touring, adventure rides, or gravel racing."

9831,"We’ve always loved titanium for its road feel; it can be engineered to be stiff or springy. Our one complaint with this bike is that ride quality on rougher surfaces isn’t balanced front to back. The front end does a good job absorbing bumps and jolts from rocks and washboards, but the back rides a bit harsh. That may be because, where many brands use a smaller-diameter seat tube and 27.2mm post, Litespeed chose a larger tube and post that offer less flex.

The lower link slides—it’s effectively a shock with no internals.

Marin also claims better traction, better pedaling, etc. The usual."
9841,But the ride is captivating.
9842,"On paper the Wolf Ridge looks like a big-wheeled, long-travel enduro bike. But it’s a lot more efficient, lively, quick, and easy-steering than almost all 160mm-travel 29ers, so it rides more like an everyday trail bike. It’s also one of the best climbing bikes of its class that we’ve ridden."
9843,"While a lot of big-travel 29ers feel stuck to the ground, this one has pop, so you flick and loft it down the trail rather than point and plow. Stiffness is good, and the rear center is short enough to make it easy to pivot through switchbacks and float the front end. Testers, however, did find the front-center slightly short."

The Mavic system is the first for road use on which I could install and remove tires without using levers, and the lip holds the tire so well I didn’t need a compressor to inflate it. The tires have a 127tpi casing that rolls fast (perhaps due to the lower friction from forgoing a tube), and the tread has decent grip. Ride quality beats past road tubeless tires we’ve tried but still doesn’t match high-quality clinchers. If you experience lots of flats caused by debris, this system might be your solution.

It borrows design cues and tube shapes from Pinarello’s Bolide TT bike to smooth air over the frame, and shapes the down tube to shield the water bottle from the wind. Furthering that agenda, the Di2 junction box moves from a clunky position under the stem to an integrated placement inside the down tube.

9893,"Key to the bike’s versatility: fat 38mm tires (with clearance for up to 42mm) and other bump-damping features like the Future Shock suspension spring in the steerer tube with 20mm of travel. The women’s Diverge has female-friendly touchpoints (saddle, narrower handlebar, shorter crankarms) but its geometry is the same as the unisex model­­. The frame has a lower bottom bracket, slacker head angle, and shorter chainstays compared with the previous model, and handling felt stable and predictable—even when the terrain wasn’t. When things got sketchy, the hydraulic disc brakes offered reliable control. The bike rode quicker than I expected: The 48/32 crankset and 11-32 cassette let me spin up steep pitches, and the front suspension kept the tires glued to the road, so I could drill the descents."
9894,"Fender and rack mounts make the Diverge truly adventure-ready—and did I mention you can swap in 650b wheels with clearance for 47mm tires, plus add a dropper post? However you set this bike up, you’ll likely get into some mischief. So pack extra snacks. And don’t forget the bug spray. —Leah Flickinger"

9912,"In designing the bike, engineers analyzed hundreds of tube-shape variations, wall thicknesses, and carbon layups, honing in on areas where they could pare weight from the already feathery, first-generation Émonda. But they also added details to get to the balanced ride qualities they were looking for."
9913,"The end result amazed me. The Émonda SLR 9 is up there with the best bikes I’ve ridden. It has clearance for up to 30mm tires and a comfort that belies its light weight. It’s never noodly or whippy. It sprints like a dream, and on climbs it propels you skyward with incredible efficiency. But most telling is how well it descends. During one of my first rides on the Émonda, I dropped down a choppy road littered with frost heaves and limited sight lines. I was still feeling the bike out and riding conservatively. When we got to the bottom, one of my ride partners claimed we hit 55mph. I laughed. No way we were over 40. Looking back on the file, I saw that he was right. When a bike this light descends so fast with that much control, it’s magic. The new Émonda may have reset the bar for the ratio of weight to ride quality. —Mike Yozell"

9917,"This lightweight, lace-up, carbon-soled mountain bike shoe is just $200"
9918,"If you like the look, feel, and micro-adjustability of lace-up cycling shoes, you'll be happy to know that they're starting to trickle down below the “super-bling” tier of pricing this year. Scott’s MTB RC Lace Shoe is a new trail offering for 2017 that packs a good value for $200."
9919,"The sole is full carbon—many shoes at this price use a sole that combine a carbon fiber plate with an outsole made of other materials—and the exposed portion around the cleat is specifically woven to stand up to rock strikes and general trail abuse. Shoe manufacturers rate sole stiffness according to their own scales. “A stiffness of 10 is our highest level, and is designed to resist flex under the force or power that a professional cyclist generates at maximum power,” explained Luke Fryer, footwear designer at Scott, via email. At a stiffness of 9, the RC MTB Lace shoe is 10 percent less stiff than this. "
9920,"Scott says the MTB RC Lace is aimed at racier off-road riding—XC, cyclocross, endurance rides, and gravel. But it provides more coverage than a typical XC shoe, and that’s why it falls in a sweet spot to me. I like to bang around on rougher trails, but I don’t usually shy away from a climb, either, so I’m not a fan of pedaling in overbuilt, enduro-style shoes. For its price, the RC Lace MTB is respectably light, and has a very efficient pedaling feel. But the microfiber upper and reinforcement around the toe box are robust enough to provide added protection from rocks and other trail hazards. It’s efficient enough to race or ride fast in, but tough enough for trail riding, too: Basically, an excellent, everyday, lightweight trail shoe."
9921,     RELATED: The 11 Coolest Mountain Bike Shoes for 2017
9922,"The shoe is also very comfortable, with a roomier toe box than average. The asymmetric lacing gives the shoe a unique aesthetic, but Scott says that its actual purpose is to reduce pressure points by pulling the two sides of the shoe together “in the same plane or slope from the big toe metetarsal down to the little toe metatarsal.” I can’t say whether it’s the lacing or not, but I did wear the shoe right out of the box for eight days straight during our annual mountain bike testing trip, and never felt pain or hot spots. "
9923,"A weakness of all lace closures is that midride adjustments are slightly less convenient than they would be with a Boa or ratchet closure. Scott says its laces use a polyester nylon blend that maintains high tensile strength even when wet, and that the eyelets are designed to maintain friction and help hold tension. I noticed this about the eyelets—compared to some lace-up shoes, these were pretty sticky. This is good once everything is tensioned correctly, but if I didn't take the extra couple seconds to make sure I pulled the laces taut all the way through their length, sometimes I wouldn’t have the shoe tied tight enough the first time, leading me to have to adjust later on. But once I figured that out, a little extra attention was what I needed to get it right on the first go and leave them alone the rest of my ride."
9924,"A couple other nice touches: The tread uses Scott’s Sticki rubber compound, and provided good grip for walking and finding purchase on slippery rocks. And like Scott’s other RC shoes, the tongue features a soft, padded upper edge to help reduce the chance of chafing and rubbing. The shoe has an elastic lace keeper. Of the several pairs of test shoe sitting in the basement—including more expensive pairs—the RC MTB Lace is already becoming my go-to for its comfort, performance, and reliability. And of course, its good looks too."
9925,New models include MIPS and ICEdot safety technology
9926,"These days, helmet advances go beyond aerodynamics and ever-increasing numbers of vents. Bell and Giro recently announced that they’ll be integrating the latest helmet-safety technology into their new 2015 helmet models."
9927,"The Multi-directional Impact Protection System (MIPS) will be incorporated into both Bell and Giro new helmets. This system allows the hard shell and the liner to move separately in a crash, which could reduce a cyclist’s risk of concussion by decreasing the brain’s rotational acceleration."
9928,Giro will institute MIPS technology on five new models set to roll out in late fall. The Sutton MIPS ($100) is an urban rider’s helmet with a detachable light clip and a soft leather visor. The $95 Feature (men’s) and Feather (women’s) XC models women offer more coverage than traditional cross-country helmets and include channeled vents to keep you cool. The $100 Safant (men’s) and Sonnet (women’s) are lightweight road helmets with 25 vents and a rainbow of colors to chose from.
9929,"Bell is also adding ICEdot sensor technology to its Super 2 and Super2r model mountain bike helmets ($200), Star Pro road helmet ($240), and Full Flex action sports helmet ($100). Mounted at the rear of the helmet, the sensor can detect an impact that creates enough force to cause a concussion.

9939,"Perhaps one of the biggest innovations in mountain biking in the last couple years, dropper seatposts now come on most new mountain bikes. These handy telescoping posts lower your seat with the touch of a button, letting you “drop” your center of gravity on the fly."
9940,           RELATED: Shred Harder on the 2016 Editors' Choice Mountain Bikes
9941,"They might seem fairly straightforward, but dropper posts, like any new tech, can be a bit tricky to master. If you have one, you're probably already using your dropper post to get your seat out of your way in tight sections and steep descents—but this humble component has so much more to offer! Get in the habit of using it, and you'll be dropping and raising your saddle hundreds of times on a ride. Here are some hints to help you make the most out of your dropper. "
9942,The Basics:
9943,"Drops: A lower center of gravity improves stability on the bike by keeping your mass where it'll move the least. Picture a wine glass vs a coffee mug—one will tip over easily; the other will shred that drop. Plus, with your seat out of the way, you'll have more room to absorb the impact as you land. "
9944,"Steep descents: With a lower seat, you can move your hips lower and back over your rear wheel, transferring your weight over your rear hub. This will keep you from tipping over the bars when things get spicy. "
9945,"Sweeping turns: Remember the wine glass analogy? It works in turns too. Lowering that center of gravity extends your contact patch with the ground by distributing your weight more evenly between your wheels, which in turn lets you take wide, fast turns without sacrificing speed. "
9946,"Tight turns: With your seat out of the way, you'll be able to lean the bike over much further, letting you carve and dip with greater agility. "
9947,     Related: The Ultimate Mountain Bike Cheat Sheet
9948,Got it? Good. Now Try:
9949,"Climbing: It might seem counterintuitive to lower your seat to climb, but try it in rough terrain. Often you're standing anyway, and you'll find you can absorb bumps better with the seat lowered, which can help improve traction. "
9950,"Fallen Logs: A lowered seat won't jolt you forward when your back wheel comes up and over the log, minimizing your chance of an endo. "
9951,Wheelies: You'll be able to center your weight over your back wheel and manual for days. 
9952,Step ups: You'll have more room to suck your legs and back wheel up and over the obstacle once your front wheel is clear. 
9953,"Jumps: With your seat dropped, you can stay centered in the air instead of being forced behind the seat, which can shorten your trajectory by pushing your back wheel down too early. "
9954,Stopping: Simply lower your seat and you can sit with both feet comfortably on the ground! 
9955,"Storage/travel: Any time you need to make your bike a little smaller to fit on a bike rack or in a closet, a dropper seat post can help. "
9956,On the road/cyclocross: Mountain bikers aren't the only ones drinking the Kool-aid; we're increasingly seeing dropper posts across disciplines for many of the same reasons they work on the trail. 
9957,Mount It Right:
9958,"To get the most out of your post, adjust the handlebar-mounted remote trigger so it's easy to reach with your thumb. To do this, loosen the trigger clamp and move it into the position that allows you to toggle it without removing or unwrapping your hand from the bar. You should be able to drop your seat with about the same effort as it takes to shift gears. Once you get it in the right spot, tighten it to the correct torque."

9984,"The all new Contend
	The Contend is very reminiscent of an existing Giant platform. The Defy seems to offer many of the same features as the Contend, to be targeted at the same rider, and sells, when similarly built, for about the same price. The biggest, most obvious differences on paper are that the Contend has internal cable routing, and one-centimeter shorter chainstays (which also shrinks the Contend's wheelbase 1cm)."
9985,I reached out to Giant’s global senior product marketing manager Andrew Juskaitis for more information.
9986,"“Given last year, if you were to look at our global product line when it came to road, I think we had almost thirty different frames in the global lineup. There were just too many frames floating around. We needed to consolidate, and one way to do that was to create the bike of the future, hitting a very considered price point with Contend. [With Contend] we cherry-picked what we felt would be the geometry for this more entry-level rider. We really did rely on Defy geometry for the lion's share of it, but we tweaked it as you can see through the numbers to be appropriate for that more entry-level road rider. [Contend] has become our core platform, and has really cut down on the SKU count when it comes to our global lineup, so that we’re able to build a bike that should work for most people at a price that’s just outstanding,” Juskaitis said."
9987,"Juskaitis confirmed “many” lower-priced Defy models will go away for 2017—including the $920 Defy 3, a two-time Editors’ Choice winner—and will be replaced by a slimmer line of Contend models. Higher-end carbon Defy models will remain in the line for 2017."
9988,"2017 Giant Contend models
	The Contend SL Disc sits atop the range of this new platform. It is built with an aluminum frame—made of Giant’s premier ALUXX SL aluminum—and a carbon-legged fork with hybrid composite/alloy steerer. The frame uses some of Giant’s trademarked technologies, including the rectangular Megadrive downtube, PowerCore press-fit 86 bottom bracket, and D-Fuse seatpost, which is D-shaped to improve vibration damping and vertical compliance. Like the higher-end TCR Disc frames, the Contend SL Disc accepts flat-mount disc calipers. Unlike the TCR Disc models, the Contend SL disc has rack and fender mounts.

	The TCR Advanced SL is quite simply a brilliant bike, and one of the best race platforms of, at least, the past decade.

	Topping the TCR Disc range is the TCR Advanced SL 0 Disc ($8,250). Like the Editors’ Choice-winning TCR Advanced SL 0 (rim brake, $8,800), the Disc variant uses Giant’s most-premium-grade carbon composites, and an integrated seat mast."
10002,"With a few exceptions, the frame design of the Disc model is largely the same as the rim version. The Disc receives thru axles (12x100 front and 12x42mm rear), the flat mount disc caliper mount standard, but is otherwise similar."
10003,"The front disc hose is externally routed: The TCR is a light-weight race platform, and Juskaitis stated they didn’t want to take the weight penalty a (he admitted) sleeker -looking, internally-routed hose required: “Punching a hole in the fork looks good, but boy-almighty does it take a lot of material. Any time you punch a hole in something, you need to reinforce the hole. We just weren’t willing to pay the weight penalty to make it super-sano like that.”"
10004,The rear hose enters the downtube near the head tube and pops out of the chainstay a few centimeters in front of the caliper mount.
10005,"Even the geometry is identical, right down to the 405mm chainstays—surprising, because most companies stretch the chainstays, or make other accommodations, to maintain the chainline with a disc hub’s 135mm rear axle spacing (rim-brake wheels use 130mm spacing). Four sizes are offered: small, medium, medium/large, and large."

Currently, the specs state that, though equipped with SRAM brakes, the disc rotors are 140mm Shimano RT99 Ice-Tech for Centerlock.

10019,"The Messenger series of Kryptonite bike locks offers lightweight, simple security for frame and wheels
"
10020,"A U-lock is a great first line of defense against bike theft, but you’re often forced to make a choice: Pick a bulky, heavy lock with a longer shackle to secure the frame and a wheel, or go with a smaller, lighter version, but add a cable to secure your wheels."
10021,"The newest lock from bike security stalwart Kryptonite, the Messenger Mini+, does all that in a single, compact lock. The main body of the Mini is now a little longer and wider than the old version, so it’s more versatile in terms of what you can lock your bike to. The 11mm shackle is thinner, but is made of a harder steel, so Kryptonite rates it as the same security level—7 out of 10."
10022,"But the real genius is the integrated secondary shackle. Pass the secondary loop through your front or rear wheel, then slide the main shackle through the eyeholes and lock your bike as normal. The secondary shackle adds weight, but it folds over on the main body for compact storage. It’s an elegant, simple solution that makes you wonder why no one else thought of it until now."
10023,"As part of its Messenger collection, Kryptonite also showed a deceptively simple wheel security system, called Wheelnutz, which replaces conventional axle locknuts (it’s not compatible with quick-release systems). The nut features a toothed interchange to the washer. Tighten down as normal, and a simple gravity pin slides into place. The only way to release the pin and loosen the wheel is to flip the bike upside down. But a thief can’t, because the bike is also locked to a rack or post."
10024,"

At just 667 grams for a size 56cm frame with all its hardware and 277 grams for its fork, the RCA is one of the world’s lightest bicycles. But as feathery as the RCA is, its low weight isn’t the most impressive part—its ride is. Many would expect a bike this light to feel wispy or fragile but it’s not true. Not only does the Cervelo ride smoothly and quietly by race bike standards, but it also has the backbone to withstand hard-charging efforts. All this awesomeness is handcrafted in Cervelo’s Southern California facility: Compared to the R5, this frame takes twice as many carbon plies to lay up and 5 to 8 times as long to make. A bike this exotic comes with a price tag to match—but if you can afford it, one ride is all it takes to almost justify it. —Ron Koch"

At just 667 grams for a size 56cm frame with all its hardware and 277 grams for its fork, the RCA is one of the world’s lightest bicycles. But as feathery as the RCA is, its low weight isn’t the most impressive part—its ride is. Many would expect a bike this light to feel wispy or fragile but it’s not true. Not only does the Cervelo ride smoothly and quietly by race bike standards, but it also has the backbone to withstand hard-charging efforts. All this awesomeness is handcrafted in Cervelo’s Southern California facility: Compared to the R5, this frame takes twice as many carbon plies to lay up and 5 to 8 times as long to make. A bike this exotic comes with a price tag to match—but if you can afford it, one ride is all it takes to almost justify it. —Ron Koch"

It’s hard to believe that just 20mm of handlebar and stem travel can create such an acutely smooth ride, but it makes things like cattle guards practically disappear. The back of the bike may not ride with quite the same isolation, but it’s still really smooth. Specialized gives the new frame sharper-handling geometry and a carbon build that, without the Future Shock assembly, is as light or lighter than a Tarmac.

And when the batteries tanked, it wasn’t a chore to ride it around like it can be with some other bikes of equal capability. It has integrated lights, solid mount points for cargo, and a dedicated rack on the front that added to the balance of the bike and helped distribute loads when carrying heavy stuff.

"
10382,"The Buffalo Bicycle—a $134 steel workhorse—has saved or materially improved the lives of 190,000 people in developing countries who don't have access to transportation. Few other bikes can claim to have such a positive impact on so many.
The nearly indestructible bikes are distributed by World Bicycle Relief, a nonprofit arm of component-maker SRAM, to the rural poor in a dozen African nations. The organization donates most of the bikes to aid workers and school children, many of whom walk 10 miles or more to class each day. The bikes also can be bought by rural farmers and entrepreneurs, often using micro-loans, who can load them with up to 200 pounds of milk and other products. This allows them to carry more goods to market—and earn more money—than if they had to walk. In Zambia, which has one of the world's highest incidence of AIDS, health-care workers ride them to reach many more patients than they could if they traveled by foot.
Each bike is designed to withstand five years of hard use on Africa's sunbaked, washboard roads. ""Our bikes are extremely durable and much tougher than other bikes we see in developing countries,"" says Charles Coustan, WBR's executive director. There's also an elegance to them befitting their noble mission--the tight curve of the chrome bars, the twin top tubes, the sharply sloping seat tube remind us of old British touring models. And this makes us love the Buffalo Bike even more.

10383,"Yes, you can wear headphones while you ride. Here’s how to do it safely, along with the best options—whether you’re on the bike or in the gym."
10384,"The world is now wireless and there’s no reason listening to your tunes shouldn’t benefit from advances in wireless tech. While riding in traffic with headphones can still be dangerous, new models allow more ambient sound or even use bone-conducting technology (the “buds” go on your temples, not in your ear canal), so you can hear more of what’s happening around you. That makes them good options for mountain biking, bike paths, and gravel roads in addition to using them on  your trainer or in the gym. Plus, as earbud tech improves, the options for cycling are getting more durable and sweatproof, and coming with longer-lasting batteries, all while prices are falling."
10385,"Every pair of wireless earbuds and headphones on this list has been thoroughly evaluated and vetted by our team of test editors. We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and engineers, and use our own experience with these devices to determine the best options. We’ve evaluated them on sound quality, price, comfort, and reliability to come up with this list of wireless earbuds and headphones that will best serve the needs of cyclists looking to (safely) add audio to their ride or strength training session. "
10386,"The latest (and most expensive) wireless audio devices are totally wireless earbuds, meaning two self-contained buds attach to each ear, no cords in between. Models like the Jaybird Run and Jabra Elite Active 65t balance absolute freedom with reasonable battery life and impressive sound quality, but they’re admittedly on the pricier side of the market. If you’re considering them for outdoor use, make sure they fit great. If they fall out on a ride, they’ll be difficult to find on a path littered with leaves."
10387,"Your other options are models that have a cord or neckband that connects the buds and holds a battery and sometimes a microphone. These options are economical too, and models like the JBL Reflect Mini BT cost about half as much as totally wireless options. Full-size cans that cover your whole ear are a good option for the trainer or hitting the gym. Wireless headphones like those from Jays and Plantronics offer superior sound quality and battery life (with a little extra bulk) than bud-style options. "
10388,"One of the best and most unique options for cyclists is the Aftershokz Trekz Air, which uses bone-conducting tech to deliver sound. Instead of placing a bud in your ear canal, the headphones rest on your temples and vibrations travel through your bone into your ear. Incredibly, the sound is clear yet your ears are open to let in ambient sound, so you can hear honking horns, approaching cyclists, or your riding buddy asking you to ease the pace. "
10389,"While sound quality is largely subjective, a couple basic rules exist. For one, high-quality sound in a device the size of your thumb doesn’t come cheap—reviewers across the internet laud the $200 Bose SoundSport Free wireless earbuds for its balanced sound. The Skullcandy Ink’d Bluetooth costs just $40. These won’t necessarily do justice to Beethoven or Bach, but they’re tuned bass-heavy to compensate for smaller drivers (the vibrating component that creates sound). For a cleaner bass, though, you’ll want to bump up the driver size and go for over-ear headphones; models like the Plantronics Backbeat FIT 500 can deliver great sound for less money than comparable wireless earbuds."
10390,"A set of dead wireless headphones can make you wish you kept the cords, so a lasting and predictable battery life is crucial. Over-ear headphones have the most longevity, simply because they can accommodate larger batteries that last 14 to 25 hours between charges. Most truly wireless and mostly wireless earbuds in our roundup manage around 8 hours of battery life, though."
10391,"The way a wireless headphone or earbud fits in your ear impacts how much outside sound you’ll hear while you’re wearing it. Smaller earbuds from Skullcandy and Sennheiser go farther down your ear canal, blocking out ambient sound—which could be good or bad, depending on how you’re using them. Most earbuds come with interchangeable inserts, so experimenting with the included options will help the buds stay in during your workout. "
10392,"Models like the Bose SoundSport Free’s earbuds are designed to sit just outside your ear canal and use attached wings to stay affixed to your ear, so you’ll hear some ambient sound, but not enough to ruin the tunes."
10393,"Here are 16 wireless headphone options perfect for riding, cross-training, or trainer workouts. "
10394,"The Jabra Elite Active 65t truly wireless earbuds have earned universal acclaim across the techscape for their comfortable, secure fit and impressive sound quality. Three sizes of bud inserts assist with fit, and they’re water-resistant, so they’ll won’t get ruined by sweat. You can also adjust how much of your own voice you’d like to hear during calls, and the app also includes an equalizer for a customized listening experience. "
10395,"If you’re an Apple loyalist looking for an interconnected alternative to AirPods, check out the BeatsX. The W1 Bluetooth chip allows for seamless switching between Apple devices, and the earbuds use a Lightning charger. There’s a claimed 2 hours of playback from a 5-minute charge and up to 8 hours of total battery life. Four sizes of ear tips and a flexible cable help these mostly wireless earbuds move with you, and magnetic earbuds keep the cable from tangling in your jersey pocket. "
10396,"Plantronics’ Backbeat Fit 2100 improves upon the company’s mostly wireless earbuds with the addition of tap sensors: Users can set commands, like starting a stopwatch or changing a playlist, to match a series of taps on the outside of the buds with the Backbeat app (the buds press in with a “click,” so the tapping function works with sweaty fingers). They’re sweatproof and waterproof, and the 10-meter wireless range means you don’t have to carry your phone between workout stations. Battery life is 7 hours and the ear tips are designed to pass sound from your surroundings through the earbuds to keep you safe while you ride. "
10397,"We like the Aftershokz Trekz Air because they solve the problem of listening to music while riding your bike. The headphones conduct sound through your cheekbones to your inner ears without covering your ear canals, which means you’ll hear your tunes and the cars coming up on you simultaneously. At 1.04 oz, the titanium headset is lightweight and rests comfortably around the back of your head. Our reviewer reported they work just as well on a trail run, which means your exercise movements won’t knock them out of place."
10398,
10399,"Sennheiser’s signature sound is the highlight of these sport wireless earbuds. User reviews indicate excellent sound quality, and there’s an accompanying app to help you tweak the equalizer to your liking.

Four sizes of ear tips help you find the right fit and a fabric-wrapped charging case makes these high-end buds feel like they’re worth the price tag."

There’s 14 hours of playback time and a customizable equalizer that carries your audio settings across devices. A pivoting earbud system allows wearers to position the wires beneath the ear (for taking calls) or behind the ear (to get the wires out of the way), and interchangeable fins and tips help you find the right fit."
10406,"This is the first truly wireless option from one of the biggest names in the audio industry, and Bose came out swinging, with water-resistant buds that deliver great sound quality and excellent Bluetooth connectivity. Soft fins keep the units in your ear, while the controls sit just outside the canal, giving you easy access to the buttons. You’ll get five hours of play time off a single charge, and a cool quick-charge feature that gets you 45 minutes of play time after a 15-minute charge."
10407,"Yes, Jaybird’s Run is designed for runners, but cyclists will appreciate these buds too, because of the sweat-proof and water-resistant design and secure in-ear fit thanks to interchangeable tips and fins. And true audiophiles take note: A companion app allows you to adjust the sound to your preferences. Like more bass? Want to bring out the mids or highs in a particular song? You can do that. Like the JBL, the Free also uses a single-button control system. "

They’re just 8 ounces and Amazon reviews lauded their comfort and exceptional sound quality. Touch controls on the ear cups make it easy to switch songs or stop the music on the fly. Best of all, the 25-hour battery life means you won’t have to think about charging them for weeks."
10411,
10412,"These JBL-engineered truly wireless earbuds are ideal for cyclists because its TalkThru and AmbientAware modes make you instantly aware of your surroundings. Using the TalkThru setting, music can be lowered and speech amplified for an impromptu conversation, and Ambient Aware boosts ambient sounds to make you award of traffic. There’s an IPX7 waterproof rating for superb sweat-resistance and JBL’s dynamic sound. An aluminum charging case recharges the buds when you’re not using them; with the buds and case fully charged, Under Armour claims you’ll get 25 hours of listening."
10413,"The Ink’d Bluetooth wireless earbuds are on our list because it’s tough to argue with a set of $40 wireless headphones that actually work. Stash them in your pocket on the way to the gym—the flexible collar makes them easy to ball up—or leave them around your neck and use the integrated microphone to make calls. If you’re (understandably) worried about the quality of cheap headphones, Skullcandy puts a 2-year limited warranty on the Ink’d; it doesn’t cover damage you cause yourself, but they’ll send you a new pair if they stop working on their own."
10414,"These mostly wireless Bluetooth earbuds combine JBL’s balanced sound with portability and lightness. The cable between the earbuds is reflective, so you’ll be seen during a nighttime workout, and the 8-hour battery life should span a week’s worth of gym sessions (although battery life may depend on sound level). They don’t accentuate low-frequency sound like bassier headphones, but if you’re not a hip-hop workout addict who needs heavy bass for motivation, the Reflect Mini BT should work well with your entire music library. "
10415,
10416,"The Plantrontics BackBeat FIT 500 is for the audiophile who won’t sacrifice sound quality for portability. Ample headband and ear cushioning keep the phones glued to your noggin, and 40mm drivers deliver a well-balanced sound that elevates every track in your gym playlist. A military-grade nano-coating guards the electronics from moisture, and the 18-hour battery life is superb."
10417,"Sennheiser’s signature sound gets a sporty package with the CX Sport mostly wireless earbuds. Ear fins keep the buds in your ear canals, which means that for better or for worse, you won’t hear much else with the volume up. Four sizes of ear adapters and three sizes of ear fins come with the earbuds, plus a cable clip and neoprene storage pouch. The earbuds top out at 6 hours of battery life, but a 1-hour quick-charge feature gives you 1.5 hours of battery life on short notice. "
10418,"If you’ve seen people talking to themselves in public lately, it’s probably because they’ve been wearing AirPods, Apple’s own totally wireless bluetooth earbuds. The buds charge when inserted into their case and auto-connect to Apple devices, and users report solid sound quality out of the microphone. Double-tap for Siri to give commands to Apple Music (you’ll have to use your phone to access Spotify, though). There’s only one size and no inserts, but if Apple’s EarPods fit you well, the AirPods could the wireless earbuds that streamline your on-the-go listening experience."
10419,Stiff. Light. Steady. Yes. Cannondale's update to this nimble carbon road race bike will have you zipping through turns and rollers at exhilarating speed.
10420,"We have resigned ourselves to the fact that our socks will be wet. But our shorts have dried. The rain that soaked us when we set out early this morning has dissipated, and our newly dry spandex makes us feel fresh again.

But doing it on a bike like the Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod takes that enjoyment to the next level."
10421,"When the first SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod was released in 2011, engineers aimed to make a race bike that was light and stiff, but also to achieve a level of smoothness that was, at the time, yet to be attained by most other race models. And they succeeded: Bicycling testers thought the bike provided an outstanding ride quality along with its World Tour race-readiness."

Cannondale went to a thinner, 25.4mm-diameter seatpost, slimmed down the fork legs, and made the stays wispier to further smooth the ride. The company says these changes allowed engineers to make the head tube and bottom bracket areas 12-percent and 11-percent stiffer, respectively—and still winnowed the frameset weight by 70 grams. A slightly lower bottom bracket makes the bike a more stable descender, and it also allows it to now take 28mm tires while retaining the right BB height. (But even on the stock 25mm tires, the SuperSix transitions blithely from pavement to rough gravel roads.)"
10426,"New, truncated aero profiling in the tubes and a lower (more sheltered) placement of the seat tube water bottle help save six watts over the previous version. “The idea was to offer a little aero advantage without compromising the goals [light, stiff, and smooth] at the core of Evo,” says David Devine, senior product manager at Cannondale."
10427,"Smoothness is apparent upon first ride. The bike was buttery over well-maintained pavement; over chip seal and potholed country roads, it took the sharp edges off, leaving a pleasant buzziness that let me experience the varying surfaces beneath me without beating me up. I felt comfortable even after a five-hour day."
10428,     RELATED: 2016 Road Bike Editors' Choice Winners
10429,"At 14.5 pounds, this bike is about as light as you can get for its price. It was enjoyable on climbs, encouraging me to go a little harder, a little longer than usual, and responding to out-of-the-saddle accelerations with immediate surges. Midcompact (52/36) gearing paired with an 11-28 cassette provides race-appropriate power for flats and downhills, but plenty of gears to spin up hills too."
10430,"Geometry didn’t change much, but it’s still standout. The last couple of bikes I’ve tested have provided descending confidence by being longer and more stable; the SuperSix—with its short, whippy rear end—maintains nimble handling that makes it exhilarating to swoop into hard turns. Yet it also inspires confidence thanks to a long and low rider position that seats you in the bike and gives you plenty of control on fast, winding descents."
10431,"There was only one instance in which I found control to be lacking: In the rain, the Dura-Ace brakes and Mavic Ksyrium Elite aluminum wheels took longer to engage than I’m comfortable with, even compared with other rim-and-pad combinations I’ve tested. At one stop sign, before the pads could squeegee water off the rim, I blew past the rider in front of me while squeezing my levers as hard as possible (and apologizing profusely). Switching to a wet-weather brake pad would improve this. And braking in dry conditions was good."
10432,"Beyond this, the SuperSix did everything right. It amplified the best parts of the ride, then faded into the background so I could focus on more important things. My chamois is dry. My socks are wet. My legs ache with all the hilly miles that have come before. My heart is brimming with the feeling that right now, everything is perfect."

10480,The top level Airén will get disc brakes and a beautiful new paint scheme for the next season
10481,"It’s hard to jump on a new bike, ride for five hours, and have no complaints, but that’s what happened when I got the chance to preview the revamped Diamondback Airén."
10482,"I went to Santa Rosa, California for a first ride on the newly redesigned women’s endurance bike. The Airen line, along with its brother Century line, has been redesigned from the ground up, with cues from Diamondback’s Podium and Serios race bikes. This version features a new rear triangle with swoopy seat and chain stays that are designed to dull road chatter. The company also added 12mm thru axles at the front and rear, and an oversized bottom bracket—tweaks that are intended to improve power transfer and stiffness. Also, five of the seven models in the line get disc brakes. "
10483," I’m a picky cyclist, and tackling a 95-mile charity ride seemed a little daunting on a new bike. But I felt super comfortable on the Airen—I ended the day feeling like I’d been riding it for years. Cushy touch points, including a dreamy Prologo Kappa women’s saddle and Eva gel handlebar tape, combine with the geometry to add to the bike’s plush ride. "
10484,
10485,
10486,"Although it’s an “endurance” road bike, it has some serious snap: We completed the 95-mile ride in less than five hours. The Airen responded quickly when I stood up and sprinted to regain contact with a group over a tough climb, or when I accelerated to move through traffic. The power transfer and stiffness were excellent: having ridden a prior aluminum version of this bike, there was marked improvement; traits that can be attributed to the tuning of the carbon fiber, especially in the bottom half of the frame, and the addition of thru axles that solidify the frame's hold on the wheels."
10487,"The Airen 5 was stiff enough for sprints and sustained speed, but the overall ride feel was comfortable. When we hit chewed-up roads, the Airén sailed over them with ease. On stiff race-style bikes, I often have issues with my hands falling asleep, but this bike was compliant enough that I finished the ride with all the feeling still in my hands and my back loose, not cramped.  "
10488,"Disc brakes add an extra level of confidence in tense situations and improve braking performance in wet conditions, making them a huge draw for endurance riders. I appreciated them when descending with large groups on unfamiliar roads during the ride. They felt smooth and allowed me to quickly adjust my speed and not lock up my brakes before I almost overcooked a tight turn."
10489,"I loved the updated aesthetics on this model, too: Diamondback calls the Airen 5’s blue shade Tiffany Matte. It’s a standout color that is sure to turn heads without being overly feminine. The understated logos on this bike give riders a chance to make it their own.  "
10490,
10491,
10492,"Diamondback claims that the Airen 5 weighs 18.9 pounds, which is on par with many other endurance bikes with disc brakes. Personally, I never felt like the bike was holding me back while climbing. The Airén 5 comes equipped with a compact Ultegra groupset and an 11/32 cassette in the rear to give you enough gear to climb over the steepest pitches. HED Flanders C2+ wheels and Shimano Flat Mount hydraulic disc brakes round out the parts package on the top-of-the-line model. "
10493,"The Airén 5 is the highest-end bike in the line at $3,200 but the seven models (three carbon frames and four aluminum) go all the way down to the $800 Airén Sport. This bike is a great fit for a woman looking to pursue longer charity rides or even dabble in some entry-level racing, but I’d recommend any of the budget-friendly Diamondback Airéns to a woman looking to get started in the sport. "

10495,"Tips for properly stowing your spare gear holder
"
10496,"At their best, saddlebags are respectably functional. They discreetly carry ride essentials that would bulk up a jersey pocket. But if yours is stuffed and swaying like the belly of an overfed housecat, you lose major style points.
The key elements are size and installation. Choose a small bag that fits under your saddle without sticking out behind it. Unless you’re getting out for an all-day epic on bad roads, you need to fit only a tube, small tool, flat-repair items, and perhaps a few bucks inside. Use your tube to separate metal items so they don’t jingle. Make sure the bag is connected to your saddle rails and seatpost, then adjust all the fasteners so it tucks away unobtrusively. And, like your fly, make sure it’s always zipped. Heading to a race? Move essentials into your jersey pockets and leave the saddlebag at home."
10497,The company updates its flagship road race platform with disc brakes and more affordable carbon versions
10498,"Last summer, Cannondale updated its flagship carbon road race bike, the SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod, with a slew of improvements. These included a new fork with slimmer legs that saved weight and better balanced front and rear end ride compliance; a stiffer bottom bracket and head tube area; a thinner, 25.4mm diameter seatpost for better compliance and weight savings; subtle aero shaping in the tubes; and the ability to take up to 28mm tires. These improvements were brought to the lighter, high-modulus (Hi-Mod) version of the SuperSix EVO first, and we were impressed with the end result (read our review of the Cannondale SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod here). "
10499,"Today, Cannondale launches disc brake versions of the SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod, as well as a more affordable SuperSix EVO Carbon. "
10500,
10501,
10502,SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod Disc
10503,"The new SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod Disc landed under embargo at the Bicycling office late last week. Besides paint, the outer shape (geometry and tube shaping) of the disc bike looks the nearly identical to the rim-brake bike, but Cannondale tells us the frame got a new mold to accommodate subtle differences in cable routing, and the rear end hub spacing increased from 130mm to 135mm to take the disc brake. "
10504,"The SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod Disc incorporates the clean-looking flat-mount disc brake standard released by Shimano last spring, where the rear brake caliper sits on top of the chainstay, and the front caliper bolts directly behind the fork leg, providing better modulation and also tucking the calipers out of the wind. The fork otherwise has similar construction to the updated rim brake SuperSix EVO, but now takes a 100x12mm thru-axle."
10505,
10506,
10507,"Which is why we were a little surprised to see a quick-release in the rear instead of another thru-axle. Cannondale global marketing manager James LaLonde explained, “There are relatively small stiffness gains when comparing thru axle to quick release that were outweighed by the simplicity of the quick release for quick wheel changes and weight savings. Thru axles have a significantly higher benefit in a non-supported structure like a fork, whereas the rear has the support and structural integrity of the entire rear triangle.” "
10508,"Still, the SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod Disc deviates here from its racy disc road peers like the recently launched Giant TCR Advanced Disc and the Trek Domane SLR Disc, which both got thru axles front and rear. (The Specialized Tarmac Disc still sports quick releases front and rear.)  "
10509,
10510,
10511,"The disc version of the SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod frame weighs 829 grams, compared to 777g for the rim brake version. It will be available in two standard builds—Ultegra Di2 for $6,200 and mechanical for $4,200—as well as a $6,200 women’s build with Ultegra Di2, a Fi’z:ik Arione Donna women’s saddle, and compact (50/34) gearing instead of the mid-compact (52/36) crank spec’d on the standard version. Braking is courtesy of Shimano hydraulics on all builds. "
10512,"We have the women’s Di2 build here at Bicycling (shown here in these photos). It weighs in at 16.4 pounds for a size 54cm. So far, I’ve only been out on it once and due to a parts issue (note that the wheels shown in the photos are replacements, not the tubeless-ready, Cannondale carbon clincher disc wheels that will ship stock), I can’t provide a solid impression at the moment. But I really enjoyed the SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod Dura-Ace 2 rim brake version of the bike, and as one of my few minor niggles with it involved braking performance in the wet, the disc version is set up to outperform its rim-brake brother in at least one category. Look for ride impressions soon."
10513,
10514,
10515,SuperSix EVO Carbon
10516,"The new SuperSix EVO Carbon brings all the updated features on the Hi-Mod to Cannondale’s more affordable, intermediate modulus carbon frame. In other words, same SuperSix EVO frame, different (heftier) carbon layup. Cannondale says the SuperSix EVO Carbon still weighs under 1,000 grams. "
10517,"The Carbon version will be available in four rim brake builds, two disc builds, and four women’s builds, also with identical frames to their standard counterparts. Pricing will range from a budget-friendly $2,200 with a Shimano 105 build, up to $3,500 for Ultegra Di2—what sounds like a pretty remarkable value."

10523,Love data? Check out one of these GPS-enabled cycling computers
10524,"Whether you like the simplicity of a fine  watch, or want to explore new roads, there's a GPS cycling computer for you. "
10525,"GPS cycling computers use satellites to track your position, accurately calculating speed, distance, and time without wires or magnets. They record your route–and data collected from heart rate, cadence, power–which you can then upload to a ride logging service to evaluate your performance for fun or training. "
10526,When shopping for a GPS cycling computer consider the following:
10527,"Smartphone Connectivity–Most new GPS cycling computers will connect to your mobile phone, but there are different levels of connectivity. Some push all alerts—phone calls, emails, texts, Instagram notifications—to your cycling computer, while others only allow post-ride uploading of your data files, so think about how badly you want to know if your mom is calling. A phone app that pushes firmware updates and lets you set up data screens is very handy."
10528,"WiFi–Computers that connect to your home Wifi network take a step out of ride uploading. By the time you've finished taking off your shoes, your ride can be up on Strava. "
10529,"ANT+ and Bluetooth–ANT+ is currently the more-popular connectivity protocol for cycling sensors (speed, cadence, heart rate, power), but Bluetooth is quickly gaining ground and looks like the future. Some computers only connect to one or the other, some connect to both. In general, we recommend getting a computer that can connect to both ANT+ and Bluetooth sensors. "
10530,"Sensor Compatibility–some less-expensive GPS cycling computers are not able to connect to power meters. If you're going to be training with a power meter, make sure your head unit supports it. "
10531,"Maps and Navigation–One of the bigger differences between GPS cycling computers relates to maps and navigation. A computer with maps can provide detailed turn by turn directions like your car's navigation system. No maps, and the computer can only provide a breadcrumb trail to follow. If you're wanting to explore new roads in new places, a computer with full featured navigation is invaluable. "
10532,"Guided Intervals and Workouts–With some computers–or a cloud-based service–it's possible to create or download workouts, which are then displayed while you're riding as prompts with targets. It's like having a tiny coach in your computer shouting at you to go faster."

10534,"Strava Live Segments–If you're looking to beat your friend's times, the Live Segments feature can tell you exactly where a segment starts, finishes, and provides mid-segment status relative to your PR, your closest rival, or the KOM/QOM. "
10535,"Screens–Color screens are cheery, but are mostly useful only for more complex navigation. If you're just using a computer for speed and distance, a monochrome screen is enough, and is easier to read in some conditions. Touchscreens can make some functions easier, but they can get glitchy when wearing gloves, or when sprinkled with precipitation or perspiration. In general, cycling and touchscreens don't mix well, so we suggest avoiding them when possible. "

It had all the features a data hungry rider needed–speed, distance, and time; barometric altimeter; wide sensor compatibility, including power meters; long battery life and reliability–without the additional complexity of mapping. The Edge 130 adds some tricks from Garmin’s higher-end computers–text and call alerts, compatibility with Garmin’s Varia Rearview Radar, and course navigation–but it’s stuffed in a compact (41 x 63 x 16 mm) 35 gram with up to 15 hour battery life."
10541,
10542,"A new favorite for many riders, Wahoo’s ELEMNT BOLT made the company's old ELEMNT computer even more user-friendly, and added some aerodynamic accents to reduce drag. The brand introduced this feature saying the BOLT has “less drag, less cost, more simplicity, and virtually universal compatibility.” It still calculates power, heart rate, speed, cadence and—with the proper accessories—muscle oxygenation. It reads your bike and your smartphone as well, if you have Shimano Di2, SRAM eTap, Campagnolo EPS, or FSA's WE system. And Wahoo doesn’t just map the Island of Zwift: you can create routes and load them into the unit as well, and hunt down Strava segments in real time. "
10543,"Lezyne joined the GPS market two years ago with a small ‘mini-GPS’ at first, and gradually built to the Super GPS with mapping functions at a fraction of the cost of some of the other brands. At $150, the Super GPS uses both GPS and Glonass to navigate, but also integrates with the Ally app from Lezyne, and allows for live segment updates for racing-while-riding. The Ally app lets you create your own route (or use one that's pre-programmed), and then the computer provides turn-by-turn directions."
10544,"The Garmin Edge 1030 is the gold standard for cycling computers with navigation options available on the market right now. The huge color screen makes following an unfamiliar route easier. Despite its size–slightly larger than an Edge 1000–it's low profile, and the included out-in-front mount sets the 1030 flush with your bar. Preload maps from Trendline Popularity Routing with billions of miles of Garmin Connect ride data for turn-by-turn directions, find out when you’re about to hit a Strava segment, let friends and family live-track you on Garmin Connect, and keep pedaling for up to 20 hours with the updated battery. And, of course, it does what every good cycling computer does: monitors the basics like speed, altitude, time, distance, cadence, and power."
10545,"The SRM PC8 (Power Control Eight) doesn't, on paper, compare well to other GPS cycling computers. It's very expensive, and doesn't offer navigation, smart phone connectivity, or any of the training or recovery guidance features many of the other computers can. This is a tool for a racer looking to take their training to the next level. It has massive battery life, huge memory, and is specifically designed for interval training. The display is fantastic: arguably the clearest, sharpest, easiest to read of all the computers. And the aluminum case is jewel like, and can be highly customized. Be aware that the PC8 only uploads through WiFi, or if connected directly to a computer with its proprietary USB cable. Don't lose this cable–it's also the charging cable, and a new one will cost you $29."
10546,"The Omata One's mechanical hands makes it look like a fine chronograph, but underneath that classic face is a full-featured GPS cycling computer. It has many of the basic features of a GPS cycling computer, and records speed, distance, time, power, heart rate and data information for later download into Strava or other ride-logging service. But instead of a digital face, hands provide current speed, distance, ascent, and ride time information. An appropriately-elegant machined aluminum K-Edge out-in-front mount is included."
10547,"The Mega C offers a color screen and the value we’ve come to expect from Lezyne’s GPS units. The Mega C lives up to its name with a large 56mm diagonal display, an long feature list, including great battery life (up to 32 hours), and enough memory to store 800 hours of rides. The Mega C also offers smartphone alerts, navigation with turn by turn directions, compatibility with ANT + and Bluetooth Sensors, ANT+ FE-C trainer control, coaching prompts from Today’s Plan or TrainingPeaks training prorams, and friend tracking."

10553,"Pioneer’s SGX-CA500 computer was a powerful computer with compelling features. It was also a complete nightmare to use. The new CA600 looks like it quashes the nightmares, and keeps the powerful stuff, and adds a few enhancements. Eliminating the 500’s wonky touchscreen and adding setup from a smartphone should mean most of the nightmares that bedeviled the old computer are cured in the 600. New features include a 56mm diagonal color screen, OpenStreet basemaps for navigation with turn by turn directions, compatibility with Bluetooth sensors, smartphone alerts, and Strava Live Segments. The powerful stuff that carries over is Pioneer’s extensive suite of coaching features (manual setup, or downloadable from Training Peaks or Pioneer’s Cyclo-Sphere service), training analysis, as well as extensive pedaling metrics (when used with Pioneer’s power meters). And if you love data, you’ll love this: the 600 can display up to 15 metrics on a single screen."
10554,Giant’s women’s brand introduces three new lines of full-suspension bikes.
10555,"Giant split out its women’s bikes into an entirely separate sub-brand, Liv, a few years ago, and since then has been steadily adding to the portfolio to create a lineup that will match its men’s offerings."
10556,"Today, Giant announced it’s adding substantially to that on the off-road side, with three new platforms, including what it’s billing as the first women’s-specific enduro bike, the Hail. There are other women’s enduro models like Norco’s Sight and Juliana’s Roubion, but both of those bikes use the same geometry as the men’s bikes. "
10557,"On the Advanced composite models, Liv's bikes feature geometry and a carbon composite layup that are designed specifically for women. Rear triangles are ALUXX-SL aluminum. Giant spec’d all three lines with 27.5 wheels, which it feels are the right choice for most women riders. There are multiple models in each line, up through high-end bikes that match the men’s side. Here’s a look:"
10558,
10559,
10560,"Hail
	Essentially Liv’s answer to the Editors' Choice-winning Reign, the Hail is a 160mm enduro/trail platform based on the brand's excellent, long-running Maestro suspension. The line includes four models: the carbon composite Hail Advanced 0 and Hail Advanced 1, and the aluminum Hail 1 and Hail 2."
10561,"The Hail Advanced 0 features an Advanced-level composite frame with Boost axle spacing (15x110mm front, 12x148mm rear),  and 160mm of travel front and rear, with a Rock Shox Lyric RCT3 fork and Deluxe RC3 rear shock. SRAM’s new Eagle 1x12 drivetrain offers a wide gearing range, and SRAM Guide Ultimate disc brakes come with 180mm rotors. "
10562,
10563,
10564,"Pique
	The new Pique fits into a space next to the more XC-oriented Lust series. With 120mm of front and rear travel, it’s a bit more trail-y, but will likely still be pretty capable when you’re running a number plate. The lineup features six models: two Advanced-level carbon offerings and four aluminum frames with varying levels of spec."
10565,"The Pique Advanced 0 is definitely tuned for going fast, with a race-oriented RockShox RS1 fork and SRAM’s XC Ultimate disc brakes. But it’s also got Boost spacing and SRAM’s Rise wheels, which means it’ll accept meaty rubber more in line with an all-day trail ride."
10566,"There’s also a sub-lineup called Pique SX with two models, one composite and one aluminum; the SX designation means the bike has been tuned for a bit more rowdy riding style—chiefly with a longer-travel fork (Rock Shox’s 120-140mm Revelation RL in this case) and different brakes—SRAM’s Guide, with a 180mm front rotor. "
10567,"Last, Liv offered a very little bit of information on a new affordable suspension lineup called Embolden, with two models. The ALUXX aluminum frames use FlexPoint suspension, a single-pivot design that’s also used on the men’s Stance platform (another EC winner). We were impressed by the suspension quality on the Stance, and the Embolden series will feature shocks with compression and rebound damping, a step up from the Monarch R on our Stance 2 tester. Another upgrade: The Embolden 1 will get a dropper post."
10568,"Full details on the lineup, including complete spec for all models and pricing, are not yet available."

10640,"ENVE’s new rims are designed to help with ascents, yet be robust enough to handle aggressive trail and all-mountain riding"
10641,"Bikes that are capable of utilizing a plus-size tire are hitting the market fast, and suppliers and manufacturers are keeping pace with products aimed at this growing segment. ENVE is the latest to announce rims designed with the fatter tires in mind."
10642,"The new M60 Forty Plus rim is the first from the Ogden, Utah-based company that's aimed at aggressive trail riders looking for lightweight, durable rims to work with the 2.8 to 3.0-inch tires most commonly found on bikes in this category."
10643,         RELATED: 3 Easy Tricks to Better Mountain Bike Tires
10644,"Constructed at the ENVE facility in Utah, the M60 Forty Plus features a 40mm internal (and 49mm external) 25mm-deep carbon fiber rim that weighs in at a claimed 455 grams for the 27.5 version. According to ENVE, the rim structure is optimized to be more compliant, handle the lower pressure of the bigger tires, and better deal with impacts. The rim features a hookless bead shape in the rim wall, which can hold the tire in place yet add more material in a critical area, bolstering the claim at durability. The M60 Forty Plus is available in 28-hole drilling as a stand-alone offering for customers who want to lace with the hub of their choice, or as pre-built wheels with DT/Swiss and Chris King hub options for Boost 110/148 spacing. Retail for the rim alone is $975 with wheel options starting at $2,718."
10645,"Each wheel in the M-Series lineup has been aimed at a ratio of descending to climbing. In the case of the M60 Forty Plus, the ideal rider is looking for a rim that won’t hinder him or her on the ascent and is robust enough to handle aggressive trail and all-mountain riding: In ENVE-speak, that's roughly a 60/40 ratio of descending to climbing. “Our goal is to make the ultimate rim for a given category and application, in this case the Plus platform. The shape of the M60 Plus with its 40mm internal rim width saves weight and maximizes the interface between rim and the most popular 2.8 to 3.0 inch tires,” says ENVE Marketing Director Jake Pantone."

10647,Phil Kmetz tests a $179 Huffy downhill bike on a double-black diamond trail in this crazy new video
10648,"Buying a new downhill bike for $179 might seem like a sweet deal—until you take it out on the trail. This becomes abundantly clear in pro downhiller Phil Kmetz's new video, during which he somehow survives a double-black diamond DH trail, massive jumps and all, on a Walmart-bought Huffy Carnage. "
10649,"Despite being aesthetically on-point, good for skids, and stocked with some current-looking components (like 27.5 wheels and a coil shock) the Carnage weighs in at a hefty 55 lbs and sports a set of improperly-set-up brakes, which produce a deafening squeal and literally burn away over the course of the run. The bolts also prove un-tightenable, resulting in some worrisome handling, especially as Kmetz reaches the jump line. Undeterred by the disintegration of his steed (or eventual lack of all stopping power) Kmetz braves his way to the bottom for the sake of a proper gear test."
10650,"While most department store bikes will never be subjected to this kind of torture, and might be great options for lighter use, there's a morbid sort of fascination in watching this one meet its demise. "
10651,"Of his run, Kmetz says: ""After several close calls and soiled undergarments... I've never been so happy to get to the end of the trail.” See it for yourself below (there is crashing)."

10653,"Smart strategies for test-riding bikes
"
10654,"It’s always smart to test ride a bike before plunking down your hard-earned cash. Bike companies often bring a fleet of new models to ­shops and events for consumers to try. But before you hit up a demo, consider these tips from Jackie Baker, marketing manager and former demo-van driver for the women’s brand Liv/Giant.Prepare
Bring helmet, shoes, pedals, and cycling shorts. Be ready to answer questions about your riding and budget so staff can identify the best bikes for you. Do your homework and ask questions so you can make smart comparisons about parts, materials, and price.Familiarize
Allow about 40 minutes for a test ride, using the first 10 to get acquainted with the bike. If the handlebar feels too high or the suspension too springy, ask for a fix. And make sure you know how to use the components. If you’re used to Shimano, say, ask for a SRAM tutorial.Ride
Take the bike through all of its paces: Brake hard, brake slow, corner at different angles and speeds, descend, and climb. Resist the urge to try every bike at the demo. Limit yourself to no more than three or you risk losing track of what makes each unique."

10656,Why just sleep when you can multitask?
10657,Pull on the right PJs and you just might snooze better and recover faster from tough workouts. That’s what Under Armour claims will happen if you hit the sheets in their Athlete Recovery Henley Sleepwear.
10658,"And now, you can get that sleepwear for 30 percent off during Amazon's Black Friday Deal of the Day. Both the women’s and the men’s short sleeve top is $55.99 (normally $70 and $80). The men’s long sleeve is $69.99, as is the women’s (down from $100). Recovery pants for both men and women go for $69.99 (also down from $100) while the recovery shorts are $41.99 for women and $55.99 for men (typically $60 and $80)."
10659,"The company first unveiled their revolutionary sleep and recovery system earlier this year after collaborating with none other than that guru of everlasting vigor, Tom Brady. The secret to their rejuvenating sleepwear lies in its bioceramic print lining. Bioceramics—in case you don’t know—are a mix of powdered ceramics and mineral oxides that have long been used to repair or replace body parts. Think hip replacements or dental implants. They also reflect heat."
10660,"The super-soft bioceramic print absorbs heat given off by your body then reflects it back in the form of Far Infrared rays, aka FIR, aka energy we feel as heat. Gentle, radiating heat, to be precise, that can penetrate our skin. When that heat gets under our skin, say the folks at Under Armour, it does all kinds of things that help promote muscle recovery and improve sleep."
10661,"And multiple studies have indeed shown a whole bunch of positive effects from FIR therapy, including reduced inflammation, pain, stiffness, and fatigue, and improved circulation. In fact, one study found that runners who got FIR therapy had fewer symptoms of muscle soreness after a hard, simulated trail run than those who didn't get the treatment."

10667,"The company began in 2006 with the goal of helping people learn and understand more about their genetic makeup, specifically, their ancestry, genetic traits, and genetic health risks. Since then, more than 2 million people have submitted their DNA for analysis and detailed reporting on their genotype, and 23andMe-ing—posting genetic makeup on social media—is, of course, now a thing. (If you struggle with your weight, it could be genetic.)"

10669,"For example, when one Women’s Health writer took the test, she learned she was a carrier of Gaucher disease type 1, a metabolic disease with a range of symptoms including bone problems, anemia, and an enlarged spleen and liver. Armed with that information, she was able to consult a certified genetic counselor for advice before starting a family."

10671,"So in addition to providing interesting insight into your ancestral makeup, the test provides information on whether or not you're a carrier for certain diseases (like cystic fibrosis), if you're at risk for certain genetic diseases (like late-onset Alzheimer's), what genetic traits you have (like hair loss), and how those traits may affect your health."
10672,"The test is meant to be an informative tool, a relatively inexpensive way to get a deep dive into your genetic makeup. If you have serious concerns about your health, you should always consult a certified genetic counselor or your doctor. (Make sure you ask your doctor these 7 questions at your next appointment.)"

"
10678,"There are few things as disappointing as gutting out a workout and then, drenched and dehydrated, finally reaching for your water bottle only to suck down a stream of lukewarm water. Or accidentally taking a swig of beer that's been sitting out too long at a summer barbecue. Or taking a sip of coffee that's gone ice cold (not in a good way) less than an hour after you brewed it. None of those things happen when you carry your liquids in a Hydro Flask."
10679,"We're big fans of these vacuum-sealed bottles, and were excited to hear that Hydro Flask is offering 25% off sitewide until December 3 with the code HYDRO-25. Hydro Flask products range from 12-ounce water bottles to a 64-ounce beer growler and lots of other options in between, including coffee mugs, food flasks, and wine bottles."
10680,"What exactly sets these vessels apart? First of all, they're crafted from nearly indestructible stainless steel and BPA-free plastic that can withstand all sorts of abuse. But it's Hydro Flask’s proprietary TempShield insulation that works the magic. The company promises its vessels will keep your drinks cold for up to 24 hours, even in scorching temps, and our (admittedly unscientific) tests prove they actually do. Case in point: One of our editors left a HydroFlask bottle of cold brew coffee in a hot car in the middle of the summer. Hours later, the liquid was still cold, and the ice cubes were even still intact."
10681,"Hydro Flask products make perfect holiday gifts—that's why they wound up on our lists of the best gifts for outdoorsmen, gifts for beer lovers, and whiskey gifts. You won't find such a wide variety of discounted Hydro Flask products again this season, so shop before December 3 to take advantage of the sale. And if you don't know anyone who enjoys a cold beer (unlikely), check out the rest of our gift guides and Black Friday coverage for inspiration.

Of course, replacing your mode of transportation doesn’t eliminate your need to haul stuff. But in order to do that comfortably and efficiently, you need the right bag for the job. So, for example, while one person might need a roomy backpack to carry lunch, a laptop, and a change of clothes to work, another might have an obsession with organization, in which case a bag with lots of pockets and compartments would be a better fit. There’s even a bag on our list that can be both a backpack and a shoulder bag, with the simple switch of the straps. As long as you find the bag that best fits your needs, you’ll have little excuse to skip the ride. Here are some things to think about when choosing a commuter pack."
10750,"Whatever bag you buy, make sure the harness (think backpack) or strap (think messenger bag) is comfortable when the bag is loaded with the weight you’d typically carry (listen up, college kids—those books are no joke). Some riders like the extra stability that a waist strap offers, and some packs have a sternum compression strap to help balance unwieldy loads. The straps themselves are also something to consider: Some are wide, some narrow, some with more padding than others. And if hot and humid conditions don’t sway you, do yourself a favor and look for a pack that’s designed with ventilation between it and your back."
10751,"First, the obvious: If you haul a ton of stuff, you’ll need a roomy bag. If you don’t, you can get away with something smaller. Let’s say you’re a daily commuter who needs room for a laptop, lunch, and a change of clothes. Look for a backpack (over a messenger bag) that has a padded sleeve to keep your device safe, plus enough room to fit the rest. If your work attire is more business than casual, choose a bag with a larger, protected main compartment that will keep collared shirts from wrinkling. If rain doesn’t hold you back, consider a waterproof bag with waterproof zippers or one with a cover that can be easily deployed when the weather turns. "
10752,"But let’s say you just need a bag that you can quickly sling over your shoulder for a day of running around town. You don’t need much, just a few necessities—or even just a safe place to stash your phone, keys, and wallet. In this case, a messenger back might be all you need. "
10753,"If environmentally friendly products are at the top of your must-have list, look for a bag that uses recycled and upcycled materials, such as the Green Guru Joyride, which is made from street sign scraps, among other fabrics. Like the look of leather but not a fan of where it comes from? The Lolë Lily Bag has a faux-leather bottom and trim."
10754,"Are you the kind of person who likes to have a spot for everything, from a fleece-lined phone pocket to a place specifically designed for a water bottle or even a zip-up sleeve that lets you slide a yoga mat in for easy carrying? Or can you handle one large main compartment for all the big stuff, with a few smaller ones for the smaller stuff? Do you find value in easy-to-access external pockets, or do you like to keep your valuables on the inside? Keep a few things in mind with regard to pockets: They can add weight, they can increase price, and external ones may not be waterproof. "
10755,"There are a number of ways a pack can make you more visible to motorists. If you don’t mind the double takes you’ll get in the office, go for a bright or hi-vis pack to make yourself more visible on the road. If you do, look for a pack with a removable hi-vis cover. If you commute at dawn, dusk, or in the dark, get a bag with reflective details and/or mounts for a taillight. "

"
10803,"1. Tread
Made from natural rubbers. Challenge's treads are hand glued with temperature-sensitive latex rubber cement, not bonded to a casing as in a vulcanized tire. The process keeps natural rubber flexible, so the tire is more likely to deform around bumps instead of bouncing off, reducing rider fatigue.2. Casing
Sheets of polyester and cotton or silk threads—up to 1,000 per inch—are folded diagonally back on themselves two or three times so threads lie on a bias (In opposing directions) to allow the casing to flex more easily.3. Inner Tube
Tire casing is stitched into a hoop around a seamless latex inner tube. Roll over something sharp, and the latex tube is more likely to flex than puncture. If you do flat, a tubular stays on your rim as you brake and stop. A clincher is much more likely to fly off your rim."
10804,"4. Coating

10806,"SRAM's simple, single-ring cyclocross drivetrain drops weight and mud—but not your chain
"
10807,"Traditionally, much of the equipment used for cyclocross racing—excluding frames and tires—came from the road. That's been changing with the sport's increased popularity, and now SRAM pushes this further with its new, 'cross-specific, single-ring drivetrain, Force CX1."
10808,"This drivetrain is based on SRAM's well regarded 1×11 mountain bike groups. A new rear derailleur ($235, 261g) works with a single chainring and has a cable-pull ratio tuned to SRAM's road shifters (compatible to either rim or hydraulic disc brakes). Because there's no changing between chainrings, the left shifter is fitted only with a brake lever. The 'cross-specific chainring ($126–$152, 80g/40-tooth) has teeth that are profiled to grip the chain in a way that keeps it from bouncing off, and additional cutouts keep mud from accumulating. You can get a crankset with a special logo on it, but that's strictly for style—it's the same as SRAM's Force 22 road crank.
The chainring teeth, made with alternating thicknesses, grab the sideplates—a simple solution that we can attest, after more than a year of testing, is effective.
However, the bulk of the chain-retention technology happens at the rear derailleur. Most modern rear derailleurs use a slant-parallelogram design: As it moves down toward harder gears, the upper pulley moves up toward the cogs. This helps keep the chain close to the cassette for easier, crisper shifts—great on smooth roads.
But when you hit a bump, vertical inputs also introduce some lateral movement of the chain, unseating it and causing ghost shifts. In contrast, the CX1 rear derailleur has a straight parallelogram—it's limited to purely horizontal motion. The derailleur can't move in the same direction as bumps. The derailleur also has a one-way clutch that damps the pulley cage's forward rotation, reducing the chain's tendency to bounce and slap on rough terrain. And the pulley teeth have the same profile as the chainring.
During testing, the chain stayed on across bumps harsh enough to bounce us out of the saddle, and also when we accidentally dropped the bike after a carry. We've jolted chains off SRAM's 1×11 mountain groups, but only in extremely rough terrain while riding full-suspension bikes, because of moving frame members. We haven't dropped one on a 'cross bike.
Shifting performance is smoother, crisper, and more positive than with SRAM's multi-ring drivetrains, particularly when you force high-torque shifts in bumpy situations. The straight parallelogram and one-way clutch system doesn't seem to require more effort to shift, but there's a nice resistance, and clearly audible and tactile detents let you know you're in a new gear, which we appreciate in the chaos of a 'cross race.
Though the rear derailleur is heavier than regular Force 22 (261g vs. 186g), the system eliminates the front derailleur, the front shift mechanism, one chainring, and a cable and housing which, combined, shave around 200g.
There are always compromises, of course. The double-tap action of the shifter can occasionally cause consternation—it's easy to bump the paddle in rough terrain and fire off an unwanted upshift, and sometimes if jostled midshift you might fail to throw the lever far enough to activate a full shift, causing the chain to partially ride up and then drop back down. Experience reduces these occurrences, but they still happen to us after many years of riding SRAM."
10809,"And the rear derailleur isn't compatible with multi-ring drivetrains. You have to use a single ring, which can limit your gear choices or, if you choose the cassette with the biggest range, leave you with larger jumps between gears than you'd like. Rings are offered in 38, 40, 42, 44, and 46 teeth (all sized for 110mm bolt-circle diameter). Cassettes come in 11-25, 11-26, 11-28, 11-30, and 11-32. If you're planning to do a lot of racing on different courses in a variety of weather, we recommend getting a few different cassettes and rings so you can fine-tune your range on race day—and go for the longer-cage derailleur needed to use the 11-32 cassette, if it comes to that.
CX1 isn't for all 'cross bikes. Adding it makes your bike less versatile, especially for riding outside course-marking tape. But we think that, for most 'cross racers, the benefits are worth the compromises."

"
10828,"It took me just one, 40-mile ride—climbing Malibu's Yerba Buena Road and dropping down into Decker Canyon—to become convinced that Cervélo's new Rca is the ultimate high performance bike. I had high expectations, and this bike exceeded them all: Nothing I’d ridden previously combines low weight, stiffness, handling, aerodynamics, and comfort in the sublime way that this bike does. Of course, at $10,000, this oligarch-only frame—of which only 325 will be made—should be among the best I’ve ever tested."
10829,"	On the road, the bike felt solid, significant, and confidence inspiring in my hands and under my feet. The geometry is proven—shared with other R-series bikes—which helps make it the best-descending Cervélo I’ve ever ridden, and one of the best-descending bikes I’ve tested from any brand. Marrying those angles with a frame that doesn’t dilute little motions and small changes in power makes it reactive and quick. It’s also stable, remaining composed in rough corners, and providing me with superb feedback."
10830,"	But the wonder of this bike is not only in how it rides—after all, your chances of riding, or even spotting an Rca outside WorldTour races, are infinitesimal. The real magic lies in the experiments with high-tech materials, and the lessons that Cervélo learned in building this wonder bike—technological gains expressed in a language native only to lab technicians wearing white coats. Hopefully, this bike’s tech will be passed on to the company’s production bikes in the coming seasons."
10831," High-Tech Machine
	In hatching a descendant of the 689-gram R5ca, Cervélo needed to raise the bar. That bike was exceptionally light and stiff. Cervélo says that three years after its debut it is still the lightest frame in the world, with the highest stiffness-to-weight ratio. But it was not designed with any regard for aerodynamics. However, Cervélo’s wind tunnel testing showed that the R5ca performed better than many traditional road bikes."
10832,"	With that insight came another: Adding just a little attention to aero shaping, a new bike could capture aero gains and maintain the R5ca’s superlative characteristics. Of course, combing those three traits—aerodynamic efficiency, stiffness, and low weight—presented engineers with a challenge. Typically, road bike designers need to choose two of those three traits, and compromise on the third."
10833,"
The Rca’s magic was readily apparent on our first ride. (Courtesy)"
10834,"	Cervélo developed the Rca using a suite of software tools, two of which are well known in the bike industry: Finite element analysis (FEA) helped the company evaluate structural performance and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) evaluated the aero performance. A third program, called Laminate Tools, is less common. Cervélo used it to understand how each individual piece of carbon in the frame functions. That's a large task: A 54cm Rca is comprised of 459 plies of composite, and uses seven different fiber materials, in 14 different orientations."
10835,"	Computer modeling is helpful, but once the designs were set, Cervélo turned to another resource that’s unusual in the cycling industry: Their own carbon manufacturing facility in Garden Grove, California, where every Project California bike is built. Because they own the facility (rather than contracting out manufacturing, a common practice), Cervélo can perform research and development quickly, testing various iterations and developing manufacturing technologies in-house that improve their frames. Plus, its location—amid facilities used by the United States’ defense and aerospace industries—gives them quick access to expertise and the latest materials."
10836,"  More Aerodynamic
	Using these tools, Cervélo designed 93 computer models of different frames before arriving at what became the Rca. The new bike reduced the frame’s weight by 30 grams and incurs 74 grams less drag than the R5ca—and 102 grams less drag than a Cannondale SuperSix Evo or Specialized Tarmac SL4—which saves a rider 7.4 watts at 40 km/h. For riders who only care about aerodynamics, Cervélo says its S5 is still the top of the heap—it generated 140g less drag, but weighs 300g more; an 54cm Rca frame with paint and hardware weighs 667 grams."
10837,"	The most obvious difference between the Rca and the R5ca it’s replacing—and the source of its aerodynamic gains—are the tube shapes. The tubes are “squoval” (squared oval), like on the R5ca, but have been revised with a ""nose"" on the leading edge, and redesigned corners on the trailing edge. The shaping (called Squoval3) is applied only where it serves an aerodynamic purpose: The down tube is quite square at the top because, Cervélo says, ""[it] is drafting in the wake of the front wheel, so aero shapes are less important and structural considerations can drive the shape."" But, further down, where the tube is exposed to more direct airflow, the tube gets the aerodynamic-enhancing nose. The result is a bike with some tubes that look similar to those found on the Scott Foil and the new Trek Madone, but Cervélo doesn’t share “Kamm Tail” or, “truncated airfoil,” nomenclature used by other brands."
10838,"
The down tube transitions from a square shape at the head tube to the Squoval3 design toward the bottom bracket. (Courtesy)"
10839,"	The hourglass-shaped head tube, minimalist seatstays, and seat tube have also been optimized to slice through the air. The top tube and chainstays don't have a nose because they have, ""virtually no effect on aerodynamics,"" the company says. Instead, they are optimized stiffness and comfort, and to reduce weight."
10840," New Materials
	The Rca is the first bicycle to incorporate two new composite material technologies. One is a nano-resin from 3M called PowerLux, just launched in February. The typical nano-resin is a nano-rubber, but PowerLux is a nano-silica resin. Nano-rubbers, says Cervélo, increase toughness at the expense of interlaminar shear strength (strength between layers) and compression strength. The nano-silica PowerLux improves both toughness and interlaminar sheer and compression strength. What does the jargon mean to you? Cervélo can use less material to further reduce weight, without weakening the frame. Of course, PowerLux is expensive—seven times more costly than the other composites used in the Rca—so it is only used in three areas, the down, seat, and top tubes."
10841,"	The other new material in the Rca is called Powermetal Nanovate, a nickel-plated carbon. Compared to other carbon materials, this one’s grains are 1000 times smaller, but still have a yield strength (point at which a material permantently deforms) that’s seven times that of typical nickel grains. Cervélo applies it to the fork steerer where, they say, it improves toughness without adding weight. A tougher steerer should improve its resistance to damage from over-torqued stem clamps, crashes, and handling mishaps that can lead to failure."
10842," Bulkheads
	One of the features pioneered in the R5ca and carried over to the Rca are internal reinforcement walls that Cervélo calls bulkheads. The company says that large diameter, thin walled carbon tubes can buckle, slightly, when subjected to high loads. One method to counter this effect is to increase the wall thickness of the tube, but that adds weight. Instead, Cervélo found that adding bulkheads to brace the walls results in similar stiffness gains with less additional weight than thickening the tube walls. The Rca has bulkheads in the down tube at the head tube, seat tube at the top tube, and above the bottom bracket shell."
10843," The Little Details
	In addition to several marquee technologies, Cervélo enhanced the Rca with a number of other small details."
10844,"	The bike has a fully internal, ""future proof"" cable routing system with an interchangeable click-in stops and blanks that accommodate mechanical, electronic, or even hydraulic systems. The derailleur cables enter the down tube behind the head tube because Cervélo feels it's better to cut holes in the top of the tube where there’s less stress, rather than the sides. The drive-side chainstay is at a slightly different angle than the non-drive stay, so a mechanical shift cable can run from the bottom bracket out though the dropout without a bend, for better shifting."
10845,"
The Rca’s ""Future Proof"" internal routing is compatible with mechanical, electronic, and hydraulic shifting systems. (Courtesy)"
10846,"	Cervélo found 5 grams of weight savings in the dropouts, into which the stays are bonded, reversing the method used on most carbon bikes. This results in less redundant material—and the weight savings."
10847,"	The Rca also uses Cervélo's BBright bottom bracket standard, but the company tweaked it slightly, filling in some unused space on the outside of the chainstays and opening up the inside the stays for more tire clearance—the bike easily accommodates 25mm tires, and even some 28mm models will fit."
10848,"	In a nod towards the proliferation of power meters, the Rca has an integrated neodymium magnet in the bottom bracket area, which will work with crank-based systems from SRM and SRAM."
10849," What It Means to You
	While the highlighted features and technologies Cervélo developed for the Rca are only found in this one, rarified, frame, much of those developments will eventually trickle down to Cervélo's mass production bikes. Already, technologies developed for the R5ca—CNC pattern cutting of composites, molded in-carbon bearing races, the BBright bottom bracket, and the bulkheads—are found in production bikes."
10850,"	Newer materials and processes are often costly, but slowly over time the prices will come down, and we’ll start to see materials like PowerLux and Powermetal Nanovate in other Cervélo bikes—as well as those from other brands."
10851,"	Some of this bike’s other details may be adopted more quickly—particularly the Squoval3 tube shapes. That alone would improve the aerodynamics with minimal weight gain. The fat-tire friendly BBright, ""future-proof"" cable routing, built in magnet, dropouts, and ""straight shot"" drive side chainstay, seem like upgrades that could easily show up in future versions of Cervélo's R, S and P series frames."

10853,Details and first-ride impressions of Campagnolo’s least-expensive drivetrain
10854,"About a year ago, Campagnolo unveiled Potenza, a new mid-range group designed to compete against Shimano’s mighty Ultegra group. While Campagnolo’s battle to take original equipment (OE) specification away from Shimano on models in your local bike shop continues, Potenza is an excellent group. Over a year after its introduction, and months after this review, it remains in regular use and continues to impress."
10855,     RELATED: Shimano Ultegra Vs. Campagnolo Potenza
10856,"Today, Campagnolo is launching another new mid-tier drivetrain. Centaur 11 is Campagnolo’s lowest price drivetrain, and it too was designed to compete against a powerhouse Shimano group: 105. (While Campy has had groups with the Centaur name in the past, they've all been 10-speed.) "
10857,"Meet Centaur 11
	With the introduction of Centaur 11, all of Campagnolo’s groups (Super Record, Record, Chorus, Potenza, and now Centaur) are 11-speed."
10858,
10859,
10860,"According to Campagnolo’s press manager, Joshua Riddle, the similarities between the groups are deeper than the number of speeds. At Centaur’s press launch, Riddle stated the company’s engineers “dedicate a great deal of time ensuring that current Campagnolo performance standards eventually permeate the entire range.” The goal with Centaur was to create an “affordable group set without offering entry-level performance or features,” and the resulting group is “very similar to Super Record in everything but material usage and weight.” "
10861,"And if you view the Centaur parts along side Campagnolo’s other mechanical shifting groups, you can see a strong familial resemblance in the four-arm crank, the shape of the ErgoPower bodies, the double-curved brake levers, and the long rod front derailleur."
10862,
10863,
10864,"Centaur will be available in new-school black (available May), or in classic polished silver (available September)."
10865,     RELATED: First Look: Campagnolo’s New Potenza Drivetrain
10866,"Crankset
	The big news in the Centaur crankset is the adoption of Campagnolo’s Ultra Torque BB-axle system. UltraTorque (UT) consists of two 25mm half axles on each crank arm which mate in the middle using a Hirth joint. The bottom bracket bearings are pressed onto the axles, which means Ultra-Torque’s BB cups are just that: cups only. According to Campagnolo’s technical information, UT allows for low profile crank arms (greater ankle clearance, and narrow Q-factor) while still positioning the bearings as far outboard as possible, which improves rigidity."
10867,
10868,
10869,"Previously, Campagnolo’s representatives had said the Ultra Torque was too expensive to implement in a lower-cost drivetrain, so the company’s lower end drivetrains—including Potenza—used a system called Power Torque. Power Torque was similar to Shimano’s HollowTech and SRAM’s GXP system: the non-drive arm pressed onto the long axle attached to the drive-side crank arm."
10870,"But Riddle stated that Campagnolo’s engineers had since found ways to execute Ultra Torque in ways that are cost effective enough to bring them to Centaur. And, in a running change, Potenza cranks will switch over to Ultra Torque as well. That means all of Campagnolo’s current cranks use the same axle and BB-cup system."
10871,
10872,
10873,"The rest of the crank info you want to know: The arms are solid aluminum with a lightning pocket on the back side (Potenza’s arms are hollow aluminum); 53/36 and 50/34 ring combinations will be available (the Centaur cranks are compatible with all Campy four-arm chainrings, so it is possible to mount a 53/39 combo as well); and three lengths are offered: 170, 172.5, and 175 millimeters."
10874,"ErgoPower
	Like Potenza, Centaur uses Campanolo’s Power Shift system. It still follow’s Campagnolo’s “One lever, one action” philosophy, but it’s a less-complex shifting scheme than the Ultra Shift found in Campagnolo’s Chorus, Record, and Super Record mechanical groupsets."
10875,
10876,
10877,"The main difference between Power Shift and Ultra Shift is the former does not have the ability to do multiple rear-derailleur upshifts (higher/harder) in a single press; instead, they must be fired off one by one. This difference explains Centaur’s (and Potenza’s) dropped, downward angled shifter button on the inside of the ErgoPower bodies (in Ergo Power, the lever is flat-topped, and sits higher)."
10878,"The Power Shift internals in Centaur use different, and more durable, material than what was found in Potenza. However, Riddle indicated that a running change will see this new material incorporated into the Potenza internals as well."
10879,
10880,
10881,"Though the shifting system is different (Power Shift and Ultra Shift components are not interchangeable), the shape of Centaur’s ErgoPower bodies and brake levers are the same as the rest of Campagnolo’s groups (disc or rim brake; mechanical or electronic shifting). In the rider’s hands, Centaur offers the same experience as the company’s higher-end products."
10882,"Derailleurs
	Centaur’s front derailleur uses the long-rod design that debuted with the current iteration of Super Record. The longer arm reduces the force required to shift into the big ring, for lighter shifter action."
10883,
10884,
10885,"Out back, the Centaur rear derailleur is offered in a single mid-cage length that is compatible with cassettes from 11-32 to 11-25. A new pulley wheel design is claimed to reduce friction and noise at more extreme chain angles."
10886,
10887,
10888,"To simplify the design for the lower cost group, the Centaur rear derailleur does not use the EMBRACE derailleur design—claimed to keep the chain closer to the cassette for faster and more precise shifts, and better power transfer—found in the company’s higher-end mechanical drivetrains. Instead, Centaur’s rear derailleur employs a “new trajectory angle” to mimic some of the benefits of EMBRACE."
10889,"Cassettes
	Centaur brings with it Campagnolo’s lowest priced cassettes yet. At less than $100, you could buy five Centaur cassettes for the price of one $536 Super Record cassette."
10890,
10891,
10892,"Offered in 11-29, 11-32, and 12-32 combinations, the Centaur cassette uses all steel cogs with basic (less expensive) finish. The three largest cogs are grouped on a carrier, with eight individual cogs making up the rest of the cassette."
10893,"Brakes
	At this time, Centaur is only offered as a rim brake group. Its dual pivot brakes resemble Potenza’s, but with fewer weight-saving details."
10894,
10895,
10896,"In another bit of trickle-up news, Centaur launches another new aluminum-rim brake pad compound to the company’s line. Building on the excellent pad that Campagnolo debuted in Potenza, this new pad is claimed to offer improved feel and performance and will trickle up into the company’s higher-end groups."
10897,     RELATED: The Italian Job
10898,"Price and Weight vs Shimano 105
	Coming in at 2,484 grams (claimed) for the complete rim-brake group, and selling for €571.10 (about $624 at time of conversion), Centaur looks well positioned to compete against 105. Shimano’s group sells for about $680 complete at full MSRP (it can often be bought online for much less, however), and weighs around 2,540 grams."
10899,"First Impressions
	A bit more than a year ago, I was with Campagnolo in the same location as they launched their Potenza group. As I pedaled the same roads on Centaur, it felt a bit like Groundhog Day. Centaur may be heavier and less expensive than Potenza, but it feels and functions identically. That’s a compliment."
10900,
10901,
10902,"The shifters have medium-light throws; distinctive, positive clicks; and they travel smoothly. There’s a feeling of quality and precision in them that eclipses Shimano’s 105 and SRAM’s Apex. Shifts are crisp, accurate, fast-ish; every shift is announced with a bit of a racket, but once a gear is selected, the drivetrain runs smooth and quietly, even in extreme cross over gears."
10903,
10904,
10905,"The brakes are good too: light and smooth action, excellent power and modulation. The new aluminum-rim compatible pads seem to offer the same or slightly better performance as the pads they replace (first launched with Potenza), but have a firmer, more positive and confidence inspiring feel, especially near lockup."
10906,
10907,
10908,"I’ve written before that Campagnolo, because it is Campagnolo, can get a pass for things that would be unacceptable if they were to come from any other company. But the Campy Card isn’t required with Centaur. This low-end group, based on my first ride, is the benchmark entry-level performance group set. And that makes Centaur more significant, and more relevant, than the high-end groups Campagnolo is best known for."
10909,"Make these four adjustments for maximum protection
"
10910,"We see too many riders with a helmet game so sloppy they may as well leave the lid at home. Follow this advice for proper fit from Randy Swart, director of the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute in Arlington, Virginia.
1. Place the helmet on your head so it's level front-to-back—when you look up, the front should barely be visible—and not listing to one side.
2. Tighten the strap just enough against your chin so that it pulls your helmet down a bit when you open your mouth.
3. The Y of the strap should fall just below each ear.
4. Adjust so that the lid is snug but not too tight. (It shouldn't move when you shake your head, or leave a mark on your forehead.)Final Test
Gently push the front of your helmet up and back. If it moves more than an inch, readjust."
10911,This cargo bike has a unique front steering mechanism designed to make carrying large loads easier
10912,"The Yuba Supermarché lets you carry huge loads in a variety of ways with an extended front wheel and plenty of pannier attachment points. The sturdy aluminum frame weighs 55 pounds alone, and can carry up to 250 lbs in the front with an additional 80 lbs in the back. It’s perfect for grabbing groceries, shuttling kids to the park, or getting anywhere you want to go with a big load. "
10913,RELATED: The Best Cargo Bike for Every Rider
10914,"You might be wondering how the bars can turn the front wheel if they’re not connected with a traditional steer tube. The answer is in a unique steering mechanism guided by four barrel-adjustable cables, like what you might find on a mechanical brake. It responds similarly to a regular bike, and gives you a lot more space for cargo. You can even adjust how responsive you want your steering to feel. "
10915,

Even the cargo box (sold separately) is customizable, with a padded seat available for kids and a variety of safety belt options."
10918,"The Supermarché is no climbing machine—it’s a big rig meant to haul big loads. But it boasts exceptional stability thanks to a low center of gravity and easy-loading double kickstand. If you’ve been thinking about going car-free more often, the Yuba Supermarche could be a great option. "
10919,Can't decide if you need a pannier or a backpack? This stylish two-for-one has you covered.
10920,"I’m always on the hunt for the ultimate backpack, and my search thus far has been both thorough and extensive. When you schlep all your stuff to work by bike every day year-round, it’s weird how passionately you start to care about seemingly minor elements of your bag, like ease of compartment access and strap placement. I never would have expected those little things to become sources of such fanatical assessment and debate, but after trying too many packs with painful straps and unwieldy buckles, here we are."
10921,Making left turns in traffic is also tricky. Here's how to do it right. 
10922,"Blackburn’s Wayside Backpack Pannier has risen through the ranks of my list for a few reasons. For one, it’s lighter than my previous pack while being equally water resistant and sturdy, thanks to a waxed canvas exterior. It also has large, easily accessed front zipper pockets that are big enough to carry a thermos, phone, and wallet; with interior pen compartments, and mesh side holders for toting water bottles. All the straps are highly adjustable so that the padded backpack straps fall in a natural position and the chest straps can be moved up or down to add more support while comfortably accommodating boobs (you’d be surprised how often this is overlooked). There’s also a looped strip of nylon down the center so you can attach a bike light as high or low on the bag as you want."
10923,RELATED: The Year's Best Commuter Bags
10924,"On the inside of the bag, there’s room for up to a 15-inch laptop in the padded laptop sleeve, and abundant space for all my cycling layers. The interior fabric is patterned like a topographical map—a nice touch of flair on an otherwise clean and simple design. The bag’s Velcro and snap rolltop closure is easy to adjust depending on the size of your cargo."
10925,"One of the coolest features of the bag is also the one I used the least: The bag converts into a pannier so you don’t have to lug everything on your back. Just tuck the backpack straps into the bag’s hidden pouch and use the included Velcro straps to attach it to your rack. It takes some time to get it snug and secure, and it definitely works best if you have enough stuff loaded into the bag that it’s not billowing around or crumpling into your spokes. For the most part I use the bag in backpack mode, but it’s nice to have that bonus functionality for trips home from the library with heavy books."

"
10950,"We know what you’re thinking – does the world really need a carbon fat bike much less an aluminum one? After a handful of rides on our test Bucksaw 1 aluminum fat bike, my answer is, “Absolutely.”"
10951,"Already, the Bucksaw is the most surprising bike I’ve ridden in years. If you think you know fat bikes you don’t really know them until you’ve ridden one with suspension. The performance that full suspension brings to the ride of a fat bike opens the door to big-time fun on rough technical and even hard packed trails and places you wouldn’t think a 4-inch wide tire would work very well. The only thing better would be one that’s lighter and stiffer, and that’s just what Salsa has in store with the carbon version."

11041,"No longer synonymous with a rough ride, aluminum is back in demand—and the frames are smoother than ever
"
11042,"Just 10 years ago, most high-quality bikes sold in the United States were made from aluminum or related alloys. As recently as 2003, our annual Buyer’s Guide featured only a handful of ­carbon-fiber models. And in the first years of this century, pros rode aluminum race bikes alongside carbon-fiber models at the sport’s most celebrated events.
	Then the carbon-­composite craze took hold and so commenced the great aluminum disappearing act. High-end road bikes were the first to go. Top-of-the-line hardtail mountain bikes were next, quickly followed by suspension and midpriced bikes. Aluminum’s 20-year run at the pinnacle of the sport ended with shocking abruptness.
	By 2005, most manufacturers had relegated aluminum to value models and hybrids, but a few continued to build impressive frames out of it. More recently, improvements to the way the metal can be manipulated have led to better-performing bikes, encouraging large and small builders to re-embrace aluminum’s value and performance. Nowadays, the material increasingly occupies an important niche between entry-level models and expensive carbon machines, in both road and mountain bikes. And there are few signs that aluminum’s resurgence will slow.Elements of Choice 
	The earliest widely available aluminum frames were made in the mid-1970s by brands like Vitus and Alan. They were built with straight-gauge tubing that was similar in diameter to the steel tubes commonly used at the time. These so-called “glued and screwed” frames (a reference to their construction, which relied on mechanical joints rather than welds) had a pleasant ride quality, but were overly flexy, making them scary on descents and ineffective in sprints.
	Cannondale and Klein pioneered aluminum 2.0 in the 1980s and early ’90s—the light, stiff frames were TIG-welded from thin, large-diameter,­ straight-wall tubes. Oversize aluminum frames ­originally were designed for durability, says Chuck Teixeira, a 28-year veteran of Easton’s materials department who now directs advanced R&D for Specialized. But extending the life span of the bikes came with an unintended consequence: an immense stiffness that created a harsh ride. As a result, the metal earned a bad rap that has proven hard to shake, even though stiffness isn’t an inherent property of the material."

	Also playing a role are recent innovations in manufacturing techniques that allow brands to build lower-cost aluminum bikes that have a ride quality similar to carbon models, says Teixeira. One of the key advances has been the widespread adoption of hydroforming, a process that uses pressurized hydraulic fluid to press aluminum into intricate shapes. The technique allows builders to create light, stiff, and strong frames that don’t have the buckboard ride of past models.
	Although aluminum’s advances­ have been impressive, even the best tubes can’t match the stiffness or weight savings of high-grade carbon fiber. But the gap is closing and, importantly, aluminum comes at a lower price. According to Nova Cycles Supply, a major supplier of ­tubesets to custom frame builders, preassembled carbon-fiber rear triangles can sell for almost three times as much as complete Columbus aluminum versions. And Specialized’s Teixeira says global demand is inflating carbon’s price at a faster rate than aluminum’s.
	The metal’s physical qualities are also winning over custom builders, who traditionally have favored steel or titanium pipes. Aluminum is about a third as dense as steel, and what it lacks in inherent stiffness can be made up by forming­ the tubes into stronger structures. Unlike titanium, which is so hard that it wears out tools used to cut and shape it, ­aluminum is relatively soft. This makes it easier to manipulate into tubes of varying thicknesses and shapes—yet another quality that is partly responsible for aluminum’s comeback."

	In the end, aluminum’s most striking impact may come at the hands of craftsmen like Gaulzetti. While he is a custom frame builder, he’s no traditionalist. For his day job he manages Boston’s International Bicycle Center, where he sells bikes from Trek, Ibis, and Pinarello. And he freely admits that the best carbon bikes today are nothing short of amazing. His niche, however, is rooted in the spirit of the ingenious, creative tinkerer. Custom frame builders have long attracted customers by promising something unique and more personal than what a big bike manufacturer offers. But Gaulzetti wasn’t interested in simply being different; he wanted to build a bike that, from a performance standpoint, rode like none he’d experienced.
	To do this, he needed a material he could design himself, not in Asia with a manufacturing partner. He needed a material that offered him the chance to customize his own parts, in his own workshop. And he needed a material that could satisfy the myriad, at times even contradictory, needs of a discerning cyclist. To move forward, all he had to do was look back."
11049,"With the new S5, Cervélo raises (and redesigns) the bar for aero road bikes
"
11050,"The Cervélo S5 could have returned unchanged and still been considered a great model. The bike won our Editor’s Choice award in 2012 and is still, arguably, at or near the head of its class in terms of aerodynamics and ride quality. Not a company to rest on its laurels, however, Cervélo took a look at the S5’s weaknesses and addressed them head-on with the redesigned 2015 version. Plus, the company took its aero knowledge to a component for the first time—the handlebar. After spending two days on the bike in the desert surrounding Tucson, Arizona; I can say that Cervélo’s mission was accomplished: The refined S5 retains the strengths of the current version and fills in the previous voids, leaving you with one heck of an aero road bike."
11051,"Raising the Bar
	Like the other models in the S-series, the S5 prioritizes aerodynamics over all else. Cervélo says that the latest revision is 21.3 watts faster at 40 kilometers per hour than the old version (when built with Shimano Dura-Ace Di2). That number becomes impressive when you factor in the 35 percent stiffer headtube, 17 percent more laterally rigid fork, and 6 percent stiffer bottom bracket area—all without gaining any weight. Just as significant is the improvement in overall looks because—let’s be frank here—the prior version wasn’t the most beautiful bike in the world. Cervélo evened out the frame’s proportions and angles, particularly in the head tube area and fork, to give it a much-improved look."
11052,"Cervélo kept many of the S5’s best features, like the dropped down tube that closes the gap between the down tube and the front wheel, the flat section on the down tube for improved aerodynamics with bottles on the bike, and the patented seat tube cutout that keep the rear tire tucked in tight and out of the airflow. The seatstay junction with the seat tube still shields the standard rear brake caliper from the wind, too."
11053,"The list of changes is much longer: Cervélo says it improved 31 areas of the bike. The most significant is an increase in the S5’s stiffness, which brought the bike to similar levels as those found on the R5. The frame shape was tweaked to be wider wherever possible, and tolerances were tightened. The company also borrowed manufacturing techniques from other models to make a stiffer bike. Cervélo says it tried 75 different layups for the head tube on the 56cm size alone to come up with a frame that it says is “right on the edge with material use.” Cervélo also says its aero tube profiles are exactly 3:1, to the millimeter, which makes the frame legal for UCI-sanctioned events. Plus, the new frame now fits 25c tires and every wide road wheel currently on the market. The Di2 battery is internally located at the bottom of the downtube, just in front of the bottom bracket. A keyed seatpost binder stays put even when the seatpost isn’t in place and will be much appreciated by those who travel and have had to fish a binder out of a frame before. The frame is electronic-, mechanical-, and hydraulic-ready thanks to a modular cable stop system. The old straight 1-1/8” steerer has been replaced with a tapered version with a 1-3/8” lower bearing. The interface with the downtube has been cleaned up so it no longer interferes and makes contact with the fork at extreme rotation angles."
11054,"Geometry, and thus handling, is the same as the current S5, with one change: Cervélo did lower the head tube to better reflect this bike’s intentions as a serious race machine. The head tube is 15mm lower on a size 56."
11055,"Cervélo’s new, all-carbon aero road bar features internally routed cables and a 31.8mm oversized bar mount. (Photo courtesy of Cervélo)"
11056,"Redesigning the Bar
	During Cervélo’s aero testing, the company noticed an interesting statistic: 30 percent of the bike’s aero drag was coming from the handlebar, compared to just 16 percent from the frame. Realizing this untapped aero potential, Cervélo developed an aero bar that it says is 4.4 watts faster than a traditional round bar. The company claims it couldn’t find another aero bar that tests faster. The new, all-carbon bar features internally routed cables and a 31.8mm oversized bar mount. It has 80mm of reach and 128mm of drop with generous wrist clearance, and is offered in 40-, 42- and 44cm widths measured center to center. It will be offered separate from the bike if you get the Ultegra 6800 build, and costs $400."
11057,"Preserving the Ride
	Generally speaking, I don't like aero road bikes. Aerodynamics is the next frontier in the quest for speed, and aero bikes may be faster over the long haul, but I like to ride in the moment. In other words, I don’t care about the time saved at the end of a ride if the bike beats me up and handles poorly on the way there. Compromise is a term I often associate with this style of road bike because they’re often simply lacking in stiffness and ride quality compared to traditional road frame designs."
11058,"But Cervélo's current S5 is my personal favorite in the category because to me, it feels the most like a non-aerodynamically optimized road machine, with a great ride quality and stiffness through the back of the bike (though the bike’s intentions, particularly in the front, felt a bit vague under hard cornering). Surprisingly, the feedback from the front of the bike was smooth and muted—unusual for an aero road bike, and almost too muted for my tastes."
11059,"On a ride in Saguaro National Park, the S5 responded instantly to our tester’s on-the-rivet adjustments. (Photo by Jay Prasuhn)"
11060,"The biggest and most tangible improvement on the new S5 is the front-end stiffness. The bike now feels solid when a quick mid-turn line correction is needed, or when I am leaping from the saddle for a burst of speed over a small roller. I really noticed this trait on my first ride, a quick 8-mile lap around Saguaro National Park. I was following Cervélo staff who knew the route, so I found myself making late turn corrections, not knowing the turn radius, road conditions, and how fast I could push it. The S5 responded instantly to my on-the-rivet adjustments, just like a good road bike should. I’m not sure about the feel of the handlebar, which is flat on top, but the shape grew on me during the two rides, and may continue to over time."
11061,"By aero bike standards, the ride is smooth and very close to that of a traditional road race bike. The front end might have lost a touch of smoothness compared to the old version, but the new S5 feels much more connected to the road. That’s a tradeoff I’m willing to make."
11062,"The highlight of the trip happened on day two, when Tom Danielson and Cervélo’s Engineering Project Manager, Graham Shrive, rode off the front of the group as we rolled out on a loop called Pistol Hill. I was taking off my jacket, so the two got quite a ways up the road before I was able to pursue them. I chased hard, but never stood a chance as they rolled out of sight. Hammering to catch up, and then settling into my own pace until we regrouped up by Pistol Hill, I pretty much forgot about the fact that I was riding an aero bike. It just felt like a good, fast, all-around road bike."
11063,"There is only one S5 platform now— the VWD is gone, and all models now incorporate the same high-level frame. In addition to a frameset for $4,500, the S5 will be offered as a complete bike. Two Dura-Ace builds will feature Rotor 3D+ cranks, Hed Jet 6 Plus SCT wheels, Continental Gran Prix tires, Fiz’ik Antares saddles, and the new Cervélo carbon bar. The Di2 version costs $10,000 while the mechanical Dura-Ace build will set you back $8,000. An Ultegra 6800 build costs $5,500 and comes with Mavic Cosmic Elite S wheels. The new S5 will be available on November 15."

11066,"I put on a cycling cap every day that I ride my bike. I've done so pretty much since I became a professional cyclist, when I felt that I had finally earned the right. Lately though, I sometimes feel ridiculous. Now that I am retired, why do I still feel the compulsion to stick so resolutely to this tradition, looking in the mirror each morning, straightening my peak before I head out the door?"
11067,"	Many of us have a bit of a 'first girlfriend' syndrome with cycling, an intensity and excitement that springs from the image of the sport the way it was when we first found it. For me, the cycling cap is central in that image. I haven't moved on from a scorching July day in France in 1990 where I watched a yellow-jersey-clad Greg LeMond help his Team Z teammate Ronan Pensec to victory in a post-Tour criterium. It was an important milestone for me: Not only was it the first professional bike race I saw in person, but it was also the day I bought my first cycling cap—and began an almost lifelong association between those distinct little cotton caps and the sport I love."
11068," IN THE EARLY days of pro racing, the cycling cap was purely functional. Riders wore plain, white skullcaps that eventually turned shades of brown and grey with dust from the rough roads of austerity on which cycling grew up. There was something a little ironic about the cycling cap then. The riders of the day were tough men—more like coal miners and boxers than the svelte thoroughbreds of recent years—and the cap was a dainty thing. In pictures it looks as if riders thrust the caps onto their heads in disgust, as though forced to by their mothers, to avoid catching a chill."
11069,"	Up until the sixties I can plot the cycling cap's history only by studying the kind of black-and-white images that have become so iconic you wonder if reality at the time was in color at all. I found a little color through the eyes of Colin Lewis, a member of the 1967 British Tour de France team. Lewis is renowned for his love of cycling caps—his teammates, he tells me, used to joke that he ""had a six-inch nail in his forehead to hang the thing on."""
11070,"	When Lewis began racing in the early sixties, cycling caps were popular among riders, but they weren't easy to come by. ""Times were harder then and racing caps cost money, so not everyone would have them,"" Lewis said. ""No one had helmets, and a cap was very practical; firstly it would keep the sun out of our eyes, secondly it absorbed the sweat, and thirdly it kept the rain and muck out."" ""When I turned pro, along with our salary we got 24 cans of Mackeson's Stout and six racing caps a month,"" he continued. ""But we still got them infrequently because the guy in charge of distributing them was selling them on the side!"""
11071,"	For Lewis, the cycling cap was a badge of honor, a mark of professionalism, and not something a rider would want to give away. ""When I got selected for the Tour de France, my team gave me something like 10 cotton racing hats. I was very fond of a good starched racing cap, and I was proud of having a nice fresh one on each day,"" he said. ""But on day three, Tom Simpson came alongside me during a bit of a lull on this long stage and said, 'Gi's your hat.' I said, 'Sorry?' He said, 'Give us your hat!' I said, 'Well, what for?' And he said, 'I want to have a shit and I need to wipe my arse on something!' I had to ride bloody 200k with a bare head, then."""
11072,"	The cycling cap may have been a very functional piece of kit, but its real evolution began when it became viable to do exactly what Lewis had been so reluctant to embrace: give it away. In the seventies, as the cost of producing caps came down and sports marketing evolved, the cycling cap became the ultimate souvenir—a link between a generation of cycling fans and their heroes. For a sponsor, the idea of someone wearing your brand on his head was no doubt worth the production cost of any number of thousands of hats per year."
11073," OVER THE NEXT two decades, the cap enjoyed a high water mark: TI-Raleigh riders storming the Alps with their caps pushed up high on their heads; Sean Kelly hitting the cobbles with his cap turned backward like a man ready to dive into a fight; Giuseppe Saronni, impeccable with his peak flipped up at the front, signing autographs in his Colnago-branded rainbow jersey."
11074,"	Wearing the cycling cap became an art in itself. The greats all had their own styles, and the rest of us gleefully imitated them. The cap stood proud on the heads of professional cyclists not only in races, but also in their team postcards, on podiums, as well as on the heads of managers, mechanics, and fans alike; the whole cycling family had chosen the cap as its dress code. The cap also became an attainable sign of allegiance for fans. ""When I was growing up in Idaho in the 1980s,"" says Luke Batten, co-creator of the popular Tenspeed Hero blog, ""we just wanted to be a part of the culture any chance we had. We could not afford a Campagnolo-equipped bike, but we could afford a Campagnolo cap."" This was also when caps started showing up in pop culture—most famously on Spike Lee in She's Gotta Have It and later perched on Wesley Snipes in White Men Can't Jump."
11075,"	It was around the nineties, though, that things started to change for us pros. In 1991, UCI rules stated that helmets were optional for professionals but compulsory for amateurs. The immediate effect was that to any aspiring young amateur forced to wear a helmet, the cycling cap became the mark of a true professional. The rule stood until 2003, when helmets became mandatory for everyone."
11076,"	Perhaps it is quite telling that the entire period in which I longed to be a professional spanned almost exactly these years. (After going to my first race in 1990, I would turn pro in 2003 with Amore e Vita.) By then, I knew in my heart the cycling cap's days in racing were numbered. And I had managed to race just once in a cap as a trainee the previous autumn. In time, most riders chose to train in helmets, too. The two weren't mutually exclusive, but the number of occasions when we wanted to stuff a cap under a lid was limited to the very cold and the very wet. Suddenly the cycling cap seemed to have no place. The cap got outmaneuvered off the bike too, usurped by the more uniformly accepted baseball hat. Cycling caps, with their various crooks and peaks and funny angles, had potential to go wrong on the podium. Baseball hats not only did the job, they were also an obvious choice for a younger generation of bike riders influenced more by popular culture than by cycling tradition. And by 2010 the cycling cap no longer seemed to have a practical purpose. A few riders would pull crumpled ones out of their pockets and don them at the cafe, and some would wear them to the start of races and give them away to spectators. The cap that had once protected necks from sunshine, eyes from rain, and unified the cycling world and those who wished to be a part of it was almost nowhere to be seen."
11077,"	The idea that the cycling cap might one day die off seems a bit far-fetched, but it takes only one generation for things to change. Mine might never forget it, because the cap is so central to the way cycling was when we first fell in love with it. But what about the young kids discovering cycling today, whose heads will be filled with images of riders who roll up to the start line with impressive haircuts and then climb onto the podium in a baseball hat?"

11083,"FORTUNATELY, THE CAP is experiencing something of a renaissance that might yet be its saving grace. While no one was really watching, cycling caps stopped being the uniform of just the dedicated cyclist, and became instead an identity patch for all sorts of people. Tenspeed Hero and many other specialty makers now design caps that are bought and worn all over the world by everyone from cycling enthusiasts to fashion-conscious creative types. Amazingly, perhaps because of this hip rebirth, the cycling cap has found its way into the peloton again. Mark Cavendish consistently appears at the start of races with a cap placed jauntily on his head. One might be tempted to think that the British sprinter is being flippant, but Cavendish is a rider who acknowledges the traditions and history of cycling. It is conjecture of course, but I feel his adoption of the cap is a way to show that he understands the rich heritage of the sport that he is now, and will forever be, a part of."
11084,"	Had the cycling cap existed solely for function, it would have gone the way of toe clips, plus fours, and goggles. Thankfully it has proved that it is more than that. No other sport uses similar headwear, which makes it uniquely ours. And that is its true essence: It is more than a functional or promotional item. Just like a policeman's hat or a soldier's ceremonial headgear, the cycling cap has come to mean something much greater than the sum of its four cotton panels and tiny brim."
11085,"	The cap might be an old institution, its real function all but gone, but people are wearing them again. I cannot truthfully be sure of their reasons. In the cold light of day I tell myself I wear mine because I am a fan of the sport. I have a BigMat cap that belonged to a dear French friend with whom I raced many years ago and whose company the geography of our diverging lives forces me to miss. I have caps from teams I myself have ridden for. I have caps from small brands trying to get started and others that bear the logos of some of the most famous brands in cycling. And although I no longer wear it, I have that Team Z cap that I bought all that time ago."
11086,"	But really, I wear mine because I am a little stuck in time. I am stuck in a time when cycling caps were what professionals wore, and I wanted to be one, and maybe somewhere in the recesses of my brain I long to look at the sport through eyes that I'll never have again."

The Saddle Fit Kit allows mechanics to eliminate saddle discrepancies and reliably measure to a fixed point. The tool affixes to any saddle with a toe clip strap and has notches on the edge to measure to. Sold separately are a series of “bullets” to hook the measuring tape into for an accurate and repeatable center; they can be put into hollow crank arms or replace the preload cap on the non-drive arm on a Shimano crank. This gives you a consistent and accurate starting point. Price is TBD but should be in the $150 ballpark, with an estimated $20 for the 8mm or 10mm bullets and $25 for the Shimano crank preload tool. —M.Y."

11273,"There are more snow, slop, sand, and trail-busting options than ever. Below are some of our favorites, and what you need to know before buying your own. "
11274,"A fat bike is the perfect tool for extending your riding season if you live where it’s snowy or wet, or where riding a regular-tire mountain bike is futile, not fun, and might damage the trails. Fat bikes are also highly functional for bikepacking, and for riding on sand, because larger tires that are run at low pressure float over soft surfaces, which can smooth out your ride even on a frame without suspension."
11275,"Recently, fat bike tires are getting wider for more float in extreme conditions, and the bikes are being built lighter with higher performance in mind. Plus, dropper posts are becoming increasingly common on stock builds, making it easier to ride technical terrain, and riders are outfitting these bikes as gear haulers for backcountry trips."
11276,"And more manufacturers are paying attention to Q Factor (or stance width), which is the distance between the outside of one crank arm to the outside of the opposite crank arm. To create the clearance for wider tires, brands use wider rear hub spacing (up to 197mm—a typical mountain bike has a 148m-wide rear hub). Wider rear hub spacing requires that the crankset be shifted outboard to maintain a reasonable chain angle for proper shifting, which increases the stance width of the cranks. Wider-stance cranks can cause knee or hip pain in some riders. If this is you, look for a fat bike with a narrower bottom bracket shell (less than 100mm)."
11277,In the market for a fat bike? Here’s what you should be thinking about as you shop around.
11278,[Related: All of the Different Types of Bicycles- Explained]
11279,"A hardtail with a rigid fork is the most affordable and most common type of fat bike. Because most of these bikes use 4- to 5-inch-wide tires, and because you typically run those tires at low pressure, even a rigid bike can feel like it has suspension as the tires conform to irregularities in the trail. If your riding surface is particularly uneven, rooty, or rocky, or you want to run your tires at a higher pressure for less squirm, consider buying a fat bike with full suspension. A full-suspension setup can help you maneuver better, keep you from feeling beat up after a long ride, and make the ride more enjoyable if you swap fat rims for standard mountain bike rims. However, if you typically ride in extremely cold temperatures, a rigid fork may be more reliable. "
11280,"Some fat bikes are designed to accommodate both fat-tire rims and standard 27.5 or 29-inch mountain bike rims. If you don’t want to ride fat tires all year, buying a frame with multiple configuration options lets you have one bike with multiple personalities. In snow or sand, run it with a fat-tire setup. Buy a set of mountain bike wheels with narrower rims and equip them with smaller tires, and you have another option that’s lighter and may be better suited to everyday riding. All fat bikes are built with different hub standards, so you’ll likely have to buy a dedicated second set of wheels if you want to enjoy different options."
11281,"Most fat bikes use 26-inch wheels, though 27.5-inch builds are not uncommon. Larger wheels are faster rolling and make trail obstacles even easier to push over or through. Fat tire wheels come in many different rim widths, ranging from 60 to 100mm. In general, the wider the tire you want to use, the wider the rim you will want. However, a narrower rim will save weight and make the bike feel livelier. "
11282,"The fatter the tire the cushier the ride. Five-inch tires give more float on soft ground than 4-inch models. But fatter tires are heavier, slower, and bouncier on firm ground. For riding on firmer and drier trails, and at higher speeds, a narrower tire is going to provide a more satisfying, and less squirmy, ride. Whichever you choose, consider setting them up tubeless and running low pressures for less chance of flatting. Just ensure the tubeless sealant you choose works at subzero temperatures. If you’ll be riding in icy terrain instead of snowy trails, you’ll want to buy or make a set of studded tires for enhanced grip."
11283,"Tire pressure is the best tool you have to fine-tune the performance of your fat bike. With 5-inch-wide tires in the softest conditions, you may be running pressures as low as 2 psi. In firmer or rougher terrain, or for higher speeds, you will want to use more pressure to increase the support the tire offers, and to sharpen the bike’s handling. You may even want to change your tire pressure several times on a single ride as you encounter different conditions. For the best fat-biking experience, you’ll want to invest in a good digital tire pressure gauge, because differences as little as a half-pound of pressure make a significant difference in the feel and performance of a fat tire."

11317,"There are more snow, slop, sand, and trail-busting options than ever. Below are some of our favorites, and what you need to know before buying your own. "
11318,"A fat bike is the perfect tool for extending your riding season if you live where it’s snowy or wet, or where riding a regular-tire mountain bike is futile, not fun, and might damage the trails. Fat bikes are also highly functional for bikepacking, and for riding on sand, because larger tires that are run at low pressure float over soft surfaces, which can smooth out your ride even on a frame without suspension."
11319,"Recently, fat bike tires are getting wider for more float in extreme conditions, and the bikes are being built lighter with higher performance in mind. Plus, dropper posts are becoming increasingly common on stock builds, making it easier to ride technical terrain, and riders are outfitting these bikes as gear haulers for backcountry trips."
11320,"And more manufacturers are paying attention to Q Factor (or stance width), which is the distance between the outside of one crank arm to the outside of the opposite crank arm. To create the clearance for wider tires, brands use wider rear hub spacing (up to 197mm—a typical mountain bike has a 148m-wide rear hub). Wider rear hub spacing requires that the crankset be shifted outboard to maintain a reasonable chain angle for proper shifting, which increases the stance width of the cranks. Wider-stance cranks can cause knee or hip pain in some riders. If this is you, look for a fat bike with a narrower bottom bracket shell (less than 100mm)."
11321,In the market for a fat bike? Here’s what you should be thinking about as you shop around.
11322,[Related: All of the Different Types of Bicycles- Explained]
11323,"A hardtail with a rigid fork is the most affordable and most common type of fat bike. Because most of these bikes use 4- to 5-inch-wide tires, and because you typically run those tires at low pressure, even a rigid bike can feel like it has suspension as the tires conform to irregularities in the trail. If your riding surface is particularly uneven, rooty, or rocky, or you want to run your tires at a higher pressure for less squirm, consider buying a fat bike with full suspension. A full-suspension setup can help you maneuver better, keep you from feeling beat up after a long ride, and make the ride more enjoyable if you swap fat rims for standard mountain bike rims. However, if you typically ride in extremely cold temperatures, a rigid fork may be more reliable. "
11324,"Some fat bikes are designed to accommodate both fat-tire rims and standard 27.5 or 29-inch mountain bike rims. If you don’t want to ride fat tires all year, buying a frame with multiple configuration options lets you have one bike with multiple personalities. In snow or sand, run it with a fat-tire setup. Buy a set of mountain bike wheels with narrower rims and equip them with smaller tires, and you have another option that’s lighter and may be better suited to everyday riding. All fat bikes are built with different hub standards, so you’ll likely have to buy a dedicated second set of wheels if you want to enjoy different options."
11325,"Most fat bikes use 26-inch wheels, though 27.5-inch builds are not uncommon. Larger wheels are faster rolling and make trail obstacles even easier to push over or through. Fat tire wheels come in many different rim widths, ranging from 60 to 100mm. In general, the wider the tire you want to use, the wider the rim you will want. However, a narrower rim will save weight and make the bike feel livelier. "
11326,"The fatter the tire the cushier the ride. Five-inch tires give more float on soft ground than 4-inch models. But fatter tires are heavier, slower, and bouncier on firm ground. For riding on firmer and drier trails, and at higher speeds, a narrower tire is going to provide a more satisfying, and less squirmy, ride. Whichever you choose, consider setting them up tubeless and running low pressures for less chance of flatting. Just ensure the tubeless sealant you choose works at subzero temperatures. If you’ll be riding in icy terrain instead of snowy trails, you’ll want to buy or make a set of studded tires for enhanced grip."
11327,"Tire pressure is the best tool you have to fine-tune the performance of your fat bike. With 5-inch-wide tires in the softest conditions, you may be running pressures as low as 2 psi. In firmer or rougher terrain, or for higher speeds, you will want to use more pressure to increase the support the tire offers, and to sharpen the bike’s handling. You may even want to change your tire pressure several times on a single ride as you encounter different conditions. For the best fat-biking experience, you’ll want to invest in a good digital tire pressure gauge, because differences as little as a half-pound of pressure make a significant difference in the feel and performance of a fat tire."

11361, Zipp’s first road tubeless tire offers claimed best-in-class performance
11362,"Zipp finally has a tire to go with its tubeless-ready wheels. The new Tangente Speed T25 and T28 tires are the company’s first road-tubeless tires. Zipp claims that independent lab tests show them to offer the least amount of rolling resistance, best dry grip, and best cornering grip among the major brands. The tires are available in 25mm (T25) and 28mm (T28) widths and feature a 127 TPI nylon casing with a polyamide puncture protection layer under the tread. Max tire pressure is rated at 115PSI for the 25c and 100 PSI for the 28c although most riders will run them roughly 20-40 PSI lower than that. The ability to run that low pressure is what makes road tubeless great: Ride quality and traction are enhanced, and there's a lower risk of pinch-style flats since there is no tube. Another huge plus is the ability to use sealant as yet another highly effective preventative measure against flats. Claimed weight is a competitive 292g for the Tangente Speed RT25 and 302g for the Tangente Speed RT2. These tires will retail for $74 with availability starting in June for the RT25 and August for the RT28. "

"
11365,"Pivot Cycles has been on a bit of a tear. The company’s Mach 429 SL, Mach 429 Trail, Switchblade, and Firebird have all been well received by our testers, resulting in numerous Editors’ Choice awards."
11366,"But the company has had a conspicuous hole in its line: a mid-travel 27.5 trail bike. This hole had been the domain of Pivot’s first carbon full suspension bike, the Mach 5.7. First launched in 2011, the 5.7 was a 140mm bike that began life as a 26-inch-wheel bike, though at the end Pivot was shoehorning in bigger wheels and selling it as a 27.5-inch-wheel bike."
11367,"Today, Pivot has launched the Mach 5.5 Carbon, a dedicated 27.5-inch wheel platform with 140mm rear travel designed to be “a real mountain biker’s mountain bike,” say company representatives. I traveled to Moab, Utah to get the first look and my first rides on Pivot’s latest."
11368,
11369,
11370,Meet the Mach 5.5 Carbon
11371,Pivot’s latest bike is made with a carbon frame (an aluminum version may be offered in the future) based around 27.5-inch wheels with 140mm of rear travel; complete bikes are equipped with a 160mm Fox 36 fork. The frame has clearance for 2.6-inch wide tires (the Mach 5.5 is not designed for plus widths or 29-inch wheels) and has the expected low/long/slack geometry.
11372,
11373,
11374,I asked Pivot’s founder and head designer Chris Cocalis to describe the rider the Mach 5.5 is designed for. His response: “Pretty much any trail rider...Between the frame weight and the overall features—and even the combination of the rim width and tire width—it's a real mountain biker’s mountain bike.”
11375,
11376,
11377,"If you’re shopping for a trail bike today, you’re inevitably faced with the 29 versus 27.5-inch question. In addition to the 140mm rear/160 front Mach 5.5 here, Pivot also offers the 135mm rear, 150mm front Switchblade. The intended use of the two bikes overlaps, and even geometry is quite similar. So to, hopefully, help potential buyers identify which wheel size would better suit their needs, I asked Cocalis to provide his take on the differences between 29 and 27.5-inch wheeled bikes."
11378,"“Obviously a 29er wheel rolls over stuff really nice,” Cocalis said, “But with that you lose some agility and the ability to pop off stuff in the same way, and the flick-ability of the bike. And when you get to 27.5 wheels, obviously you’re going to give up just little bit of that rollover, but the riding experience, for me anyway, it’s more dynamic. I can jump the bike easier, I just feel like, as a rider, I’m in more control of what the bike’s doing. ”"

11381,The 5.5 Carbon’s frame shares much of its design and features with other current Pivot frames. 
11382,"Like all Pivot suspension frames, the DW-Link design is employed on the 5.5 Carbon. Every pivot on the Pivot’s short dual links uses a sealed cartridge bearing. One new feature debuting on the 5.5 is a flexible rubberized cover atop the lower link to shield it from gunk."
11383,
11384,
11385,"Pivot is claiming the 5.5’s frame weighs between 5.2 to 5.5 pounds with shock (a frame sample weighed at the launch indicates these claims are believable). This is quite light for a 140mm frame intended for aggressive trail riding, and is about a pound lighter than Pivot’s 155mm travel Mach 6 Carbon frame, despite the 5.5 achieving similar frame stiffness. "
11386,"Cocalis stated that the 5.5 employs more high-modulus carbon than any previous Pivot frame, which allows designers to lower weight while maintaining stiffness. Of course, the material also adds to the frame’s price: jsut the 5.5’s frame sells for $3,099, $100 more than the Mach 6 frame."
11387,
11388,
11389,Five sizes are offered—XS through XL—and frame geometry is in line with other modern trail bikes designed for aggressive riding: longer front centers; lower bottom bracket (340mm); 430mm chainstays; 66.5-degree head tube angle and 73.5-degree seat tube angle. 
11390,"Top tubes are low for generous standover clearance (686mm for the XS size; 711mm for the XL), and seat tube lengths—356mm (XS) to 495mm (XL)—were chosen in anticipation of longer-drop dropper posts. The combination of standover and seat tube lengths means most riders can comfortably ride a few different frame sizes, allowing them to pick their size based on front-center length (longer front center, more stable; shorter front center, more maneuverable). "
11391,
11392,
11393,"Housing and hoses run internally through the frame. Pivot’s clamping ports allow the hose and housing to be pulled taut and locked down, preventing the scourge of rattle and slap. The 5.5 is also Shimano Di2-ready with compatible port covers and a battery door and holder just in front of the bottom bracket. "
11394,"The covered port in the non-drive chainstay near the dropout and the pad under the top tube near the forward shock eyelet are provisions for Fox Live, a forthcoming electronic system for automatically controlling fork and shock damping. Pivot and Fox representatives were unwilling to provide on-the-record details about Fox Live’s technology, or when the system might be publicly available. However, the fact that the 5.5 Carbon is provisioned for Fox Live seems to indicate that the launch on the foreseeable horizon."
11395,
11396,
11397,"The 5.5 is compatible with front derailleurs (remember those?), and a removable e-type adapter is included with every frame. For the pack-averse, the 5.5 fits a large bottle in the main triangle (with the stock shock) and has a mount under the BB for a second water bottle or tool carrier. "
11398,"Soft rubber guards in appropriate places quiet chain slap and provide rock-strike protection. Boost 148mm spacing is employed in the rear (complete bikes have Boost 110mm forks), while the press-fit 92 standard (with ISCG ’05 tabs) is used at the BB shell.

11417,"My overarching impression of the bike is that it is excellently balanced. The terrain we rode should easily reveal flaws, weaknesses, compromises. And while I know the Mach 5.5 has them—because all bikes do—they’re well masked."
11418,
11419,
11420,"I was able to ride the 5.5 with both the stock Float DPS and the optional Float X2 shock. The bike rides well with both, but the X2 provides better suspension performance—it’s more sensitive and more controlled—and the X2’s damping and spring curve are more tunable than the DPS’s. But the X2 is about 100 grams heavier and costs an extra $399."
11421,"For the stock Float DPS shock, Pivot’s engineering team has chosen a shock with a tune that can work for a wide range of rider weights. On the trail, this means that heavier, or more aggressive, riders will likely find the bike rides better with more compression damping: that means setting the Open Mode Adjust (the back knob under the blue Open-Medium-Firm lever) to position two or three, or even using the Medium mode (blue lever) for most riding. But is should mean that lighter riders can experience good suspension performance without sending the shock out for a custom tune."
11422,
11423,
11424,"I’m 160 pounds (about 170 in gear and wearing a pack), and I settled on position two (Open Mode Adjust knob) and left it there. The rear end was sensitive and supple, and I never felt the need to use the blue lever on climbs or flatter sections. Position one was more sensitive and supple, but there was a bit too much motion for me: I preferred the improved chassis control of position two. This is in contrast to most bikes which I find ride optimally in position one."
11425,"The DPS shock’s spring curve was where I like it: The bike used its travel, but there was still a platform to push off when I wanted to pop the bike. It didn't feel like it was wallowing in its mid stroke, and I never felt it bottom harshly. But it is important to know that the 5.5’s stock DPS shock has the maximum number of volume spacers it already, so riders who like a more progressive air spring will need to explore other shock options with Pivot. "
11426,
11427,
11428,"It shouldn’t be surprising to learn that the 5.5 Carbon pedals crisply and feels efficient; this quality is important to Cocalis, which is why Pivot bikes have been this way from the beginning. Whether grunting up a ledgy pitch, accelerating into a hard downhill corner, or powering across chop, the 5.5 is snappy, but still follows the ground well, with no obvious feedback or stiffening of the suspension."

11430,"Descending the 5.5 Carbon was a joy. It was both confidence-inspiring and lively, qualities in a mountain bike that are often at odds. "
11431,"What made it confidence-inspiring was its phenomenal accuracy, reactivity, and traction. If I needed to put my tire on two-inch wide rock, I knew I could; if I took a bad line and needed to pick the front end up to make a correction, I knew I could; if it was a steep, ledgy, switchback, I knew I could stuff the front wheel in the corner, and it would stick and carve through. The bottom bracket was high enough (plus the suspension doesn’t wallow) that I could pedal up awkward off-camber ledges and through chunky terrain without anxiety, but low enough that I never felt precarious when navigating switchbacks."
11432,
11433,
11434,"Because the 5.5 Carbon was so confidence-inspiring, it encouraged me to take advantage of its liveliness. It accelerates very well; it feels light (I weighed after riding it and was genuinely surprised to see it weighs nearly 28 pounds) and easy to maneuver, and once I got used to the bike’s balance, the front end is easy to pick up. So despite its long front center, slack head angle, and robust parts, the bike is playful, and surprisingly reactive, even at slower speeds. Rather than push back and plow (as I might do on a 29er or a bike I felt less confident on), I would look for opportunities to jump rougher sections, take alternate lines that looked more fun and challenging, and just generally faff around like a kid."
11435,"This was my first experience on the 2.6-inch Maxxis tires, and I’m a believer. The traction, control, and feedback were outstanding, without the vagueness, mushiness, or bounciness that I continue to experience from plus tires. "
11436,
11437,
11438,"Based on a couple diverse and challenging rides, my first impressions of the Mach 5.5 Carbon are overwhelmingly positive. The bike offers top-of-class performance climbing and descending, and is exceptionally precise. It bumps hard against the enduro category in demanding terrain, but it’s light-feeling, efficient, and sharp-handling when climbing. While the smaller 27.5-inch wheels don't offer the rollover performance of a 29er and made me work harder in demanding terrain, that was somewhat offset by the Mach 5.5 Carbon’s precision, responsiveness, and playfulness. Its one more great bike in the Pivot line."

11440,"It’s easy to make an e-bike overly complicated, which means models with a minimalist design and simple execution are all the more attractive. The Sturmvogel E EVO presents a sleek silhouette with a neatly integrated battery and Brose 250-watt motor hidden inside an alloy frame. Combined with Shimano’s Alfine 8 internally geared hub, the Sturmvogel hits the mark as a low-maintenance townie with the oomph, comfort, and run time to power through a lengthy commute (Bulls claims up to 137 miles per full charge, which takes five hours)."
11441,RELATED: ​New Study Offers Yet Another Reason to Bike-Commute
11442,"I used it mainly to tool around town and to ride to work. The Brose motor is one of the more seamless out there: It never felt punchy or abrupt, and tapered off smoothly when I stopped pedaling. I was able to quickly get up to the bike’s top assisted speed of 20 mph and then slow back down without fighting unwanted assist. Bulls wisely built the Sturmvogel around Schwalbe’s 2.35-inch-wide Fat Frank tires. When run at low pressure, they cushion the stout frame’s ride, making it Cadillac smooth. A handlebar-mounted digital remote lets you cycle through four power settings and control integrated lights. While the remote is simple to use, its screen is backlit, making it tough to read on a sunny day. Luckily, after a short time getting acquainted with the bike, I could tell which assist mode I was in just by feel."

11445,The new models feature frames that are designed specifically for women's bodies
11446,"Two weeks ago, Canyon launched three all-new 2018 women’s road bikes: the Ultimate WMN CF SLX carbon road race bike, and the Endurace WMN CF SL carbon endurance model, and the Endurance WMN AL in aluminum. We got a first look, and first rides, on the carbon Ultimate and Endurace in Napa Valley, California over the weekend."
11447,"These new models represent the first Canyon bikes with frames designed specifically for women. Previously, the brand’s WMN bikes had used unisex frames and changed touchpoints (saddle, handlebar, cranks). But women’s specific geometries and frames had always been the game plan, says Canyon."
11448,Canyon’s take on women’s bikes
11449,
11450,
11451,"We’ve been very impressed by the Canyon bikes we’ve tested so far, and along with its direct-to-consumer model and competitive pricing, the German brand seems poised to compete with Specialized, Trek, Giant, and Cannondale when it arrives in the US in August. Though both Specialized and Trek have backed off a totally dedicated women’s-specific approach in the past few years, launching women’s road and mountain bikes that use unisex frames, Canyon’s new models show that women’s-specific design isn’t going away."
11452,     RELATED: Canyon Introduces a New Superlight Road Bike
11453,"To design the Ultimate and Endurace WMN, Canyon used fit data from over 60,000 riders, information amassed from all of the prospective customers that had visited its website to size themselves up and purchase a bike directly. From this, Canyon drew the following conclusions: that women are generally shorter and lighter than men, but didn’t have shorter legs. They did find that women have shorter arms (about 2cm, on average), putting them in a more stretched-out position on the same frame than a man of the same height."
11454,"At the same time, the company’s engineers and product managers didn’t believe that women should have to ride in a different position than men. “The really comfortable position for women was too comfortable for racing,” says Katrin Neumann, women’s product manager at Canyon. “Why shouldn’t she sit in the same position as a man for racing?” This philosophy drove the goal of putting a woman in the same riding position by targeting the same bend at the hips and arms as her male counterpart. This was generally achieved on the bikes with a shorter reach and a slightly taller head tube than the equivalent unisex models."
11455,"Canyon’s new WMN bikes also come in smaller sizes than its unisex models: from 3XS up to a size M, covering riders from 5’0” to 6’1” tall (unisex models range from 2XS to 2XL). But very small sizes (anything smaller than a 52cm-ish for most brands) have always presented geometry problems as the smaller frames start to butt up against the limits of the diameters of the wheels. Traditionally, these smaller frames have had to resort to longer wheelbases (usually achieved through a slacker head angle) to avoid toe overlap, but this led to the smaller bikes having different handling characteristics than intended for the line overall."
11456,"Canyon’s answer to this: Smaller wheels. Both the Endurace WMN and Ultimate WMN feature 650b wheels on 3XS and 2XS bikes, which enables them to hit the same riding position and handling across the size run."
11457,"But don’t big wheels roll faster? Yes, acknowledged Canyon product engineer Lukas Schuchnigg. But, according to Schuchnigg, Canyon’s testers—who included petite pro rider Trixie Worrack of Canyon-SRAM—found that the advantages in handling (the bike is easier to corner), aerodynamics (with smaller wheels, they can get a rider into a lower position), and acceleration (small wheels spin up easier) of the 650b wheels made up for the differences in rolling speed. The smaller bikes also get stiffer gearing—52/36 chainrings instead of the 50/34 compact crankset that comes on the larger frames. (This is to compensate for the smaller wheel size, as distance traveled in one pedal revolution is a function of wheel size and gearing.)"
11458,"Of course, there will be equipment issues to contend with for buyers of the 3XS and 2XS bikes. Currently, the 3XS and 2XS bikes are equipped with Schwalbe Pro One 650b road tires, made specifically for Canyon. No other brand makes 650bx25mm tires at the moment, and choices for spare wheels (and even spare tubes) will be limited too. But Canyon believes that more options will become available as the bikes mature in the market."
11459,Better than the guys' bikes
11460,
11461,
11462,"Impressively, in designing the women’s Ultimate, Canyon achieved better aerodynamics than the unisex Ultimate. At 45kph, the Ultimate WMN CF SLX saves two watts compared to the Ultimate CF SLX, a three percent savings. (The unisex Ultimate already had aerodynamic shaping that provided a significant savings over the version before it.)"
11463,"Part of this is slimmer tube profiles, which results in less frontal surface area: Like other brands, Canyon was able to make the tubes on its women’s bikes more slender and still achieve the same stiffness-to-weight for lighter riders. But the tubing on the Ultimate WMN is actually also shaped more aerodynamically, says Schuchnigg, innovation that Canyon plans to bring to the next version of the unisex Ultimate. Another benefit of the smaller tubes: The bike is 6.5 percent lighter than the unisex Ultimate at the same size—claimed weight on an XS Ultimate WMN CF SLX frame is a feathery 765g."
11464,"Other forward-looking features that came to the WMN line first: Both the Ultimate and Endurace WMN are disc-brake only. “We think this is the future, it makes no sense to develop any bikes with rim brakes, to be honest,” says Schuchnigg. Both bikes also feature Canyon’s new one-piece H31 aerodynamic bar and stem, built to fit riders with smaller hands and narrower shoulders. Canyon says this new cockpit saves five watts compared to a traditional bar and stem combo, and provides 10 percent more compliance than its predecessor, the H11 Aerocockpit initially developed for the unisex Endurace last year. Different frame sizes of the WMN bikes come with different sized cockpits, though riders can swap the one-piece bar and stem with Canyon for a better fit, free of charge."
11465,First Ride: Canyon Endurace WMN CF SL
11466,
11467,
11468,"When the unisex Endurace launched last summer, it was an exciting bike to us here at Bicycling because it represented one of the “new school” endurance road bikes that blended the aerodynamics and speed of a race bike with the slightly more relaxed position of an endurance model, disc brakes, and clearance for bigger tires. The Endurace was the bike for riders who like to go fast, have fun, and ride mixed surfaces from time to time, but who didn’t need the unforgiving stiffness and razor sharp handling of a race bike—in short, most riders. In his review of the Endurace, Bicycling test director Matt Phillips said of the bike, “It challenges the notion that an ‘endurance’ model has to be sluggish or boring.”"
11469,RELATED: Canyon to Begin US Sales in Late Summer 2017
11470,"I rode the Endurace WMN CF SL Disc 9.0 with SRAM Red eTap (it was XS, so it had 700c wheels) on a 35-mile test loop that included a couple of longer climbs, a twisty descent, and some chopped-up California roads. Some bikes just feel natural and easy to ride right away, and the Endurace was one of the them. Part of this is the riding position. Comfort is a relative term: If you’re accustomed to riding race bikes, hopping onto an endurance model with a very tall headtube and a super upright position can actually feel somewhat uncomfortable. Despite being an endurance model, the Endurace still puts the rider in a sporty position so that hopping off of a race bike and onto the Endurace felt like a seamless adjustment, and getting in the drops allows you to get low enough to rally downhills. Others in our group who typically prefer race bikes also commented that the Endurace was comfortable, but not overly staid."
11471,"The bike is also easy to handle, with a predictable feel to the steering that doesn’t come at the cost of fun on the descents, where the Endurace swooped around corners easily and stayed planted even when the turns got a little chopped up. Just riding along at 17 to 18mph, the ride is smooth but communicative enough that you’re aware of changing road conditions—a really nice balance between compliance and feedback."
11472,"Acceleration on this disc-brake endurance bike was lively enough to not feel sluggish, and the bike ascended efficiently and responded quickly when I got out of the saddle. Along with a wide-range 11-32 cassette in the back with a spin-friendly climbing gear, the Endurace WMN encouraged me to go for it on one mile-long stretch that averaged 11 percent. On a longer climb, where I fell into a rhythm, the Endurace sort of just disappeared—a good sign that a bike isn't holding you back."
11473,"More riding will suss out more nuanced impressions, but I can already say that of the women’s endurance models I’ve tried in the past year, I found the Endurace WMN to be the easiest to transition onto from my personal bike, a race model, and can already think of all the different types of rides I’d love to take the Endurace on. I’d pick this bike for big all-day climbing affairs that take on our steep gravel roads, but would also happily throw it into one of the playful town line sprints on our lunch ride."
11474,First Ride: Canyon Ultimate WMN CF SLX
11475,
11476,
11477,"I rode a size XS Ultimate WMN CF SLX Disc 9.0, with SRAM RED eTap and the same carbon Reynolds Assault LE wheels that come on the Endurace WMN CF SL 9.0 for about 45 total miles over varied terrain that included some longer climbs and descents. I’ve also spent a fair amount of time on the previous Ultimate WMN, which shares the same frame as the current unisex Ultimate, with women’s touchpoints."
11478,"We really liked the previous women’s Ultimate—enough, in fact, to award it a 2017 Editors' Choice award in April. The unisex frame always felt like it worked fine for me, and in terms of riding position and fit, I didn’t perceive a drastic difference when I hopped onto the new bike. (The reach is 1cm shorter than the unisex model in XS). In the drops in particular, though, I noted that the new Ultimate WMN puts you in a low, aggressive position."
11479,"For a race bike, the Ultimate WMN CF SLX Disc felt surprisingly easy to pilot and not overly quick-handling or nervous dodging potholes or flowing along in a group. It also did an impressive job taking the sharp edge out of washboard-like stutters on one fast descent, and stuck to the ground very well for a light race bike through the chatter. I think part of it is the wheels; while the Assault LE carbon rims don’t sport a crazy wide internal width (17mm) compared to the widest modern road rims they still plumped up the 25mm tires a bit. SRAM’s very good top-of-the-line road hydraulic disc brakes were also powerful, modulated consistently, and helped provide confidence on this long and unfamiliar descent."
11480,"Upon initial impression, the Ultimate WMN Disc seemed to preserve most or all of that fluid and responsive feel that made the rim-brake Ultimate such a fun bike to ride too. On climbs, it rides light and and accelerates quickly when called upon. On flats, it was solid and unified when I was out of the saddle pedaling hard. In these two short rides, I didn’t really get to properly observe cornering on this bike, but Canyon-SRAM pro rider Alexis Ryan says that, to her, this is the new bike’s standout trait: “It really carves corners.”"
11481,How to get one
11482,
11483,
11484,"Since we’ve still got about three months until Canyon hits US soil, US pricing is still TBD on these models. But like all of Canyon’s bikes, we expect these models to be offered at a great value. On Canyon’s site, the Ultimate WMN CF SLX Disc 9.0 Team CSR with SRAM RED eTap and the Reynolds carbon wheels is just 6,199 euro, but an Ultegra build is available for 3,399 euro. The Endurace WMN CF SL Disc 9.0 LTD is 5,899 euro, but the carbon line goes down to 1,999 euro with Shimano 105 and DT Swiss aluminum wheels. Aluminum Endurace WMN AL Disc bikes, with the same geometry as the carbon version, start at a price tag of 1,499 euro with Shimano 105. Canyon did not indicate which models will be available in the US."

11497,Choosing the best bicycle seat doesn’t have to be intimidating—or painful. Here's how to get it right.
11498,"Finding a perfect bicycle saddle is like finding your life partner: It can be a long journey and you’ll probably have a few missteps along the way. Some people find the perfect saddle (or soulmate) right away; for others, the journey can take years. But while we can’t offer great dating advice, we can make the quest for the perfect saddle easier by looking at what you might be doing wrong in your hunt, and what you should be doing instead. To get the inside scoop, we talked to Paula Dyba, vice president of marketing at Terry Bicycles, who shared some of her best tips—and worst mistakes that she sees—when it comes to buying saddles."
11499,"Not Taking a New Saddle for a Test Ride
	Using your hands—instead of your rear—to test the saddle is a common problem, Dyba explains. But you should always take it for a test ride, if possible. “Many bike shops allow you to test a saddle, or give you a return option if you’re not happy.”"
11500,    RELATED: How to Choose a Saddle
11501,"Equating Soft with Comfortable
	Just because a saddle is well-cushioned, it may still be the wrong size or shape for you. Since our sitbones are always looking for a solid place to sit, cushiness can mean more pressure on your sensitive bits. “You want your weight to be supported by your sit bones, not by your soft tissue area,” says Dyba. “A soft saddle feels good for about 20 minutes, but then all that weight distribution on soft tissues can really start to hurt.”"
11502,"Assuming You Need XYZ Saddle
	All cyclists have different body shapes—and that applies to butts, too. That's why saddles come in different lengths, widths, and levels of firmness. “There are definite differences in sensitivity issues, rider style, and bike fit among riders,” says Dyba. "
11503,"Ignoring Pressure Points
	There are many ways a saddle can work with your anatomy, explains Dyba, and it should provide relief in areas that come in contact with soft tissues. That may mean a cutout, or a thinner nose. Focus on whether the saddle pushes on sensitive soft tissue; if it does, you’ll want to try another style."
11504,"Not Checking Sitbone Width
	Sitbone width isn’t tied to pants size, so some companies have developed measurement tools, available in many bike shops now, to measure the distance between the sitbones to find the perfect saddle for you. “You definitely want a saddle that is wide enough to support your sitbones,” says Dyba. “That’s where the bulk of the weight and pressure on the saddle should be.”"
11505,"Not Explaining Your Ride Style
	You might be tempted to walk into your local shop and start grabbing saddles to test. But before you do, think about what problems you’ve had and what kind of riding you’re doing. Mountain bike saddles make it easier to shift your weight way back, and road saddles are narrower to avoid chafing. If you have a lot of pressure problems and in-ride numbness, you may want to consider a saddle with a cutaway or a depression to take some pressure off, Dyba suggests. And if you’re planning on going on ultra-long endurance rides, looking for a saddle with a thin layer of gel on the top may make those miles feel less taxing. Men and women also have different needs. “I suggest that women look for saddles that are flat along the top as opposed to curved upward from outer edge to edge, which can make you feel like your bones are being forced apart,"" Dyba says."
11506,"Rushing into a Decision
	It may seem annoying to swap between saddles until you find ""The One,"" but saddle testing is worth the effort. “Don’t get discouraged,"" Dyba says. ""The right saddle will become the one you won’t even remember after the ride!”"

It’s clear and bright, easily readable even in bright sunlight. The touchscreen controls are simple; above six miles an hour, the app disables the touchscreen capability, and you use a simple four-axis remote mounted near a grip to control it. “It’s impossible to really use a touchscreen while riding,” said Freitag. Several readouts are possible, including a fitness screen with calorie count, a music display to control playlists, or a home dashboard with a flyover map and turn directions, speedometer and even ETA countdown for your destination."

There’s a dedicated version for the iPhone 6 or 6s, and a “universal mount” for other phones, which includes a separate charging cable that’s not as elegant.

11531,"The system will also work as a replacement display unit for a number of e-bikes; Freitag sees a significant market there, particularly as original equipment, where the extra hit of a $300 (retail) system can be more easily built into the purchase price than on a $400 townie. It’s easy to see COBI becoming the Johnson Controls of the e-bike world. An early adopter is Raleigh, which will spec it on the Sprint IE.

11655,"Light, low profile, inexpensive waterproof shoe covers. But…"
11656,"Wet, cold feet can ruin a ride fast, making shoe covers a necessity on cool rainy days. VeloToze is a different sort of shoe cover: It’s made of stretchy rubber, and is only good for a few uses. It’s an intriguing product, but one that asks some bigger questions. "
11657,"VeloToze are made of natural latex: yep, rubber from a rubber tree. And that means if you have a latex allergy, you’ll want to avoid this product."
11658,"The tall cover covered here is offered in eight colors, and sells for $18 a pair. The company also makes a short cover (about ankle height, $15), a toe cover ($13), and a helmet cover ($22) out of the same latex. "
11659,"Pulling on the tall VeloToze is different than a typical shoe cover: Before putting on your shoe, you’ll need to pull the shoe cover up to calf height; then pull on the shoe and tighten it up; and finish by hooking the cover over the heel and stretching it over the toe. If you’ve done it right, the cover will be smooth."
11660,"In my experience, the tall VeloToze were simple to put on, but do take some grunting/pulling/twisting to get them just right. But because they stretch so much, they do fit better than any shoe cover I’ve ever used. And there are a few tricks to getting them to work their best. For maximum water protection, the top of the cover should be sealed on your skin. If a sock peeks above the cover, or if you’re wearing leg warmers or cycling tights, they’ll pull water down and into your shoe. Also, use tape to seal any vent holes in the sole of your shoe."
11661,     RELATED: These Are the 10 Best Cycling Socks
11662,"The seal against the calf is very snug, but I didn’t find it constrictive or uncomfortable. Very quickly I noticed my feet were pleasantly warm; it wasn’t too much longer before I noticed the covers are not very breathable. After wearing them for an hour or so, my feet felt a bit damp and after about seven hours (the high was 60 degrees), my socks and feet were somewhat wet, and there was some water built up between the cover and my shoe. I’d say my feet were just on the good side of gross and swampy."
11663,"However, the tall Toze kept the rain and splashes out—though damp, my feet were drier than they would have been uncovered—and blocked the cold breezes. And my shoes were clean and protected."
11664,"It’s important to highlight how thin, light, and unobtrusive the VeloToze are. Many covers I’ve used are so thick and clunky that they rub on crank arms or chainstays and gum up cleat engagement. Not the VeloToze. They also have claimed aerodynamic benefits. In wind tunnel testing at 45 km/h, they can save up to 12 to 13 seconds during a 40k time trial, according to a VeloToze representative."
11665,"In their favor, VeloToze are biodegradable and pretty inexpensive ($18). But there’s a tradeoff: The VeloToze have a short lifespan. VeloToze doesn’t make any claims other than, “VeloToze products are designed to be used multiple times, but if you take them on and off carefully and follow the proper care instructions, they can last longer.” "
11666,"I’ve used them a handful of times with no obvious signs of damage or wear, though I’ve been lucky, I think. All my bikes have toe overlap, and all my shoes have scuff marks on the toes: I’m guessing that I’m a few low-speed turns away from tearing a veloToze. One other tester’s covers tore on his maiden voyage, though he did admit that he was scrambling over boulders when it happened. "
11667,     RELATED: Prevent Freezing Feet on Winter Rides
11668,"Beyond the usual, “do they work,” (they do) the VeloToze start a deeper conversation than most products. Credit goes to VeloToze for using a renewable and biodegradable resource. However, though they will biodegrade, rubber takes a long time to break down in a landfill. And though technically recyclable, rubber doesn’t recycle as well as plastics or aluminum cans, so it’s not often done. So, because of their very short life, I have mixed feelings about recommending VeloToze, even though they do work well. "
11669,"I’d feel better if VeloToze instituted a take-back program for used-up products (incentivizing the return would be wonderful: one free pair for every five pair returned?), or offered an alternative way to dispose of its products other than the landfill. And it doesn’t help that VeloToze are individually packaged in plastic bags. They are reusable zip bags, which are always handy in a workshop, but they have breather holes, which can let in water, making them not the best choice for your iPhone. "
11670,"Another big question: Is it worth buying a less-expensive limited-use product like VeloToze, or a more-expensive product with a longer lifespan like Rapha’s Pro Team Rain Overshoes ($95)? The VeloToze are a fifth the price, but they may only be good for a handful of rides (or less). The Rapha covers are more expensive (and aren’t biodegradable), but one pair should last a long time. You’re not going to cry if you crash (which is more likely if you ride in the rain) and rip your $18 VeloToze; you might if you crash in the Rapha covers. "
11671,"I’m not going to try and answer this for you. I will say that in my area (in the dry Southwest), it seems to make more sense to keep a couple pair of VeloToze on hand for the few times a year I might ride in the rain, than to invest in the Rapha. I’ve used the Rapha covers, and they’re very good: If riding in the rain were part of my regular routine, I’d probably invest in them over frequently buying fresh sets of veloToze. "
11672,"This steel road bike takes big tires, rides like a dream, and costs just $595 for the frameset"
11673,"The Black Mountain Cycles road bike taught me that most of the things we care about in a bike don’t matter as much as we believe: heritage, price (and implied value), aesthetic, branding, and, of course, speed."
11674,"This frame is so understated that it doesn’t even have a name: It’s just Black Mountain Cycles’ road frame. It is not expensive: $595 for the frame and fork, or a complete bike with hand-built wheels starting at $2,110. It’s not light: The fork weighs about 950 grams—heavier than a Pinarello Dogma F8 frame."
11675,"The brand doesn’t have heritage (not yet anyway). Black Mountain Cycles is a small bike shop in Point Reyes Station, California (population 900).

11679,"It has a longer wheelbase, and its midreach rim brakes provide clearance for (officially) up to 33mm tires. It is straight-ahead stable. It won’t dart if your attention is suddenly grabbed by the life-and-death battle between a hawk and mouse playing out to your right (amazing what you see when your focus is not consumed by the next 100 meters). Initiating a turn takes a bit of effort, then diligence to catch and correct the bike as it tips in—at slower speeds, it can feel wobbly. But once you’ve adapted, the Black Mountain does not need a masterful touch to arc gracefully through curves, and it can be allowed to run. It is not a sharp instrument for pack riding or flicking through turns, but that should be fairly obvious."
11680,"And hell yes it is compliant. Like most metal bikes, it’s buzzier than the smoothest carbon bikes, but that also helps it regain some of the lively spark that gets damped out of heavier, less stiff, bikes."

11693,Specialized’s new electric assist bike is a thoroughly capable commuter that makes road riding tons of fun
11694,"Specialized debuted its first e-bike, the Turbo S, in 2012. With the tagline “it’s you only faster,” the S was a functional, fast, capable, and formidable competitor in the e-bike market. Outside of the larger downtube housing, the battery, and the larger rear hub/motor, it looked like a bike, rode like a bike, and was a blast to ride, with performance that was above and beyond many other offerings from competitors. Its near-silent operation gave the rider what felt like superhuman powers, but was hindered by its high cost and a somewhat limited range (batteries lasted roughly from 30 minutes to an hour). Since the Turbo S, several other models came to be, including the Turbo X and more recently, the Turbo Levo."
11695,"In the e-bike world, technology has progressed substantially in the past few years, and it’s very clear that the 20-person international team at Specialized dedicated to Turbo has been working to make a much better, more refined electric assist bike. The company's new Turbo Vado has a new look, a technological makeover, and is much more refined than the original Turbo. Specialized invited us to Palo Alto, California, in the middle of Silicon Valley, to preview the Turbo Vado and learn what went into its creation. (Don't miss any of our latest bike reviews as they come in by subscribing to our newsletter!)"
11696,
11697,
11698,"From the ground up, the new Vado is something different. Constructed of E5 Aluminum, the battery has been neatly integrated in the down tube, and the motor on the bike has been relocated to the bottom bracket area, rather than in the rear hub, as on the original Turbo S. These changes center the weight, bringing better balance and weight distribution. The near-silent belt drive system, designed by Specialized in conjunction with German company Brose, is said to provide up to 320-percent support for the rider up to a top speed of 20 or 28mph (depending on the model), and decouples from the drivetrain after passing top speed, allowing the rider to coast or pedal with no resistance."
11699,"Battery life has been improved, with a 460 WH 40-cell lithium ion battery on the Vado 2.0 and 3.0, and a 604 WH battery on the 5.0 and 6.0. According to Specialized, this should net you between 28 and 38 miles of riding, respectively. By using Specialized’s Mission Control app, available for Android and iPhone, the bike is highly tunable in just about every way imaginable. You can choose your initial power output to max power output in three completely tunable modes: Turbo, Sport, and ECO. The bike can also be pedaled with the motor off. The battery is removable with an ABUS key—handy if you live in a high-rise apartment or work in an office, and need to take the battery sans-bike upstairs for a charge."

11703,"Safety and comfort was a major developmental consideration. A powerful 600-lumen light is smoothly integrated into the front, while the tail light is recessed into the rack, doubling as a brake light that increases in intensity as brakes are applied, just as in a car. There’s even a surprisingly loud horn. (We found this particularly useful when navigating the streets, although it's a bit startling if you accidentally hit the button.)"
11704,"The controls are all integrated into the cockpit so that there’s never a need to take your hands off the handlebars. There is a 2.2-inch heads-up display that feels like (and reacts like) a smartphone to touch. The tires are Specialized brand 2.0-inch armadillo casing. I talked to Specialized’s founder Mike Sinyard, who has been logging miles on a near-daily basis on his Turbo for a couple of years now; he said he has yet to get a flat."
11705,
11706,
11707,"Fenders were even thought through and designed specifically for the Vado. Called “Drytech,” they're more than long enough to keep dry in damp conditions. Made of a more pliable plastic on the ends, Specialized claims they provide extra flexibility in the case of getting hung up on a step or curb."
11708,"Specialized’s Mission Control app—like what is found on the Specialized Turbo Levo, is still in development. When released, Specialized claims that it will offer some pretty cool features to help navigate and plan your routes, based on details like battery life and power, to ensure you can make it home. (It'll also help you consider hills, power output, and distance, adjusting the metrics accordingly.)"
11709,
11710,
11711,"The Vado is available in several different models, with both standard and step-through models for men and women. The higher-end 5.0 and 6.0 come with some added features, along with the higher capacity 604 WH battery. Batteries are interchangeable between all models, and the 604 WH battery can be purchased on its own for those looking to upgrade or want a spare."
11712,"The Vado has a claimed weight of about 43lbs—respectable for an e-bike. Once you’re riding it, the seemingly heavy weight disappears and it feels very much like any other non-electric model. We spent the first day running around town in Palo Alto for several hours and covered 15 to 20 miles. With a variety of starting and stopping scenarios along mixed surfaces, the larger tires were more than capable, and the TRP disc brakes proved plenty powerful. After countless starts and stops with several hours on the bike, I still had 62 percent of my battery power left."
11713,
11714,
11715,"On the second day, we pedaled out of town and up into the hills. After a steady several-mile-long incline, which we breezed up (and passed many commuters pouring sweat along the way), we came to a much steeper 10-to-15-percent grade. That's when we learned that although the Vado is an e-bike, it’s still very much a bicycle. Climbing the steep hill was slower, still took effort, and required several downshifts to keep my pace going up the incline."
11716,"Descending was a blast, and the bike was comfortable and stable. While the motor does turn off at 28mph, it doesn’t hold you back. If you can pedal the bike faster than 28mph unassisted, you will continue to accelerate just as on a normal ride. Upon arriving back in town an hour and a half later, we had gone through 1,500 feet of elevation in about 20 miles; I was surprised to see that I still had 52 percent of my battery life remaining."
11717,
11718,
11719,"As far as the convenience and functionality it offers in bike commuting, the Vado is unmatched by anything I’ve experienced before. Even as a group, going a conservative pace and staying together, we passed hundreds of cars and saved what I would guess to be several hours over the course of two days getting around town."
11720,"Simply put, the Specialized Turbo Vado is rad. If commuting to work or just around town in haste (or the option of not breaking much of a sweat) is something that you're interested in, I can’t think of a better tool to accomplish that."

To head out on even a quick solo loop required more double-checking my phone for directions than actual riding—and my carefully handwritten cue sheets were no match for noncommittal streets that seemed to change names every tenth of a mile. But why would I shell out for a bike computer when my iPhone was capable of the same job? Thus began my search for a dependable phone mount for my bike, which ended shortly after I found the Topeak RideCase."
11723,"For the most part, the RideCase is just a cheaper way to incorporate the miracle of GPS onto your bike than buying a dedicated bike computer—assuming you already have the phone already. For $49.95, you get a protective case and a mount that can be installed on either your stem or your handlebars. The case holds your phone (currently available for iPhone 5/5S/6) and slides easily out of the mount so you can snap photos while riding, then clicks back in when you’re finished. Once your phone is securely locked back in, you can tilt the mount to any angle so it’s easier to view from your saddle."

11725,"We’ve tested much cheaper phone mounts around the office, but many were flimsy and gave the sense that your phone might choose to bail on your ride at the first sign of gravel. The handlebar attachment and lock on this one feels secure and up for whatever your roads have in store for it. I haven’t had any issues with either the case or the mount after two months of use—though I’d likely be better off with the weatherproof model (the standard model doesn't protect against the elements)."
11726,"New mapping app features like Strava Live are making it easier to get by with just a smartphone, too. The app’s new interface incorporates real-time cycling metrics and a live map, with both free and premium features, like access to power and cadence data. Sounds a lot like what Garmin and other bike computers can already do. So would you be better off with a Garmin? Maybe. But if you’re looking to save some money—and not add more electronics to your life—with a good mount, your smartphone is up for the job."

11729,"Though some purists argue that style went out the window in 2003, when certified hardshell helmets became mandatory, most riders today are happy to have the protection—even if we’ll never again witness the likes of Fausto Coppi and his perfectly pomaded coif slipping through the wind.

11731,Here’s a look at some of the most notable helmets we’ve seen over the years at the Tour de France.
11732,"Early 1900s to the 1970s: The Hairnet
	The longest-lasting (to date) “helmet” style at the Tour was also the least effective for crash protection. In the early 1900s, racers began strapping on headgear made from strips of leather and wool. By the 1970s, some European countries including Belgium had begun to require helmets, and the hairnet became ubiquitous in the peloton among riders from those countries. The design and materials had evolved, too. Though the Tour didn’t mandate helmets until many decades later, some riders wore hairnets, such as this popular Cinelli Danish Helmet, all the way up until the 1990s. But lab tests eventually proved what was suspected all along—the hairnet provided little protection from impacts."

11734,"1985: Cinelli Aerolite
	The most lasting images of Bernard Hinault at the Tour are of a man in yellow, wearing nothing more for protection than a thick, brown shock of hair. But the Badger was an early adopter of new technologies, and he was always looking for an advantage in time trials. In 1985, his sponsor Cinelli created this Aerolite helmet, which was considered cutting-edge at the time. Wearing it, Hinault won the prologue, and went on to secure a record-tying fifth Tour title."
11735,"The Aerolite was created specifically for aerodynamic purposes, with no padding, no vents, and no features for crash protection on the road. Though aero cycling helmets had first emerged at track events including the 1984 Olympic Games, the Tour de France had never seen anything like the Aerolite. Its general profile—a plastic shell with a drop-tail shape—established a new design language for nearly every time-trial helmet that followed."

11738,"1989: Giro Aerohead
	Though the Cinelli Aerolite started the discussion, this is the helmet that legitimized the idea that aerodynamics matter in bike racing. And its design was a bit of an improvisation: When the UCI banned Greg LeMond’s longtail TT helmet after the 1989 prologue, his helmet sponsor Giro was prepared. “We built a shorter version and delivered it just prior to the Stage 5 time trial that Greg won,” said Giro GM Greg Shapleigh. “That was the big unveiling of Greg’s aero helmet and handlebars, and it signaled that he was a contender for victory.” LeMond came into the final stage TT 50 seconds behind GC leader Laurent Fignon. While Fignon raced with his ponytail flapping in the wind, LeMond attacked the 24.5km course in Paris wearing this radical snub-tailed helmet, which Giro called the Aerohead Bullet. He averaged close to 55kph, beat Fignon by 58 seconds, and won the Tour by eight seconds—the closest margin of victory ever."

11740,"1994: Limar F104
	With a background in motorcycle helmets, Italian brand Limar produced its first expanded polystyrene (EPS) helmet in the late ’80s—a time when most European pros still raced with leather hairnets. Limar partnered with Gianni Bugno’s Gatorade team in 1993, and the two-time world champion said he wanted a lighter-weight hardshell helmet with better ventilation. Along came the F104, with 10 large vents, a tapered tail that was designed with wind-tunnel analysis, and a claim to be the world’s lightest road cycling helmet."

11742,"1994: Specialized Sub 6
	By the mid 1990s, helmet designs were getting steadily lighter. Then along came the Sub 6—unveiled at the 1994 Tour with Team Motorola. As the name suggests, it had a claimed weight of less than six ounces (170 grams)—crazy light, even by today’s standards. “I hated every helmet out at the time,” said Specialized creative director Robert Egger. “I wanted something that was as comfortable as a hairnet, because that’s what I used to wear.” The Sub 6 featured large air vents and lacked any type of hard shell or fabric cover—but it became a functional, widely available helmet that passed the safety certifications of the time. It didn’t even have a fit system, just simple straps secured with double-sided tape. Egger helped fit Motorola riders including Lance Armstrong, who appreciated the light weight and ventilation, even if it meant doctoring up the foam to get a perfect fit."

11744,"1999: Giro Rev V
	Throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, aero-helmet designs went big and bold. Long, pointy tails. Integrated eye shields. Smooth, frontal surfaces devoid of air vents. Most credit Lance Armstrong’s trusted aerodynamics guru John Cobb for this trend. Working with Armstrong at the Texas A&M wind tunnel, Cobb came up with the idea for the Rev 5. “Cobb’s concept was to keep it aerodynamic even when Lance dropped his head and the tail of the helmet stuck up in the air,” said Giro GM Greg Shapleigh. Giro’s team built and delivered a prototype just before the prologue of the 1999 Tour. Armstrong won the prologue and two individual time trials, and competitors went on to mimic the design for years. Since helmets still weren’t mandatory at the Tour, these were really just head fairings—plastic shells made for aero enhancements, not protection, and the Rev V was never produced for consumers."

11746,"2008: Specialized S-Works 2D
	Following the death of Andrei Kivilev from a crash at Paris-Nice, the UCI finally made helmets mandatory for the 2003 Tour. A new era unfolded as manufacturers scrambled for designs that could pass certifications (and the fickle demands of riders). Weight was an issue, as always. So when Specialized introduced the 2D at less than 200 grams, a full 30 percent lighter than the model it replaced, it set a new standard. The name references its key technology: dual-density foam. The side sections featured high-density foam, while the center/top parts used lower-density foam. Worn by a number of pro teams including Gerolsteiner, Silence-Lotto, and Lampre-Fondital, the 2D had a huge horizontal port in front and tall, fin-like vertical exhaust ports in the back. A Kevlar fiber internal skeleton held it all together."

11748,"2012: Giro Air Attack
	The Air Attack debuted at the 2012 Tour. Chris Bullock, a contracted helmet designer who has done work for Giro, Specialized, and Giant, connects the dots for the Air Attack back to a Giro concept helmet known as the “Bug” that was originally created before the 1992 Olympics. Almost 20 years later, the Garmin-Sharp team had the idea for a sprinters’ helmet. “They wanted domestiques to drop back to the team car before the finish and swap helmets for the sprinters,” Bullock said. Giro looked back at the Bug, implemented some of its core design ideas, and created the “sprinters’ helmet” for the Garmin team. Two years later, it debuted at the Tour as the Air Attack aero road helmet. Giro claimed that the Air Attack had 12 percent less drag and 97 percent of the cooling power of its Aeon road helmet."

11750,"2014: Bell Star Pro
	Two years after the arrival of aero road helmets, Bell introduced a new twist called “Active Aero.” The Star Pro model, launched with the Belkin squad at the 2013 Tour, allowed racers to switch the helmet’s aero mode on or off while riding. The idea was simple: In its aero mode, the Star Pro reduced drag like any other aero helmet. But the vents could also be opened via a simple slider button on top of the helmet. The Star Pro also featured an integrated eye shield with a magnetic mount. The design worked well enough for Belkin rider Lars Boom, who scored a solo win on Stage 5, a brutal day of rain, wind and cobblestone roads in northern France."

	With the reigning Tour de France champion Chris Froome on its squad, the big-budget Team Sky was known to spare no expense in developing technological advantages. While most teams were still caught in the arms race to have an aero road helmet offering (17 of 22 came to the 2014 Tour with some sort of aero road helmet), Sky showed up with this prototype Kask Protone. Designed to combine cooling technology with aero performance, the Protone seemed to swing the pendulum in the opposite direction. Rather than having a vent-free bowling ball shape, it featured wide-open frontal vents and sharp lines. According to Kask, the idea was to focus more on real-world comfort and how aero performance is affected by variables like rider posture and even where you place your sunglasses on the helmet."

	Swedish helmet manufacturer POC was the first to use Multidirectional Impact Technology (MIPS) in cycling helmets. The MIPS system is based on 19 years of academic research and trials in Sweden, and uses a low-friction interior liner with an elastomeric attachment system, which the manufacturer claims will help to reduce the risk of injuries. In angled impacts, the MIPS system allows the foam liner of the helmet to independently rotate just a few millimeters around the rider’s head and redirect energy, and some tests show that MIPS can reduce the amount of rotational force transferred to the brain in certain impacts. While POC was first to use MIPS in a cycling helmet, the Giro Synthe, just launched this month, is the first to be used at the Tour de France. Three teams—BMC, Katusha and IAM—are using it at the Tour."

That did not happen, but I would probably stick to a standard trainer for intense sprint efforts."

It was easier to find a location to warm up: the trainer needs less set-up room than other models, and I didn’t need something to hold onto like I would with rollers. The adjustability of the front legs meant that I could compensate for changes in the pavement to create a stable base for the trainer."
11797,"The roller allowed me to do ramp-up efforts and sprints without feeling like it offered too much resistance as I accelerated, which is a typical complaint I’ve had with trainers in the past. It was smooth and quiet, letting me focus on warming up instead of who I was bothering.

11945,"Even the bike itself lives on the edge of the crowded genre of trail bikes. It has 27.5-inch wheels, 170mm of front- and rear-wheel travel, a 65-degree head-tube angle (a flip chip can slacken that even farther, to 64.6 degrees), and an updated VPP linkage influenced by Santa Cruz’s V10 downhill bike. It’s burlier than the bikes most riders run on the Enduro World Series. It’s a mini-downhill bike—it comes close to the descending capabilities of a true DH bike, with handling and pedaling abilities that skew toward a trail bike. If you live near a bike park and spend most of your time riding terrain that pushes the limits of long-travel trail bikes, but don’t want to be limited to lift-accessed trails, the Strega solves your dilemma."

In the bike park, I found the Strega to be so stable and the suspension so adept at neutralizing braking bumps, rooty washouts, and generally crappy late-season conditions, that I often didn’t realize how much speed I was picking up—until I’d come screaming into a corner or upload to Strava and rack up a slew of trophies. While the Strega is happiest blasting straightaways, the handling is still nimble enough (especially at speed) that the bike is a joy to carve around berms. Launching jumps and drops on this bike is daydream stoking—it has great pop, and the supportive suspension provides a reliable, forgiving landing. The Strega is the only trail bike I’ve ridden on double-black DH trails and not found myself wishing I was on a downhill bike."

11950,"My only criticism is that the brakes feel undergunned—I sometimes had the sensation of riding a bike that wanted to go faster than I could. I think switching to larger, 200mm rotors might solve this, though. In addition to the addictive ride in the park, the ability to explore beyond lift-accessed terrain makes the Strega really special. Pedaling, I could leave the suspension wide open all the time without detecting bobbing, and our top-tier CC carbon test model, with the carbon wheel upgrade, weighs just shy of 30 pounds. Don’t get me wrong: For most riders, this is not a fun bike to take out on “normal trails” (the stuff most of us ride, most of the time). You have to muscle it around at slower speeds and over technical terrain. But if the objective is to get from one rowdy descent to the next, you’ll have a relatively enjoyable time on the way. These are our favorite car-free trails to ride:"
11951,"The Strega is not the bike for everyone. But it still feels like an important bike: It serves as a welcome acknowledgement of a certain type of rider. “It’s not about how much money we get back [selling this bike],” says Zaffke. “We’re doing it for the women who are gonna buy it.” And if you’re one of those women, the Strega proves that it’s not just okay to do things a little differently—it’s also never been more exciting."

And just like the shock, EVOL fork springs are designed to offer a more linear air spring curve with extra sensitivity in the first 25 percent of the stroke. Volume spacers can still be added to the positive air spring under the cap to tune both feel and progression. "

The transfer port that automatically equalized positive and negative air chamber pressure used to be located on the center shaft, but is now found on the sanction's inner wall. Updated damper tunes are said to offer improved sensitivity and support.

Both shocks have revised oil flow paths paired with lighter 5-weight oil for improved damping consistency. In addition to numerous  high/low speed compression and rebound circuit changes, a smaller main piston and inner tube offers more room and oil flow between it and the outer tube. The claimed result is a more linear damping profile for better plushness. Redesigned main shaft seals reduce friction, too. "

The difference in feel with the added negative spring volume versus the standard spring is subtle most of the time, but it becomes quite noticeable on sharp square edges, braking bumps and smaller hits where it feels more forgiving, and seems to transfer less of the initial hit to your hands. Front-end traction seems slightly improved, too. We will be receiving a production version of the 2018 fork soon, so stay tuned for a long-term review."

At the request of the Trek Factory team, the new Slash rolls on 29-inch wheels only.

Rear travel moves to 150mm for the right balance of capability and efficiency. The Slash comes with an aggressive 65.6-degree head angle and 435mm stays with a maximum rear tire size of 29x2.6 inches."
11984,"Like the Fuel EX & Remedy, Slash gets a Straightshot down tube, which is linear from the bottom bracket to the headtube, and Knock Block frame defense, which prevents the fork crown from striking the down tube. The two combine for downhill-worthy frame stiffness with no added weight, and Control Freak cable routing ties it all together."

11986,"The new frame dispenses with the long-running Full Floater rear suspension in favor of a fixed lower shock mount. According to Trek, when the Full Floater system was designed, it addressed performance constraints associated with the air shocks that were available at the time. Since then, mountain bike shocks have evolved, with more dynamic and responsive dampers available to designers. This, along with more refined air springs like EVOL and Debonair, offered the performance benefits Trek's engineers sought to achieve with the Full Floater system."
11987,"Using a fixed lower shock mount opens up the lower frame area, giving Trek more opportunity to design stronger, stiffer frames and chainstays. This also gave designers more flexibility to accommodate larger, more capable shocks—both coil and air. All of these effects are experienced most dramatically on long travel bikes, like the Slash."

11995,What appears to be a new version of the popular road and gravel bike has a few intriguing features
11996,"Somewhat lost among Specialized’s more splashy drop-bar bikes is the Diverge. Described by Specialized representatives as a bike for 80 percent road and 20 percent off-road, the Diverge is more of an adventure bike than a Roubaix, but more of a road bike than a Sequoia."
11997,This makes the Diverge a bit of a curiosity by Specialized’s standards. It is a very versatile higher-performance drop-bike without a specific purpose from a company that tends to build focused-performance bikes. (One could almost feel the company’s marketing department struggle with how to position it.)
11998,"For 2018, it appears that Specialized’s product team has decided to overhaul the Diverge, and give it a bit of a sharper edge. Seen above is a prototype of the 2018 Diverge currently undergoing testing by Specialized’s Ned Overend. Though he allowed me take a photo, Overend refused to provide any details or answer questions. But that won’t stop me from making some educated guesses about the new model."
11999,"Most obviously, the new Diverge receives the FutureShock suspension system that debuted in the 2017 Roubaix. With 20mm of travel suspending the handlebars, the FutureShock should enhance the Diverge’s smoothness."
12000,RELATED: First Ride: 2017 Specialized Roubaix
12001,"Another Roubaix-influenced design change comes in the form of dropped seat stays, which now attach to the seat tube below the top tube. However, the Diverge uses a standard seat post clamp and not the Roubaix’s low-clamp design. Overend’s bike was equipped with Specialized famous/infamous CG-R seatpost which offers 18mm of vertical deflection."
12002,"A new cable management system that looks borrowed from Specialized’s mountain bikes provides compatibility with electronic and mechanical drivetrains, and, it would appear, dropper posts. Also new is the adoption of the flat-mount standard for disc-brake calipers."
12003,"Overend would not confirm, but the frame looks more svelte than the outgoing Diverge—though any weight savings may be offset by adding FutureShock—and I’d wager the 2018 Diverge can take a wider tires than the outgoing model: I’d guess a max width of around 40mm, give or take."
12004,"Based on Overend’s bike, some features are carried over from the outgoing model: thru-axles, 30mm OSBB, fender mounts, rack mounts at the fork, and three inserts in the downtube for mounting a bottle cage and Speciliazed’s SWAT storage box."
12005,"Notably absent from the new frame and fork: Zertz, the rubberized frame inserts that, Specialized claimed, damped vibrations."

This one, the ARO 3, is designed for all-around riding. The most noticeable characteristic of the new helmet is the generous vents that curve across the front. Oakley uses a Boa closure system to adjust the fit and it works in a 360-degree radius to fit the helmet more closely around your head. The ARO 3 features plenty of room at the temples for eyewear, and slots in the side channels hold your glasses securely when not in use. The ARO 3 will be available in early 2018 in a variety of colors and three sizes."

12087,"After a successful run that includes an Olympic title, Grand Tour Stage, World Championship, and Classics wins, BMC’s product team is revamping the Teammachine, the company’s top-of-the line race bike, for 2018. The next chapter in the Teammachine’s evolution offers more integration, a disc brake option, and increased stiffness and comfort."
12088,"No matter the brake style, the new Teammachine is heavily inspired by BMC’s Roadmachine which launched in 2016. So inspired, they look almost identical. In an email to Bicycling, Devin Riley, BMC’s North American director of marketing, explained the difference between the models: “The Teammachine … is the flagship race bike of the BMC road lineup. It’s designed to have a more agile/direct response to rider input and a racier geometry. It’s also targeted as the lightest bike in our lineup.”"
12089,RELATED: First Look: BMC Roadmachine
12090,"Compared to the outgoing Teammachine, BMC’s engineers revamped the carbon layups, tube shapes, and tube sizes resulting in the new frame gaining minor claimed torsional and bottom bracket stiffness improvements."
12091,"Rider comfort has been improved through increasing the frame’s vertical compliance, as well as employing BMC’s “D” shaped seatpost–claimed to be more compliant than a round post. The final step was to integrate the seatpost clamp into the frame, which results in more seatpost exposure for more seatpost deflection. Size specific carbon layup keeps ride quality more consistent through the various frame sizes, the company’s product information claims."
12092,"The top of the line SLR01 Disc frames achieve a sleeker look by adopting BMC’s ICS (Integrated Cockpit System) stem, which cleanly hides housing, wires, and/or hoses. Both the rim and disc frames can use a new holder for Shimano’s integrated Di2 junction box that rests in the port on the top of the down tube ."
12093,"The disc variant of the new Teammachine uses thru axles front and rear, and accepts flat-mount disc calipers. The disc fork is asymmetrically shaped to offset braking forces, and employs an adapter-free caliper mounting design to save weight. The rear derailleur hanger is captured by the thru-axle, eliminating hardware to save weight. As a result, the Teammachine SLR01 Disc frame weighs in at an impressively light 815 grams (claimed), just five grams more than the new Teamachine for rim brakes."
12094,The rim brake variant of the Teammachine has been updated to accept two-bolt direct-mount calipers. Claimed weight of the SLR01 rim brake frame is 810 grams; a 20 gram increase from the outgoing version.
12095,RELATED: The BMC RoadMachine 02 Ultegra Will Help You Go Fast in Comfort
12096,"Both the rim and disc frame have a maximum tire size of 28mm. Geometry is the same, whether the rider chooses rim or disc brakes: 47, 51, 54, 56, 58, and 61 centimeter sizes are offered, and, as you should expect from a road-racing bike, the Teammachine is intended for a long and low rider position. Both rim and disc Teammachines will be offered in BMC’s top of the line SLR01 models (lightest, most features), and in second-tier SLR02 models (heavier, less fancy). Multiple builds will be offered in both frame levels. Availability and pricing were not available at press time."

12159,"The Internet has changed how we buy cycling gear and accessories, but the biggest, most established bike brands in the US have been resistant to selling complete bikes online. This all changed Tuesday, as industry behemoth Trek announced that, this September, it will make waves in the stateside bike market by starting direct-to-consumer online bike sales through a redeveloped website called Trek Connect."
12160,"According to a Bicycle Retailer and Industry News story on the move, Trek’s CEO John Burke estimates that Trek has a roughly 30-percent share of the US market for independent bike sales (that is, not including mass-merchant sales in outlets like Wal-Mart)."
12161,"But Trek’s vast network of independent dealers isn’t entirely cut out of the mix. Trek won’t ship a bike directly to a buyer; instead, they’ll send it to a local dealer of the customer’s choice, who will build the bike and coordinate delivery logistics. Trek will also sell Trek, Bontrager, and Electra parts and accessories online, all of which will ship directly to customers."
12162,     RELATED: Buying a Bike Online? Make Sure it Fits.
12163,"Trek’s move puts it squarely in the middle of the rapidly-growing online bike market. Online retailers like Competitive Cyclist and Wiggle already sell complete bikes directly to customers, and one of the biggest cycling successes of the past decade is German brand Canyon, which moves product only through direct-to-consumer online bike sales and has no dealer network."
12164,"Given the rise of direct-to-consumer brands like Canyon, the move isn’t entirely a surprise. But with all other major brands like Trek, Specialized, Giant, Cannondale and Scott sticking to their traditional dealer networks, it is significant. Some brands, like Cervelo, do not allow online bike sales at all. If they don’t already have plans in motion to begin direct-to-consumer sales, Trek’s decision may force them to respond."

Sure, the company claimed it was stiffer than the existing Pike, but it otherwise looked almost identical. My opinion changed rapidly, however, after just one ride on the revamped model, which is targeted at all-mountain, enduro racing, and bike-park riding."
12167,"	The new fork comes in travel options between 150 and 180mm, depending on wheel size, so it fills a gap in the RockShox lineup between the trail-oriented Pike and the Boxxer DH model. The fork comes in two versions: The Solo Air and the Dual-Position Air model, which allows users to change travel on the fly. RockShox first introduced the model several years ago, but discontinued it when the company came out with the Pike, and for good reason: The Pike’s Charger sealed-damper offered far better and more stable performance."
12168,"	The 2016 Lyrik receives the same Charger damper, plus a new SKF seal that RockShox claims reduces friction and increases the time between service intervals—so you get smoother performance with less time in the shop. RockShox also added an internally tunable rebound circuit, which should please those riders who aren’t afraid to open the hood and tinker with their setup."
12169,      RELATED: Our Favorite Mountain Bikes of 2015
12170,"	Compared with the Pike, the new fork has a larger negative spring for a smoother initial stroke. On my first rides—more on those later—I felt more suppleness over smaller hits. Users can add RockShox’s Bottomless Tokens to both versions of the Lyrik, which change the spring’s progression, making it ramp up quicker, or less so."
12171,	The new chassis comes with RockShox’s Fast Black anodized 35mm upper legs that are similar to the stanchions on the Pike but are thicker where they meet the crown. The Lyrik also has stronger lower legs and crown assembly—all of which are meant to increase stiffness.
12172,
12173,
12174,"The 27.5-inch Lyrik models will come with 160mm, 170mm, or 180mm of travel while the 29-inch and 29/27.5+ versions will have either 150mm or 160mm of travel. In addition to those options, RockShox will produce the Lyrik in versions that will fit standard 100mm front quick releases and the new 110mm Boost standard. The fork is also compatible with SRAM’s Torque Caps, which increase the contact area between the fork and hub, adding stiffness."
12175,"	To show off the new fork, RockShox brought us to Retallack, a heli-skiing and mountain bike lodge in British Columbia. It felt like mountain bike heaven—the steep backcountry trails are hand built and parts of them reminded me of an outdoor motocross track with choppy high-speed bumps and multiple line choices. One run included a heli drop and a 6,000-foot descent."
12176,"	Before I tested the new Lyrik, I took several runs on the current 160mm-travel Pike RCT3 Solo Air fork, which I had been riding for several months. We did four runs down two rough trails then RockShox techs installed a 160mm-travel Lyrik RTC3 Solo Air and hit the same trails again. On the very first corner I noticed the fork felt substantially stiffer, and the bike’s whole front end seemed more connected to the trail. I’ve always enjoyed the additional rigidity the Fox 36 had over the Pike, and I had a similar sensation riding the Lyrik. It felt solid and predictable so I had to make fewer line corrections and thus carried way more speed through the fast, choppy sections that were full of holes. I’m not a go-big-or-go-home kind of rider—I’m a 42-year-old dad who still can’t believe I once held a UCI pro downhill license—but even with my conservative riding style I totally felt the difference."
12177,"	The Lyrik’s new air spring also seemed to perform better than the one on my Pike—though that might be because the Pike has been ridden hard for an entire season. The Lyrik felt more supple through the first third of the stroke while remaining level under hard braking. It comes standard with two volume spacers and since I liked the feel I didn’t add or subtract any, though that’s an option. The red O-ring on the fork’s stanchions showed that I was getting full travel, but I never felt it bottom."
12178,
12179,
12180,"The Lyrik really impressed me. It seems to be a better fork than the Pike in every category, except one—at 2,005 grams the 27.5-inch version weighs 144 grams more than a similar Pike. It’s a modest increase considering the lofty performance, but given those weight gains, RockShox will likely position the Pike as its trail fork, and offer the Lyrik for enduro and all-mountain bikes. So think of his updated model as a fork that has everything we loved about the Pike, but in a stiffer, more capable package, with some longer-travel options. I’d also like to try a Lyrik on a longer-travel 29er, since the fork’s stiff chassis could noticeably improve the way those bikes handle."
12181,"	At $1,110 for the Dual-Position Air RCT3 Lyrik, and $1,030 for the RCT3 Solo Air version, that quality does not come cheaply. Those seeking similar performance for less money can check out the new Yari from RockShox. It has many of the same features as the Lyrik, but costs $700. While the the fork legs and crown are the same as the Lyrik, it has the company’s older Motion Control damper. The Yari does come in more travel options, however. The 27.5-inch size will have travel options from 120mm to 180mm and the 29er comes in at 120mm to 160mm. RockShox says the 27.5 version weighs 2,032 grams. Expect these forks in shops by October."
12182,"This women's road cycling shoe features an excellent fit, thanks to a smart closure system"
12183,"It’s rare to find a road cycling shoe that you can wear for a 25-hour training week right out of the box, but that’s exactly what I did with the Raes shoes from Giro—and I wasn’t disappointed. With Giro’s Techlace system combined with a Boa closure, my feet felt snug without being restricted, mile after early-season mile. 
	 
	The synthetic bonded upper provides good ventilation, and the low-profile tongue won’t compress the top of your foot or wrinkle. The Techlace system (made up of partial laces attached to Velcro tabs) is designed to provide the nuanced fit of a lace-up shoe with the convenience of Velcro. If you don’t like fiddling with laces but Velcro straps don’t give you a snug enough fit, this could be a good middle ground.  You’ll find the Techlace system on Giro’s top shoes, so it’s cool to see it trickling down to more budget-friendly options."
12184,"     RELATED: First Look: The Giro Prolight Techlace Road Shoe
	 
	The Raes also features an Easton EC70 carbon fiber sole. Compared to Giro’s top-tier race shoe, the Factress Techlace (which gets a higher grade carbon sole) the Raes is about 40g heavier and considerably less expensive (The Factress is $350 on Competitive Cyclist). So while the Raes is lacking that razor-sharp power transfer you find in the lightest, stiffest, highest-end shoes, I found them plenty stiff for nearly everything: general everyday riding, climbing out of the saddle, and drilling it in a paceline. 
	 
	For a fit that’ll make you say “ahh” right out of the box, a pedaling platform that’ll take you from the group ride through race season, and a price that’s not too crazy, the Raes is worth a look. "

12186,Orbea’s all new Loki 27.5+ hardtail is awesome for all-around trail riding
12187,"After riding 27.5+ tires on and off for the last few months, one thing has become crystal clear: Plus-sized tires and hardtails go together like peanut butter and jelly. And a day riding Orbea’s new plus-size-equipped Loki hardtail in the Spanish foothills of the Pyrenees just reinforced my feelings. The forgiving ride quality and increased traction breathes new life into the trail-oriented hardtail and makes riding it genuinely fun. Not only does the Loki claw its way up seemingly impossible climbs, it stays planted on loose trails full of rubble that would knock most traditional hardtails off-line."
12188,    RELATED: What You Should Know About Plus-sized Tires
12189,"The Loki borrowed its name from a Norse god for good reason. Both have the ability to change form and behave in a mischievous manner. While this trail-focused hardtail is designed for high-volume 27.5+ tires (Orbea calls them 27+, but the sizing is the same) for versatile trail fun, it can also fit 29-inch wheels and tires for a faster, speedier experience. In fact, two of Orbea’s five Loki models are offered with 29er wheels and tires that all use the exact same frame, since their overall tire diameter is within millimeters of each other."
12190,
12191,
12192,"Loki’s hydroformed aluminum frame is loaded with modern features such as Stealth dropper post cable routing, a rear thru-axle, and Boost hubs that, combined with ample chainring spacing, allow for tight 430mm chainstays even with the 3-inch-wide tires. Those who have trouble keeping their chain in place will be especially excited about the ISCG 05 tabs for easy guiding. Although fork brands and versions change with each model, they all have 120mm of travel. The fork’s geometry is trail-focused with a 67-degree head angle and long front-center paired to a short stem length (60mm on a size large)."
12193,
12194,
12195,"When it came time to test, I set the tire pressure on the top drawer H-LTD 27+ model to 14.5 psi, and we headed out on a test loop that started with a mile or so of pavement climbing. Tarmac is not what plus-size or really any mountain bike tire is designed for, but the 3-inch-wide Maxxis Chronicle tires roll better than I anticipated, let alone on such a hard, grippy surface."
12196,
12197,
12198,"The real fun began after the Loki and I hit the dirt on some rolling singletrack traverses. I dropped pressure a bit, putting it in the 13 psi range to smooth the ride a touch for my 165-pound self. Traction was not a concern anywhere, making the trail a point-and-shoot affair, and steep climbs were only limited by my fitness, not tire grip. Right away, I was reminded of a time just a few short weeks before, when I rode the Specialized Fuze 6Fatty hardtail. The two bikes have an awful lot in common: 120mm of fork travel, dropper posts, 67-degree head angles, 430mm chainstays, 3-inch-wide tires, and top tube lengths within a few millimeters of each other. The biggest difference between the two is bottom bracket height, with the Loki clocking in at 315mm and the Fuze at 305.5mm. Both numbers are on the low side, though."
12199,"After riding the Loki for an hour, I had pretty much forgotten that I was on a hardtail. I was simply having fun on super-scenic Spanish trails that passed by old ruins and seemed to pop with awesome vistas around every turn. When the trail got really rough and fast, I did have to check my speed a bit because the back end would start dancing around—but if it hit things with finesse, I’d always come out of it with control. I’d never consider racing XC on a plus-hardtail, but for all-around trail riding I think there’s nothing better."
12200,
12201,
12202,"The flagship H-LTD model I rode will cost $2,999 and is only offered with 27.5+ tires. It comes outfitted with a Fox Float 34 fork, Rockshox Reverb Stealth dropper post and Shimano XT 1x drivetrain."
12203,"The four models below the H-LTD will come in both 29-inch and 27+ configurations. The H10 + costs $2,099 and comes built with a Fox 32 Float fork, Shimano XT/SLX 2x drivetrain, and Orbea’s cool new Digit seatpost that lets you set high and low limits for faster manual post dropping. Orbea's Loki H30 27+ will run $1,499 and is spec'ed with a Suntour Raidon fork, Deore/SLX 2x drivetrain, and the Digit seatpost. Pricing is not yet available on the 29er-equipped versions, but they should cost slightly less with the more readily available setup."
12204,Simple mountain bike gear for technical trails
12205,"When a clothing company’s motto includes “raised on the road,” it might not be the first place you would think to look for mountain bike gear. But Colorado-based Pactimo is growing up, and, as it does, continuing to expand its offerings. The brand was founded in 2003 as a custom-only house, adding stock designs in 2012. For 2016, it's offering a small mountain bike collection called Apex."
12206,"The Apex line consists of four pieces—short and long sleeve jerseys, a baggy short, and a bib liner—in men’s and women’s cuts, manufactured in Pactimo’s factory. The clothes are simple in design, technology, and priced in the mid-range; we’re not talking about 7Mesh or Kitsbow here."
12207,I recently received a collection of Apex and have worn it on a few rides. Here are my initial impressions.
12208,
12209,
12210,"Apex Jersey, $50
	Pactimo kept it really simple here. The Apex jersey is a t-shirt made of technical materials—it even has in-set sleeves like a t-shirt. Branding is very minimal, with simple color blocking designs, and the fit is full, but not loose. There are some excellent details: The back panel is made of a more open material so it breathes better when wearing a hydration pack, company representatives claim. Another pack-friendly detail: The shoulder seams are moved forward, so they’re not at the peak of your shoulder—the point where a pack’s straps apply the most pressure. The men’s jersey is offered in size small through XXL, in five colors. The women’s jersey is offered in size XS through XL, in three colors. A long sleeve jersey is also offered for $10 more."
12211,
12212,
12213,"What I Liked
	I was inclined to like the Apex Jersey from the outset. I usually wear simple tech tees like it when I ride mountain bikes. I like them because the good ones are comfortable and wick and breathe well, and I prefer the simpler aesthetic. Without pockets, zippers, snaps, and other assorted filigree, there is less to fail, and they’re more comfortable to use with a hydration pack. Plus I can use them when I do other activities, and they’re usually cheaper than a cycling jersey."
12214,"Still, as simple as they are, it is possible to screw up a tech tee: Simple and well-done can be harder than it looks. Wrong materials, misplaced seams, and bad cut can all mess up the final product. Pactimo didn’t mess up."
12215,
12216,
12217,"I rode this on a super-hot day, and I was impressed with how light and comfortable it felt, how well it wicked and how quickly it dried, and how airy and free it felt on the trail. The fit is just loose enough to fit over gear stuffed in storage pockets (like those in the Apex Bib Liner), but not so loose that I felt like a sheet flapping in the wind at speed."
12218,     RELATED: The Rise of Temperature-Regulating Performance Apparel
12219,"There are no pockets, or sunglass wipes, or anything, and that’s great. It’s simple, light, comfortable, and reasonably priced."
12220,"This is a top I will reach for again and again. It looks good, feels good, and doesn’t get in the way of the ride."
12221,
12222,
12223,"Areas for Improvement
	How do you improve on a t-shirt? What makes the Apex Jersey great is the simplicity: Start asking for a bunch of “improvements” and it would become more complex, and then a different thing entirely. I would like to humbly suggest adding a three-quarter sleeve version to the collection."
12224,     RELATED: Making A Cycling Jersey: What You Get At Every Price
12225,
12226,
12227,"Apex Shorts, $90
	The majority of this short is made with a light, soft, four-way stretch fabric, with a smooth material lining the waist and leg openings. The closure system consists of a zip fly and two offset snaps at the waist: Size adjustment is managed with an interior elastic belt, which you set to size with buttons. The shorts have four pockets: two traditional hand pockets, a zippered pocket on the left butt cheek, and a zippered pocket on the right thigh. Inseam length is 13 inches, though the back of the leg opening is scalloped for more clearance. The men’s shorts are offered in sizes small through XXL, in four colors. The women’s shorts are offered in sizes XS through XL, in three colors."
12228,"What I Liked
	I love quiet when I ride: quiet bikes, and quiet clothes. And this short is about as quiet as they come—no crinkling, crunching, flapping, or voom-voom with every crank revolution. The material is very supple, and has a bit of stretch; it almost disappears, and I was able to pedal freely, with no tugging or fighting against the material."
12229,"Comfort is very good. The fabric is thin, soft, and light: The short breathes well, and I didn’t feel any nagging seam rub."
12230,"The fit and cut is very good, and Pactimo got a lot of little details right. The bagginess of these baggies is middle of the road, between a full cut and some of the newer almost-not-a-baggy shorts. The crotch hugs the body, preventing snags on the nose, and the leg length is right where I like it: At the top of the pedal stroke, the short stops just above the knee. The leg openings are large enough to accommodate knee pads, and the smooth liner fabric prevents them from snagging when pedaling."
12231,
12232,
12233,"The waist has few hard points to dig into the body—I never felt the offset snaps dig into my belly—and no excess fabric overlap. This is great anytime, but extra great when using a hydration pack because there’s nothing for a tight waist belt to drive into your hip-bones."
12234,"I appreciated the normal front pockets: Even though I never use them while riding, they’re a handy place to put stuff when getting ready for the ride, or when driving to a trailhead. And their design is so low profile, they didn’t interfere with the fit or function of the short."
12235,"Areas for Improvement
	I’d like to see a bit of gripper material added to the waistband to help prevent the shorts from slipping down. As a serial crasher, I’m always worried about how thin, light, materials like those Pactimo uses in these shorts will hold up. I am sure I'll find out eventually."
12236,
12237,
12238,"Apex Bib Liner $70
	This lightweight liner is designed to be worn under baggies. The bulk of the short side panels is made of a stretchy open mesh, while the “rise” (the part that covers your junk in front and butt crack in the rear) and the inner thighs are made of denser fabric for modesty, and to prevent wear from friction or snagging."
12239,"The inseam is nine inches (size medium), shorter than a typical bib short. This means that when the overshort is worn, less of the leg is covered by two layers of material, and it also reduces material overlap with knee pads."
12240,"The chamois comes from Cytech, and has a four-way stretch top, multi-density foam, and anti-microbial threads."
12241,"The current trend in mountain biking is to be free of a hydration pack whenever possible, which Pactimo accomodates by building two back pockets into the liner. They’re angled slightly out, and the left pocket has a small elastic strap for securing a mini pump. The men’s bib liner is offered in sizes small through XXL. The women’s bib liner is offered in sizes XS to XL."
12242,     RELATED: The 10 Coolest Tech Features in Modern Cycling Kits
12243,"What I Liked
	You don’t feel like you’re wearing much. The open design is unrestrictive, and quite breathable. The chamois provides some additional shock absorption, but does not feel bulky, and it’s well placed for a mountain bike position. The cut and material choices are good and the seams are well-placed, so the liner is comfortable and moves well with your body. The pockets secure their contents well, so there’s no bouncing on rough trails."
12244,
12245,
12246,"Quick note on sizing: The open mesh isn’t very compressive, which gives the liner a looser fit than a thicker, denser bib short. I’m 5’8”, 160 pounds and the medium shorts I was sent for review felt a bit too roomy."
12247,"What Could Be Improved
	Overall the liner is good, but I’d like to see a few refinements. When stretched, the bib straps rolled up and cut into my shoulders; a new design or different material would fix this and make them more comfortable."
12248,
12249,
12250,"The pockets are a touch narrow: I religiously carry my iPhone 6s in a waterproof case ever since I crashed and broke my leg last year, and it was difficult to shove it into the pockets. The pockets are also high, which is necessary to prevent them from interfering with the overshort’s waistband, but reaching them with ease requires above-average flexibility. I’m also concerned that the delicate mesh side panels will get shredded in a slide, but (thankfully) I don’t yet know for sure."
12251,"Ditch your heart-rate strap, without ditching the accuracy"
12252,"Most heart rate monitors are comprised of a sensor worn on a strap around your chest. This setup is widely accepted as the standard for data accuracy, but for many the strap itself can be problematic and uncomfortable. Wahoo’s new TICKRfit, which is worn on the forearm, is designed to deliver the reliability we've come to expect from Wahoo while giving athletes a comfortable alternative to the chest strap."
12253,"The TICKRfit uses the latest in optical technology to ensure accuracy, and ships with two soft perforated straps to fit a wide range of users. Battery life is a claimed thirty hours and the sensor is easily rechargeable via the same dock used to sync data to your computer.  Wireless connectivity also means data can be uploaded via Bluetooth or Ant+. Like all Wahoo accessories, the TICKRfit is compatible with all mainstream fitness platforms such as Strava, Wahoo fitness, Training peaks, MapMyfitness, and others. "
12254,Pricing is set at $79.99 and the TICKRfit will be available in early January 2018.
12255,"Several top teams, including Trek-Segafredo, plan on racing on bikes with disc brakes this year, even in Grand Tours"
12256,"Walk into any bike shop or roll out on any group ride and you’ll see that disc brakes are making serious gains in road bikes. The reasons are seemingly clear: disc brakes offer more controlled, consistent braking in variable weather conditions and open the door to wider tire options than traditional rim brakes. The one hardcore holdout? Top level pro racing, where rim brakes still dominate. After several years of speculation and even controversy, widespread change might finally come in 2018. And you might see it as soon as this month at the season-opening Tour Down Under."
12257,"Trek-Segafredo will use the new Emonda Disc platform in most races for 2018, the team said, including three-week Grand Tours like the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia. “Everyone who was on an Emonda rim-brake bike in 2017 will be on a disc-brake bike in 2018 in every race,” Trek team liaison Matt Shriver told CyclingNews. (Shriver was out of office Tuesday and unavailable for comment to Bicycling.)"
12258,"The UCI's WorldTour has officially been in a disc brake trial since the 2016 season. But use has been sparse, and mostly in races like Paris-Roubaix where the added tire clearance is a bonus, or in early season stage races like Paris-Nice. Come showtime in May and July for the big tours, and discs were almost nowhere in the pro peloton."
12259,"That would seem to make Trek-Segafredo the outlier, but they’re not alone. Sources with the Katusha team say that the team plans to race disc brakes more in 2018, and Giant representatives predict that the Sunweb team of Giro d’Italia winner Tom Dumoulin will likely spend more time on the disc versions of bikes like the TCR and Propel this coming season. Women’s WorldTour team Canyon-SRAM will race only on discs for 2018."
12260,What changed? Several factors are playing a role:
12261,Results: Can't Argue with Success
12262,"Everyone likes a winner and pros started winning big races on disc brakes last year. Tom Boonen nabbed the first pro win on disc brakes during Stage 2 of Argentina’s Vuelta San Juan last January. Months later, Boonen’s teammate, Marcel Kittel, became the first rider to win a stage of the Tour de France on disc brakes when he took Stage 2 on a Specialized Venge ViAS Disc. He followed up with three more stage wins on the same bike."
12263,"Wins on discs weren’t widespread, but Kittel’s victories in particular establish credibility for the technology. A similar dynamic played out three seasons ago in cyclocross, where only a few riders had adopted discs, but one was Mathieu van der Poel, who won the World Championship on them. Fast-forward to today, and disc brakes are standard in the field. So far, disc brakes in road racing are following that script: initial resistance leading to sporadic adoption followed by results, and finally, broader adoption."
12264,Safety: Lack of Injuries Calm Sharp Edge Concerns
12265,"WorldTour riders have been highly critical about disc brakes, voicing concerns of sharp-edged rotors in crashes. But to the extent that discs have been used, the fears haven’t borne out. There have been just a handful of crashes where riders allege that disc brakes caused an injury and in two of them—Francisco Ventoso’s crash in the 2016 Paris-Roubaix and Owain Doull’s crash at last year’s Tour of Abu Dhabi—official review found no evidence that discs caused their injuries (video from Doull’s crash suggests it was a fence). And no, discs will not really cut a shoe (a contention made by Sky's Owain Doull after a crash in last year's Abu Dhabi Tour left a slice in his left shoe; experiments have shown that highly unlikely)."
12266,"At the same time, there’s been only halting progress on fixes that would address safety concerns. The UCI now requires rotors to have a rounded edge profile. But rotor covers are still not required (or used even voluntarily). But gradually, disc brakes are being used in races without catastrophic results, which is blunting the safety criticisms."
12267,Industry: Most of the Big Players are in the Disc Brake Game
12268,"Up until 2017, it was impossible for some teams to run disc brakes in pro races. Campagnolo, for instance, didn’t have a disc-brake version of its components, so teams like Lotto-Soudal and UAE Emirates had no disc option. And a number of bike makers hadn’t certified disc frames through the mandatory UCI approval process."
12269,"But this past May, Campagnolo finally came out with a hydraulic disc gruppo. And as of the latest-available (December) update of the UCI’s approved-frames document, only Lapierre (which sponsors FDJ) and Bianchi (which sponsors LottoNL-Jumbo) lack an approved disc version of their all-around racing platforms. BMC doesn't have an all around bike approved yet, but its Classics-oriented GF01 is cleared, and says its Team Machine SLR01 Disc will be on the approved list ""soon."" Lapierre and Bianchi are further behind; Bianchi hasn’t gotten its Infinito Disc approved, and there is no disc version of the Oltre XR4 yet; Lapierre hasn't submitted its Xelius SL 700 Disc. But 15 of 18 teams are now set for disc-brake frames and groups."
12270,Weight: New Groups are Pro Level Light
12271,"Disc-brake bikes are typically heavier than their rim-brake counterparts. But that’s changing. Already, we’ve seen a number of disc-brake bikes that were within a pound of the UCI’s 14.96-pound minimum weight limit."
12272,"Now, they’re at or below it in some cases. One of the biggest factors is the long-awaited availability of Shimano’s new Dura-Ace 9100 group. The group was announced 18 months ago, but some parts, like the hydraulic levers, weren’t available until recently. Previously, Shimano didn’t have a Dura-Ace hydraulic disc brake and Dual Control shifter. The new 9170 levers are 138 grams—almost five full ounces—lighter than the R785 non-series levers they replace."
12273,"That helps make lighter bikes. Bicycling recently tested a Trek Emonda Disc with clincher wheels and 28mm tires that was at the weight limit in a 54cm; tubular wheels and tires would make it even lighter. Canyon’s Ultimate WMN Disc CF SLX is its lightest frame, rim or disc, period, and an XS tester we had was just 15.1 pounds with mid-range components. And while Specialized has yet to officially intro its new Tarmac Disc, the bike is already UCI-approved and is rumored to weigh under 15 pounds."
12274,"There are still challenges to overcome before disc brakes get widespread adoption in pro racing. Right now, speedy wheel changes are a big issue. And safety concerns have not been fully addressed. So WorldTour racers—and some mechanics—are still largely taking a skeptical view of disc brakes."
12275,"But the weight penalty is quickly becoming a non-issue (at least unless the UCI decides to lower the current weight limit). And riders will continue to face tricky situations where the speed modulation of disc brakes is a benefit, like the descent of the Mont du Chats in last year’s Tour, where slick roads helped cause Richie Porte to crash out. All the pieces are finally in place for disc brakes to roll out more broadly. Now, it’s just down to the riders to choose. And 2018 might go down as the year that discs finally took hold in pro racing."
12276,This coaster-brake throwback model brings the fun—at an affordable price
12277,"Luddites of the forest, your moment has arrived! If you’ve spent the past 30 years of mountain bike development hiding in a trailside bunker—or shaking a curmudgeonly fist at all the complicated, high-tech trappings getting in the way of your shredding session—the new throwback klunker trend is for you. "
12278,"Earlier this summer, we covered Transition Bike’s rigid, 26-inch-wheeled Klunker, which brought old-school trail style back to the forefront. Now, it’s time to meet the new Hank from Portland-based Asylum Cycles. What the Hank lacks in dropper posts, electronic shifting, and disc brakes, it more than makes up for with what the folks at Hank call “enhanced skid technology”—which apparently boils down to the encapsulated spirit of being 15 again."
12279,
12280,"With the geometry of the Schwinn Excelsior, a raw-steel frame, coaster brakes, and 650B wheels, this one-speed “two-wheeled time machine” was essentially designed because the team at Asylum dreamed of riding a bike exactly like it. It was inspired by mountain biking’s early klunker beginnings, or “days when folks like Joe Breeze and Gary Fisher were fearlessly mobbing down hills on modified cruiser bikes similar to this one, thereby opening the door to mountain biking as we know it today,” the team behind Hank explains. “Second, much like the inner spark that drove our sport’s founders, the Asylum Hank was made to heed the call of your nagging inner child that you just can’t keep quiet.”"
12281,RELATED: 15 for 15: The Year’s Best Mountain Bikes
12282,"To be honest, this bike reminds me a lot of the “Rose City Injury Bike”—a bike used by wounded couriers at my former place of employment, Rose City Messenger Service—notable for its ape-hanger bars, coaster brakes, 26-inch wheels, and downright easy riding even through fractured ribs. Ridiculous and fun, that bike was the only beacon of light in the whole injury-recovery process. There’s something about the paradoxical joy of cruising town on a simple bike and not even trying to keep up with the sleeker, more aero models on the road.  "
12283,"From full-suspension trail bikes to klunkers, and everything in between, the moral of the story is it’s nice to have a little something for everyone on the market. And the best part about the Hank is its $450 price tag isn’t marked way up to take advantage of its niche-ness, “Portland factor,” or retro style. It’s just a fun bike for getting around town, skidding down fire roads with a killer guitar riff stuck in your head, and staying stoked. Or as the Hank team puts it, “a dirt bike for dirt bags, a one-way ticket to scraped knees, big smiles, and bigger skids.”"

If so, tighten the straps in front of your ears (loosen the rear straps so that the V points still sit just below your ears). If you can push the helmet forward, adjust the straps behind your ears. In the end, you shouldn't be able to move the helmet more than an inch in any direction."

12302,"It's time to toss your old calendar and hang up a new year—and if you've resolved to ride more, Bicycling's 2018 calendar could be just the tool you need. No matter what your goals—boosting mileage, entering your first race, or adding muscle—a calendar can help.

12307,SRAM introduces its most affordable four-piston brake yet
12308,"Since SRAM introduced Guide brakes in 2014, the company has been steadily expanding the line at both the high end with the Guide Ultimate, and the low end with more budget-friendly versions, such as the RS and R. SRAM is now offering its most affordable Guide brake ever with the newly released Guide T. This new brake uses the same S4 four-piston caliper of the higher-end models with Heat Shield and Bleeding Edge drip-free bleed port technology."
12309,"The biggest changes between the Guide T and the Guide R, its most comparable stablemate, are evident at the lever: The Guide T requires a hex wrench to adjust the reach compared to the tool-less reach adjust on the Guide R. Since this is usually a once and done adjustment at initial set up it's a minor detail. The lever body is slightly chunkier too, and uses a two-bolt clamp that is Matchmaker-compatible for clean integration with shifters. However it's not compatible with the Matchmaker X and MMX components, such as Reverb dropper post remotes and remote fork lockouts, so those will mount with their own clamps."
12310,"Priced at $105 per wheel without rotors or adaptors, the Guide T is $28 less than the Guide R and in direct competition with Shimano’s Deore BR-M6000 brake with a retail price of $100 per wheel. The Guide T is shipping to dealers now and should be a popular spec on complete bicycles this year."
12311,Boa closure technology on your gloves? It’s more helpful than you may think—especially for pulling on numb hands.
12312,"Dressing to ride in the winter can be quite the process. There are lots of layers to consider as you head out the door, and fluctuating temps mean you’ll probably have to adjust a few times once you start riding. Castelli designed the new Boa Glove ($119.99 at competitivecyclist.com) to make the whole process a little easier— after all, gloves are the layer we put on first when we get cold, and pull off first when we get warm."
12313,Here’s how to layer properly for winter riding:
12314,"Rather than using cinch cords or a gauntlet-style cuff, Castelli incorporated a Boa dial on the top of the glove, which tightens all the way down the long cuff. It cinches the long wrist of the gloves down nicely, helping them layer well under the sleeve of your jacket to effectively seal out the elements. Plus, when you need to remove your gloves, the Boa opens up with one easy pop, which is extra helpful for when the temperature drops and your fingers start to get numb."
12315,"The Boa Glove is lined with a soft, warm fleece and uses Castelli’s “Out Dry Technology,” which completely seals out water and wind while still staying breathable so your hands don’t sweat. The palms have a grippy silicone pattern, and the base material is flexible so you can maintain full dexterity. A lot of gloves I’ve used don’t have a ton of “feel” on the handlebars, which always gives me the sense that I'm sacrificing some control, but that’s not the case with these gloves. I’ve been able to ride my road bike, cross bike, and even mountain bike on technical terrain without compromise."
12316,RELATED: How to Ride Hard in the Cold
12317,"These gloves are advertised to work best in the upper 30s to 50s, a predicted temperature range that rang true to my experience with the gloves. At 128g, they're lightweight, and lay flat enough to stow easily in a jersey pocket."
12318,"Overall, while Castelli’s Boa Gloves are not the cheapest on the market, they bring some worthwhile features that can make a cold ride better by simplifying a common process—and the Boa dial on top will without a doubt draw comments and questions from just about anyone you encounter. Is it necessary? No. Is it really cool and helpful? Absolutely. Will it help you be the first one to shed your gloves and pop the top on a frosty beverage at the end of the ride? You decide."
12319,​Newly launched head unit and cloud-based software are the core of a power-training ecosystem
12320,"When Stages introduced its line of powermeters in fall of 2012, the focus was, well, focus. Stages made powermeters for the left crankarm only, which made them more affordable than conventional crank-based systems. And notably, the company skipped the head unit entirely, saying it had no plans to make one. That has changed."
12321,"Last fall, Stages announced that not only would it make a head unit, but it was getting into the training software game as well. So it would be taking on both the solidly entrenched leaders in the computer space like Garmin and Wahoo, and software juggernaut Training Peaks. That ambitious effort fully launched on June 6, with the on-sale announcement for Dash and the public unveiling of Link."
12322,Dash is the hardware head unit. Link is the cloud-based software analytics program and companion mobile app. They're designed to join Stages line of powermeters as a kind of ecosystem of power-based training. The idea is a seamless integration of training tools that all sync to each other more or less automatically so you can focus just on riding and getting faster.
12323,"I’ve been using pre-release versions of Dash and Link for over a month now, albeit in beta-testing mode with a bit less than the full feature set. The system, Link especially, is a powerful training tool. It’s not without its quirks, but in particular for users who want a full-feature training program but not a masters in exercise physiology, it’s a compelling option."
12324,(Want more news on the latest gear? Sign up for our newsletter!)
12325,"Dash
	In concept and execution, Dash sits midway between SRM’s PowerControl and Wahoo’s ELEMNT. Like both, the screen is grey-scale, not color, and it uses physical buttons rather than a touchscreen like Garmin’s most recent Edge computers."
12326,"It’s slightly smaller than the ELEMNT and Garmin Edge 1000. Price-wise, it’s $400—$70 more than an ELEMNT. Instead of the ubiquitous quarter-turn bar mount, Dash snaps on to a proprietary mount and can be oriented either vertically or in landscape. Stages will offer different mounts for various road, mountain, and aerobar configurations."
12327,"Dash features up to five screens, all of which are fully customizeable with up to 16 fields per page, or as little as one. There is a massive array of data display fields available, from simple (elapsed ride time) to sophisticated/bordering on arcane (heart rate-power efficiency, or pedal smoothness, to name two). You can set up multiple bike profiles as well."
12328,"Dash has a built-in GPS and will eventually have turn-by-turn directions via a smartphone connection, but this feature and several others were not available in the initial firmware. It operates on both ANT+ and Bluetooth communication protocols, so it will pair to almost any existing powermeter or sensor accessory."
12329,"Dash’s last, and most interesting point, will likely be its most controversial: Stages created a new file format for data recording with a .rde extension (get it?). One of the enduring frustrations of computers is data dropouts, which show up in your ride file as zeroes. If they happen often enough and at the wrong times, they can completely skew the accuracy of your workout record. Sometimes, a .fit file is also corrupted and unreadable."
12330,"Stages points to two culprits: ANT+ communication, which they say is prone to dropouts, and the industry-standard .fit file created by Garmin. Sensors like powermeters send four data points per second to the computer over the ANT+ or Bluetooth protocol, but .fit files only capture and write one. So Stages created its own file format, which captures and records all four data points per second. Result: a denser file, more data, less dropouts, all over a more robust communication protocol. The drawback is that Dash only writes to .rde files. Stages has made the file format open to other developers but, at this point, only Today’s Plan supports it. So Dash, as a computer, doesn’t work directly with other third-party platforms (you can export data, which I’ll get to in a minute). Instead, you upload the files to Link."
12331,"Link
	Link is the real beating heart of the training data ecosystem Stages is trying to create, and not merely because it’s the only real conduit for Dash at the moment. What’s perhaps most important here is that Stages didn’t try to create an entire new system, but partnered with Today’s Plan, one of the more innovative online training and data services. A lightweight piece of computer software called Sync, or the Link mobile app, handles the data transfer."
12332,"Cycling is chock full of computer and training hardware makers who’ve created data management and training software programs. Most have been failures to varying degrees, hamstrung by poor user experience design, buggy programming, or overly proprietary “walled garden” approaches that limit data sharing. The result is that most riders who record ride data use one of just a small handful of services. The hardcore riders and racers typically go for TrainingPeaks or its denser alternative, WKO4; for social fitness, Strava is the benchmark."
12333,"The approach at Today’s Plan is to offer a lot of the function of WKO4, but in a slightly less daunting user interface. While the “skin” on Link is Stages’ creation, the backend is entirely powered by Today’s Plan and any TP user will find it broadly familiar. Link provides a massive amount of data to play with, but it’s collated into layers, so you can dive deep or just get a top-line summary and move on with your day."
12334,
12335,
12336,"Perhaps the best part is how it makes use of the visual data tools that Today’s Plan is arguably best at in the training program world. Open a ride file, and you can dive into a series of graphs ranging from combined ride graphs with power, elevation, cadence and other data points to sophisticated 3D bar graphs of cadence over power over time. Like TrainingPeaks, you can zoom in on small portions of the ride graph, and overlay and compare multiple files (say, the same threshold test route done a month apart)."
12337,"Where Dash is singly compatible with Link at the moment, Link itself plays beautifully with other devices and files—you can manually import files from all the main formats like .fit, .ant, and .gpx, and if your coach works on TrainingPeaks, you can import training plans to Link, where they’ll sync to your Dash. You can also import data from Garmin Connect and even Fitbit, if you use a daily wearable. For export, TrainingPeaks and Strava are, right now, the only sync connections offered."
12338,"You can also access specific workouts and entire semi-custom training programs within Link. Several platforms have this feature now, including TrainingPeaks and Strava. But Today’s Plan was the first to offer not just a menu of workouts, but the option for complete, algorithm-based and semi-customized training program based on your current fitness, your goals, and your timeline. That carries over to Link."
12339,
12340,
12341,"You can create 6-16 week plans based around a specific goal, like improving a particular part of your fitness or just losing weight, or around a specific event, which you can create or select from a calendar menu. (Amusingly, the calendar includes UCI WorldTour events so, if you want a plan to get you “fit” for the Vuelta España, you can get that. Good luck!) You get e-mail prompts and updates, and the sync function automatically pushes your workout plans to the Dash and pulls your files when you connect to Link. (The Link app even eliminates the need to connect Dash, automatically uploading files, exporting data to third-party sites you select, and providing firmware updates.)"
12342,"Link has two membership levels: the free Basic and pay-only Premium. Basic membership gives you access to the Dash and Power Meter tabs, so you can manage those devices. You get file storage and viewing abilities, but you won’t get the Performance tab (which looks at your fitness over time), and you can’t set zones or analyze power or HR info. You can export files to other analysis clients like TrainingPeaks."
12343,"So this option is really best for someone who’s already invested in TrainingPeaks (for example, your coach uses it exclusively) and wants to use Dash because they like the head unit. If you’re not already on TrainingPeaks, then Basic doesn’t really give you much in terms of tools."
12344,"The paid plan is pricey: $20 a month or $200 a year (you get two months free when you buy a Dash or a Stages powermeter). That’s a premium to other services, which range from $60 a year (Strava Premium) to $150 (Today’s Plan, with access to training programs)."
12345,"Impressions
	I’ve been using Dash and Link for six weeks. Stages let journalists in on the product in beta testing mode, pre-release, so we could get time with it. Because of that, not all features were available, and I experienced a few issues."
12346,"The most serious was when power display and recording for the first three weeks was suspiciously low even accounting for me being out of shape. On examining my files, Stages staff said they believe the issue was an early firmware version that mis-captured data for both display and the .rde file. A firmware update fixed the problem and it hasn’t reappeared since (I’m still slow; just now as slow as I feared)."
12347,"Dash is a very good head unit. The grayscale display is clear, bright, and more readable in direct sunlight than most color displays, and I like the physical buttons, since a touchscreen gets pretty frustrating with gloves, or on anything other than glass-smooth roads. Menu trees are mostly simple and intuitive. The tactile response of the buttons is a half-step below the ELEMNT, still tops for me for on-ride useability. The ELEMNT has more features, including base maps, customizeable LED pace lights, and social ride-tracking functions when paired to a smartphone."
12348,"But Dash is intended as a serious training tool, much like the Power Control, and has great versatility in terms of the screens and field customization; for that user, a “next lap” info field is probably more relevant than knowing you’re heading east on Saint Vrain or whatever. Battery life is fantastic—the best of any head unit I’ve used, and the mount is solid, even holding tight in a surprise crash at 20mph."
12349,"Link is, as I mentioned, the real heart of this whole thing. I’ve used the cloud-based desktop version only; the iOS app has only been out for a few days and I’ve yet to use it. But the feature set is impressive."
12350,"There’s literally a lot to it—enough that the journalists who attended the late April launch event were treated to roughly five hours of product info and tutorial on how to use, and most of that devoted to Link. It’s easy to get lost in the data, but you don’t necessarily have to. Just as in Dash, you can custom-select what fields you want to see in your ride data, and you can go as deep or as shallow as you wish."
12351,"And that, I think, is probably the system’s main strength: from the powermeter to Dash to the app to Link, it all works together—it literally and figuratively syncs. The true power-training fan is already ahead of this. That rider knows that your TSB is your CTL minus your ATL, and what that all means and how to use it. She has a coach, has power meters on more than one bike and keeps track of her zero reset data. For that rider, Dash and its .rde file may be the compelling point, because of what Stages claims will be higher-quality workout files, without data dropouts and corruption."
12352,"But the Stages ecosystem, to me, seems aimed at a slightly larger group of riders: they’re interested in doing more than just riding; they have goals or want to have goals, and they want to know how to meet them. They’ve heard of power-based training, maybe even have a powermeter. But they don’t have a coach and probably won’t hire one, and neither do they understand how to build a coherent training program themselves for a particular event or goal. They need a certain level of help at a certain price."
12353,"You can cobble that together on your own right now: any powermeter, any head unit, and a subscription to one of the cloud-based services that offers algorithm-based training plans. But that agglomeration of parts doesn’t always fit well together. Stages’ bet is that a seamless ecosystem of a head unit and desktop and mobile software will smooth out those issues enough to be worth the premium."
12354,"With the early versions that I’ve been using, I’ve had a few hiccups. None posed serious issues and they’re almost all attributable to testing in beta mode. But Stages’ pitch is premised on the idea that the ecosystem it has designed works smoothly; that the Dash syncs seamlessly, that firmware updates are essentially automated, and that data flows to and from the device and cloud analysis platform without issues. That might be worth a slight price premium for the hardware and software components."
12355,"It’s a trick that’s worked for, among other companies, Apple. The Apple comparisons are numerous and often trite, but the central feature of Apple’s technology is that it’s so easy to use it doesn’t come with an instruction manual. Things generally just work, and work together. It’s a high standard to put to Stages, and my experiences with the beta firmware versions don’t give me a solid verdict just yet. But if Stages can deliver on what it’s promising, the system might be the first one in the sport to clear that lofty bar."

12511,"Wolf Tooth Components just rereleased the PowerTrac Elliptical (PTE) chainring for your gravel/CX/adventure or mountain bike setup. Refining the shape of the oval for off-road use, the new ring aims to hit the sweet spot between a traditional circular chainring and ovular chainrings that are designed to eliminate the “dead zones” when your pedals are at the top or bottom of their rotation."
12512,"With just 10-percent ovality and 112-degree timing, the PTE’s more subtle oval shape purports to offer riders a smoother, more natural (circular) pedal stroke without losing those ovular power benefits. If the PTE rings live up to its traction-packed promises, this should lead to less spinning out of your back wheel on uneven terrain."
12513,"Confused about how that works? Picture your chain ring as a clock face. When your pedals are at 11:00-1:00 and 5:00-7:00 on a circular ring, you’re in the recovery zone and not actually doing much to propel your bike forward except return your feet to an angle where they can produce leverage. An ovalized ring reduces that window and makes your 34t act more like a 32t—so you get the instant benefits of a smaller ring without a major change in shape that might throw off your pedal stroke."
12514,"Wolf Tooth’s PTE ring are available in multiple versions, including 32-36t sizes for any 104 BCD crankset, 30-36t for 96mm BCD Shimano XT M8000 and SLX M7000 1x, 38-42t for 110 BCD 5 arm cranks, and options for both SRAM and RaceFace direct mount cranks. A complete list can be found here."

Our test group came with a 32t ring and, while that low gear was good on extended climbs, I often wished for more top end on descents. Switching to 36t in the front (taller than I would normally ride) gave me the power I was looking for and still let me spin up most of the climbs in our area. "

12586,​Industry Nine’s trail wheels are wider and more durable than ever
12587,"Industry Nine (known as I9) produces strong, lightweight wheels with custom anodized hub and spoke colors, all built in its Asheville, North Carolina, facility. While the company is perhaps best known for its blingy annodized hubs with rapid-fire engagement, it also produces carbon and aluminum rims and wheels, some of which can be found on high-end bikes from Santa Cruz, Pivot, and others. "
12588,"For 2018, the company updated its aluminum trail wheel, the Trail245, hoping to create a stronger wheel without significantly increasing weight. The new model, named Trail270, uses the same I9 Torch Hub system as its predecessor, and is available with 27.5-inch or 29er rims, with 24 or 32 spoke holes. The 29er option with 24 holes weighs a claimed 1,560 grams, about the same as the previous version. "
12589,
12590,
12591,"To increase strength, I9 built the Trail270 with some of the features of I9’s more gravity-oriented Enduro305 and Grade300 rims. Like those models, this one has a profile that is thicker on the bottom, where impacts from rocks and other obstacles occur, to prevent denting and flat spots. The Trail270 rims were also made 2.5mm wider than the previous generation (for a total inner width of 27mm), to accommodate wider tires run at lower pressures. To lighten it up for general trail riding, I9 shaved excess material from areas on the Trail270 that didn’t need it."
12592,
12593,
12594,"I’ve been testing a set of the 24-hole, 29-inch Trail270’s for the last few months, and have put several hundred miles on them. There’s no noticeable flex or power loss when hammering up a climb, sliding into a berm, or bouncing through a rock garden. I have cased jumps, smashed into square-edged rocks, and aggressively banged the rim in those situations. I’ve ridden far with really low tire pressure simply trying to find the limit of the wheels—but I have yet to knock them out of true or even dent them. In my experience, it seems I9's claims of producing a tougher rim hold up. "
12595,RELATED: Industry Nine’s MatchStix Is the Best Use of Space on Your Bike
12596,"Paired with I9’s hubs, which offer the brand’s signature 3 degrees of engagement, you get almost instant power transfer between the freehub body and ratchet mechanism. It’s a subtle difference compared to a standard hub, but I’ve found it moves the bike forward with more precision, which is helpful for navigating really technical sections of trail."
12597,These are our ten favorite trails to ride:
12598,"I9’s new Trail270 aluminum wheels are available in multiple axle configurations, from quick release to thru axle. The 24-hole rim is lighter and offers a slightly more supple ride than the 32 and could be ideal for smaller riders—I9’s are already pretty stiff because its machined-aluminum spokes have less torsional give than a traditional J-bend spoke. The wheels accommodate both Shimano and SRAM XD cassettes. They start at $1,225 (as tested), so they're not cheap, but given how well they've held up to months of abuse, they could be a worthwhile investment for anyone looking to make a noticeable upgrade to their bike. "
12599,"Trek and other companies are looking into Bicycle-to-Vehicle technology, which would allow bikes to automatically alert drivers to the presence of cyclists"
12600,"When it comes to the relationship between bikes and cars, the biggest concern for cyclists has always been safety. (After all, in the battle between a two-ton car and a 20-pound bike, the car always wins.) That concern accounts for something called passive visibility, one of the biggest pushes in cycling equipment in recent years. A lot of thought has gone into reflectivity, bright colors, and lighting as passive methods of getting drivers’ attention."
12601,"Trek and sister brand Bontrager have been one of the most vocal players in passive visibility, with a line of products that follows what they call the ABCs (Always on, Biomotion, Contrast) of Awareness. But a recent partnership between Trek, Ford vehicles, and software developer Tome signals a potential evolution from passive to active visibility in the quest for improved road safety."
12602,RELATED: Is There a Place for Airbag Helmets in Bike Safety?
12603,"It’s called Bicycle to Vehicle, or B2V. Still only a concept—no consumer products yet exist—the fundamental idea is this: Bicycles carry a transmitter that would, in certain conditions, alarm nearby cars to the presence of a cyclist."
12604,"The nuts and bolts of how this would work still need to be figured out. For example, researchers are looking into applying advances in communication technology (think Bluetooth and WiFi) to a potential system. But the plan is to incorporate the bike-side of B2V into something as small as a rechargeable tail light or, potentially, the bike frame itself."

12606,"At the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week, B2V’s partners announced that they want to integrate B2V into the larger Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) movement, which seeks to allow vehicles to communicate directly and autonomously with other cars, pedestrian devices, and traffic infrastructure like road signs and stop lights."
12607,RELATED: Austin Invests in Rider Safety by Adding New Bike Signals to its Traffic Lights
12608,"Rather than the system alerting every driver, every time, as they approach every cyclist—something that might encourage drivers to tune the signal out—B2V will only alert drivers to cyclists in ""potentially dangerous situations."" What defines such situations will, of course, be critical to making the system effective."
12609,"The timeline is fuzzy as well, but Trek’s brand manager, Eric Bjorling, said anticipated first-generation B2V could be on the market in as little as two years. Bjorling also indicated that the plan is to make B2V’s eventual bike and car technologies open source."

12626,"Whether it’s for fit, style, or performance, gender-bending on bikes goes both ways
"
12627,"Once upon a time, women’s bikes were easy to identify: They had a huge sloping top tube so a lady could saddle up without her skirt bunching up and billowing immodestly in the breeze. Today, some women’s specific design (WSD) still includes a sloping top tube, now known as “stand over” or “step through” for easy on-and-off, especially in case of emergency. Many are also designed for typical female bodies, which tend to be smaller (the average woman is 5’4” tall) and proportionally lighter in the upper body, with smaller hands and so forth. Oh, and they’re often painted in prettier colors."
12628,"But here’s the thing. You don’t have to dig too deep to discover that there are plenty of men who, when it comes to bikes, either do or would like to shop in the ladies' departmentbecause frankly, fit and style are not gender issues."
12629,"“We find many men actually really like our colors,” says Janette Sherman, global marketing manager at Liv, Giant’s sister brand. “They also will ask for the bike by name. I’ve personally seen men looking for the Lust most often. Of course, Liv bikes are specifically designed for women and are designed to fit that stature, especially in the smaller sizes. We see men of shorter stature gravitating toward our bikes because of that.”"
12630,"WSD can also be a good solution for juniors, says Theodore Essenfeld of San Diego, California. After much research and number crunching, Essenfeld bought a Kinesis Racelight KR-210L for his 10-year-old son, which the kid raced like a boss. “At four-foot-ten, he deals with many of the fit issues petite women endure; short reach and toe overlap with 700c wheels was a big challenge,” Essenfeld says . “A good fit is key to comfort and performance. I dislike the women’s specific label because body shapes vary. This is marketed as a woman’s frame but it isn’t ridden by a woman. It’s ridden by someone it fits.”"
12631,"Rich Stianche, owner of D’na Bikes in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, agrees. “I have fitted quite a few male customers to women’s bikes simply for the better fit,” he says. “All that matters in the end is that people are comfortable on their ride. If they are, they’ll ride more, and that’s what counts.”"
12632,"Of course, there’s the collective issue of women’s specific graphics, colors, and design, which—as it does with women—achieves mixed results with men. Some, like Essenfeld, are not big fans."
12633,"“We definitely had to repaint the frame,” he says. “The women’s specific graphics weren’t even popular with the women we know.” Others like Frank Stec of State College, Pennsylvania, are all over it. “If only Liv made the Intrigue SX in an XL, you would have me for the style component.”"
12634,"Ryan Dudek, who races for Kelpius Cycling in Philadelphia, also pines after the cool colors seen on women’s bikes. “I have not actually pulled the trigger on a Liv over a Giant, but I have contemplated it many times because the Liv bikes look so much better,” he says. “Unfortunately, in order to save money and offer a less expensive MSRP, Liv often stocks lower component levels for the same level of complete bike,” Dudek says."
12635,Which brings us to something both sexes complain about: Women’s specific bikes have traditionally been—and largely still are—outfitted with lower-level componentry relative to similar men’s bikes in order to keep them economical for the manufacturer (and seemingly the consumer).
12636,But that consumer demographic is changing; women’s bikes might lose potential male buyers as well as high-end-seeking female buyers because of lacking technology.
12637,"As Milin Balsara of Oakland, California, puts it: “Women’s frames generally would fit me better since I have long legs and a short torso. I would have gotten a women’s frame [when I was in the market], but at the time, and even now, a lot of companies won’t offer their best stuff in a ‘women’s fit.’ And that annoys me to no end on a number of levels. In the end I went with a custom frame.”"
12638,"In an age where we’re all more comfortable in our own skin and owning our personal style, it might be time to hang up the preconceived notions of what men and women need or want; start making bikes that everyone can and will want to ride; and label them by something other than gender. Judging from what we’re hearing on both ends of the male-female spectrum, it just might work."

12648,RELATED: These are the 7 Indoor Trainers and Rollers our Gear Experts Recommend Most
12649,"A trainer, which lifts the back wheel and fixes it in place, works by applying resistance to the wheel to create a ride-like feel. The least expensive options use a magnetic or fluid resistance, with higher-end models offering digital route simulations, phone connectivity, and power-specific workouts. Trainers are a great option for small spaces, new riders, or anyone who likes to zone out while riding indoors, because they're really hard to fall off of. "
12650,"Rollers, on the other hand, tend to require a little more concentration. Rollers consist of a set of cylinders attached to an external frame, and work like a treadmill for your bike—you simply get on and start riding. Because you're free to move back and forth, and depend on your own balance to remain upright, it's easier to have a mishap if you're not paying attention.

12761,"You might look at the Allied Alfa All Road’s disc brakes and generous tire clearance (up to 38mm) and be inclined to call it a gravel bike or an adventure bike. But despite having these features in common with those types of bikes, the All Road is something quite different."
12762,"It is a light, road-race-influenced bike with quick steering, a tight wheelbase (its chainstays are 420mm, only 1cm longer than those on the Allied’s rim-brake Alfa road bike), and a bottom bracket with 69mm of drop (similar to a race bike, though its longer fork and the option to add bigger tires would effectively raise the BB’s height). Unlike the stability-forward feel of a gravel bike, the All Road is very lively. With narrower tires, it’s almost indistinct from a road-race bike in the way it feels and moves: it's stiff at the bottom bracket, with efficient pedaling; it’s compliant and very smooth; and it’s sharp, accurate, and intuitive in its handling."

12764,
12765,
12766,"The All Road’s simple, 920-gram (claimed) frame also distinguishes it from the gravel genre. You won't find mounts for fenders, racks, a third bottle cage, or a top-tube bag; it doesn’t have suspension, and it won’t accommodate 650b wheels. It’s just a bike with clean lines and proven geometry without the fluff. That isn’t to say those amenities aren’t desirable, even crucial, for a certain type of rider. But from my experience, it’s mostly the tires—and a bit of help from lower gearing—that make a bike capable off pavement. Despite bike manufacturers’ attempts to convince you otherwise—because selling you two bikes instead of one is in their best interest—a simple tire swap (and, of course, the appropriate clearance) is often all it takes to expand your road bike’s potential. That’s why, if you’re more in the market for a versatile bike (in terms of where it can go) and less concerned about having all those extras, the All Road fits the bill."
12767,You Versus the Peloton: Riding on Flat Roads:
12768,"With 25mm Vittoria Corsas, the All Road is a road-racing bike. But throw on a set of 38mm Panaracer GravelKing SKs, and it becomes a gravel bike (race or otherwise). Hell, with 33mm Challenge Baby Limus tires, it becomes a cyclocross bike—or even a sweet singletrack ripper. I rode it primarily with 30mm Kenda Valkyries, which made the All Road a honey badger that didn’t give a shit where I rode it. Best part: Bigger tires don’t change the All Road’s fast and stiff personality; they just allow it to go more places and roll more smoothly. (Check out the world’s best cycling rides and routes, from Italy and Belgium to Arizona and Texas, in Bicycling's book The Cyclist's Bucket List.)"
12769,"The All Road isn’t the only alternative for a big-tire-ready, disc-brake, drop-bar bike. It may not be the right bike for everyone. But I like it because it feels and handles like the road-racing-style bikes I’ve been riding all my life. Only now it has much better brakes and can fit much bigger tires. It’s a bike that lets me go more places and do things I’d never dream about doing on a typical rim-brake, road-racing bike. And going places is how I have adventures."
12770,"The wireless electronic shifting group has been in production for five years. Here’s what you need to know about the finally-completed product.
"
12771,"It’s here: SRAM’s wireless electronic system, in development since 2011 and publicly raced by SRAM’s professional teams for over a year, is now officially official. And though we’re excited, it’s not quite available for consumers yet. We did, however, attend a press event at SRAM’s European Development and Training Center in Schweinfurt, Germany, where the company finally provided all the info—price, weight, and on-sale details—and gave me an opportunity to ride the group."
12772,"Here’s the Brief Version
	It is called Red eTap, and will be in shops in spring 2016. It shares chain, cassette, cranks, and brakes with the Red22 mechanical group; weighs 2,096 grams (about 137g more than a Red22 mechanical group when shift cables and housing are accounted for); and will cost about $2,760 for a complete group (about $780 more than Red22 mechanical)."
12773,"There are accessory remote shifter buttons called Blips. The battery packs in the derailleurs are interchangeable, and are claimed to be good for 1000km or 60 hours of riding, and to be rechargeable in 45 minutes; each shift lever contains a CR2032 battery. The custom wireless communication language, called Airea, uses 128-bit rolling encryption; only one set of shifters can be paired to a system. Both derailleurs have a mechanical disconnect to prevent crash damage and protect their internals: The derailleur will give way in an impact, then returns to its original position"
12774,
12775,
12776,"Why Wireless?
	While electronic has more going for it than mechanical shifting—such as more intricate shift movements, remote shifters, and automatic features—wireless is just electronic without wires."
12777,"The disadvantages are easily noted: separate power sources for each element, increased complexity, battery anxiety, not to mention wireless interference anxiety."
12778,"So what, then, are the advantages? Primarily, installation and setup: There are no wires to fish through the frame, no junction boxes or batteries to place, and fewer bits to rattle. During his part of the presentation, SRAM’s advanced development manager Brian Jordan claimed it will take longer to remove a mechanical or wired electronic system than it will to install a new eTap system."
12779,     RELATED: This Might be the Best Road Group Ever
12780,"There are less significant, but still noteworthy, advantages: no connectors to come loose or fail; no wires to accidentally cut; a cleaner looking bike; and, potentially, more opportunity for frame optimization. Those are great things, but, as Chris Zigmont, SRAM’s road brand director, noted in his launch presentation, “Once it’s set up, you don’t care if it’s wireless.”"
12781,"Airea
	SRAM calls their wireless technology Airea. It operates on the 2.4gHz frequency, like many wireless devices, and is not ANT+, Bluetooth, or WiFi, but a spread spectrum “custom communication language for shifting,” with, “high noise immunity,” Jordan said."
12782,"Developed by a group of programmers, cryptographers, and hackers, it employs 128bit rolling encryption and is “more secure than any cash machine,” Zigmont said, with Jordan adding that the people who developed Airea have tried to hack it and can’t."
12783,"Though the distance from rear derailleur to shifters is only about one meter, Jordan states that Airea has a range of 100 meters to ensure a robust connection. Only one set of shifters may be paired to a system."
12784,"SRAM came to its launch presentation prepared to answer every single tweet, comment, and forum post outlining cyclists’ wireless anxiety. The short version: According to Scott McLaughlin, SRAM’s global engineering and design director, the company extensively evaluated environmental wireless noise and accommodated for it by testing the heck out of Airea in the lab. Throughout nearly one million kilometers of field testing, McLaughlin said, the wireless system has been “completely flawless.”"
12785,
12786,
12787,"That said, SRAM did allow that interference is possible, but not probable. SRAM also admitted that someone could potentially hack the group, but posed a rhetorical question: “Why would someone put so much effort into hacking some derailleurs? What would they get out of it?”"
12788,"But let’s be real: There are people out there who may try to hack Airea just to see if they can, though shifting somebody’s derailleurs is hardly as attention-grabbing or disastrous as taking control of a passenger jet."
12789,"In addition to Airea, the rear derailleur contains an ANT+ radio for sending gear selection and battery life information to head units. SRAM says the information is sent on an open profile that any head unit maker can use. At the launch, some SRAM employees had Garmin Edge 520 head units with the profile activated."
12790,     Related: Why We've Been Waiting for SRAM's Wireless Group
12791,"Battery Stuff
	One of the primary differences between SRAM eTap and electronic groups from Shimano and Campagnolo is the battery situation. With a wired system, one battery powers everything, and there is one battery to keep tabs on and recharge. SRAM’s eTap has four batteries."
12792,"The front and rear derailleurs use identical lithium-polymer battery packs. SRAM had a lot of flexibility on the capacity of these packs, but ultimately the goal was enough capacity for one month of heavy use in cold temperatures “with a lot of buffer on top.” That works out to about 1000km or 60 hours of riding time for the rear derailleur; the front derailleur’s battery should last about 50 percent longer (depending on use). Those estimates are in normal conditions; below -20 and above 50 degrees Celsius, battery performance falls off.
	 "
12793,
12794,
12795,"The derailleur batteries have their own charging cradle powered by USB. The charger can be plugged into a computer, or into SRAM’s wall adapter, which can power two cradles. This is one of the advantages of SRAM’s battery packs: Unlike Shimano’s internal battery or Campagnolo’s EPS system, the bike doesn’t need to be near an outlet to charge the system. From fully depleted, they charge in about 45 minutes, and the batteries are good for about 100 charge cycles. A new or spare battery costs $40 and comes with a charge tester."
12796,"The shifters are powered by a CR2032 coin cell—the same battery found in many heart rate straps, speed and cadence sensors, and power meters. SRAM claims the shifter batteries will last about two years under normal use."
12797,     RELATED: First Ride: Shimano XTR Di2
12798,"Battery life is extended by the accelerometer in each electronic component. After 15 minutes of inactivity, the system goes to sleep; when the bike is moved, the system wakes up. When traveling longer distances or flying with the bike, SRAM recommends removing the batteries because the constant motion will prevent the system from sleeping. If a shifter button is pressed for 15 seconds or more, the system sleeps."
12799,Current charge status is indicated by an LED on each component. A green flash indicates 100 to 15 hours of use left; a single red flash means 15 to five hours left; five quick red flashes and less than five hours remain.
12800,"Shifting
	Like SRAM’s mechanical groups, eTap uses a one lever (button)—one direction format, but takes advantage of the capabilities of electronics to initiate shifts in a way mechanical can’t."
12801,
12802,
12803,"SRAM describes eTap’s shifting as similar to a sports car’s paddle shifters: Press the left side paddle for rear derailleur downshifts (easier); right side for rear derailleur upshifts (harder). Hold a button down and the rear derailleur will continue shifting until the button is released or the largest/smallest cog is reached. For a front derailleur shift (up or down depending on start position), press left and right buttons at the same time."
12804,"This format, Zigmont said, makes it “impossible to mistake upshift for downshift, and impossible to accidentally execute a front derailleur shift.”"
12805,"Electronic shifting offers many more possibilities for shift button placement than mechanical, and SRAM did explore and test many different layouts, McLaughlin said. But it returned to its signature shift paddle movement, placement, and shape because internal feedback deemed it most advantageous. McLaughlin did allow that because it was mostly SRAM employees testing the different button placements, their familiarity and comfort with SRAM’s mechanical ergonomics may have resulted in the final outcome of eTap’s ergonomics."
12806,
12807,
12808,"The front derailleur borrows Yaw cage articulation from the Red mechanical group. Yaw, claims Brad Menna, SRAM’s road project manager, eliminates front-derailleur rub without resorting to automatic trimming, like Campagnolo and Shimano’s electronic groups, as the rider works up and down the cassette. The initial movement of the eTap front derailleur does vary depending on the rear cog selected."
12809,"Each shift lever has ports for remote shifter buttons called Blips. Blips shift the same direction as the shifter they’re plugged into, and can be used together to shift the front derailleur —provided one is plugged into the right and one is plugged into the left. Two Blips can be plugged into each shifter, so the shift levers with a full complement of Blips would offer three locations per side from which to shift. Four different wire lengths (150mm: 6 grams; 230mm: 7g; 450mm: 8g; and 650mm: 9g) allow them to be placed almost anywhere on the bar."
12810,
12811,
12812,"SRAM showed many different examples of placement, including positioning two directly next to each other so all shifting could be done from the bar tops with one hand. Blips can be exposed, mounted under bar tape, or glued directly to the bar."
12813,"Shifting speed and direction is not customizable and there are no diagnostic tools available. However, a USB transmitter and software (for both Windows and OSX) will be offered to push firmware updates. Lever reach is adjustable."
12814,"eTap for Triathlon and Time Trial
	Wireless is particularly advantageous for ever-more complex and integrated time trial and triathlon bikes, and SRAM will offer eTap for aerobar setups from the start. The solution is based around the Blips described above, but instead of plugging into the drop bar shift/brake levers, they plug into a Blipbox sending unit (31 grams, $300, powered by one CR2032 battery). The four-port Blipbox (two buttons per direction) is a hair smaller than a Garmin Edge 500, and mounts to the bike with a quarter-turn Garmin-style interface."
12815,
12816,
12817,"Setup
	The shortest part of SRAM’s eTap launch presentation was the derailleur mounting and pairing, and fine-tuning the shifting."
12818,"The front derailleur is installed and set up like SRAM’s Yaw mechanical front derailleur but with two tweaks: It uses a reinforcing wedge (three are included to accommodate different frame shapes) to prevent the derailleur from flexing while shifting, but does not use SRAM’s chain spotter. A press of the function button on the front derailleur shifts the derailleur inboard and outboard so it can be set up without pairing the shifters. The rear derailleur (28-tooth max) is bolted to the frame like any rear derailleur."
12819,"Pairing is faster and simpler than pairing a Bluetooth headset to a smartphone. For a demonstration, check out this one minute video."
12820,
12821,"Fine-tuning the rear derailleur shifting is achieved by holding the function button on a shift lever while pressing the lever: The left button moves the derailleur left, while the right moves it right. Each press moves the rear derailleur 0.2mm, and there are a total of 26 positions, enough range for a complete shift."
12822,"Testing and Manufacturing
	In addition to testing the wireless robustness, SRAM implemented other tests for its foray into electronic shifting. Most significantly, every shifter and derailleur is powered up and tested at the end of the production line."
12823,"But before the parts got there, McLaughlin said, SRAM did other testing during the development of eTap to ensure the electronics were dust- and waterproofed and could stand up to “aggressive power washing”."

12826,"Additionally, SRAM tested eTap for plenty of other possible stumbling blocks: chemical compatibility and corrosion resistance, to ensure common cycling lubes and cleaners don’t harm the products; temperature (both extremes and rapid temperature changes) and humidity tests; static discharge resistance; various tests to prove the security of the battery attachment and to ensure it can’t be improperly installed; and vibration and tumble testing."
12827,"Though the circuit boards are manufactured out-of-house, the eTap shifters and derailleurs are assembled at SRAM’s factory inside a clean room, by workers with anti-static protection."
12828,"An interesting anecdote about eTap’s SRAM’s production history: The company tooled up a full production line for its third generation of prototypes for training and learning only. At the end of the run, all the parts were destroyed, and the line was torn down and then rebuilt for final production using the knowledge gained in the mock run. By the time eTap reaches final production, SRAM will have spent five years developing the manufacturing process and will have completed 32 pilot runs on eTap."
12829,"Riding eTAP
	I was able to ride eTAP for 233km over eight hours at this press event. While not a long-term test, it is more time than I usually get on a product at a launch."
12830,"Here’s what struck me the most: The group’s most notable feature–being wireless–is not noticeable while riding. Within a few kilometers, the wireless part is forgotten because eTAP behaves like an electronic group. There is no lag, no misfires: Push the button and it shifts, just like any wired electronic or mechanical group that’s been properly set up."
12831,     RELATED: SRAM’s Wireless eTap Spotted in the Wild
12832,"There were no interference issues. Our group numbered close to 50—we were together for initial setup and bike fit loops in the parking lot, and then broke into two groups for our ride— all equipped with eTAP, all carrying wireless phones, most using Garmin head units, many equipped with power meters. Our rides began in an industrial city with lots of people, wireless communications, power lines, and other potential sources of interference—and there were no glitches. I would guess that it is possible to encounter some interference somewhere, somehow, that may hamper a shift. But it’s possible only because it’s not impossible. Based on my initial rides, I will have no “wireless anxiety” when I ride eTAP in the future."
12833,"SRAM’s mechanical ergonomics work well for me, so adapting to the eTap hoods and levers was easy. Like Shimano Di2 vs. Shimano mechanical, the eTap hoods are slightly smaller in diameter than their mechanical counterparts. Blessed with comically-short fingers, this suited me well, and I took full advantage of the provided reach adjustment."
12834,
12835,
12836,"Shifting was intuitive and, other than brain-farting and trying to use the right eTap lever like a SRAM mechanical shifter a few times, I never missed a shift I wanted to make. The front derailleur shifting action was easy to adopt, and there seems to be some forgiveness in the system so you don’t need to be extraordinarily precise with the timing of the lever presses. By my third ride on the group, I did find there was truth to SRAM’s statement that you can’t mis-shift this system."
12837,"Guessing that I was going to ride eTap at this event, I spent my rides preceding the launch exclusively on Shimano Di2 and Campagnolo EPS. In comparison, eTap’s rear shifting felt a little slower and noisier than both, and somewhat less smooth than Di2 (though the eTap was brand new and the Di2 and EPS were well broken-in)."
12838,"I asked SRAM representatives about the shifting speed and they said they had wide latitude in this area, but settled on the final speed based on testing and feedback from field testers and professional athletes. They wanted it fast enough to feel responsive, but not so fast that it jumped or skipped the shift gates."
12839,"It’s hard for me to say if I would prefer it faster or not (I’d need to try different speeds to find out), but I don’t think the shifting speed, though slower than anticipated, was detrimental to my experience or ride performance. Perhaps it was just that I had a certain expectation, not right or wrong, and it was not met."
12840,     RELATED: First Look: FSA’s Electronic Groupset
12841,"The brake calipers are the same as those in the current Red mechanical group, and braking performance felt the same: Good, though our rides were rolling affairs on open roads in good weather with nary a switchback or grade exceeding a few percent. (I rode the latest Zipp carbon wheels with Zipp platinum pads.)"
12842,"Where it Goes From Here
	SRAM has a number of products that could see wireless enhancement. SRAM representatives were not exactly subtle with their hints about eTap’s next step: Hydraulic braking for rim and disc. I’d also expect to see a 1x-specific rear derailleur—with straight parallelogram and clutch—in the not too distant future. Hydro plus 1x would make for some seriously happy cyclocrossers. No mentions were made of eTap for mountain bikes, but I can say with some certainty that it is on the to-do list."
12843,"In a sea of standard corporate monikers, these cycling company names stand out
"
12844,"For the past several months I’ve been testing an excellent bike jersey from an independent company called Hill Killer Apparel. As much as I love the bike brand’s Classic Jersey, with its comfortable, lightweight feel and distinctly retro vibe, seldom does the jersey go without comment—especially when I’m inevitably passed on a climb."
12845,"Just a couple weeks ago a line of roadies grunted “What’s up, Hill Killer?” as they blasted past on a switchback—and there simply wasn’t time to retort with a comeback about how I’m testing the jersey, or perhaps just wearing it ironically. But despite the relentless guff brought on by telegraphing the words HILL KILLER in giant letters when you’re, at best, a “hill irker,” I love the name of the company. It’s bold. It’s confident. It offers a simple, reassuring mantra when you’re in your smallest gear, staring down the barrel of a long 12-percent grade with no discernible crest. Plus, wear it to race on the track, and no one can really call you on it."
12846,"So with respect to the audacity of Hill Killer Apparel, here are some of the other company names we love."
12847,"Moots: Moots makes great bikes, but even more importantly, it’s just a fun brand name to say. We gave this year’s Moots Vamoots one of our 2015 Editor’s Choice awards, and let’s just say there was no shortage of angling to ride the Moots, debating the pros and cons of the Moots, and just plain old making up excuses to say the word “Moots.”"
12848,"DZ Nuts: You knew it would be on here. We’re adults, but we’re only human. Every 13-year-old’s favorite comeback is also the name of a “high-viscosity” chamois cream line formulated by pro Dave Zabriskie. If you’re losing the battle against saddle sores, give in to your inner child’s sense of humor and load up on DZ Nuts. "
12849,"Panache Cycling: Aside from making some of our favorite women’s kits, the American brand Panache has the kind of name that just evokes confidence, flamboyance, and joie de vivre. It also falls in the “fun to say” category. Words like “epic” and “legendary” get used far too often in cycling, but “panache?” We could stand to hear more of that one."
12850,"Harlot Bike Wear: Less a description of scandalous bike apparel, Harlot Bike Wear’s name nods to an era when critics thought the bicycle might lead women to “immodesty” and “immoral acts.” Since 2004, the company has sold casual cycling clothes to women who can laugh off the sexist misconceptions of the 1800s and celebrate the freedom bicycles have brought us ever since. "

12872,
12873,
12874,"Compliance and comfort were top priorities for Felt with this new bike, leading the company to redesign the seat tube, seatstay, and top tube shapes and junctions. Variable profile seatstays are flattened in the middle for vertical deflection and improved compliance. A shorter seat tube exposes more of the 27.2mm seatpost, allowing greater flex. The seatstays attach outboard to the seat tube, which reduces weight and introduces flex in the seat tube just above this junction. The new design allows for a whopping 74 percent increase in fore/aft movement measured at the saddle compared to the Z Series."
12875,
12876,
12877,"Felt also improved handling and steering precision with a 23 percent increase in head tube stiffness. Like most bikes in its category, the VR features endurance-focused geometry with a higher stack and shorter reach for a more upright riding position and relaxed angles for stability. The VR is constructed with the same InsideOut technique and carbon materials such as TeXtreme. As a result, the frame weighs just 950 grams and the fork 390 grams. Like the brand's new FR, Felt uses three different size-specific lower bearings in the VR’s headset to maintain consistent ride quality through the size range. Size 43cm and 47cm use 1-1/8”, 51cm and 54cm 1-1/4” while 56cm, 58cm, and 61cm see a 1-1/2” lower bearing."

All VR models have disc brakes with the Flat Mount caliper standard and thru axles in both front and rear wheels. The VR’s internal cable routing is compatible with all drivetrain styles, and everything runs through frame for protection from elements. All of its cable ports are fully sealed, as well."

12884,"Felt outfits the VR with a new sub-compact gearing, which offers a comfortably low climbing gear. The new 46-30t chainring configuration paired to 28c tires offers a six percent reduction in top speed, but an 11 percent gain in climb gearing, compared to 50-34t compact chainrings with 23c tires. Hidden mounts on the fork and seatstays are designed to pair with a fender kit developed in-house by Felt for the bike. You'll also find pair of bosses located above the top tube for mounting a small bag or even extra water bottle cage. "
12885,
12886,
12887,"I rode the a VR2 on an out-and-back ride up Black Star Canyon road, not far from Felt’s Irvine, California headquarters. The ride included a mix of bike path, road, and about four miles of dirt at the end. At this point I did not know about the 74 percent increase in seatpost deflection but I could sure feel it. I rode over bumps and rough patches of road, in the saddle, quite comfortably with very little of the road vibration transmitted to my behind. It’s not just smooth at the saddle either; the sensations through the pedals and handlebars were similarly good, just not quite to the same degree. When it’s go time the VR has plenty of kick with a nice stiff and efficient feel. I have not ridden a Z-Series bike, so I can't compare the two, but I would put the VR right in there with other models I have tested, like the GT Grade and Cervelo C5—two very good bikes. As I climbed some of the steeper pitches of dirt on Black Star Canyon I was super happy with the low gearing that the sub-compact 30-tooth chainring and 32-tooth cog provided—a smart choice on a bike like this."

I’m a big fan of high-volume tires, especially on a bike like this, so I feel like it could benefit from something even larger, particularly if you're frequently riding rough and/or dirt roads. Tires up to 35mm wide do fit, but they do not meet ISO clearance standards, so they're not officially recommended. "

The 2016 Warbird features front and rear thru-axles, which provided the rear end stiffness that enabled the company to employ what it calls its “Class 5 Vibration Reduction System” (VRS): The seatstays are bent outward (it looks similar to a wishbone from the back) to soak up the bumps and chatter from riding off-road at speed. The SRAM Rival 22-equipped Warbird Carbon is available in black or white for $3,500, while the aluminum version is available with 105 for $2,499, or Tiagra for $1,999."

Salsa launched the bike at the 2015 Tour Divide, where it was raced to a second-place finish by Jay Petervary. The Cutthroat features shortened chainstays to give it a more nimble ride than the Fargo, yet one that’s still stable enough to be forgiving to a sleep-deprived racer on a multi-day vision quest. It maximizes front triangle space for cargo, and Salsa’s Woodchipper bars sport flared drops and more options for places to rest tired hands. The Firestarter carbon fork is the same as that on the Fargo, and the bike has mounts for Salsa Anything cages, which can hold round items like Nalgenes, rolls, or sleeping pads. The Cutthroat also features Class 5 VRS technology. It’s available as a frameset for $1,999, and goes up to $3,999 built with a SRAM Rival 1x11 drivetrain with a wide-range, 10-42 cassette."

12949,"Designing one piece of equipment that can adapt to the huge diversity of speeds and terrain a modern mountain biker encounters is a challenge. Companies are always trying to make products that provide as much versatility as possible with the fewest compromises. It’s what leads to equipment like six-inch travel forks with lockouts, wide-range single-ring drivetrains, and suspension frames that attempt to climb efficiently and descend smoothly."
12950,Into this circus drops Giro’s new Switchblade helmet with a removable chin bar.
12951,
12952,
12953,Bell—Giro’s corporate cousin—offers a removable chin bar helmet also called the Super 2R. But here’s what sets the Switchblade apart from the Super 2R and Giro’s original Switchblade from 1998: They are/were trail and XC helmets respectively that the rider could add a chin bar to; the new Switchblade is a downhill helmet with a chin bar that may be removed.
12954,It’s a fundamentally different design. The new Switchblade’s removable portion is just the chin bar: the removable component of the Super 2R—like the first Switchblade—is a larger component that covered the ears and wraps around the back of the helmet.
12955,
12956,
12957,"Compared to a Super 2R, the Switchblade is a heavier and heavier-duty helmet, and more of the head is covered more of the time.The new Switchblade weighs 977 grams with a chin bar, 699 without (size medium, my scale), and provides a lot of coverage, including the riders ears and surrounding area, which are always protected. For comparison, a Super 2R weighs 429 grams without the chin bar; Giro’s Montaro trail helmet (no chin bar option) weighs 381g."
12958,     RELATED: Bell Super 2 and Super 2R Wraparound Chin Bar
12959,"Installation and removal of the chin bar is easy, and, with some practice, fast. To release, press the two toggles on the underside of the chin bar, and pull forward (it helps to rotate the chin bar up slightly). To install, guide the chin bar’s buttons into slots in the helmet’s ear cups until they click, then pull down. The chin bar’s hardware is stainless steel so it shouldn’t corrode from sweat, hot breath, or rain. Giro claims it designed the hardware to prevent injury should that area of the helmet take a hard hit."
12960,
12961,
12962,"If you’re wondering what the hell a helmet like this is for, here’s your one-word summary: enduro. At the professional level, this style of racing exemplifies the diversity that is mountain biking. The descents are practically World Cup level downhill tracks, but the riders often face tough XC-like transfers between stages. They want to wear downhill helmets for the stages, but a DH helmet is too hot, stuffy, and heavy for a tough transfer."
12963,
12964,
12965,"The Switchblade was designed to provide these racers one helmet that offered the protection of their full-face DH helmets—the Switchblade is certified to the ASTM DH 1952, CPSC, and EN 1078 helmet standards—in a lighter weight, better ventilated format, that, with the chin bar removed, offers additional comfort for the transfers."
12966,
12967,
12968,"With 20 vents (Giro’s Cipher full face helmet has eight) and internal channeling, it’s more ventilated than most dedicated DH helmets to start. Pop the chin bar off, and the helmet is a lot less stuffy than a DH helmet, and air rushes over the face more easily. In the ear cups, where the chin bar plugs in, are channels designed to suck in air and flow it over the ears. It sounds hokey, but based on my rides in the helmet, they do work."
12969,
12970,
12971,"The Switchblade is light for a DH helmet too. At under 1000 grams (with chin bar), it’s lighter than other popular full-face downhill helmets like the Giro Cipher ($200), Bell Full9 ($400), Specialized Dissident ($350), and the Troy Lee Designs D3 Carbon ($450). Plus, the $250 Switchblade is cheaper than all of them except the Cipher; offers the removable chin bar feature; and has the MiPS, which, a Giro representative claims, offers “more protection in certain impacts.”"

12973,"If you’re wondering what to do with the chin bar when you ride, you can lash it to a hydration pack, or, if you’re like the cool kids and don’t wear a pack, Giro employees and sponsored riders have been stuffing it down the back of their shorts—really. I tried this method on a few rides and while I won’t say it was the most comfortable or elegant solution ever, I found it easily tolerable for over an hour’s worth of riding."
12974,
12975,
12976,"The chin strap is wide and robust, and the closure is a double-D ring system like a downhill or motorcycle helmet. An adjustable closure system fine-tunes the fit, and the dial has a bumper to prevent accidental adjustment caused by bumps from neck braces or hydration packs."
12977,
12978,
12979,"Naturally, the Switchblade is goggle compatible, and the standard visor can be pushed well back to create a stash point. Giro representatives stated that glasses are also accommodated, which I was able to verify in my test rides; I was even able to stash my glasses in the rear vents."
12980,Giro sent me a Switchblade a few weeks before the official announcement and I’ve been wearing it for most of my mountain bike rides. My feeling is that your impression of it will be influenced by what you compare it against.
12981,
12982,
12983,"My go-to mountain helmet is Giro’s Montaro, and compared to that, the Switchblade is noticeably a lot more helmet: heavy, claustrophobic, and hot. Plus, as my wife will tell you, the coverage over the ears restricts your hearing. But the extra coverage compared to a trail helmet is confidence inspiring. You feel safer (which may not the same thing as actually being safer), and once you adjust to the weight and extra padding around the ears, the helmet is comfortable and locked onto the rider's head."
12984,
12985,
12986,"But I think it’s a mistake to compare it to a trail helmet; the Switchblade should be compared to a DH helmet. And compared to that, the Switchblade with the chin bar is light, super ventilated, and very comfortable. And pulling the chin bar off makes the helmet so much more open and airy than a full face, it feels like losing more than half the helmet. I left the chin bar at home and did two hour rides on pretty hot days with the Switchblade, and though it wasn’t as comfortable as wearing a good trail helmet, wearing the Switchblade wasn’t torture."
12987,     RELATED: The 6 Coolest New Trail Helmets
12988,"As noted above, I had no problems using the Switchblade with sunglasses, with or without the chin bar. But I had issues with goggles: I found the Switchblade put pressure on the goggle frame—I was using Giro’s Blok MTB—and pushed them down on my face. No matter what I did with the fit system, I found myself constantly pushing the helmet shell back on my head to relieve the pressure on the goggles."
12989,
12990,
12991,"This could be related to my second complaint: I think the fit system’s height adjustment is biased too low. In the lowest position, it felt like it was almost digging into my spine, and the highest position wasn’t high enough for my preference."
12992,"When I raised my concerns to Giro, a representative responded, “One or two testers experienced similar issues to you, but only in size small helmets. When [the product managers] looked at solving it by modifying the fit system to allow for more fore/aft height adjustment they realized there was room to do so in all 3 sizes.So they've made a running adjustment. Your media sample does not reflect this adjustment, helmets which are arriving in shops now do.”"
12993,
12994,
12995,"The Switchblade should be available in mid-August. It will be offered in small, medium, and large sizes; six colors (Giro will offer color-matched versions of their Blok MTB goggle); and comes with an adjustable visor shown in the photos installed, and a visor with a three-tab Go-Pro style camera mount on the underside. To accommodate the extra weight of a camera, this visor is not angle adjustable, and more rigid than the standard visor."
12996,
12997,
12998,"I don’t think the Switchblade will replace a trail helmet, unless you really want extra protection and are willing to wear a heavier, hotter helmet. But if you’re looking for a light, well vented downhill helmet, one helmet for trail riding, enduro, and lift-served riding, or you just want to feel safer on any ride, the Switchblade is effective and impressively versatile."
12999,"Turn your road bike into a touring bike in one quick step
"
13000,"When, like me, you live in a small town without a car, the occasional weekend bike trip to the nearest city can be the only thing keeping your life from turning into a sad country song. Sure, the Blackburn Outpost Seat Pack was likely made for long bikepacking trips and escapes into the backcountry, but I’ve found it’s perfect for overnight escapades to civilization, too. Just throw a change of clothes in with a few bike tools and snacks, and set a course for the bright lights and multiple restaurant options of the big city."
13001,    RELATED: How to Plan a Weekend Micro-Adventure
13002,"This summer, I put the bag through the ringer on both a five-day gravel adventure through New England and a two-day out-and-back to Philly, where it generated a lot of interest for being such an ingenious cargo solution. The Outpost adjusts by volume; alone, it can handle cargo for about a two- to four-day trip, or a much longer bike tour with the addition of other bikepacking bags. The best part about taking it on short trips is there’s no need to bother with a touring bike, panniers, and a rack. It’s easy to attach and remove from any bike, provided you have the clearance to mount the pack between your saddle and rear tire (a 5-foot-two friend of mine faced difficulty with this and had to resort to panniers)."
13003,"Once I had the pack’s straps tightened securely enough against my saddle, I stopped noticing the added weight, and my bike tour became more like a road ride. As a bonus,  while technically not designated “waterproof,” the pack miraculously kept my gear dry through eight hours of riding in a torrential rainstorm."
13004,"Overall, the Outpost Seat Pack is the perfect solution for hauling all your stuff on a bike not designed to haul a lot of stuff. Think of it as the messenger bag that you don’t actually have to carry on your back for 70 miles. And at $99, it’s cheaper than most messenger bags—and two weekends’ worth of bus tickets to the city."
13005,"The only thing better than looking fast on this slick bike is riding it
"
13006,"Every now and then, I come across a bike that I know will be fun, before I’ve even touched it—let alone ridden it. You know the type. It’s a bike that looks fast even when it’s not moving; a bike so “stealth”—with meticulous aerodynamic features and an understated paint scheme that states, ‘I don’t have to compensate for anything’—that it prompts a totally contradictory reaction when it hits the pavement: Everyone notices it. And then when you get on it, the ride matches the appearance. For me, the Felt IA3 triathlon bike is one of those bikes. It’s not brand new, but it’s certainly lustworthy for anyone who wants to look good while beating down the clock."
13007,
13008,
13009,"While racing the IA3 in a sprint triathlon, on a flat course with a few turns on it, it felt like the bike knew the course. I’ve ridden many bikes in this category, and at this price point, and they can feel overly responsive to my input. The Felt, however, was more stable—it picked up on my subtle steering cues without veering more than I expected, and went where I projected it. But it was still plenty responsive: I could think about leaning into a turn without shifting my weight too much on the bike, and still get the IA3 to react. This is comforting on a technical course, where I had to find my way around other riders, with my hands on the bar extensions, cornering at speed."
13010,     RELATED: How to Turn Your Road Bike into a Time-Trial or Triathlon Machine
13011,"The ride quality was consistently dependable. On new, smooth pavement, the bike virtually disappeared beneath me; there was only that hollow, low, rumbling sound of the wind across the bike, and the bike on the road. On older, less-smooth roads, the IA3 adequately dampened some road chatter, sounded a little louder, and yet was still smooth enough to let me keep my power and speed high."
13012,
13013,
13014,"Felt’s Integrated Aero line of time trial and triathlon bikes extends from the top-of-the-line IA FRD, complete with Zipp 404/808 wheels and Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 electronic shifting, to the IA1 frameset, which allows riders to add their own components and wheels to Felt’s aerodynamic fuselage and cockpit. In the middle of Felt’s triathlon and time trial bike lineup is the IA3, complete with SRAM Red components, deep-profile carbon wheels, Felt’s proprietary cockpit, and the comfortable ISM Attack saddle. All of the bikes in Felt’s IA lineup share similar features, such as the fork, a rubber-topped storage area in the top tube where you can stash some energy chews or gels, and brakes integrated into the frame's bottom bracket area."
13015,
13016,
13017,"The IA3’s geometry—which is the same across all of Felt’s Integrated Aero models—accommodates just about any fit requirement and race distance, whether you’re doing a sprint triathlon with a 20km bike distance, an open 40km time trial, or an Ironman-distance event. Most of my time on this wicked-fast-looking bike was spent in preparation for 20km time trials, and sprint- and Olympic-distance triathlons. Felt’s proprietary cockpit is easily adjustable; however, on a size medium, I had the bar extensions at their minimum insertion point. The saddle height and position were also simple to set, in part because Felt specs the bike with a proprietary seatpost clamp that offers micro-adjustment of saddle fore/aft position, as well as nose angle. The seat tube clamp tightens down in the center of the seatpost, which is grooved to accomodate it. Once my saddle height and angle were set, I cut the supplied silicone strip, which seals that channel that runs the length of the seatpost. Although the seatpost might not seem like an area prone to drag, Felt has ensured that you won’t be wasting your watts on wind resistance there."
13018,
13019,
13020,
13021,
13022,"Felt differentiates its bikes not only by component specification, but also by the kind of carbon fiber used in frame construction. The IA3’s frame is made of high-modulus carbon (the second tier of carbon fiber layup schedules), which means it has a high carbon-fiber-to-resin ratio, and relatively more carbon strands per area than those in less expensive bikes. The massive, flattened seat tube seems to be tempered by small-diameter seat stays, mounted very low on the seat tube, for aerodynamics, compliance, and comfort. This results in greater stiffness, lower weight, and some forgiveness on rougher roads. To be certain, some road noise did come through the IA3—but I liked this. I could feel what was going on underneath me, and get a better sense of the terrain."
13023,     RELATED: Reviewed: Boardman AiR/ TT 9
13024,"I did have a few minor issues with the IA3. The stock carbon wheels (Felt-branded Novatec 50mm-deep carbon clinchers) are very sensitive to wind—maybe more than any deep-profile wheel I have ridden. The winds were pushing me around so much that I got nervous several times on fast descents and on the flats; I am a very average-sized adult male, so I do not usually get blown around. However, when racing, I swapped out these stock wheels for a Zipp 808 front wheel and a Super-9 rear disc, and experienced no steering issues. As with many non-premium carbon wheels, the Novatec wheels weren’t especially low-weight; my race wheelset—with a disc—was lighter, and easier to get up to speed."
13025,"The other issue of note was braking with the SRAM 990 brake levers, which operate Felt’s proprietary brake calipers. The levers are meant to rotate in place, in the base bar, to take up or add slack to the brake cables and allow a variety of wheel widths. Even with some tinkering, the brake levers never had a crisp feel, and they came out of adjustment more than once. The rear brake caliper, positioned under the bottom bracket and hidden behind a fairing, did not operate smoothly after a ride in the rain. Even after cleaning, the braking function was not on par with what I would expect of a bike at this price point."
13026,"The Felt IA3 is a pro-level bike with an enthusiast price tag. The ride is smooth and predictably fast, and offers ample comfort over long trips. With a race-day wheel swap, this just-right bike becomes a super bike—like the IA that carried Australian Mirinda Carfrae to two consecutive Ironman World Championships."

13097,"Your move, bike industry: Advanced Sports International (ASI), the parent company of Fuji Bikes and several other large cycling brands, announced Monday that it purchased Performance Bicycle, the largest brick-and-mortar bicycle store chain in the country and a major online retailer."
13098,"     Get the newest gear updates, training hacks, nutrition tips, and more in your inbox daily with theBicyclingnewsletter!"
13099,"It’s the latest big shift in a rapidly reshaping consumer bike market, which is seeing increasing consolidation, a rise in online sales, and the decline—in numbers, at least—of the independent retail shop."
13100,"ASI’s purchase puts the company on closer footing to the 'big three' brands—Specialized, Trek, and Giant—all of which have been aggressively competing in the retail arena, both online and in stores. It puts pressure on other mid-tier bike brands that Performance, for now, carries. And it raises the question of whether ASI’s current 2,000-strong dealers will still be able to offer shoppers such broad lines of product."
13101,     RELATED: How to Buy a Bike Online
13102,"Why the Buy?
	To understand why ASI made the purchase, just look at how the bike retail environment has changed over the past decade. Trek, Giant, and Specialized have become dominant in retail through several tactics. "
13103,"First, they opened some corporate-owned or franchised retail outlets. "
13104,"Second, and more important, they’ve separately pushed independent retailers to more strongly affiliate with them, in part by locking up increasing amounts of retail floor space in exchange for better sales terms. That tactic results in a smaller retail floor space footprint for every other brand to fight over."
13105,"Finally, both Trek and Giant have in the past year announced direct-to-consumer sales online, positioning themselves as “omnichannel” brands (retailers are still involved in direct online sales, but more from a service standpoint). "
13106,"All of that has put pressure on not just rival bicycle brands, but also accessory, apparel, and component companies, as well as shops. That’s the backdrop of ASI’s purchase."
13107,"ASI, which owns Fuji, Kestrel, SE, Breezer, and Phat Cycles, as well as component brand Oval Concepts, has 2,000 retailers in the US (not all of them carry every ASI brand). But ASI’s brands were in the same position as every other brand: fighting for slivers of floor space against the big three, or focusing on shops that weren’t Trek, Specialized, or Giant dealers. "
13108,"Performance already sells Fuji, Breezer, SE, and Kestrel, so the purchase doesn’t open new outlets, but ASI’s move does cement those as the core bike brands for Performance’s 106 physical retail locations. That means ASI no longer has to stress as much about fighting for floor space in other independent retailers, especially in markets with a Performance store."
13109,"ASI also picks up Performance’s house brands, like Scattante frames and accessories, Spin Doctor maintenance products, and component brand Forté. And the move strongly positions ASI for online retail through the performancebike.com and nashbar.com sites."

13111,"What This Means for Cyclists
	So, how will this affect you, the rider? It’s a bit early to tell. The product mix at Performance and Nashbar will definitely change, but how much and when are still to be decided. Pat Cunnane, ASI’s CEO, told Bicycle Retailer and Industry News that Performance would sell more ASI brands, “but they will not be an ASI store. Performance stores will sell other brands.”"
13112,"The question is which brands, and in which categories. Performance currently sells bikes from Ridley, GT, Diamondback, Marin, and Schwinn, among others, and will continue to do so for the time being, according to Bicycle Retailer. It’s easy to see Performance discontinuing at least some of those relationships."
13113,"But Performance likely can’t soon dump major accessory brands like Giro helmets or Pearl Izumi clothing; of all the brands under the new ASI umbrella, there’s not one for apparel, and Scattante only has a smattering of helmets."
13114,"When you put the buy in perspective of other large recent industry shifts, however, it underscores that the way we buy bikes is absolutely changing. "

13116,"The brick-and-mortar retailer is still dominant, but that is shifting. Consider the impact of just a few large online retailers: UK outlets Wiggle and Chain Reaction will merge later this year, and joint revenues top $400 million. Much of that is to domestic buyers in the UK, but some is to American customers. And Competitive Cyclist is part of the Backcountry.com empire, which across its various sites does roughly $500 million in sales of outdoor gear including bikes and accessories. Performance doesn’t break out numbers between brick-and-mortar versus online sales but, overall, the company did about $275 million in total sales last year. For context, the National Bicycle Dealers Association found the domestic US bike market was a $6.1 billion industry last year."
13117,"The biggest pending impact on US consumers (and to the US market) may not be Trek or Giant’s move into consumer-direct sales, but when Canyon begins online sales to US customers next spring. The German brand pioneered the direct-to-customer model and will come to the US as part of an investment from TSG Consumer Partners, which owns a stake in Backcountry.com. Its bikes are considerably less expensive than comparably equipped models from brands with traditional retail sales channels. "
13118,"As digital behemoths rise, NBDA reports that the number of independent retailers in the US has steadily dropped from over 6,200 in 2001 to just under 3,800 last year. Ultimately, the retail environment may split, with large brands pursuing their own, dedicated sales channels and bike shops working with the diverse array of smaller, independent brands, and refocusing on services like maintenance and bike fit (a shift already underway). "
13119,"ASI’s move isn’t a single earthshaking moment in that process. But it is more evidence that the changes in how we’ll buy bikes aren’t a cyclical trend; they’re a genuine shift, to an entirely new approach."
13120,"Campagnolo's 40802 car wheel was just dubbed ""the coolest wheel in history."" You probably didn't even know it existed."
13121,"When bike people hear the name Campagnolo, they might associate it with refined groupsets and top-of-the-line wheels favored by legends of the sport. However, the renowned Italian company once made components for cars as well as bikes—and, by all accounts, its engineering wowed motorists then as much as it does cyclists to this day."
13122,"Back in the late 1950s, Campy became one of the first manufacturers to perfect magnesium wheels, supplying them for use on a number of different cars (including models by Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Maserati) as well as motorcycles. These wheels were built to be lighter, stronger, and more durable than their peers, making them a preference among racers."

13125,Check out Campagnolo's hydraulic disc brakes:
13126,"“This is a simple multi-spoke wheel with a beefy-looking center hub and outer rim,” Jalopnik's Bradley Brownell wrote. “This was a wheel built for strength, capable of withstanding the rigors of tarmac rally in its day, but clearly with an eye on weight as well, using a simple structure of reinforcements as its only nod to style. Its beauty is found in its utilitarian build.”"
13127,"Porsche and Fiat outfitted some of their models with the 40802, and Ferrari’s Formula One racing team used the wheel in the 1970s. Campagnolo no longer manufactures any wheels for cars, but a few companies, including the UK's Group 4 Wheels, still produce replicas."

The machined 7075-T6 aluminum spokes thread directly into the brand's signature Torch hubs to increase strength and durability, while the rim shape is optimized for low tire pressure riding with a tubeless setup. (Reinforced rims also mean more dent resistance—but only add 20 grams from earlier iterations of the wheelset, weighing in at 1,480 grams.) The torch hubs feature I9's unique pawl design which boasts 120 points of contact for an impressive three degrees of engagement. That means you'll get precise control when accelerating— and you'll also make a distinctive buzzing noise when coasting. "

ENVE's M70 ‘high-volume’ wheels are wider than some of ENVE’s other models, so they’re built to withstand a serious pummeling. Handmade in the US with 31mm wide rims, the shape is slightly more shallow than the rest of the M-series wheels, leading to a stronger profile. The tubeless-ready rims fit tires from 2.3 to 2.5-inches and are ready for rocky terrain.

The coal-brown lens option (not pictured) enhances visibility for urban riding, with a transmission pattern that makes LED lighting—the type found in car head- and taillights and traffic lights—pop.

The lens was designed in conjunction with Carl Zeiss, maker of high-end camera lenses in the US, and is triple-CNC cut for a precise fit within the frame. There are four lens options, each designed to enhance contrast in various environments: two “deep forest” options, a desert lens, and a road tint. The frameless segment at the top helps these shades sit flush against the edge of a trail helmet, and POC’s “breakaway hinges”—the earpieces—will snap off the frame in the event of an impact.

The new collection includes shorts, jerseys, and jackets for both mountain and road riding, and features integrated abrasion and impact protection comprised of protective fabrics (like Kevlar) and POC’s impact-absorbing VPD material. The protection is subtly applied where you’re most likely to hit the ground or obstacles: shoulders, elbows, knees, and hips. POC’s Resistance mountain bike baggie shorts (pictured here) are available in three levels of protection, featuring the ceramic-coated, breathable, and abrasion-resistant SuperFabric.

With a single chainring in the front, and a 10- or 11-cog cassette with a wider range in the rear, the 1x provided the same high and low gears as a double-ring drivetrain, while eliminating front shifting. In 2014, 1x came to drop-bar bikes in the form of CX1 for cyclocross. Now, SRAM's Force 1 and Rival 1 groups are bringing 1x to the road."

13191,"I rode this bike after work on a day I felt especially cooped up and frustrated, so I was tearing around like a bat out of windowless office hell. I was surprised at how fluid the shifting was and how little I felt the need for another chainring.
	As for this particular gearing combination, I think a stronger rider would be okay with it. But for the fully loaded, cross-country touring I used to do, during which you're carrying 50 pounds, I would have needed a smaller gear in the front for the eastern part of the country (the Appalachians), though probably not the western (the Rockies). In my opinion, this setup was ideal for carrying weight, climbing steep terrain, being off-road, and any combination of two of those things—not all three of those conditions at the same time. —Caitlin Giddings
	I liked this system more than I expected. I took it up Tenth Street—which hits over 20 percent grades—with loaded panniers, and never felt like I didn't have enough gears. Sure, I was slow, but I could just chug along without fighting for every pedal stroke. Coming down Fifth, I had a high enough gear to be satisfied on the steep downhill too. —Taylor Rojek"
13192,"    RELATED: What You Need to Know About Bike Gear Shifting
	I tested the 1x on some long, solo rides, including one with 7,000 feet of climbing and dirt roads. Days like these, you turn your brain off and just pedal, so it was nice to forget about front shifting. The Double-Tap shifters were also a fantastic complement; they only further simplified things. One shifter, one chainring, one question: Easier or harder? Bada-bing, bada-boom. The nearly 1:1 low gear gave me what I needed even when climbs hit over 10 percent, and I rarely spun out on descents—though I wasn't pushing the pace, because that wasn't the point. It was also easy to quickly find my comfortable gear. Maybe if you were gravel racing, you'd want a bigger gear and more fine-tuning. But 1x was ideal for these long, climb-y rides where you're just out to explore all day. —Gloria Liu"
13193,"Should You Single Up?: Definitely, maybe, probably, sure. For lightweight touring and all-day adventure riding, we love the simplicity and climbing assistance of a 1x and a wide-range cassette. But on longer, fully-loaded tours and gravel races, you may want more gearing options."

	Who is this 1x drivetrain for? Maybe someone like me. I don't race. I don't train. I just like to ride. I like to knock around town and commute. My ride to work is a rolling 10 miles. Having fewer gears to deal with and no left lever to think about is awesome. Shifting is smooth and quiet, too. I could confidently tell someone who wants a bike for recreational use that a 1x drivetrain is really worth considering. —Jennifer Sherry"

	I was pedaling up a short but steep wall of road, clicking into easier gears along the way. As I neared the crest, I rose out of the saddle because I figured I'd reached my easiest gear. When I stopped to rest at the top, tired but not trashed, I was pleasantly surprised to see that I'd actually had two cogs to spare. I did rely on that easiest gear on a road ride with longer climbs, some with steep switchbacks. If I'd had more cogs, would I have used them? Probably. Did I enjoy the climb without them? Absolutely.
	I think this system would work beautifully for casual or newer cyclists. It might encourage people who never touch their gears because they're intimidated by them, to make better use of their bike's abilities. —Emily Furia"

13201,
13202,
13203,"Most races we do around here are criteriums, and for those it's all big ring. You'd think that a 1x system would be fine. But in racing, or race-like situations, 11-25 is as broad a range as I want in the back—one to two teeth per jump. When I'm on the edge I need to be in exactly the right gear; if not, I risk blowing up trying to push a gear that's slightly too hard.
	For our weekly crit, the 1x was totally fine—I had the gears I needed, and the spacing I needed between them. But that setup was impractical for training or for a hilly road race. I rode it on the lunch ride and suffered on our rolling terrain—52/26 isn't a great climbing gear. I also rode the Derby, and while the downhill ride there, 20-mile roll out, and the lung-busting sprint back were fine, riding home up past Bear Creek, I actually considered walking. —Brad Ford
	Having a 1x turned the Tarmac into a dedicated crit racer. You could try running a wide-range cassette, but when attempting to fine-tune, the jumps between gears mess with power, cadence, and your head, all at once. I settled on an 11-26 and a 52T ring. It was just enough to be competitive in bunch sprints and worked fine when in a group. Surprisingly, where it turned out to be good was driving across to a break, or taking a solo flyer. Having the gears just a little lower meant staying on top of them just a little longer.
	This did come at the loss of utility. On easy days, I reached for a different bike—changing cassettes to get a range low enough for spinning is a pain. And no matter what bike I have a 1x on, I'm going to use a stout chain keeper. That cuts into weight savings, but better that than an untimely trip to the hospital. Any chance of the chain coming off in a sprint is more of a chance than I am willing to take. —Mike Yozell"
13204,"Should You Single Up? Sure—if you want a dedicated crit bike. Otherwise, you'll be happier with the combination of a wider range and smaller jumps allowed by a second chainring."

13207,"The Crest CB7 is only offered in 29-inch diameter, fitting into the line between Stan’s all-around Valor and ultra-light Podium SRD. Unlike the race-bred Podium RSD, the Crest CB7 rim is a bit more versatile; it is built with thicker walls, and can be laced to more hubs. It weighs the same as the Valor at 325 grams, and has the same 230-pound rider-weight limit, but it’s wider at 23mm (inner) making it ideal for 2.0 to 2.35-inch-wide tires."

This wheel is designed for trail riding and enduro racing with a 26mm inner width, making it suitable for tires ranging from 2.25 to 2.5-inches wide. It is offered in 27.5-inch diameter with a weight of 450 grams and in 29er at 450 grams—both have a rider weight limit of 250 pounds."

Both rims feature Stan’s patented bead socket for easier inflation with a more reliable seal. Low-profile sidewalls help to increase strength, reduce weight, and create and more full tire shape. Both Crest and Arch CB7 rims are available in either 28 or 23 spoke drillings with a retail price of $600. Complete pre-built wheels cost $1,399 and are built with Stan’s own Neo hubs that feature a six-pawl freehub that engages every 10 degrees."
13213,
13214,
13215,"The wheels can be built with Shimano or SRAM DX freehubs and six-bolt or centerlock brake mounts. The wheels come with 28 butted J-bend Sapim spokes, and Secure Lock alloy nipples.

"
13322,"Juliana traveled from its home base in Santa Cruz, California, to the Sierra Mountains a few hours east to showcase updated versions of its popular Roubion and Furtado mountain bikes. The models have changes in the frame geometry and suspension that make them more maneuverable, easier to climb, and more fun to ride—at least that’s what officials from the company told me before my first ride aboard the new bikes."
13323,"A note on Juliana bikes: The Roubion and Furtado use the same frames as models from Santa Cruz, Juliana’s parent company. The reason? “We build bikes for women who ride hard,” says brand manager Katie Zaffke. To Juliana, that means using Santa Cruz’s geometry, rather than building a bike to a theoretical woman’s measurements. The only differences between the two are the touch points, paint schemes, and the addition of a new extra-small size Furtado."
13324,"For 2016, the Juliana Roubion and Santa Cruz Bronson get one-degree slacker head tube angles (now 66 degrees), shorter chainstays, and longer top tubes. That particular adjustment is designed to let riders run a shorter stem, resulting in quicker handling. The seat tube angles are also steepened by one degree, which places the rider more directly above the bottom bracket for better climbing traction."
13325,"The Furtado and 5010 get 67-degree head angles, a degree slacker than the current models. The bikes also have the same longer top tube/shorter-stem geometry used on the new Juliana. The companies claim that these improvements make the 5010 and Furtado easier to climb, which I was excited about—when I tested the 2015 version, my only wish was that it handled better when pedaling uphill."
13326,"All of the bikes get new hardware on the VPP rear suspension: a top-tube mounted, box-section upper link that Juliana officials said is stiffer and has better bearing life. Designers also moved the lower link higher so it sits more inline with the BB. This reduces the risk of rock strikes, and makes it possible for the bikes to accommodate shorter chain stays."
13327,"When Gloria Liu, Bicycling’s gear editor, reviewed the current version of the Roubion, she wrote that she wished the bike had more supple suspension. She should be more pleased with the 2016 version—Juliana revised the shock rate to make the suspension more responsive to crunchy trails and small hits."
13328,Small cyclists can get excited about the XS Furtado and its ability to (we were told) even fit a water bottle inside the front triangle. That frame size is in the works now and will be available in spring 2016.

13331,"We took to the trails of Downieville, California, a former Gold Rush boomtown now home to 300 residents and the Downieville Downhill, a popular all-mountain race. A 40-minute shuttle ride put us in a high-mountain saddle with 20 miles of singletrack leading back toward town. The trails included tight bermed turns, rooty sections, chunky rock, and zoomy-fast straightaways—the ideal terrain to test the new bikes."
13332,
13333,
13334,"First Ride: Juliana Roubion
	The descent from Butcher Ranch revealed a lot about the redesigned Roubion. It has a graceful, smooth quality that allows it to handle rough trail with precision. The shorter chain stays made it easy to maneuver around techy corners and swoopy berms and accelerate quickly away—when I stepped on the gas, the Roubion sprung ahead faster than I expected for a bike with 150mm of travel."
13335,"The plush suspension smoothly soaked up small and large hits. I felt in control on everything from chattery fire roads, to chutes filled with babyhead rocks, to ass-over-the-rear-wheel boulder drops."
13336,"Considering how well the Roubion descended, I was pleased with the way it felt on the half-mile climb midway down the mountain. I set the Fox fork and rear suspension to their stiffest settings and experienced little bob, whether I was sitting or standing. However, the front wheel seemed very far in front of me and had the tendency to wander as I was climbing. To be fair, I was pretty gassed at that point, and my skills were not at their peak."
13337,"The bike was also poppier than I expected it would be, and it was easy to lift and hop over obstacles. As for the color? It’s somewhere between gray and lavender, and not overly feminine, which I really liked. It’s also a color I’ve never seen on a bike before—a major plus for me."

	We took the Furtado out for a spin on the mellower Mills Creek singletrack in Downieville. This trail started loose and shaley, then rolled into soft, piney dust as it twisted and turned down the mountain."
13342,"The Furtado feels like the Roubion’s fun younger cousin—the two bikes have different personalities, but their similar suspension and frame design means you can tell they come from the same family tree. Compared to the Roubion, the 130mm-travel Furtado is lighter and more nimble. It has some of the plushness of the Roubion, but with a more lively feel that makes rock gardens fun. This new version’s slightly slacker head angle makes it feel more capable on chundery descents. But it’s no sofa. While the Roubion can plow through rocks without losing any speed, the Furtado transmits more feedback to the rider—several rock gardens tossed me off my line."
13343,"On both the Furtado and the Roubion, the steeper seat angle made it feel like I was sitting right above the bottom bracket, especially on climbs—like I was pushing up the climb, rather than simply sitting back in the saddle. Overall, the bike felt like it ascended better than the model I tested last year, but I’m not ready to attribute that entirely to the new geometry. The model I tested earlier this summer was less expensive (so, heavier) than this one—a definite factor in climbing performance. Also, I only tried the newer model on a long fire road climb that wasn’t terribly steep or techy. The real test will come when I get this bike on my rooty and rocky home trails. However, the initial ride in Downieville makes me optimistic that this new model will improve some of the slight slowness I felt on climbs with the older model."
13344,"This year’s color is a shade lighter than what was used on last year’s Roubion. If the large proportion of teal helmets, shorts, and jerseys on our ride were any indication, the color is growing in popularity right now."
13345,"Pricing for the Furtado starts at $3599, with options up to $8699."

	The text message I sent gear editor Gloria Liu while I was in Downieville should give you some idea of how I felt about both bikes: “What happens if I really don’t have much negative to say?” I wrote. Santa Cruz and Juliana did a spectacular job of choosing trails to show off the bikes’ best attributes, and I think the new geometry improved the bikes’ performance in substantial ways. I’m looking forward to testing these bikes on different types of trails to really find the strengths and weaknesses of each model. Stay tuned for upcoming reviews of the bikes."

Trek has steadily brought the the lineup down in price, and with two new men’s and women’s models, cracks the $1,000 barrier for a versatile bike that works for light touring, all-surface road riding, and commuting in any weather."
13351,"The Domane AL 2 and AL 3 are available as men’s and women’s models, and feature the same IsoSpeed carbon fork as the higher-end aluminum ALR models. But a simpler aluminum frame without the seat tube decoupler shaves hundreds off the price between models of similar spec."
13352,
13353,
13354,"Men’s and women’s models have the same geometry in identical sizes. What’s different are the touch points like saddle, stem, handlebars, and cranksets. Other differences include paint, and a size run that for women goes from 44-56cm and from 47-62cm in the men’s version. Given that, you can probably think of the “men’s” model as unisex (a Trek dealer will likely swap seats or handlebars for you if, for example, you’re a tall woman who needs a 58cm frame). And the attractive paint jobs are in hues that don’t scream “I’m a women’s bike” if you’re a particularly short guy."
13355,
13356,
13357,"Under $1,000, you don’t get the full Domane experience. These bikes feature a pretty straightforward aluminum frame with a carbon fiber fork. You don’t get the rear decoupler from the ALR or carbon models or the front decoupler found on the more expensive Domane SL or Silque SLR women’s models in carbon fiber (but those models start at $3,500)."
13358,"You do get the Domane geometry, the carbon fiber fork with extra compliance, clearance for 28mm tires, and integrated rack and fender mounts. The Bontrager Elite stem features Blendr mounts to easily attach accessories like lights and computers, and the chainstay has a slot for Bontrager’s DuoTrap integrated wireless speed and cadence sensor."
13359,The Domane AL3 and AL3 Women’s use Shimano’s 9-speed Sora drivetrains; the AL2 and AL2 Women’s come with Shimano Claris drivetrains. Both use Bontrager tubeless-ready rims. The AL3 is $930. Pricing on the AL2 was not immediately available but should be slightly less. The bikes are available now through Trek and dealers.

13361,It was only a matter of time until Cannondale threw its hat into the fat bike ring. The company just unveiled its inaugural offering in the big-wheel category: the Fat CAAD.
13362,"The Fat CAAD's standout feature is its fat bike-specific Lefty Olaf fork, but there are some other clever details that make it intriguing. Cannondale plays with the fork offset for snappy steering, and offsets the chainrings for what it claims is the lowest Q factor in the fat bike realm."
13363,    RELATED: 
13364,"There are two Fat CAAD models: the 1 ($3,730) and 2 ($2,130). Both utilize the same CAAD (Cannondale Advanced Aluminum Design) SmartFormed frame with Stealth dropper post routing and 120mm-wide BB30XL bottom bracket. The chainstay length is tight at 456mm with clearance for 4.8-inch-wide tires. The Fat CAAD 2 comes with a 2x drivetrain and rigid aluminum fork, while the 1 model has a 1x drivetrain and Lefty Olaf fork."
13365,
13366,
13367,"Anyone who has pedaled a fat bike knows the wide Q factor can make you feel like a bowlegged cowboy, because the crank arms are wide-set to allow for big tires. According to Cannondale, the Fat CAAD’s Q factor is up to 2.5 centimeters narrower than other 4.8-inch-compatible fat bikes, thanks to a custom offset chainring setup that moves the chain out towards the crank arm. This gives the Si crank-equipped bikes a 198mm Q factor on the 1x version, and 204mm on the 2x model."
13368,    RELATED: Who's Buying All the Fat Bikes?
13369,"Cannondale’s forks are arguably the Fat CAAD’s standout feature. The fat bike-specific Lefty Olaf utilizes the oversized Lefty Max legs but has custom offset clamps to make room for the fat tire. Wheel travel is set at 100mm on the air sprung fork, which utilizes the same PBR damper with new Enduro+ tune as its other models. Fat bikes are not known for having razor-sharp steering, so Cannondale increased the Lefty’s offset to 60mm for reduced trail. This should offer a lighter feel at the handlebar and faster steering. The Fat CAAD 2’s rigid aluminum fork has an offset set at 55mm."

13379,"However, 2016 is a new year for the company, and Meredith claims that after copious testing, the improvements made on the still-classic-looking pedal give it a extend its lifespan by 75 percent. Across the board, the pedals have gotten an internal makeover, in particular thanks to self-lubricating Igus LL-glide bearings that replace the old bearings. “They’re custom-made for us,” Meredith explains. Another addition is a double-seal system that will keep grit out of pedals for an extended lifetime of hard use. “Our outside bearing is an enduro model specially made for us,” he adds. “Everything is in the same spot, we’ve just made improvements.” These improvements will, of course, carry through the entire line."

	New for the Candy pedals—essentially Eggbeaters with a small platform around the clip—are some structural tweaks that allow for better clearance, both to lessen frequent rock smacking and to avoid clip-in issues. The Candy 7 and 11 are “trail” versions of the standard Candy, Meredith explains. The body shape has been refined with smoother sides in order to avoid hitting rocks. A new integrated traction pad on the top of the pedals also increases rider comfort, and with 1mm and 2mm options, riders can choose what works best for them. Lastly, the pedal is significantly easier to pull apart to rebuild, thanks to a switch to a 6mm hex key opener versus the old screwdriver slot."

	The Mallet was originally designed as Crank Brothers’ answer to the rise of enduro racing: The large platform allowed for downhill-style standing and platform, while an Eggbeater pedal in the middle provided a clip-in for when you’re riding up the hill between segments. The 2016 line features the Eggbeater upgrades in all models, as well as a weight reduction of 50 grams in the Mallet E compared to the Mallet DH. Additionally, it’s designed to be lower-profile, and features the same refined body shape and traction pads as the Candy."

Of course, you don’t have to listen to the company: Ride what feels right, Meredith says. “If you happen to like a bigger pedal or you’re riding a fat bike in the snow, size up,” he says. He also notes that there’s an unintentional bottle opener capability on the Stamp, so consider that an added bonus.

13391,"Making the switch from mechanical shifting? These facts will help ease the transition.
"
13392,"Now that SRAM has introduced Red eTap, all three major component companies make electronic drivetrains. A fourth, FSA, is not far behind with its as-yet unnamed prototype group. All of that begs the question: Should you make the shift? (Sorry.) If you’re intrigued by electronic shifting, here’s what to know in advance."
13393,"Yes, you can upgrade your bike.
	A switch from mechanical to electronic can involve as little as swapping four parts, says Shimano spokesman Nick Legan: the shifters and derailleurs (and adding the wiring harness and battery). But that’s only for current 11-speed drivetrains. Electronic shifting is controlled by firmware, but no company has released a firmware version that allows for adjusting the number of drivetrain speeds. A year ago, Shimano even killed an older version of firmware that allowed users to pair 10-speed and 11-speed electronic parts as long as they were all compatible with the newer E-Tube wiring. So if your bike has older 10-speed stuff on it, you’ll need to also upgrade the crankset, cassette, and chain. (Yes, you can get by for a time with 10-speed chainrings, but the tolerances from a 10-speed ring to an 11-speed chain are so tight that it’s not recommended.) Go back to 9-speed on Shimano and you’ll also want new brake calipers, as the lever throw changed to a different cable pull ratio. For SRAM, similar rules apply. Neither company officially says you can mix parts but we’ll say it here: Unless you’re super finicky, a Shimano chain on a SRAM cassette or vice versa works fine. It’s just a little noisier."
13394,     Related: Why We've Been Excited for SRAM's Wireless Group
13395,"Electronic doesn’t always play well with older frames.
	If your bike has external cable routing, you’ll have to zip-tie the wiring to the frame. It’s entirely doable technically, but the aesthetics aren’t great. As well, Shimano’s new Di2 drivetrains are based around cigar-style internal batteries, which won’t fit on all frames. Most frames made since 2012 have internal routing with cable stops that can be swapped for mechanical or electronic cables. You may have to buy new stops through a dealer. SRAM’s wireless eTap provides a great retrofit option to older frames, both because you don’t have to deal with a wiring harness and because the batteries are mounted to the derailleurs. “You install the derailleurs and shifters, pair them, and you’re good to go,” says SRAM road product manager Brad Menna."
13396,"It may be better to just buy a new bike
	If your bike is, ahem, of a certain age (say, pre-2005), then it may be better to look at a whole new bike, says Chad Nordwall, owner of Bay Area shop Above Category Cycling. It’s difficult to retrofit electronic shifting to some frames (see above) and if you’re already looking at spending $2,000 on a new groupset, “then from a cost-effectiveness standpoint, you should probably just get a new bike,” Nordwall says, and benefit from innovations like oversize steerer tubes and lighter, stiffer carbon fiber frames. Di2-equipped bikes start around $5,500—no one’s idea of a bargain—but if you’re set on switching, it may be the smarter choice."
13397,"If you go the new bike route, consider whether you want to run disc or rim brakes. Right now, eTap is only compatible with mechanical brakes (BB7 or BB5 road discs work). Menna would not divulge any plans for future hydraulic versions of eTap, but it’s such a valuable market that hydraulic-brake versions are almost certainly coming within the next year. If you’re in the market for a hydraulic disc bike this year and want electronic, it’s Shimano’s game."
13398,RELATED: SRAM Red eTap is a Step Forward for Electronic Shifting
13399,"No, the battery won’t go dead.
	Shimano makes no outright claims on battery life, says Legan, citing the broad range of terrain and conditions riders encounter. But, he adds, even pro riders don’t charge the batteries on their training bikes more than 5-6 times a season. Quarterly is probably enough for most riders. Far more common: A dead battery results because they last so long you forgot to charge it. (Tip: Set up a regular calendar reminder for, say, Friday evenings at the end of the month.) And don’t worry about outlasting the unit’s charge cycle life. Above Category has sold Shimano Di2 and Campagnolo EPS groups since they first came out, and Nordwall says he’s never seen a rider come back with a battery that’s totally dead. SRAM, the newest entrant, says its batteries last at least 15 hours—and up to 60—on a full charge. LED indicators warn of low power, but even when it turns red to indicate a depleted battery, Menna says, you’ll have at least five hours of ride time before it goes dead. Plus, the front and rear derailleur batteries are interchangeable. If one does go dead mid-ride, “you can swap the live battery to the front derailleur, put it in the proper chainring and then put it back on the rear for shifting in back until you get home,” Menna says."
13400,"But you will need a charger.
	Make sure what you’re buying—bike or group—comes with a charger. Shimano’s new internal battery system uses an E-Tube charger box that connects to any USB adaptor. Campagnolo uses an external charger setup. SRAM’s eTap also uses an external charger. With separate, smaller batteries for each derailleur, SRAM says a full charge takes just 45 minutes per unit—but there’s only room for one battery at a time, so make sure to leave enough time to power up both. You can add an additional charging cradle to the system if you want to charge both batteries at once."
13401,"It won’t go out of adjustment.
	Di2 initial installation and setup are best handled by shops, says Legan, a former pro team mechanic for CSC and RadioShack. But once it’s done, an electronic drivetrain should shift exactly the same every time. “There’s no cable stretch, and the motor shifts the chain at the same speed, the same distance, every time,” he says. Indeed, that kind of bulletproof reliability is one of the biggest selling points for electronic shifting. If your shifting’s not working, the culprit is likely a dead battery or a loose wire—check all connections. Shimano does make a (PC-only) software tool for customization like reversing the shift button function or adjusting shift speed, but unless you’re a constant tinkerer, it’s probably easier just to take it to a shop. SRAM says a decent home mechanic can set up eTap. Since there’s no wiring harness except from the shifters to the stem-mounted CPU, Menna points out that once the derailleurs are bolted on and paired, setup is mostly a matter of adjusting limit screws and the B-tension screw on the rear derailleur. SRAM does not have plans to offer firmware customization."
13402,"Take care with tools.
	Be mindful with any sharp tools, which could damage electrical wiring. And take care even with mundane tasks like re-wrapping the handlebar tape. “If the E-Tube wiring is under tension along the handlebar, when the tape compresses it, it can pull on the harness just enough to pop the E-Tube connector out,” says Legan. Leave just a bit of slack under the bars and double-check the harness connections to make sure they’re snug. Also: Never pull on the wires themselves. With SRAM, you won’t have to worry about spare wires, but if you’re using additional remote “Blips” shifters, take care when cutting handlebar tape so you don’t nick the wires from the Blips to the shift lever connection. Be doubly careful with Campagnolo; Shimano’s E-Tube connections mean a sliced wire is easily replaceable for about $25, but Campagnolo’s EPS “brain” is all hard-wired. An errant slip could mean a new $200 wiring harness."
13403,"Don’t ignore maintenance.
	Precisely because electronic shifting is so good, Nordwall says, people are neglecting their bikes more. “Before, people had this kind of imposed maintenance alarm where their shifting would start to get bad and they’d bring their bike in,” he says. “Electronic is so good that by the time people bring in a bike it’s toast—the cassette is worn out, the chainrings are effed, and the jockey wheels are full of crud.” The problem is that stuff’s expensive—a Dura-Ace 9000 outer ring is $240. Regular cleaning, and swapping chains before they get too stretched and prematurely wear cassette and chainring teeth, can prolong the life of any drivetrain. Just because your shifting works fine doesn’t mean your bike doesn’t need a little TLC."

The fabric is on the stretchy side, and quite thin—they’re a great pair for hot days. Plus, they’re sold in numbered sizes for the best fit (I found them to be true to my jeans size). They’re available in two colors.

Two small pockets in the rear can hold very small items like a bar or a phone, and display a nice pop of color contrasting inside the pocket. The knit fabric is medium-weight, but it wicks and dries respectably quickly, making this jersey suitable for warmer days, though probably not my first pick for the very hottest days.

The Power Trail Lady Jersey Long is a welcome deviation from this, combining a loose, slightly billowy cut with longer, stretchy cuffs and a wide stretchy waistband for a fashionable look that’s more “summer blouse” than “tech t.” The fabric is very lightweight and cool to the touch, so I typically paired it with a long-sleeve base layer for chillier days (below the mid-50s), or with a sleeveless base layer for shoulder season (fall and spring) rides between the mid-50s to low-60s. The stretchy cuffs and waistband are super soft and comfortable, and still fit well over a baselayer. This 3-season jersey has stood up very well to many machine washes and—despite the care instructions—tumble dries, and still looks (and smells) good as new several months later, with no pilling or weak spots.

The fabric has a pretty minimal amount of stretch, which makes them feel tough, but it’s still light and soft enough to be comfortable and breathable. An elastic and button system in the waistband allows riders to cinch it tighter if needed. Two pockets on the front hips hold your stuff when you’re not on the bike, while a mesh-lined front thigh pocket and another on the back left keep small items secure while you ride. Two offset snaps close the waistband. I appreciated the cut of the shorts, which are scooped up on the back of the leg to allow for better mobility.

13441,"Wild Rye is a new brand out of California that’s dedicated to making beautiful athletic apparel for women. I love the way the Kiah tee feels against my skin—it’s a merino-nylon blend that somehow manages to feel like one of my favorite linen tees. It drapes nicely too, and despite the light color manages to be not-too-see-through—it’s possible to wear a patterned bra without it being super obvious.  The fabric is thicker than some other athletic fabrics though, so on super-hot days it might be best to choose something else. And the sleeves are quite short—they’re cute, but not the best for pairing with elbow pads. 
	 
	My favorite part of the outfit is the Chammy. These undershorts have a super-high waistband, which I absolutely loved. The fabric is super silky feeling, and I didn’t notice the chamois at all while riding—to me, that’s the mark of a good one. I found myself reaching for these liners over similar ones from other brands; the waistband really set them apart in comfort for me. 
	 
	The shorts are made of a fabric that’s light and super stretchy. That stretchiness does cause them to slide down a bit when you’re moving around lots, but there are belt loops to help with the issue.

The result, in this case, is an uber-comfortable cool-weather riding jersey that actually stays dry, even at the slow speeds and high exertion levels encountered on my techy home trails. I’ve worn other jerseys made of merino blends, but always ended up a soggy, sweaty mess. The Andorra drirelease Merino ¾ jersey has, in terms of wicking and breathability, performed the best of any merino-blend jersey I’ve tried. It’s also outperformed other merino blends by avoiding pilling after washing. And it feels soft enough to the touch that I was surprised to learn that the merino content was only 11 percent (the rest: 84 percent polyester, 5 percent spandex). Other perks: a zippered side pocket, a casual look, and a feminine cut that’s also long enough to provide coverage in the riding position.

The 12-inch inseam falls right above the knee, so you can wear pads without leaving an awkward gap, and two small notches in the back of the shorts provide a little extra give to fit pads, too. There are two hand pockets that are deep enough to hold a phone securely, and a zippered pocket for stuff like credits cards or cash. An integrated belt makes it easy to adjust the waist band, and the metal hook-style buckle is easy to fasten and adds a nice accent as well. The nylon outer shell is lightweight enough to make this a good summer short, and has a nice-feeling silky finish, while a mesh lining helps the shorts to breathe and wick well, and sit over liner shorts without clinging.

While this does make the Desperado hold a bit more moisture than fabrics with lower wool content—I had some sweat stains under and around where my pack sits by the end of an hour and a half ide—it’s still a very lightweight and superbly breathable jersey. That high level of breathability and ¾ length sleeve makes it appropriate for a wide range of temperatures: it’s comfortable on its own into the low 70s, or can provides warmth for cooler temperatures when worn with a base layer underneath. The material is also nice and soft. The snap neck closure is low profile and means there are no metal bits to rub against skin like a zipper, and it gives this jersey a streetworthy casual look. A neutral (meaning the back is only very slightly longer than the front) but generally longer cut provides full coverage when you’re in the riding position, but doesn’t look weird when you’re off the bike either.

A companion app—available for iOS and Android—is used to customize the ELEMNT's display and features, which should be much easier than navigating a maze of an unfamiliar operating system’s sub-menus."
13472,"The unit has a 2.7-inch (diagonal) screen, weighs 100 grams, and has four gigabytes of internal memory. The battery is rechargeable through the unit’s USB connection; Wahoo claims 17 hours of battery life. It will connect to both Bluetooth and ANT+ sensors, including power meters."

13482,"The new fit system helps riders choose a saddle with less guesswork
"
13483,"When a saddle works, you forget it’s even there. But when a saddle doesn’t work, your whole bike feels wrong—and chances are you won’t keep making time for another ride. But without test-riding a library full of bike saddles, how do you diagnose the problem?"
13484,"Liv introduced a new fitting tool at Outdoor Demo this week called the Dynamic Cycling Fit system. It's meant to determine the shape of a woman’s pelvis and calculate whether she would be more comfortable on the company’s Contact Forward or Contact Upright saddle. Didn’t realize your pelvis was such an integral part of the saddle comfort equation? While most of us probably cast blame on awkward sit bones for our discomfort, Liv says the shape and angle of a rider’s pelvis while in motion on the bike is a huge function of how we make contact with a saddle."
13485,The Contact Forward saddle is designed for when the pelvic bone is rotating forward and pressure is building up toward the center of the saddle. The saddle handles this particular pelvic style with a long groove down the center from front to back. Fitting well on the Contact Upright saddle means pressure is focused more toward the rear of the saddle and spread into two primary areas of contact. This saddle has a shorter groove that only runs from the back to the middle of the saddle.
13486,"The “dynamic” part of Liv’s Dynamic Cycling Fit is what makes the fitting style unique, says Janette Sherman, Liv’s global communications manager. “That’s how we design all our gear,” she told me. “We want it to function best while sitting on a bike.”"
13487,A rider mounts a fit bike with a gel saddle and pedals for two minutes at 50-70 RPM to reveal her pelvic contact position. The pattern of revealed colors left by the rider’s impression on the saddle determines whether she needs the fully grooved Forward saddle or the half-grooved Upright saddle. It’s an easy-to-measure system that Liv will make available to bike retailers for 2016.
13488,     RELATED: Three Steps to Saddle Heaven
13489,"I gave the system a test ride at Liv’s booth at Outdoor Demo and was revealed to be the proud owner of an anomalous ass—or in other words, a pelvic contact position that fell somewhere between Forward and Upright. One by one the other women at BICYCLING tried the Dynamic Cycling Fit as well but were easily ushered into their appropriate saddle category (most fell into the fully-grooved Forward position) without any question. My bizarre color pattern revealed a touch of the blue Forward Position but a fair amount of pink and white as well. I was eventually issued an Upright saddle based on all the pink—which features the same partial groove of my favorite saddle at home and fits me almost identically."
13490,
13491,
13492,"Both the Contact Forward and the Contact Upright saddles feature Particle Flow technology, meaning the foam padding conforms around your pressure points. The saddles feature a synthetic leather cover with lightweight fill, weigh in at 315g, and retail for $35. Both the Contact Forward and Contact Upright saddles are also available in SL and SLR versions. The SL, the next step up, is composed of composite base material and lightweight tubular metallic rails, and retails for $110. The SLR has a microfiber cover and lightweight fill and uses carbon composite base material and carbon fiber rails, and retails for $225."
13493,"The component giant's new line includes shoes for all-mountain riding, road cycling, and cold weather
"
13494,"My first clipless cycling shoes were entry-level Shimano mountain bike shoes. They cost me no more than $100, yet stood up to an incredible amount of abuse for four years. So I guess I have a soft spot in my heart for Shimano shoes, even if they tend to be more conservative in terms of style—I think highly of their function and quality."
13495,"That’s why I was more than happy to see the company go big in this department for 2016, releasing 18 new models for road, mountain, and urban riding. Here are a few highlights from the Outdoor Demo at Interbike."
13496,"AM9: All-Mountain Shoe
	The new AM9 all-mountain shoe replaces Shimano’s AM45 downhill sneaker, adding SPD compatibility and a wider toebox for even more comfortable walking. The AM9 gets the TORBAL outsole that the company released last year in its enduro footwear line. TORBAL, standing for “torsional balance,” enables the back half of the sole to flex side-to-side independently from the front, so that the rider can move a bit on the pedals through tricky terrain, while still maintaining stiffness for pedaling efficiency in the front."
13497,
13498,
13499,"The AM9 also features a cut-out in the center of the sole (pictured above), which allows the shoe to better “hold on” to an SPD pedal in those instances when you can’t immediately clip in. Anyone who’s had to clip out and back in on some steeper and more technical terrain knows that sometimes, you end up having to ride some rough sections with your shoes balanced precariously on your pedals—and understands why this feature is awesome. The AM9 will be available in October or November for $140; a non-SPD compatible version called the AM7 will also be available for $130 with a sticky, textured Vibram outsole that was designed to integrate well with Shimano’s Saint flat pedal."
13500,
13501,
13502,"RP5: Road Shoe
	Shimano also released the RP road series, which gives performance-oriented riders a more affordable alternative to the company’s top-tier road race shoes. The RP series starts with the RP9 shoe ($275), which features a full carbon outsole and can be custom-fit to your foot using Shimano’s heat molding process, which is similar to the process used to fit ski boots."
13503,
13504,
13505,"One step down from the RP9 is the RP5 ($150). The RP5 features a carbon plate embedded in a reinforced nylon sole, instead of the full carbon sole in the RP9 (see the comparison in the photo above—the RP9 is on the left, the RP5 on the right). This adds carbon-fiber stiffness at the point of power transfer between shoe and pedal, while saving some cost where it’s less integral to pedaling efficiency. The RP5 upper is also a slightly heftier material, and the shoe doesn’t get Shimano’s CustomFit technology; it does, however, share the same double-Velcro strap with a plastic ratchet design as the RP9. The RP5 is compatible with both 3-bolt cleat patterns as well as two-bolt SPD cleats, making it a solid spin class shoe, too."
13506,
13507,
13508,"MW7: Winter Shoe
	The new MW7, an all-weather winter boot, has a waterproof, full Gore-Tex upper and the flexy TORBAL sole featured on the AM9. A lace shield (secured with Velcro) helps keep your feet dry and warm, as does the fleece lining. The MW7 has a quick-lacing system—simply pull the nylon lacing tight, similar to some snowboard boot designs—which ensures you’ll be in and out easily when it’s too cold for your hands to dilly-dally outside of your gloves, fiddling with laces or ratchets. A sticky rubber outsole improves grip on slippery terrain compared to Shimano’s previous winter boot. While the MW7 is not temperature rated, Shimano says the boot is intended to be worn on even the coldest—like sub-zero Fahrenheit—days."
13509,"A few changes add up to a vastly improved trail machine
"
13510,"When Santa Cruz first launched the Bronson in 2013, the bike was an immediate hit. As one of the first carbon full-suspension trail bikes with 27.5-inch wheels, it garnered plenty of buzz. It was so good that it even won one of our coveted Editor’s Choice awards. But few categories have seen such explosive growth and advancement, so over the past few years, the bike that once stood out of the crowd started to feel dated. Its geometry felt cramped in the cockpit and steep in the front end compared to others; the suspension action lacked small-bump performance, yet still wallowed a bit in the middle of its 150mm wheel travel. These issues left many riders wanting more."
13511,"After reading Taylor Rojek’s preview of the Juliana Roubion, one of thebest mountain bikes of 2015, the Bronson moved to the top of my list of bikes to ride at Interbike’s Outdoor Demo in Boulder City, Nevada. That’s because the Bronson and Roubion share the exact same frame."
13512,"I rode for an hour and a half over terrain including a little bit of everything the Nevada desert has to offer, and can say that the redesigned Bronson is a vastly improved bike and—once again—a lust-worthy ride. Its new geometry is really noticeable, with way more weight bias on the rear wheel. This is due to the combination of shorter 432mm-long chainstays, a 20 to 25mm-longer top tube, and a one degree-slacker head tube angle (now 66 degrees). The new stance naturally makes steep roll-ins easier, but it also makes diving hard into corners more natural-feeling. It really likes to aggressively lean into the turn and rocket out, driving hard off the rear tire. You’d think that this new stance might climb poorly, but Santa Cruz steepened the seat angle to 74 degrees; that not only put me in a more powerful climbing position on the steeps, but it also effectively put more weight over the front end while seated."
13513,"As good as the geometry is, the updates to the rear suspension are just as impressive. A combination of reworked VPP linkage layout and a new Fox Float X shock with EVOL air can makes for a suspension that’s initially supple, supportive through the middle, with a nice ramp at the end. Gone is that small hack feedback and mid-stroke wallow. Pedaling performance is slightly improved, too, with a bit more reactivity while pedaling that helps the tire find traction. And as before, there’s no need to flip the shock’s lever to make it pedal well—the Bronson has a lot of built-in antisquat for great pedaling with the shock in its wide-open mode."
13514,    RELATED: 2015 Mountain Bikes Editors' Choice Winners
13515,"Other updates include a shorter seat tube, thanks to an upper link mount located under the top tube. The shorter seat tube allows riders to use longer-travel dropper posts and reduces standover height. Its lower linkage is tucked in behind the bottom bracket, helping to reduce its vulnerability and shorten the chain stays. Plus, it just looks cleaner. Another update is the addition of a wider Boost-width rear hub. This not only moves the chainring out 3mm, allowing Santa Cruz to tuck the rear wheel in and shorten the stays, but it offers wider flange width for improved spoke triangulation and a stronger, stiffer rear wheel."
13516,"Santa Cruz has the new Bronson in stock now, with complete builds ranging in price from $3,599 to 8,699."

13555,"New heads-up displays pack a computer and camera into a pair of shades
"
13556,"When we reviewed Recon Instruments’ Jet sunglasses with heads-up display (HUD) recently, we said it was one of the most intriguing examples of wearable technology we’d seen for cyclists. Now, Recon’s got company."
13557,"There are two new players in the HUD-enabled sports wearables market. Everysight offers a set of shades with comparable features to the Recon Jet, but with a slightly different design and user interface, plus some significant technological assets. A third company, Kopin, debuted another system at Interbike called Solos under a brand of the same name."
13558,"I got a chance to ride briefly with a late prototype version of the Everysight system last week around Boulder. Although the pair I used had some minor bugs (like dropping the connection to my HRM strap), I still came away impressed with the functionality and quality."
13559,"The glasses themselves look like a chunky pair of full-wrap shades. Unlike the Jet, all of the hardware is packed into the main frame; there’s no projection arm protruding from one side (the Solos use a similar projection arm system to the Jet). That makes them a bit stealthier to wear. Although the bulky arms and top frame make the glasses stick out from your face, they blend in underneath a helmet and many riders may not immediately notice that you’re not wearing a standard pair of sunglasses."
13560,     RELATED: How to Choose The Right Sunglasses Lenses for Cycling
13561,"The heads-up display is fascinating. The green display is crisp and clear. It sits more or less in the center of your field of vision, although you can adjust position to some extent. The navigation is intuitive, with forward swipes on the touch-sensitive temple toggling through different screens."
13562,"Riding uphill, I swiped forward to a climb screen, which displayed information like hill gradient. At the summit, a quick tap brought up a map that showed me my position on the descent, including upcoming switchbacks. That allowed me to essentially “see” farther down the road than I could unaided."
13563,"When I tested the Everysight system, I had no eyestrain, and the lens optics themselves were clear and distortion-free, although the tight-fitting temple pieces on the prototype version I wore created some unpleasant pressure."
13564,
13565,
13566,"Was all this information distracting? Less than I had feared. The HUD focus is set to, more or less, infinite distance, so unless you’re looking at something very close to you, switching your view from the road to the HUD display is effortless and almost instantaneous; I never had a problem looking “past it” to see my surroundings, and it’s actually easier to use than looking down at a computer display. There’s also a mode that drops the HUD out of view entirely."
13567,"The sophistication of the Everysight system is not surprising; the technology comes from parent corporation Elbit Systems, a defense contractor that designs HUD systems for many Western military aircraft. There are significant challenges in miniaturizing the technology, but the Everysight system itself is elegant and refined. For its part, Recon was recently acquired by Intel , and Solos’ parent company Kopin is a publicly traded company which, like Elbit, makes wearable computing technology for the military and industrial purposes. The original Recon snowsports goggle, the Oakley Airwave, used Kopin’s HUD technology, but the company quietly divested its stake in Recon in June when Intel acquired the company."
13568,"I wasn’t able to try out the Solos system at Interbike, but I did put on a pair of the glasses, which are lighter than the Everysight prototype system I tested. There’s one notable difference in design: The Solos system’s navigation is voice-activated and doesn’t involve swiping a touch-sensitive bar on the temple. “We felt it was necessary to be able to use it and keep your hands on the handlebars,” said Ernesto Martinez-Villalpando, Solos’ program director. Other than that, most of the features are similar to what Recon and Everysight offer."
13569,     RELATED: Everything We Love from Interbike 2015
13570,"What’s most interesting for cyclists is what a HUD system makes possible: everything from the ability to instantly snap a photo (and share it on social media) without even breaking your pedal stroke, to pacing a live Strava segment “race” against your PR or a KOM/QOM."
13571,"The systems will be expensive (Recon just lowered the price on its Jet system to $500), but HUD sunglasses are essentially three products in one: sunglasses, a high-definition still and video camera, and a GPS computer that can pair to other wireless devices like your phone or power meter. That means you wouldn’t need a head unit or a GoPro, two expensive pieces of riding gear found on many handlebars these days."
13572,"Everysight opted not to disclose significant details at this time, including price and on-sale dates, which should be announced later this year. Solos hopes to begin sales in spring of 2016, and the Recon Jet, of course, is available now. It remains to be seen whether HUD systems gain significant traction beyond a very tech-centered subset of cyclists. But after years of promises, the technology is finally here."

13685,"Discovering Wahoo’s KICKR and virtual-riding program Zwift changed that. Zwift provided motivation, and challenges; the KICKR made the Zwift experience engaging and entertaining by automatically varying the resistance to match the route; and the built-in power meter provided feedback on my efforts and helped me track my fitness."
13686,     Ride your way to fitness with the Bicycling Big Book of Training!
13687,"But even without Zwift, the KICKR is an impressive unit. I also used it with Trainer Road, and Wahoo’s apps. It’s smooth and consistent, and it offers very precise control over resistance, allowing the rider several ways to set a resistance target, including a watt target."
13688,
13689,"It has decent “road feel” (scare quotes because no indoor experience is remotely close to riding outside) thanks to the 14-pound flywheel, and the direct-drive format is much more robust and predictable than wheel-on trainers. (It doesn’t beat up your tire and hub bearings, either.) The base is solid enough for sprint intervals, and it accommodates several wheel sizes and axle styles."
13690,"So instead of sitting on my couch last winter, I rode the KICKR for hours and hours, stayed sane, and came out of the winter fitter than ever. That's not saying much, but I noticed a difference when the snow melted."

13692,"With trainer season fast approaching, Wahoo has introduced a new version of the KICKR that amplifies its strengths and nullifies past weaknesses."
13693,"What’s New:
	•Fourteen-percent quieter
	• More resistance: 2,000 watts maximum resistance, up from 1,500 watts
	• Simulates up to 20-percent grade, up from 15-percent
	• Status indicator lights
	• “New and improved algorithms regulating the electromagnetic brake operation drastically improve responsiveness, especially with third-party platforms such as Zwift,” claims a Wahoo representative.
	• The best improvement might be the new carrying handle. It has been relocated to the top of the unit, and is now parallel to the ground (the old handle was low, and at an angle on the back of the flywheel support). The new handle makes picking up, moving, and repositioning the KICKR much less awkward, and a bit easier too."

13708,"Finding shorts that fit properly, look flattering, and feel comfortable can be one of the hardest parts of getting your kit ride-ready. But thanks to companies like Shebeest, which focuses specifically on women’s garments, the hunt is getting easier. The company’s spring 2016 collection introduces some improvements to a halter-style bib short that could not only meet the above criteria, but also offer a bonus function."
13709,"Bib shorts in general tend to be more comfortable for women than traditional shorts, since the suspender-style straps mean less pinching at the waist—and, if we’re being shallow, a more flattering line (read: no muffin-top issues). ""Women are realizing the benefits men have known for years: There’s no waistband, so if you race cyclocross, your midriff isn't revealed when portaging your bike,” says Patricia Nilsen, Shebeest's senior product director consultant. “Seven years ago when I started the ten20 bike team in Boulder, only three women ordered bibs. Today, 30 percent of our order is for bibs.”"
13710,"But for all the issues bib shorts solve, they create a tricky one: the need to unzip and remove your jersey when you hit the restroom mid-ride. Halter-style bib shorts like this one from Shebeest present solutions to this impolite inconvenience."
13711,"The benefit of the halter top is that you can pull it up, slide it over your head, and pull it out through your jersey; pee; then thread it back up when you’re done. ""Halter bibs solve the problem of not revealing your entire world when having to pee. Unzip and slip over your head and down!” Nilson adds."
13712,"The Shebeest bibs are different in that the halter portion is an extremely open mesh construction. The open-cell mesh doesn’t just keep you cool; Nilson says Shebeest is pushing the fashion angle, and mesh is currently en vogue. ""We elected to use a big-hole, Madonna-like mesh with minimal coverage so you don't overheat,” Nilson explains. The placement of the mesh was also intentional. ""The first run didn't have enough support, so I wore them backwards and decided to anchor the two-way stretch mesh from the spine, up under your arms, away from your ‘girls' and behind your neck,” Nilson says. After six months of gear testers trying them out, results have been positive."
13713,
13714,
13715,"The short itself is also a new compression fabric. While it’s only a two-panel short (with a large phone-sized back pocket), the compression keeps it in place and comfortably adjusted while you ride."
13716,"The bibs come in several patterns, from a houndstooth to a more sedate colorways. On two pink-based patterns, the mesh will come in a matching hot pink shade."
13717,"The bibs will be available this spring, and will retail for $110—a competitive price for women’s bib shorts (for Bicycling's own branded bib shorts, visit our new online store stocked with staff-approved products). Shebeest has also released its bra tops in new patterns and colors, and has started to blend together patterns in similar colors on shorts and jerseys for a funkier style."

13751,
13752,
13753,"In essence, metric shocks are an overhaul of the established ratios of stroke length to eye-to-eye length, that, for a given stroke, result in a longer eye-to-eye (when comparing standard eyelet mounts)."
13754,"The benefits are more bushing overlap (claimed to improve stiffness, smoothness, and durability); more room for new damping and spring technologies; and the ability to design different mounting systems (which can scrape back some of the shock length increase) . The bad: heavier shocks (because they’re longer overall), and metric shocks can’t be plugged into frames that weren’t designed for them."

13765,"Riding The New SB5
	I received an SB5 TURQ XT a few weeks ago, and have ridden it a number of times. I’ve had an SB5c (now the “old” bike) ever since it was introduced 2014, and, because it’s my favorite mountain bike, I ride it regularly. So I have a very good basis to compare and judge the new model."
13766,
13767,
13768,"Overall, it’s a conservative update. The new bike feels a lot like the old bike, and everything I liked about it—and everything that helped it win two Editors’ Choice awards—is still present. It climbs marvelously; it punches above its weight on downhills; it’s light, playful, and snappy; it’s stable without being too stable; it’s as confidence-inspiring as it is capable and fun."
13769,
13770,
13771,"Honestly, I noticed two details more than any other: improved standover—which is a good thing in almost any situation—and a more dialed shock tune. The shock tune improved both big hit control—drop landings and g-outs—and kept the chassis more stable through successive mid-size hits. It’s maybe not quite as “plush,” but the bike is more hooked up, especially when riding fast and aggressively."
13772,
13773,
13774,"Pushing the reach and wheelbase out a bit while pulling the rear end in did make me feel more centered and “in” the frame than before. The front end requires a bit more dedication to drive it through turns—particularly when the terrain is flatter and traction is scarce—but it pays off when the terrain gets steeper and more technical: the rider can stay more centered in the bike, and worry less about hanging off the back end."
13775,
13776,
13777,"I also felt like the new bike was a bit stiffer, but its hard to say for sure if I was feeling stiffness, or just the improved control on medium-to-big hits from the shock tune. Perhaps it is a bit of both."
13778,
13779,
13780,"So overall, the changes make the SB5 even more capable in rough and rowdy terrain, and even better at high speeds, without diminishing its climbing abilities."
13781,"However, its improved capabilities do present a conundrum: because it’s better at high speeds and more capable, I found myself pushing the 5c bike harder than I did the previous version; hard enough that I started to feel like the build was too light. I found myself thinking it needed to be built with a Fox 36, beefier tires, heavier wheels, and a wider bar."
13782,
13783,
13784,"But, if it was built that way, it would be a heavier, slower bike that doesn’t climb as well and would lose some of its quickness and playfulness."
13785,
13786,
13787,"Ultimately, this is a good problem. The 5c as I received it is a light, fast, fun, and very versatile bike. But the 5c is so capable that it can take a beefier build, giving it a different character, but without changing the essence of what makes the bike great."
13788,The new SB5 bikes should be in shops in October.
13789,"Already big in Europe, this commuter bike feature is breaking into recreational cycling
"
13790,"Belt drives have long been popular in Europe, where bicycles are more of a lifestyle than a sport, and low-maintenance components are in high demand. Here in the US, though, the Gates Carbon Belt Drive only just gained a foothold in the designs of singlespeeds and commuter bikes with internal hubs, like the Breezer Beltway. But we noticed a funny thing at Interbike this year: Belt drives are expanding beyond the urban transportation market in the US, too. Dirt Demo played host to a number of fat bikes, mountain bikes, and touring bikes decked out with Gates Carbon Belt Drives partnered with the Rohloff internal hubs."
13791,"There are a few good reasons to go with a belt drive over a more traditional chain. The Gates Carbon Belt Drive—the only bicycle-specific belt drive option in the US—is lighter, stronger, easier to clean (forget chain grease—just wash it as you would the rest of your bike), and reportedly longer-lasting than a chain. For touring, a drivetrain that can handle more miles before being replaced (up to 10,000 miles in some cases, according to Paul Tolme at Gates) is a pretty big bonus, as most cross-county bike tourists have to stop at some point in the trip and change out the chain. For off-road travel, the benefits are even more apparent."
13792,RELATED: Get to Know Your Drivetrain
13793,"“Belt drives are gaining popularity in fat bikes and bikepacking bikes because the snow and sand won’t clog up the drivetrain,” Tolme says. “We’re even seeing them in e-bikes, which tend to wear the chain more quickly, like the Faraday Porteur.”"
13794,"Gates says it's still trying to break into the US market—75 to 85 percent of its business is still in Europe, where Tolme says people are willing to pay more for a nice urban bike. We were impressed with the selection of Gates-equipped bikes at Outdoor Demo, such as the MilkMoney 29er from Colorado brand Lenz Sport."
13795,"Expect to see more US bike frames of all varieties either equipped with a Gates Carbon Drive or designed to accommodate one soon. The cost of adding the drive is about $250—but depending on how much time you spend on your chain, the savings in maintenance hours might make up for that. "

13806,FSA's much-anticipated groupset features ultra-customizable shifting and power management options
13807,"After years of hype about the company’s first groupset, FSA has finally announced that it’s ready for market. FSA’s K-Force WE is a wireless, electronic, 11-speed groupset designed for double cranksets. (Want to keep updated on more tech news? Be sure to subscribe!)"
13808,"The K-Force WE is designed to be ultra-customizable: with an accompanying app, riders can customize the function of each shifter, set how long it takes to shift, view battery life, and more. Shifting is controlled by two textured buttons on the brake lever; each is capable of being used for front or rear shifting, and can be set so that the top or bottom button shifts up or down."
13809,"Brake levers come in two different lengths—standard, and a 6mm-shorter compact—to help riders get the best fit possible. The levers are also adjustable to three different reach positions."
13810,         RELATED: 8 Things You Need to Know About Electronic Shifting
13811,"Shifting is powered by a CR2032 watch battery in each lever, which the company claims should last about two years under normal shifting conditions."
13812,
13813,
13814,"Front derailleur: WE’s front derailleurhouses both the shifting mechanism and the system’s “brain,” where signals are received from the shifters and passed on to the derailleurs. The front derailleur mechanism operates on a rack and pinion system, designed to auto-trim as the rear derailleur shifts, keeping the chain in its best alignment."
13815,         RELATED: How to Maintain Your Front Derailleur
13816,"It’s worth noting that the system is actually a “hybrid wireless”—while there are no wires connecting the front derailleur to the shifters, there is a wire that connects the rear derailleur to the battery and to the front derailleur. FSA says this combination makes for easier lever installation and longer battery life."
13817,"The front derailleur is also where riders can power the system down for travel or storage, and view the system’s battery status at a glance, thanks to LED lights that flash one of four colors, based on how much battery power is left."
13818,"Power management is advanced—the system calculates how much battery power is left based on the rider's personal shift profile, including how often the rider shifts and into what gears. (Power management aside, how many times you shift is a pretty neat number to know.)"
13819,
13820,
13821,"Rear derailleur: Rather than being a traditional parallelogram design, WE’s rear derailleur is a miniature gearbox designed to maintain alignment and hold a super-accurate position on the rear cassette. A three-timing gear system moves the derailleur across the cassette laterally, and ensures that the system stays parallel. The unit uses carbon fiber in several places to save weight, but it’s not completely carbon; a lightweight, single-piece arm holds the composite pulley wheels and guides the chain."

13825,"Chainrings, chain and brakes: These components are pretty simple. FSA was making all of these before the groupset was introduced, so there’s some precedent for the models already."
13826,"WE uses a dual-pivot brake based on the existing K-Force Light. However, FSA also used feedback from pro racers to make adjustments that the company claims makes the brake more powerful than its predecessor. The new model is also designed to fit the wider rims that are currently popular."
13827,         RELATED: The Electronic Age & The Future of Shifting
13828,"The crankset is also based on current K-Force models—it’s constructed of hollow carbon reinforced in strategic areas to improve durability. It also has slightly thinner arms than the previous model, which FSA says reduces the Q-factor and therefore improves ergonomics. Six crankarm lengths are available: 165, 170, 172.5, 175, 177.5, and 180."
13829,"The chainrings are CNC-machined and feature new pin placement, which the company claims improves outer chainring stiffness by 120 percent. As for chainring sizes, three are available: 50-34; 52-36; and 53-39."
13830,
13831,
13832,"Battery: The system's lithium battery lives inside the seat tube—that position protects the battery from the elements, and doesn’t put weight in an awkward place for the rider. One wire runs through the seat tube to the front derailleur, and then through the chainstay to the rear derailleur. Installation is what FSA terms “fit and forget”—once the battery is in, you don’t need to remove it to charge the system. To charge, detach the electronic cable from the rear derailleur and plug it in; a full charge should take an hour and a half. It should run between 4,000km and 6,000km of riding."
13833,"The system will be available in May 2017. Pricing will be available within the next two months, but FSA says it will be on par with Shimano Di2 and SRAM eTap."
13834,"Artisans from Carl&Rose explain how Pope Francis’ bike got such a holy paint job
"
13835,"Pope Francis landed in the US earlier this week, where he was spotted in an eco-friendly Fiat in Washington, DC. Hopefully later in the trip, he’ll trade the temporary Popemobile for something even more eco-friendly: a custom-painted Breezer Downtown 8 bike."
13836,"The bike will be waiting for His Holiness when he gets to Philadelphia this weekend. Philly-based Advanced Sports International (ASI), the company that owns Breezer, is behind the bike and papal design. Yesterday, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and the Philadelphia Bicycling Advocacy Board presented the bike to Archbishop Charles Chaput; it was also announced that 100 Breezers will be donated to bicycle-based community programs in the area."
13837,"Though the Breezer itself is cool, the devil is in the details (ha!) and the paint scheme and ornamentation are what truly set this bike apart. The bike, which has a clean white and gold colorway, is decorated with graphics by Amanda Dirksen Catanzaro, head of ASI's graphic design team; the Pope’s crest serves as the head badge. We chatted with the talents behind the implementation of the paint scheme, head badge, and excellent wing-themed chain protector, Noah Rosen and Suzanne Carlsen of Toronto-based Carl&Rose creative agency and VeloColour Bicycle Painting."
13838,    RELATED: Inside Cycling's Coolest Art Show
13839,"BICYCLING: The white and gold paint scheme is very traditional. Why those colors?Carlsen: Actually, the overall design was pretty clearly laid out for us. [Amanda] put the graphics together and chose the general color pallet; we selected the specific colors from our in-house paint samples and color books. We adjusted a few little details, but kept it fairly close to their original layout."
13840,"The major difference between what we did and [ASI's] original expectations is how we went about applying the graphics. Most companies get decals printed, do some larger vinyl wraps, stick them on, and call it a day. We stencil pretty much everything. All of the details on this bike are comprised of many individual layers of stencils applied with paint masks that we prepared and cut in the shop."
13841,How did you guys get the job painting it?Carlsen: It’s nice to know that VeloColour has a good reputation. ASI gave us a call out of the blue and mentioned something about a custom paint job and the Pope and said that we came highly recommended. Sometimes things just happen.
13842,"How did you come up with the design for the chain guard, and how hard was it to implement?Rosen: Actually, Suzanne Carlsen (aka Carl) does most of the design work and all of the hand cutting for the custom head badges and chain guards. We received an image of Pope Francis' crest and of an angel wing, and Suzanne interpreted those to create a stenciled or positive/negative version of these forms. Some information is always omitted or altered for the intended use and overall style that we are looking for. Carl&Rose has a number of blank chainguards that were produced along with our other designs. When a custom design or pattern is needed, the blanks can be cut in almost any style—by hand, of course. The head badge was hand cut in brass and then polished and coated in automotive clear coat. The cutting, bending and polishing [of the head badge] took about five hours in total with some extra time spent reinterpreting the design."
13843,    RELATED: Cycling's Coolest Vintage Head Badges
13844,"How excited will you be if the Pope actually rolls away on the bike?!Rosen: We do really hope that Pope Francis gets to spend some time with it, and if he rides it around the Vatican, of course we would be thrilled. Even if we don't see pictures of him riding outside, the idea of him cruising around on it through the halls of the Vatican—maybe even in his socks—is pretty awesome. Also knowing that an object, with our names on it, is within the walls of the Vatican is pretty neat."

For me, it’s a piece that saw quite a bit of use this fall in the mountains of western North Carolina."
13847,RELATED: Five New Rules of Winter Training
13848,"The Gore Windstopper front and sleeves of the jersey cut the chill of the morning air, while the stretchy, breathable fabric on the back allows the jersey to vent, avoiding that “wearing a trashbag” feeling many heavier jerseys or jackets tend to produce. The jersey’s large waterproof zipper is easy to open with gloves on, and has a fuzzy flap to keep it from rubbing or catching your neck."
13849,"A clever partial inner liner functions as a lightweight jersey or base layer and zips separately inside the outer fabric, so I can unzip the top layer without feeling exposed when I need to let a little more air in. I don’t like to carry too much gear and have found that by zipping or unzipping the outer shell of the ROS, I can stay comfortable for hours on end without needing to bring along an extra layer."
13850,
13851,
13852,"The waist of the jersey lies flat and is cut long enough to keep slop off of your tail. The collar is nice and tall without being constrictive. There are three rear pockets that have reflective accents for added visibility, and drain holes to keep them from collecting water. The medium ROS Jersey fits my 5’10"" and 150-pound frame well and there’s room to have an additional layer underneath."

13857,"For me, carrying a bike lock has always been a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't scenario. Bring it, and you'll have a heavy lock swinging around on your frame or in your bag. Leave it at home and you risk getting your bike stolen if you decide to stop for coffee. I've compromised by taking my bike just inside the door of my destintion, or leaving it by a window, and then obsessively checking to make sure it's still there—until I started using the Ottolock ($65 on amazon.com)."
13858,
13859,
13860,"Built like an oversized zip-tie with a combination opening, the 18mm wide Ottolock has a three-layer stainless steel core, covered with four layers of reinforced kevlar, and coated in Santoprene plastic to avoid dinging your frame. It coils up nice and tight to fit in a jersey pocket, seat bag, around your frame, or anywhere else you can think to stash it. Conveniently, the Ottolock can also be mounted to your bike with Otto’s mount."
13861,RELATED: Avoid These Bike Lock Mistakes
13862,"The brand claims that the Ottolock is more robust than a cable lock—though not as secure as a U-Lock. So, while it won't stand up to a really determined thief, it will protect against opportunistic thefts and standard theft tools such as wire cutters or bolt cutters, along with standard daily abuse."
13863,
13864,
13865,"I’ve had an Ottolock for a few months now and it’s become more of a staple than I ever imagined, encouraging me to explore places that I had previously avoided leaving my bike. The lock is strong and secure, yet light enough for me to put in a hydration pack or carry-on without thinking twice about the weight. I’ve used it for everything from a mid-ride lunch stop to locking gear in the bed of my truck."

Adding the heavier disc brakes, thru-axles, and other associated parts to the lower-end components (often already heavier) can result in a sluggish ride."
13869,
13870,
13871,"A bike like Fuji’s Roubaix 1.1 ($1,840 at performancebike.com) is where I consider the tipping point to be: where the benefits of disc brakes may begin to overshadow the weight savings of rim brakes—for some riders. If you’re looking for an actual race bike, I’d recommend the rim-brake version of the Roubaix 1.1, which is not only $200 less, but also comes with Shimano Ultegra shifters and is two pounds lighter. But if you’re like me—someone who has no intention of racing but enjoys going fast on both descents and climbs—the disc brakes and other parts on the Roubaix 1.1 Disc are good enough to offset the extra weight. Plus, this budget-priced race bike has the frame stiffness, handling, and ride quality of much higher-end carbon versions."

13901,"According to Pivot this bike has been popular in Europe and with NICA (high school) racers, who are ideal for this bike not just because they tend to be smaller, but because the wheels and tires on the less expensive builds are lighter and spin up faster than their 29er counterparts. Even with the base build kit you’re looking at a sub 20-pound bike, according to Pivot. Geometry-wise the Les 27.5 has a long front center, short 426mm chainstays and slack 68.75-69.5 degree head angle, depending on the size of the bike. Four sizes are offered, fitting riders ranging in height from 4’10” to 6”1”."

The sensation of speed and snappy acceleration that impressed me then still wows me now, even outfitted with the new trail build. I'm a 29er guy through-and-through, but this is one of the few 27.5” wheeled XC bikes that doesn’t make me wish it was on a 29er every other second."
13911,"If you've ridden the current generation Mach 4 carbon you’ll have a fairly good idea what the new one feels like. There may be a little more rigidity in the rear end of the bike but it's not really a drastic difference from the already-stout current model. More noticeable was the new trail-focused build I rode, which gives the bike a more versatile nature out on the trail. The slightly slacker front end from the longer travel fork, combined with the more aggressive tires lets the bike play more on the downhills with little penalty on the climbs. This was my second ride on a 2018 Fox fork with the new EVOL air spring, and it makes the first half of the stroke more supple and sensitive, enhancing the bike’s trail fun.

13971,"It's not really a bike, but this mashup of a snowmobile and dirt bike looks awesome"
13972,"The bike is narrow, but stable enough that I can easily rest my feet on the pegs and balance without moving. The first time I give it some gas, I stall. On a second try, as I get to the end of a straightaway, I struggle to turn and nearly run over my instructor. But by lap number three, I’m in third gear, spraying snow as I carve around turns, and hooting like an idiot. How had I never tried this before?"
13973,"You’d be forgiven if you’ve never heard of snow bikes until now, but that won’t last long. After languishing in big brother snowmobile’s shadow, snow bikes are finally having their moment. Basically just dirt bikes with a tank-like tread system replacing the rear wheel and a ski replacing the front wheel, they are smaller, more nimble, and a lot cheaper than snowmobiles. It’s a combo of features that makes them poised to become the dominant motorized snow machine for pure recreation. It also helps that they’re a whole lot of fun, even for first-timers."
13974,RELATED: 5 New Rules of Winter Training
13975,"If there’s one main barrier to entry, it’s that this is something of a DIY job for now. If you want to buy a snow bike, what you’ll really be getting is a conversion kit that turns your standard dirt bike into a snow machine. These kits are made by a variety of companies and when you buy one you also get mounting hardware for your specific dirt bike, be it Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, or what have you. As long as your dirt bike was born in the 90s or later, there’s a good chance you can find a kit. Conversion will take a little bit of work, but it offers a huge added bonus: can ride your dirt bike all summer, then, when the snow starts coming down, you swap in the track and ski and can keep riding all winter. Once the snow melts you just swap the wheels back in."
13976,"“Terrific,” you might say. “I’ve always wanted a snowmobile!” Think again. These are completely different beasts. Snow bikes, unlike their broader and heavier cousins, are narrow, light, and much easier to turn, which lets you to go where snowmobiles simply can’t, cutting your own lines through dense trees. Snowmobiles are notoriously lousy for side-sloping (sliding sideways instead of going forward cutting across a steep slope). On a snow bike, because you’re on just one ski and one tread, you remain upright like you would if you were mountain biking. The setup also enables you to carve your way down very steep terrain, as if you were on a snowboard."
13977,"All that said, words do not quite suffice as a means of describing what these machines are capable of. As a visual aid, I suggest you watch this:"
13978,"The concept of the snow bike is far from new. Prototypes for motorcycles with two rear wheels that could accommodate tracks go as far back as the 1920s. In WWII, both France and Germany got into the game, attempting to make a lean machine that could be used for warfare in the rough terrain and snow of the Alps. In the 1930s, the American company J.E. Love developed the Shrew snow cycle, which was the first snow bike that had a ski in the front on shocks. They made between 500 and 1000 Shrews but they had some problems with overheating engines. They were also extremely difficult to turn but very easy to tip."
13979,RELATED: Small Riders Can Shred Snow with the Specialized Hellga Expert
13980,"That was about as close to success as snow bikes came for a while, though there were many iterations by many manufacturers through the 1950s and 60s. Popular Mechanics even featured a kit from a company called “Snow Job” in 1973, but the unit was wide and awkward, especially considering its $778 pricetag, which is more than $4,300 adjusted for inflation. There was a similar failure in 1977 when the U.S. military commissioned Chrysler to develop what would be called the Sno-Runner. Ultimately the government decided to pass on it because it would get stuck in deep snow, so Chrysler went public with it in 1979. It was advertised as a “light utility mountain vehicle” and it was showed off at ski resorts around the country. They were sold for $900 and never found a market, so they were pulled by 1982."
13981,"But today, after a few more decades of technological advancement, these nimble snow machines are flying off the shelves, building an ever-growing tribe of devotees, and even showing up on the biggest stages in snow sports. While a handful of companies now make snow bikes, the basic design has mostly stabilized. They all have a ski up front and a track in the rear with roughly 20 inches of suspension travel, giving the bikes a very cushy feel even on uneven terrain. Companies like Moto Trax, Yeti Snow MX, Sno Ripper, and CMX all have followings, but the 800-pound gorilla in the market, and the one most responsible for the snow bike renaissance, is the Idaho-based company Timbersled, which revitalized the age-old design."
13982,"Until Timbersled, the front ski on snow bikes were essentially just a ski that was pulled off of a snowmobile, a piece of kit perhaps unsurprisingly ill-suited for transplant onto a much smaller, lighter vehicle. Rather than having a flat bottom, Timbersled’s snow-biking ski has three well-defined keels, each with two carving edges on them. There’s a large, center keel which is essentially what you’re balancing on when you’re going straight in hardpacked snow. Then, crucially, there are the two shorter keels on each side, which give you another set of edges you can use to carve along a side-slope. The channels in between the keels also afford the bike far greater flotation. This was a major game changer. Suddenly the ski could float through powder. It could handle cliff-drops without the nose digging in, sending you over the handlebars. It gave riders an incredible amount of control at a wide range of speeds and essentially let you carve like you were on a motorized snowboard. At ESPN’s inaugural Winter X Games Snow BikeCross competition—a 30 lap race around a track with bumps, jumps, and hairpin turns—a whopping 13 of the 16 athletes chose to ride Timbersleds."
13983,"And I can understand why after riding one for myself at a press event. Even as green as could be, with no motorcycle or dirt bike experience to speak of, I was up and cruising in mere minutes. The trickiest part was learning to turn, which requires you to lean in and really commit in order to engage the side of the bike’s skis. But within five minutes I was having more fun than I’d ever had on a snowmobile. I loved the dexterity the bike had, and how it was so easy to carve whatever line I wanted. It may not have the sheer uphill climbing power that a snowmobile has, with its higher horsepower engine and bigger, toothier track, but the bike more than made up for those deficiencies with its effortlessness."
13984,"That’s actually a large part of the appeal of snow bikes. Because they weigh so much less than a snowmobile, that means that smaller, lighter riders don’t have to exhaust themselves wrestling a bulky machine through turns. Even kids can make the bike more or less goes where they want it to by just leaning. Add in the ability to take it into steep terrain with dense trees and suddenly a lot more of the backcountry is open to you. You don’t need to worry as much about following a trail when your bike is fine with powder and can carve fine on its own."
13985,"Timbersled, which is now owned by Polaris, claims it has doubled the number of sleds it sold every year since 2010, which would bring their numbers to between 5,000 and 10,000 per year, currently, and that’s just one company. At this rate snow bikes are easily on pace to outsell snowmobiles in the next few years, and it’s not hard to see why. Rather than buy a snowmobile that will sit in your garage eight months out of the year, these conversion kits enable you to ride a motor bike year-round and really have a blast in any conditions. Personally, I can’t wait to get some more time on one this coming winter."

13997,Who says disc brakes have to be heavy?
13998,"In Trek’s stable of race-oriented bicycles comprised of the Madone, Domane, and Émonda, the latter is the lightweight all-rounder that complements the aero Madone and rough-road Domane. "
13999,"At the time of its introduction in 2014, Trek claimed the Emonda was the lightest production frame in the world. Capable of being built to an astoundingly low 10.9 lbs complete (sans pedals) is was a rim-brake equipped wonder of low weight with no rider weight limit. It also provided an exceptional ride, garnering praise from the media at large and winning a Bicycling Editor’s choice award in 2017 for the Émonda SLR 8 Race Shop Limited, the same bike available to Trek Segafredo riders and consumers alike.  "
14000,RELATED: How to Watch the Tour de France
14001,"For 2018, Trek built on their philosophy of lightweight-for-all with two new models: the SL, a price-conscious model based on the current (2017) Émonda SLR and built with 500series OCLV carbon that supersedes the current introductory S models; and a brand-new-from-the-ground up SLR that shaves weight and offers incredible ride characteristics for any bike, let alone one so light. Both variants will be available in rim or disc models. "
14002,ÉMONDA SLR:
14003,"The SLR is Trek’s flagship offering in the line. It will be available in H1, Trek’s longer, lower, race oriented fit, and H2, with a slightly shorter reach than the H1 and a taller head tube. Both bikes will be constructed of Trek’s proprietary 700 OCLV carbon. Weights for both frames are a claimed 640 grams (Rim, H1, size: 56cm) and 665g (Disc, H1, size: 56cm).  For comparison, the previous Émonda was 690g.  "
14004,
14005,
14006,"All the proprietary tech of the current Émonda is retained, including the E2 head tube (which maximizes strength without adding weight) BB90, a ride-tuned seatmast and Duo Trap speed/cadence sensors in the left chainstay. The rim version relies on Bontrager Speedstop Pro brakes directly mounted to the frame in traditional fork seat stay positions.
	 
	The only difference between the disc and rim frames is co-molded dropouts with aluminum inserts, to carry the direct-mount style calipers and to capture the thru axles. Rear spacing is 142x12 while the fork sees a 12mm thru axle. "
14007,Check out the previous Emonda:
14008,The Émonda will be available in both men’s and women’s models with the only difference being touch points and paint schemes. Riders who want a truly custom bike can take advantage of Trek’s Project 1 program to pick their own paint job and component spec. The SL model with H2 geometry is available in 44-62cm frames.  SLR with H1 runs  50-62cm.
14009,"Trek’s aim was to craft a purpose-built all-around road bike with a simple goal: Improve ride quality and make the lightest lighter. It also needed to hold up, with no rider weight limit and a lifetime warranty.  "
14010,
14011,
14012,"To that end, they used computer modeling to identify ideal tube shapes. As OCLV continues to evolve, the carbon fiber pieces are getting smaller and more optimized, which allows Trek to focus on ever-smaller areas of the frame and continue to pare down weight. Trek claims they made hundreds of working model frames before they arrived at the final product. "
14013,"Trek also wanted the Émonda to have more tire clearance, up to 28mm on the rim version and a claimed 30mm (though it looks like larger 32mm tires might fit our tester), on the disc version. "
14014,"Pricing for the Émonda range starts at $1579.99 for the base model Émonda SL Disc FS and tops out at $10,999.99 for the Émonda SLR 9."
14015,
14016,
14017,The Ride: 
14018,"The new Émonda is poised to be an instant classic. I tested the Émonda SLR disc in H2 fit over a couple days riding around Trek's HQ in Madison, and just received the same bike here at home for long-term testing. The new bike delivers on Trek’s promises; it’s soft when you need it to be (riding rumbly broken roads, for example) and stiff under power when climbing or sprinting. "
14019,"The H2 fit is generous, putting riders in a position that spans comfort and efficiency well. With a slammed stem it was easy to get to a race position, and general trundling around wasn't so stretched that I couldn't take in the scenery. "
14020,RELATED: Why You Should Invest in a Bike Fit this Season
14021,"Handling-wise, the bike is super sharp. It benefits from a balanced feel that lets you take advantage of hip steer in tight chicanes for an effortless ability to carve lines at supersonic speeds. When stretched out and really giving it some stick, the Émonda did an admirable job of allowing you to lay down the watts. For the pure sprinter, the bike will get you to the line— but a Madone or similarly stiff chassis may be your better choice, as the (very) slightly springy ride of the Émonda may leave you wanting of those last few watts. "
14022,
14023,
14024,"But consider the ethereally light weight of the bike, and its all-rounder nature may be inconsequential.  On our scales the fully built bike—with pedals and cages, in 54cm, with Dura Ace 9100, Aeolus 3 carbon clinchers and 28mm Bontrager R3 Hardcase Lite 28mm tires— weighs in at a scant 15.6 lbs. "

14026,"These lovely mitts are a quintessentially inessential addition to your cycling kit
"
14027,"From Silca to Shinola, cycling entrepreneurs are taking advantage of the larger cultural trend of embracing resurrected or rebooted heritage brands. Beginning in the 1960s and lasting into the neon '90s, the Italian company Brancale was, along with Cinelli, the premier manufacturer of leather hairnets, a respected producer of early hardshell helmets (including the Brancale Sport, worn by the villain Belov in American Flyers), and a supplier of handmade leather shoes for Greg LeMond and other stylish champions. The new Brancale, based in the US and manufacturing here as well as in Italy and England, offers bibs, jerseys, socks, and arm warmers featuring the iconic logo. But its most striking product pays tribute to the brand's legacy in leather: short-finger ($180) and long-finger ($200) gloves. That's pricey for an inessential piece of kit that's subject to a lot of wear as well as outright abuse, but it's competitive with similar mitts from Rapha, Dromarti, and others. And because leather acquires character as it ages, and absorbs the ravages of water, sweat, grease, and abrasion, devotees will happily pay more for a product that has not only a longer life than fabric versions, but also a more beautiful one."

14048,Specialized’s new family of aluminum hardtails shed weight and gain performance
14049,"For 2018, Specialized is introducing the Chisel family of MTB hardtails. The Chisel has several updates from the long-standing Stumpjumper line that look to offer a high level of performance in an aluminum bike. Made with M5 aluminum and weighing 1,350g, the Chisel is 200g lighter than the current alloy Stumpjumper hardtail. Some of this weight savings is attributed to the use of Specialized’s “D’Aluzio Smartweld Technology.” Smartweld was a technology that was first seen introduced on the Allez several years ago, then on the Diverge, and is now for the first time seen on one of Specialized’s mountain bikes."
14050,"Traditionally, the tubing an aluminum bike frame is made with is simply cut and welded together at the junctions. This leaves much of the integrity of the frame left in the hands of the welder. With Smartweld, the aluminum tubes that create the frame of a bike are hydroformed at the ends. When the tubes are placed together, there is a larger area of contact, forming a valley which is then filled in with the weld material. (An easy way to imagine this is to put the bottom of two aluminum cans together) This also allows engineers to better tune the ride quality of the frame and optimize the stiffness and weight. Engineers claim that it can provide a similar stiffness to that of a carbon fiber frame."
14051,
14052,
14053,"Updated Geometry
	The headtube angle is 69.8 degrees, chainstay length is 430mm, and trail is 82mm. These numbers on paper look to provide a great all-around performance hardtail. Other nice features are of course the threaded bottom bracket and sleek internal cable routing. The seatpost diameter is 27.2, and is dropper post compatible. With more 27.2 dropper options available now than ever, there will likely be many people adding one to their bike, although it does not come spec’d on any of the models. The rear end spacing is boost, 12x148."
14054,"The Chisel is available in both complete models as 1x and 2x, and as a frameset. There is also a women’s model, which has different touch points and a different tune on the fork. The different tunes for men’s and women’s suspension come from the culmination of research that Specialized has done and while it works great for many men and women, there are cases, as Specialized’s engineers noted, that men may benefit from the women’s tune and women benefit from the men’s."

14061,"If you’ve looked at your road bike recently and thought, “I need more carbon, I want tubeless, and I like to buy US-made stuff,” you should start wearing a tin-foil hat, because ENVE read your mind. The company has a new hubset and rim that tick all your boxes."
14062,"The hubs have a simple name that undercompensates—ENVE Carbon Road Hub. The carbon fiber shells, manufactured in ENVE’s Ogden, Utah, facility begin as two halves: Each half is molded as one piece including flange and spoke holes, which are bonded together and finally co-molded to make the final shell. Enve promotes the hub as balanced, taking into account reliability, strength, weight, stiffness, and efficiency."
14063,"The rear hub uses a DT-Swiss star ratchet system, driver body, and axle (the front axle is ENVE’s design); it’s reliable, and replacement parts are easy to find. The ceramic-hybrid (steel races and ceramic balls) come from Ceramic Speed. The SES 2.2 carbon clincher rims are tubeless ready and feature a rain-friendly brake surface."
14064,"The hubs are only offered for rim brakes, with 20 front and 24 rear drilling; Campagnolo or SRAM/Shimano driver bodies; and are quick release-only (though the rear could be upgraded to thru-axle with DT’s parts)."
14065,"ENVE claims the hubs’ weight is 232g: 74 grams front, 158 grams rear. For comparison, a DT-Swiss 240s hubset for J-bend spokes is 314g (claimed), while a Chris King R45 hubset is 318g (claimed). Price? Hold onto your tin-foil hats, because the suggested retail is $1,350. Yes, for the hubs alone. A complete Smart ENVE System wheelset built with the Carbon Road Hubs will sell for $3,300 tubular, or $3,500 clincher."

14067,"This presents a perfect segue into ENVE’s other new product: the SES 2.2 Clincher rim, also made in Ogden. While other SES rims have differentiated depths and widths front and rear, the 2.2 rim is the same all around. The only differentiation is the front rim has 20 holes and the rear has 24."
14068,
14069,
14070,"It is the shallowest (25mm-deep, 27mm-wide, 18.5mm-internal width) and lightest (410 grams each, claimed) of ENVE’s SES rim series. It’s not pitched as an aerodynamic rim, but as a lightweight climber’s rim that is stable in crosswinds. It is also ENVE’s first road tubeless-ready rim."
14071,     RELATED: Why You Should Go Tubeless
14072,"Like the 2.2 tubular rim unveiled earlier this year, the 2.2 clincher has the latest iteration of ENVE’s textured brake track. ENVE claims that, when paired with ENVE’s latest brake pads (included), the rim makes it possible to achieve the same amount of stopping power as first-gen brake tracks with 30 percent less effort, in wet and dry conditions. The 2.2 was optimized around 25mm-wide tires, though naturally it is compatible with almost any width tire that can be squeezed into a road frame."
14073,"Claimed wheelset weights start at 1,275 grams when built with ENVE’s new Carbon Road hub ($3,500), and top out at 1,458 grams when built with a DT-Swiss 350 hub ($2,575). The rims ($975 each) are also available, though harder to get."

14077,"Designed for high-speed shredding and big air, downhill bikes are the monster trucks of the cycling world—with the right skills, you can ride them over just about anything. In recent years, gravity riding has split into overlapping downhill racing and bike-park playing: the former involves traditional timed downhill runs; the latter involves more big airs and tricks (think Redbull Rampage)."
14078,"Standard downhill bikes will be long, low, and slack to deal with the big hits and drops of a natural trail, while park and freeride bikes will often have a slightly shorter wheelbase for airs and tricks. With plenty of travel and reinforced frames to withstand the biggest hits, neither will be as svelte as their endurance-focused cousins, which means they're most at home in lift-served or shuttle-able terrain.

	SRAM calls the brake “platform” HydroHC. It is all new, and not just cosmetic changes to SRAM’s existing HydroR road hydraulic platform. HydroR products will still be sold at the Force and Rival levels. The HydroHC platform is found in SRAM Red eTap HRD (Hydraulic Road Disc, presumably) products. Got it? Cool."

14202,
14203,
14204,"First Ride
	I had my first experience on eTap HRD on a soggy two-hour ride in the rolling German countryside aboard a Cannondale SuperSix Evo Disc."
14205,"I’m a very big fan of eTap’s hoods, and I was curious—and mildly anxious—to see if SRAM could fit in a hydraulic braking system and maintain eTap’s excellent ergonomics."
14206,
14207,
14208,"The eTap HRD ergonomics are… close to Red eTap (for rim brakes). They're similar enough to feel familiar, but different enough to notice."
14209,"HydroHC is slightly larger diameter than the rim brake hood. SRAM’s brake category manager Paul Kantor told me the difference is just a couple millimeters, but I felt it. The transition to the hood peak felt different to me as well: not quite as natural, not quite as nice as eTap for cable brakes."
14210,
14211,
14212,"But, again, eTap HRD’s hood shape is close to eTap. And much closer than SRAM’s Red mechanical shift and brake lever is to Red’s mechanical shift/HydroR brake levers. And much closer than current Shimano road shift/brake for cable brakes are to Shimano’s road shift/brake levers for hydraulic brakes (though Shimano has addressed this in the forthcoming Dura Ace 9100 group)."
14213,
14214,
14215,"After a few kilometers, I thought little about the hoods. Despite not being quite as sweet as eTap for cable brakes, they are comfortable, and they have clearance for a three finger wrap behind the brake lever."
14216,And it must be said they simply look hundreds of times better than SRAM’s blocky HydroR platform.
14217,
14218,
14219,"Braking performance is very good. With the recommended 160mm rotors, power is excellent (power meaning how much hand effort it takes to generate a certain braking force), the feel is light and communicative, and they modulate intuitively once you get accustomed to the light touch they require. And because it was raining the entire ride, I was once again reminded of the superior control disc brakes offer. No rim brake/pad/rim combination performs as well."
14220,
14221,
14222,"HydroHC’s lever feel is very good, and much improved from SRAM’s previous effort (HydroR). The lever feels snappier, the action is smoother, and there’s less slop. It feels more precise and higher quality. Kantor says this was an area of focus in HydroHC’s development, and it seems to have paid off."
14223,
14224,
14225,"However, I did notice a few instances when the lever was slow to return to its initial position. These seemed to happen at random and I couldn’t induce a slow lever return.This situation was not accompanied by any change in braking performance."
14226,"In all other ways, this group performed exactly like other eTap groups I’ve used—hardly surprising, because in all other ways it’s the same group."
14227,
14228,
14229,"At this moment, I’d say Red eTap HRD offers the best blend or ergonomics and performance of any road-disc drivetrain and is a step forward for the category overall. However, I haven’t used Shimano’s new Dura Ace 9100, nor have I tried Campagnolo’s disc brake (a few sources have told me that Campy's disc is better than Shimano’s and SRAM’s disc)."

14232,
14233,
14234,"• Though it’s found in products sold at the OE level and aftermarket, the Stealth-a-Majig hydraulic connection at the hood is primarily to benefit OEMs. It's bled at SRAM’s factory as two separate units—the caliper and hose, and the lever—then sealed and shipped to the bike assembly factory. Workers on the bike assembly line can run the hydraulic hose through a frame and connect it to the lever without the system ingesting air, and the brake does not require a bleed after connection."
14235,
14236,
14237,"• Because DOT hydraulic fluid ingests water—lowering the fluid’s boiling point—SRAM hydraulic brakes should be flushed and bled annually (at least). The oil paths in the HydroHC caliper and a drip-free, sealed bleed syringe connection at the caliper, are claimed to make flushing and bleeding the system more foolproof. I watched a live demo, and it appears to be about as easy as a hydraulic brake bleed gets."
14238,"• While SRAM's earlier HydroR platform offered hydraulic rim brakes in addition to hydraulic discs, HydroHC only has a disc brake option."

14252,How former pro Tom Soladay learned to love the one piece of gear he never thought he’d wear
14253,"I was a professional bike racer with Rally Cycling for 10 years before I retired at the end of 2017, so I’ve done my share of long training rides. I’d been noticing that more and more drivers are paying attention to their phones instead of the road. And it feels like it’s getting worse. I’ve had side mirrors hit me, I’ve had cars slam the brakes right in front of me. My wife and I are expecting our first kid this March, so my priorities are shifting and I feel less inclined to take risks. Last year I stayed with a family in Austin, Texas, to train. The dad is in his 50s and rides with a mirror on his helmet. Mirrors of any kind are not something you find in the bike-racing crowd. It’s not “pro.” In professional cycling, it’s like, your bar tape is white, your shoes are white, you have to have shaved legs. But it was a revelation to ride with someone who knew that a car was about to pass without having to crane his neck to look—we could anticipate traffic with almost no effort, and it felt much safer. Suddenly, I was curious: Could I rock a mirror?"
14254,"I added three options to my Amazon cart…and let them sit for two weeks. Part of me wasn’t ready to publicly display my apprehension of riding on open roads. And part of me still wanted to preserve my vanity. But practicality finally won out, and I clicked “buy.” (Get the Peddler’s Take a Look Mirror Soladay wears for $13 at Amazon.)"
14255,"The first mirror I tried was a bar-end design that fit into my handlebar’s drop, but I didn’t like that I had to take my eyes off the road completely to use it. So I switched to a sunglass-mounted model. On my first ride, I saw the benefits immediately: With a quick glance to my left, I could see approaching vehicles. Cars that previously went unheard and passed too close were now on my radar. If there was not much of a shoulder to ride on and I needed to protect my space, I could slowly drift out and gauge how drivers were reacting to me. I could see whether they were slowing down, if they were moving over. I was always looking out for the driver who made no adjustment. Now that I could create enough room between myself and the shoulder, I had a space to move into when they got closer."
14256,This is how drivers can safely pass a cyclist:
14257,"
"
14258,
14259,"Wearing my mirror in public was another matter. The first time I did was at a charity event: There were a lot of recreational cyclists there, along with professionals, sponsors, and volunteers. As I rode up to the parking lot, I got nervous and tucked my sunglasses into my jersey so no one would see. After the ride got going, I took a deep breath and put them back on. The mirror was definitely a topic of conversation, but the majority thought it was a great idea."
14260,"Emboldened, I kept wearing it. Of course, not everyone was ready to let it go, especially competitive cyclists. I definitely got some teasing: “What’s next, a triathlon?” Or, “That’s going to start growing hair on your legs.” But soon, one guy asked me what brand of mirror I was using. Maybe six people I’ve ridden with so far have switched sunglasses with me so they can see what it’s all about. I haven’t heard anyone say they didn’t like it."
14261,RELATED: How to Bike Commute Year-Round in Traffic
14262,"I used to think helmet mirrors were dorky. But as I transition toward dad life, I care less about what other people think (I’ve also started wearing cargo shorts and sport sandals) and more about staying safe. And I’m starting to feel a sense of solidarity with other mirror users. I wave at people who wear one, and I feel like part of the club. I’m even spreading the word by posting pictures of myself using it. Yeah, I know it’s not “pro.” But neither am I anymore. And wearing a mirror on my sunglasses has changed the way I approach riding—for the better."
14263,"The Limus Team Edition S is Challenge's winning combination of control, durability, and speed"
14264,"Get a group of cyclocrossers in a room and you can guarantee the conversation will turn to one thing: tires. Roadies might obsess over weight, aerodynamics, and gear range, but the overwhelming determinant of cyclocross performance is the contact between the rider and the ground. And when that ground turns into slippery wet mud, the choice of tread, casing, and pressure can make the difference between the top of the podium and an undignified dismount on the first downhill."
14265,"Normally there are as many opinions on mud tires as there are riders at the start line, but this weekend's Cyclocross World Championships in Valkenburg provided a rare exception. Three of four of the competitors who won rainbow stripes last weekend rode to victory on the same tire: the Challenge Limus."
14266,
14267,
14268,"Tire selection is always a tradeoff between grip and rolling resistance. The larger a tire's lugs (those big, visible rubber blocks) the better it will grip, allowing riders to handle corners and descents without sliding out. But lugs also stick to the road and will thus roll slower for the same effort, a phenomenon known as rolling resistance."
14269,RELATED: Which Tire Should I Buy for Cyclocross?
14270,"Essentially, a racer wants a tire with just enough tread to ride all the muddy sections without losing time in the fast and smooth sections. We spoke to pro cyclocross racer Andrew Juliano of the Grit World Racing team about tire choice. He said the course at Valkenberg was “mud from tape to tape, especially for the elites after a week of racing on the course."" That meant grip in the mud was the order of the day."
14271,Know your cyclocross! Check out the dismount:
14272,"Challenge is an Italian brand with a factory in Thailand, where tires are made by hand. The Limus pattern, with its three-pronged central lugs and y-shaped side lugs, has been around since 2011. Four years ago, Challenge introduced improvements to its Team Edition ""S"" lineup, including a softer rubber compound and cotton casing for better—nearly world-beating, apparently—grip."

Compton was riding the Limus, too. In the women's U23 race, British rider Evie Richards also chose the Limus, fighting impressively through a tough mechanical and bike change late in the race to take the win."
14275,
14276,
14277,"Belgian Eli Iserbyt took control of the men's U23 race early on, soloing to victory on Limus tires. In the men's elite race, pre-race favorite Mathieu van der Poel used Limus, but was bested by Belgian Wout Van Aert. Van Aert, who along with his coach is notoriously particular about tires, chose the Dugast Rhino, though in a narrower-than-usual 30mm width."
14278,"Juliano explained that “a narrower tire will grip less in the mud, but it will wrap the tread around the casing a little further so that the side lugs don’t touch the tarmac, which reduces rolling resistance."""
14279,A new fitness wearable from BSX aims to open up a new wealth of information about hydration and athletic performance
14280,"As some of the earliest adopters of heart rate monitors, cyclists are heavily experienced with the fitness wearables market that is now a household topic, even among casual users. But one of the problems with many wearables is whether the information they give us is accurate, or even all that useful."
14281,"A new entrant hopes to change that, and its producer is making some bold claims about what it measures, and what that data might mean."
14282,"The product is LVL (pronounced like it would be with the vowels in place). It’s a hydration monitor from BSX, which launched today for pre-order. You might know that name from the company’s first product, the Insight lactate threshold monitor."
14283,(Want more gear news and insights? Be sure to subscribe for daily updates!)
14284,"Why Monitor Hydration? 
	Think of LVL as the evolution of that technology, says BSX co-founder Dustin Freckleton, MD. “Lactate threshold was always a mid-range goal on the way to what we truly wanted to do, which was measure hydration,” he says. Freckleton’s interest is partly personal: in the midst of studying for med school exams, he suffered a stroke partly brought on by dehydration. Once recovered from the partial paralysis that resulted, he became intensely interested in the subject."
14285,"Past Freckleton’s own harrowing experience, BSX points to its own research that shows some significant declines in cognitive function and performance with as little as one or two percent dehydration (as a percentage of total body weight). It’s easy to write that off as bespoke research intended to buttress the company’s claims, but there’s a significant reservoir of independent clinical research that backs up the notion."
14286,         RELATED: How Dehydration Affects Your Riding—And Tips for Avoiding It
14287,"Studies have correlated even mild dehydration—the same level that BSX focused on—to drops in short-term memory, reaction time, motor skills—even mood. But the methodologies and definitions within these studies differ, and the evidence is not uniform, skeptics point out. For example, there’s no single standard measurement for ""dehydration""; total body water and plasma osmolality are two, but they’re not entirely interchangeable. Also, many of the studies focus on the effect of dehydration after a workout, not necessarily in everyday life."
14288,"But neither is anyone claiming dehydration is good for you. And, for many of us, exercise is a part of everyday life, and mild dehydration is a common effect of exercise. There, the science is a little more clear: dehydration has been strongly correlated with lower athletic performance, including faster time to exhaustion. So even if the science isn’t in total agreement, there is general consensus that being hydrated is generally better than the alternative."
14289,
14290,
14291,"How LVL Works
	How does LVL work to quantify that? It’s similar to other fitness wearable technology like from FitBit or Garmin in that it operates via optical sensors. But most fitness wearables use sensing technology called photoplethysmography (PPG), based on an LED light that’s green in the visible spectrum. (It’s similar to the technology currently used in pulse oximetry.) But as a recent lawsuit against FitBit shows, there are concerns about whether it’s as reliably accurate as conventional heart rate straps, which measure electrical activity like an electrocardiogram."
14292,"LVL uses a technology called NIRS: near-infrared spectroscopy, which, like PPG, is also used in medical imaging. One key difference is that the red visible light that NIRS uses to penetrate the skin goes deeper into the body than PPG, which BSX says essentially produces better signal strength, for better accuracy."
14293,         RELATED: Trends You Can Expect in Wearable Technology
14294,"BSX says another benefit of that is it can allow LVL to monitor more physiological parameters, including hydration. So LVL is a hydration monitor, but it’s not meant to run alongside your current wearable, but rather replace it: LVL will also monitor heart rate, step count (via accelerometers, like other wearables) and sleep. BSX also hints at more capabilities not currently built into LVL, like respiratory rate and muscle oxygenation."
14295,"Is LVL Accurate?
	That leaves two major questions, which won’t be answered at least until we get our hands on one and maybe some time after. First: is LVL accurately and reliably measuring hydration? Since there’s no single gold standard for how to measure hydration, LVL has to essentially pick a method of measurement—in this case, plasma osmolality—and then assign relative values off of that. Are you properly hydrated or dehydrated? If so, by how much? LVL shows that in a simple graphical readout on the unit, and pairs to a mobile-based app with a dashboard showing sleep and activity stats, as well as hydration recommendations."
14296,         RELATED: How Accurate is Your Wearable's Calorie Count?
14297,"For this to work practically for users, the data has to be within a consistent range of error, and correlate to other measurements. (BSX says that in lab testing and development, it’s correlated the plasma osmolality measurement it takes with other methods, including lean body water, urine osmolality and body weight change.) For what it’s worth, BSX’s Insight lactate threshold monitor, which uses the same NIRS technology, was tested independently at Central Queensland University and found to be reliable, and the highly regarded DC Rainmaker blog also favorably reviewed it."
14298,
14299,
14300,"Is Hydration Data Useful?
	The second question is far more open: we’ve never really been able to reliably measure hydration on broad terms, only in limited lab situations. What do we do with that information? The human body is roughly 60 percent water, but recommendations on how much we should drink to stay properly hydrated are typically vague, ranging from “drink when you’re thirsty” to the old eight-glasses-a-day chestnut."
14301,         RELATED: 8 Tasty Foods That Help You Rehydrate Naturally
14302,"If LVL can accurately measure hydration, then there’s the very real question of how we begin to use that information. A parallel is the advent of power meters that offered independent left leg/right leg measurement. Coaches and fitters are still figuring out what that means on a practical level for training and bike fit, let alone utilizing the wealth of data that comes with something like Pioneer’s power meter that offers force vector data at 12 points on each pedal stroke. Hydration, thankfully, may be more simple: you’re either hydrated, or over-hydrated or dehydrated to some extent. The complexity comes in what that might mean."
14303,"If LVL can do what BSX claims, then it opens up an opportunity for researchers to dive in with a relatively low-cost way to study the issue, help define those terms, and offer some practical insight into what it means. And, if LVL works as advertised and proves to be more accurate, the technology it uses could have a significant effect on other wearables, which is estimated to become anywhere from an $18Bn to $34Bn market by 2020 (that’s a larger market than just fitness wearables, but does include the category). BSX will sell the LVL at launch for $199, in range of many current fitness wearables; backers of the current Kickstarter program get a discount, as is common with crowdfunding campaigns."
14304,"In touting the potential physiological parameters its NIRS sensing technology can monitor, BSX obviously has designs on firmware updates and subsequent products that could deepen the pool of data available to wearables users while also increasing accuracy. If LVL works, which of course we have to learn, then the self-examined life just got a closer examination."
14305,"Whether you're new to cycling or simply buying a bike online, these expert tips will help you get the right fit"
14306,"Nowadays, almost everything can be bought online—and bikes are no exception. But the convenience of having your new bike delivered directly to your home comes with one main drawback: Unless you’ve already had a chance to try it out beforehand, you’re taking a gamble on getting the right size. Buying in person? That’s much easier, but it still helps to know what to look for. Follow these steps, and you’ll be ready to hit the road (or the trails) on the right bike in no time:"
14307,"First, consider what kind of bike you want. Sizing varies greatly between road and mountain bikes, as well as between men's and women's models and even between individual manufacturers. You’ll want to be familiar with your own wants and needs before determining what size is right for you. Many manufacturers have their own sizing charts that will steer you in the right direction."
14308,"While using your height as a guide is one of the easier ways to get an idea of your frame size, it won't give you a perfect fit. Rather, it’s just a decent way to determine whether the frame will be too short or too tall. Below are general guides for road bikes and mountain bikes. Keep in mind that this is only a general guide. Sizing will still vary between brands."
14309,"Getting a professional bike fit before you buy can make all the difference. That's why Missy Erickson, owner and fit specialist at ERO Sports, recommends a Pre-Purchase Bike Fit for all athletes.“It doesn't matter if you're buying a new bike from a bike shop, ordering a bike online, or buying off Craigslist,” she says. “Knowing your fit dimensions and having a fit specialist help walk you through the process not only ensures you are getting the proper size, but a bike also for your specific needs.”"
14310,"A bike fit will also provide all your more detailed measurements. For beginner cyclists and athletes, this can be extremely helpful. “Investing in a bike fit not only ensures you are going to get the right bike, but you're also going to be set up on it perfectly, avoiding injury, pain, and discomfort, which will make cycling even more enjoyable than it already is,” Erickson says."
14311,"It’s the most obvious and overused advice out there, but it’s true: Seeing a bike in person, trying it out, and getting a feel for it is often the best way to know if it’s right for you. Many bicycle brands and bike shops offer demo days or demo events to allow customers to test ride bikes. It also helps to ask questions and speak to knowledgeable staff members. As an added bonus, you avoid the potential damage from shipping, and you won’t have to assemble anything yourself."
14312,"Ideally, you’ll know your bike size before you buy. It’ll make the whole process easier, and you’ll be set up for success right from the beginning. Sometimes, however, there are other ways to know if your setup isn’t right. Lower back pain, elbow pain, neck pain, and knee pain can all be indicative of a poor fit (among other issues). Numbness is another problematic sign."

14314,This all-mountain helmet is ready to take on the trail with subtle style and thoughtful features
14315,"Nearly three decades ago, Troy Lee started painting wild designs on motocross helmets and selling them to friends. Since then, his company has expanded its line of shred-ready products to include mountain bike helmets and apparel, most of which carry the same daring paint schemes that first drew attention to the company. This summer, I tested the A1 half-shell helmet, which is designed for all-mountain ride sessions—and despite one minor technical malfunction, I found that it’s a solid piece of gear."
14316,"I normally gravitate toward brightly colored cycling gear, which Troy Lee is famous for, so my first thought when I saw the gray color was, Meh. But I came to like it way more than I expected—it let my neon gloves and shoes shine without competing. Plus, the super-matte finish added some subtle, understated style."
14317,"This helmet runs on the small side—I wear a small in most brands, and I was on the verge of needing a medium in this one. The size of this lid could prove an issue in winter, when I’m slipping a thick cap underneath, but it could also be a huge benefit for petite women who have a hard time finding helmets that fit. Needless to say, you’ll want to check out the measurements on Troy Lee’s site or try the helmet on before you buy."
14318,     RELATED: Five Cool Helmets That Cost Less Than $50
14319,"The ventilation was good, though on hot, humid days, I would opt for a helmet with more or larger vents (this one features 16). Of course, the A1 is designed for all-mountain riding—on big, rocky trails, I’ll happily give up a better breeze for extra coverage on all but the most sauna-like days."
14320,"You’re not able to adjust the visor while you’re riding, but you can change its position by a few inches by using three hand-adjustable screws in the helmet body. The visor itself is easily replaceable should you take a header over the bars, and comes in a variety of colors. One note here: While on the trail, I did lose the centermost of the three screws, which holds the visor in place. That caused the visor to fall down while I was riding (eek!). I remedied this by moving one of the side screws to the center to keep the visor attached—a good temporary trail solution, but I’ll want to get some extra screws for the future."
14321,"One small detail really elevated this helmet for me: The liner is one piece, and you can remove it easily for washing. It’s a thoughtful but simple feature that eliminates a really common (and stinky) problem. The liner attaches with Velcro, which stuck everything firmly in place without grabbing my hair. I washed it twice over the summer, and the attachment never got wonky or less effective."

14323,This is an absolutely magical bike
14324,"The reign of the skinny tired, rim-brake equipped, road-race bike is slipping as more riders are choosing bikes with concessions to comfort and control like disc brakes and wider tires. Colnago’s new C64 (the latest generation of its top-end, Italian-made carbon frame) won’t reverse the course of current trends, but it does adapt to them, and it is a reminder that a great fast, light, stiff, smooth road racing bike will always be a magical thing."
14325,RELATED: The 23 Fastest Bikes at This Year's Tour
14326,"The C64 is an extensive update (and not a complete redesign) of Colnago’s vaunted C60. Some of the C60’s shortcomings have been addressed, while its best qualities were refined and improved. We took a ride on the rim-brake version: a disc brake version is coming as well (details below)."
14327,"Like its predecessor, this is a high-end exotic you can flog. There’s a sensation of weight, stability and strength to the C64 that few other race frames have. It’s tempting to say the C64 feels like a tank, except it’s too light and quick—and too good on the climbs—for that to be an accurate descriptor. It’s a frame that thrills, and there’s a substance and safety in the C64’s ride that’s comforting. You actually feel feel every millimeter of every tube, while other high end race bikes feel more not-there than there."
14328,
14329,
14330,"That’s partly because the C64 isn’t a superlight frameset, even though it weighs about 200 grams less than the C60. The C64’s claimed frame weight is about 900 grams for the second-to smallest frame size (no paint, some hardware removed), and the fork is 355 grams. Top-end race frames from Trek, Specialized, Cervelo, Cannondale and more are 100 to 200 grams less. The complete test bike with Campagnolo Super Record mechanical drivetrain and Bora Ultra 35 tubular wheels and assorted high-end trim was 14.5 pounds (no pedals). That is certainly light, but today's bikes with disc brakes and electronic drivetrain can be almost as light."
14331,RELATED: How a Box of Old Lugs is Reviving Colnago's Arabesque
14332,"That said, it is a lot lighter than before. Weight savings were found in many areas. The downtube diameter shrinks slightly, and the dropouts are now molded with the chainstays. More weight savings were found in the seatpost and cable guides. The headset cups are made from “technopolymer” material that’s not only lighter than the C60’s aluminum cups, but is also claimed to have some shock-damping qualities. The C60’s signature interlocking “Star” tube and lug shapes are carried over, so the frame's toptube shape and size is identical to the C60, but materials and layup of all tubes and lugs were reworked. "
14333,
14334,
14335,"This weight loss is accented by small bumps in bottom bracket and front-end stiffness as well. It’s noticeable in back-to-back testing. If the C60 felt efficient and powerful, the C64 feels devastating, with the jump and reactivity that you expect from a top race bike. It leaps when called to sprint; it soars up climbs. Its modern reflexes belie its old-school construction."
14336,"The C64 affects the new-school stance as well. An internal seatpost binder gives the frame a cleaner, and more sloping look. Another modern touch is the D-shaped seatpost (it’s the same post as Colnago's V2r aero road bike) and a D-shaped upper seat tube, which is lighter and provides a small aerodynamic benefit. The cable-management system is more elegant (it’s inspired by the V2r’s system), with chips for mechanical or electronic drivetrain. Molded-in bottom bracket cable guides save weight and provide smoother shifting with mechanical drivetrains. Direct-mount brakes and changes to the fork and seatstays increase tire clearance, giving the C64 room for 28mm (and perhaps larger) tires."
14337,
14338,
14339,RELATED: First Ride Review: Colango Concept
14340,"A small relief in the downtube provides a couple advantages. It forms two ribs on the downtube which improve torsional stiffness. It also nestles the bottle cage closer to the downtube for a small aerodynamic benefit. However, we not all bottle cages fit into the relief. We had to use spacers to fill the gap, and the bottle cage effectively sat atop the downtube like normal."
14341,"The ThreadFit 82.5 bottom bracket standard that debuted with the C60 is still in use in the C64. This system employs replaceable aluminum cups that thread into the frame, and into which a BB86 bottom bracket is pressed. Colnago’s reps said that Ceramic Speed will offer aftermarket direct-fit thread in BBs for Campangolo, SRAM and Shimano cranks. Price and availability timeline were not provided"
14342,
14343,
14344,"The broad outline of the C64’s handling qualities are the same as the C60: effective geometry is almost identical. But a combination of claimed weight reductions and stiffness tweaks have slightly brightened the C64’s handling. Still, this is a frame that’s more mellow-handling than many race bikes, especially the ones from American companies. You don’t need adderall-assisted focus to ride the C64, and the thought of cross winds won’t cause involuntary eye spasms."
14345,"The steering is damped, and the bike tips into corners smoothly, before locking into a graceful arc. Mid-corner corrections require a heavy push, but even if you throw the C64 around, it's so predictable and precise, you’re more likely than not to hit a good line the first time. Erase any impression you might have, however, that the C64 is sluggish or slow handling, because it certainly is not. Rather, instead of instantaneous, no-resistance steering, the C64’s has, to recycle a word from the paragraph above, substance."
14346,
14347,
14348,"The C64 will be offered in nine sloping sizes from 42 to 60. A high-stack version with longer head tube will be offered in five sizes (48 to 56). Sorry purists, Colnago is now longer offering a traditional level toptube geometry for the C64. Custom geometry is available, however. The C64’s stock seatpost has 15mm of offset: Zero and 30mm offset posts will be offered as well."
14349,"The C64’s launch took place in Tucson, Arizona, which has its share of broken and buckled pavement, providing ample opportunity to evaluate how the C64 treats its rider. Quite well, it seems. The ride is very damped like the C60, but, living up to company representative’s claims of improved vertical compliance, C64 has a less bouncy ride. This new suppleness doesn’t make the C64 the smoothest of the smooth, but its overall comfort and bump-dissipating qualities are in the top tier of race bikes. And that impression was formed based on the ride with 25s: with 28s, the ride will be even better."
14350,
14351,
14352,"The C64 will be in Colnago dealers starting now. The frameset carries a retail price of $5,900. Four standard colors will be offered–white, red, silver, black on black—as will two of Colnago’s famous/infamous Art Decor finishes. Custom finishes are an option, but Colnago’s painters will reject a commission that doesn't fit the brand's sensibilities. Complete bikes with top-of-the line groups from Campagnolo, SRAM, and Shimano will be available in the near future, but prices have not been finalized."
14353,"A disc version of the C64 will launch in April 2018. Retail price is set at $6,100. It’s almost exactly the same bike—same geometry, same materials, very similar stiffness and vertical compliance numbers—though there are some obvious accommodations for the brakes. The disc frameset is heavier than the rim-brake frame (about 90 grams total), but has more tire clearance—officially up to 28, but in dry climates you can sneak in a 30mm. The good-idea-in-theory/pain-in the-butt-in-practice Hex-Lock axles used on the C60 have been abandoned in favor of traditional threaded thru axles."

14355,"The C64-Disc’s fork will send the front brake hose through the left fork leg. For neat freaks, Colnago will offer an aftermarket fork and stem that will allow both disc-brake hoses to be almost completely internally routed from lever to caliper for a cleaner appearance. Similar to what other bike brands have done, the fork’s steerer has a cutout to create the space for the hoses. This fork has a built-in expander plug for the headset preload cap."
14356,Specialized balances efficiency and performance in its new top-level accessories
14357,"Sometimes getting a product right is about balance. When Specialized introduced the original Evade helmet and the S-Works 6 shoe in 2015 in conjunction with the new Venge ViAS frame, the emphasis was all about making riders faster. Updates to the shoe and helmet, announced today, are an attempt to balance raw performance metrics of aerodynamics and efficient power transfer against something just as important but more subjective: comfort."
14358,"These replacements aim to improve all-around functionality, with an important caveat: improving, or at least not losing, any of those performance attributes. Did it work? We have to offer a grade of incomplete at the moment (it’s February in Colorado; not exactly sweltering test conditions), but it looks promising."
14359,RELATED: 9 of the Coolest Helmets at Sea Otter
14360,"The goal of the Evade redesign, says Chris Yu, director of integrated technologies for Specialized, was “to remove the choice of fast versus cool in hot weather.” Yu acknowledged that the Evade was too warm in some situations; in summer, it was rare to see the helmet worn by Specialized-sponsored WorldTour pro racers on anything more than a flat sprint stage."
14361,
14362,
14363,"To fix that, Specialized went back to its in-house wind tunnel for testing. That tunnel—across the street from Specialized’s HQ—is a handy tool to have; it gives Specialized the luxury of testing any number of different iterations without accounting for the cost of renting tunnel time."
14364,
14365,
14366,"There, engineers set to work testing helmet shapes with an unusual three-part plastic prototype, swapping sections with different shapes and internal channeling profiles to test airflow for aerodynamics and cooling. The top of the prototype even had a modular section to try different top vent designs."
14367,
14368,
14369,"The result: a helmet that’s slightly more aerodynamic than the original Evade, but that Specialized claims cools almost as well as its conventional road helmet, the Prevail. There’s an important caveat: that’s at speeds above the mid to high teens, said Yu. “Our main test speed for convective cooling is about 18mph,” he said. So the Prevail II still cools better in all conditions, but particularly in slower-speed situations like climbs."
14370,"Much of the other features are the same as on the Prevail II, like multi-density EPS foam and an Aramid-reinforced internal skeleton. There is no MIPS option. My limited early testing has been positive; the rear adjustment dial spins easily with one hand, the pads are soft and comfortable, and airflow seems adequate. I haven’t crash-tested it (yet) thankfully. But I also haven’t ridden it on long rides on hot days yet. Given the caveat about cooling as well at a certain speed, I suspect that the Evade II has an expanded range, but might not replace my trusty POC Octal for those big climbing days in summer."

14409,​One intrepid journalist sacrifices her hygiene for the sake of science
14410,"I have always been a bit freaked out about body odor. You know when you are on the trail and someone rides by but leaves their scent behind, as if they haven’t washed their jersey—ever?"
14411,"Turns out, it’s not always negligent laundry habits. Polyester fibers are universally loved by a certain type of bacteria, which eats sweat molecules and produces a particularly bad odor. But because polyester is also lightweight and quick to dry, many outdoor apparel companies still use it for at least a percentage of their textiles. And the stink (usually) prevails."
14412,"Enter Polygiene, an odor-control treatment added to the fabric during manufacturing, which uses low concentrations of silver salt (silver chloride) to prevent odor-causing bacteria to grow on your clothing. Originally developed in 2006 as a way to prevent contamination in hospitals, the treatment eventually crossed over to apparel. Environmentally sensitive brands like Patagonia have embraced it for its potential to conserve water by minimizing laundry cycles, and you’ll find it in everything from apparel to shoes and helmet pads."
14413,
14414,
14415,"But does it work? I picked out a polygiene-treated 100 percent polyester jersey to wear for a week, and proceeded to sacrifice my body, my hygiene, (and possibly my reputation) for the sake of journalism. The cute floral number from German brand Maloja came with a relatively casual fit, which I figured could work for multiple kinds of workouts. Stink week had begun."
14416,
14417,
14418,
14419,"On my first ride, the jersey heated up pretty fast with my body temp, but seemed to have a sort of cooling affect under my layers. Since I tested this during winter in the Canadian Rockies, wearing the jersey alone outside was out of the question, but I figured that keeping it incubated under warmer layers could only help get it stinkier. When I got home I quickly did my first sniff test. The jersey smelled a bit like curry, but a few hours later, it didn’t smell at all."
14420,"I should note that I am a big fan of curry (and ate it multiple times over the course of this test) so it didn’t really surprise me that this scent would be coming out through my sweat. Curry is one of the few strong spices that can actually change the composition of your sweat, and will remain in your pores for hours after consuming. But it seemed to be no match for Polygiene."
14421,
14422,
14423,
14424,
14425,"Over the course of the week, the weather changed to rain, and I was driven inside to the climbing gym, which I figured would be a good opportunity to produce the dreaded “fear sweat.”"
14426,"Normal, temperature-regulating sweat is produced by your eccrine glands, is composed mostly of water and salt, and isn’t typically that stinky (like the sweat from your forehead). Fear or stress sweat, on the other hand, is produced by your apocrine glands, and looks more like a milky substance. The bacteria on your skin have a big party eating it up, and you get extra-stinky (like during a job-interview or SAT test)."
14427,"But after getting what you could call scared and stressed for a few climbing sessions in a row, the jersey smelled the same as day one. I would even say that the more sweaty it got, the more neutral it smelled—when dry, that curry seemed to make a bit of a comeback."
14428,
14429,
14430,
14431,
14432,"For the grand finale of stink week I went for a hard ride on an indoor trainer—the ultimate sweat test. Without the benefit of moving air outdoors, riding the trainer almost always turns into a soggy affair. Most people wear as little clothing as possible while riding inside, but I dutifully wore my week-old jersey. After a good hour of riding, I was totally drenched, but again the sniff test still came up neutral."
14433,
14434,
14435,
14436,
14437,"For the sake of objectivity, I then had my boyfriend and a brave friend do one final sniff. My boyfriend’s comments were that it “smelled like me” (aw!). And my friend, who is decidedly not as partial to my smell, said “it did smell a little, but not bad.” She took another sniff, “not bad at all.”"
14438,
14439,
14440,
14441,
14442,"So does Polygiene really keep cycling clothes from stinking? This test says yes. When I was sweating in this jersey, it did not smell. When dry, it did tend to take on some of the odors around it, but nothing compared to your standard Polyester. I imagine I’ll have to wash it eventually, but after a week of use, it’s safe to say that I could drastically reduce my typical laundry routine. My advice? If you haven’t already, invest in a Polygiene piece or two and stop turning heads on the trail for the wrong reasons."

14444,The Specialized S-Works 7 Shoes Strike a perfect balance between comfort and performance
14445,"Specialized’s flagship shoe underwent a similar redesign to the brand's helmet for 2018, focusing on a middle ground between performance and comfort. Andy Pruitt, founder of the Boulder Center for Sports Medicine and creator of Specialized’s Body Geometry program, said that the central focus for cycling shoes for years has been trying to stabilize the foot and attach it to the pedal in a way that minimizes side-to-side knee tracking, while generating maximum power."
14446,RELATED: The Most Common Causes of Knee Pain While Cycling
14447,"“The challenge is taking the foot, which is a dynamic structure with arch flex and energy return, and turning that into a rigid lever,” he said. “That’s a pretty hard thing to do.”"
14448,"With the S-Works 6, Specialized got as close to that as it’s ever gotten but, as Pruitt acknowledged, it came at some cost of rider comfort. Specialized used Dyneema—a high-strength, non-stretch polyethylene fiber used in products ranging from parachutes to rock climbing equipment—to create an upper that would securely hold the foot to the sole plate. An aggressively shaped heel cup prevented heel lift under hard efforts."
14449,"It worked, but many riders found the upper to be overly stiff and thought it took too long to break in, while the heel cup sometimes caused hot spots and blisters."
14450,"To fix that, Specialized adjusted the shape of the shoe last for the S-Works 7, altered the heel cup slightly, redesigned the tongue, and changed materials in the upper. They also added new, custom Boa closure dials and re-engineered the outsole."
14451,
14452,
14453,"The new last is essentially a middle ground between the S-Works 5 and 6 versions. It’s medium width, medium volume (there are narrow- and wide-last variants, in black only), with slightly more room on the outside of the little toe to prevent pressure, and a slightly more snug wrap around the instep for support."
14454,"The heel cup is still molded for an aggressive hold, but the shape doesn’t pinch quite as firmly. To re-engineer the sole, Specialized used a software technology called topology optimization, which analyzes the force and pressure on a sole while pedaling to adjust the carbon layup and thickness. Where the old sole had only gradually varying thicknesses, the sole on the S-Works 7 has two medium-sized divots behind the cleat, which help the sole remain stiff at the point of power transfer while allowing some even flex to avoid hot spots. The three-bolt cleat attachments feature 5mm of fore-aft adjustment."
14455,
14456,
14457,"The S-Works 6 used Dyneema fabric laminated to a thermoplastic polyurethane base (think of it as flexible rubber). The result was a powerful connection to the pedal, but a relatively stiff body that took a long time to break in."
14458,
14459,
14460,"The S-Works 7 mitigates that by bonding the Dyneema between two layers of stretch mesh. The outer layer has a TPU coating, but nothing as thick as the old version. The orientation of the Dyneema fiber still ensures the upper doesn’t stretch vertically, but does have some give fore-aft along the footbed, and is far more supple. And Specialized worked with Boa to create a slick-looking closure reel, which features upgraded, dirt-resistant internals, 1mm micro-click adjustments and knurled aluminum dials. It’s exclusive to this shoe."
14461,"The shoe comes with Specialized’s Body Geometry insole, and as an aftermarket upgrade, Specialized now offers semi-customizeable insoles through dealers that work with its Retül fit service. The insoles, which are from snowsports company MasterFit, use a heat-molded thermoplastic in the heel and arch area that is shaped to your foot. They’ll retail for $100."
14462,RELATED: The Best Shoes of 2018
14463,"I’ve spent about a dozen hours in the new shoes so far, both with the MasterFit footbeds and my own custom footbeds. I never spent time in the S-Works 6 shoe (I gathered test impressions from staffers at Bicycling who had), but one pair of the S-Works 5 has been my “daily driver” for five years and ranks, for me, as the best shoe I’ve ever used, by a nose over the Giro Factor."
14464,"The S-Works 7 shoes aren’t fully broken in yet, and on the left shoe in particular the tongue needs some more time to adjust to my foot. But the rest of the shoe has been remarkably comfortable right away. The heel hold is noticeable, but not intrusive, and hasn’t resulted in any irritation. And the Dyneema section of the upper feels remarkably like the synthetic leather on the S-Works 5: supple and supportive without hot spots. Because of the Dyneema, I find I’m not cranking the Boa closures down as much; I can achieve a secure hold with less pressure."
14465,"Time is the test for all shoes, of course, and we’ll have a long-term review update later this spring. And, these are among the priciest road shoes you’ll find, if still below the eye-popping tag on Sidi’s Shot Vent Carbon, for example. In other words: for this price, they should kick ass. But I’m cautiously optimistic, and if I got five years out of my old shoes (still going strong with a $16 set of replacement Boa dials), then these should offer at least as much service life."

"
14480,"Look, I'm sorry that Canyon bikes, like this second-generation Aeroad, keep showing up in the magazine even though they're not available in the biggest market we serve, the US. But I think people should know about these bikes. They're that good."
14481,"The Aeroad looks all kinds of badass. It looks uncompromising and mean. But damn, is it smooth and delightful. It's an aero bike, but it's aero 2.0, with stiffness in the right places for responsive pedaling and precise cornering, and a pleasurable and rewarding ride. It feels slippery, though I doubt it's in the same category as the Cervelo S5, and there's no comparative wind-tunnel data from Canyon. The company does say this frameset saves 13.5 watts at 45kph compared with the previous version."
14482,"The direct-mount brakes stop well, are not in a weird spot (yay!), and allow the bike to accept up to a 25mm tire. The biggest letdowns are the Mavic wheels: They feel heavier and seem more flexible than average, and the tires cut and flat if you look at them wrong.—Matt Phillips"
14483,
14484,
14485,"I don't typically like aero bikes or find them fun to ride. But the Canyon Aeroad felt like a road-race bike. The road feel is a little on the aggressive side, but not harsh; more firm and planted. It tracks wonderful arcs on descents and is comfortable for a bike of this caliber. The finish is a nice departure, too; to someone who's tired of flashy aero bikes, this one looks classy. When I took it out, people asked about it.—Brad Ford"
14486,"The steering is nimble, precise, and on the faster end of the spectrum, but easy to get in sync with. Pedaling pickup is quick, with no lag or loss of power. The one-piece bar/stem is comfortable and provides plenty of usable hand positions, and the hidden cabling and Di2 box tucked into the stem are nice nods to small aerodynamic gains. However—this is nitpicky—I did find it difficult to access the interface box to charge or make derailleur adjustments when swapping wheels. This bike feels fast. That is subjective, but if a bike feels fast, chances are it is, even if that's only because it gives you a mental edge.—Mike Yozell"
14487,"This trail 29er hits the sweet spot between a steep XC bike and a slack, big-travel trail model
"
14488,It's fitting that I became obsessed with a bike called The Following.
14489,"On paper, it was a recipe for 29er bliss: a beefy, full-carbon frame; low, slack geometry that could be made even more relaxed with an adjustable system; 120mm of rear-wheel travel. With each sentence I read, my fascination grew. 29ers have mostly been either steep-angled, short-travel XC race bikes or slack-angled bikes with 140mm of travel or more. I've always dreamed of something in between, with less travel and a more relaxed stance."
14490,"The Seattle-based Evil brand may be unfamiliar to some readers, but those who really know mountain biking will recognize the name of the founder, suspension guru Dave Weagle, of DW-Link and Split Pivot fame, who sold Evil to Kevin Walsh in 2008. After years of downhill focus, Evil launched two trail bikes: The Uprising and The Following."
14491,
14492,"The suspension is a basic, single-pivot design attached to Weagle's somewhat complex, patented Delta rocker link. As if straight out of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, ""Delta"" is an acronym for Dave's Extra Legitimate Travel Apparatus. Its signature feature: high and low ""flip chips,"" which allow you to change the bottom-bracket height, head angle, and seat angle. An optional headset offers an additional degree of head-angle adjustment."
14493,"Given Evil's downhill roots, it's not surprising that The Following has a gravity-focused character. The frame comes with a custom-tuned RockShox Monarch RT3 Debonair shock, and I built my tester with a 130mm-travel Fox 36 fork, giving the bike a head angle of 66.8 degrees in the low chip setting. Because of this geometry, I expected it to be stable and perhaps a bit sluggish in terms of handling, but The Following was agile, easily switching tracks midcorner and cutting to the inside line. A day at Mammoth Mountain highlighted its cornering ability, where the bike railed around soft turns as it would on hardpack, drawing smooth arcs with little effort from me."
14494,"I had no problem keeping up with other riders of equal ability on bikes with up to 160mm of travel. Sure, there were situations—like when the trail got really chunky—in which more travel would have been better and faster, but I was more often surprised by what the bike could take than what it couldn't. The progressive ramp makes the suspension ultra-supple at the beginning of the travel for superb traction, but then it gets stiffer, holding up through the stroke. The bike rocketed out of banked corners and g-outs without sinking too far into its travel. And all that extra pop revived my love for catching air on Mammoth's jump trails."
14495,"The Following can climb, too—though more thanks to technical prowess than raw speed. I'd get to a stepped ledge that was spaced just right to hang up the front and rear wheels at the same time, think, there's no way I'll clean it, then go up and over like it was nothing. It also pedals well; I could keep the shock open all the time, to react to bumps and lend extra traction."
14496,"The seat angle gets as slack as 72.1 degrees in its low setting with a 130mm fork. With my relatively short thighs, this put me far enough behind the bottom bracket that I had to ride the nose of the saddle on steep climbs. But test riders with average leg-length proportions didn't have this issue, and I eventually found a great fit using the high chip setting, a 120mmtravel fork, and the one-degree slacker headset option to keep a 66.8-degree head angle."
14497,"It's silly, but I've held a little resentment for 27.5-inch-wheel bikes, not because I don't like riding them, but because the 27.5 craze slowed 29er progression so that the trail bike I always wanted never materialized. Until now. Even with my expectations so high, The Following delivered. It's proven to be one of the most compelling and fun trail bikes I've ridden, regardless of wheel size."

14500,"These convenient and compact bikes make travel, commutes, and life easier."
14501,"Foldable bikes are a versatile and often-overlooked cycling option. Maybe your studio apartment has limited storage place, or perhaps your commute involves a train, several flights of steps, and a crowded elevator. A foldable bike is a cycling problem-solver and a bundle of fun packed into a small and convenient package. From lightweight singlespeeds and cruisers to bikes with electric-assist motors, there is likely a foldable bike out there to suit your cycling needs.  "
14502,"Consider wheel size when looking for your ideal folding bike. It makes a difference in the folded size as well as what kind of terrain the bike is best suited to. Most folding bikes use 20-inch wheels to ensure they fold down to a manageable size and stay relatively light when commuting or traveling on public transport. If you plan on riding longer distances, 700c wheels will offer a smooth ride and maximize your pedaling input—but at the expense of a smaller size when folded down, and a lower weight. Alternatively, a folding e-bike offers some pedal assist to save energy and make sure you don’t show up to work with sweaty clothes. If you plan to ride off-road, then a folding fat bike with 4-inch tires can smooth out a bumpy trail."
14503,
14504,
14505,"As folding bikes get more expensive, their overall weight typically goes down due to higher-quality parts and lighter frame materials, such as carbon fiber and titanium. If you climb stairs more often than you climb hills, opt for a singlespeed or a model with fewer gears, which can shave even more weight."
14506,"Consider how quickly and easily the bike folds down, especially if you’re the type who dawdles and gets to the train at the last minute."
14507,Most of these bikes come as “one size fits all” with a lot of adjustability as you unfold them. Check for quick-release levers or simple adjustments so that the bike fits and rides well. A model with a lot of versatility may even be suitable for more than one member of your family.  
14508,"Most electric folding-bike options come with a 250-watt motor and enough torque for safe but fast acceleration. The higher the torque, the faster the acceleration and the more powerful the bike will feel. Most folding e-bikes are Class 1, meaning they top out at 20 mph and are acceptable on bike paths. If you encounter several flights of steps during the course of an average day, keep in mind that a battery and motor add to the bike’s overall weight. "

14510,A made-to-order model with lots of build options
14511,
14512,
14513,"Brompton has become the standard for foldable bikes, which it builds to order in its London, UK, factory. The brand offers a variety of drivetrain setups, color schemes, and handlebar shapes. There’s also a full lineup of luggage systems.  The M6L features a six-speed drivetrain and an upright u-shaped handlebar for all-around riding comfort. The steel frame is hand-brazed and ready to ride in wet weather, thanks to full-coverage fenders. You can also order a custom-built Brompton with your choice of colors and components."
14514,Ideal for storing in your car or RV for spontaneous adventures
14515,
14516,"There are three versions of the Adapt, with 1 being the most affordable. The main difference between the three is the derailleur and number of speeds. This model has a 7-speed Shimano Tourney derailleur with Shimano Revo Twist Shifters. It includes fenders to keep the spray off your back and a rear rack for carrying small loads. At 32 pounds, it’s not the lightest option in our list, so it’s more suited to someone whose day isn’t connected by multiple modes of transportation. It comes with a nylon bag for storing."
14517,A foldable e-cargo model that can carry up to 400 poundsFull Review
14518,
14519,"The Tern GSD is a full-featured e-cargo bike in a foldable, easy-to-store package. An electric-assist motor from Bosch helps speed you on your way and propel the loaded bike uphill. Buy groceries, pick up the kids from school—the GSD accommodates two Thule Yepp Maxi child seats—or haul large objects with ease.  The Tern GSD is designed to carry up to 400 pounds, while keeping its footprint the same as a standard e-bike. A step-through frame adds to the versatility and ease of use, especially for smaller riders, and a slightly longer wheelbase increases stability. Magura disc brakes provide confident stopping power, even when the bike is loaded. Tern also offers an assortment of accessories to customize your ride.  "
14520,Probably the fastest nonmotorized bike on this list 
14521,"With aero wheels, a drop handlebar, a Shimano Ultegra derailleur, a 2x9 drivetrain, and a 9-26t sprocket, the Verge feels more like a road bike than a folding model. It’s ideal for riders who want to put the hammer down on commutes, but don’t have the space to store a more traditional road bike. It weighs only 23 pounds and can be folded in about 30 seconds."
14522,A fat/cargo/folding e-bike with something for everyoneFull Review
14523,"The Rad Power RadMini is a lot to take in. It’s an electric-assist bike, a cargo bike, and a folding bike—with 4-inch-wide tires that would make a Lunar Rover jealous. It sounds like a bike for a niche sliced as thin as graphene, but the RadMini has something for everyone: hunters who need a convenient way in and out of the woods (and a bike that’s easy to conceal), anyone who wants in on the e-bike action but is limited on space, and RVers who want something they can use to zip around the campsite. This Class 2 e-bike top outs at 20 mph and has both pedal assist and a throttle. "
14524,Unfolds to become a full-size bike with 700c wheels Price: $900 Buy Now
14525,"Unfolded, the Montague Navigator becomes a full-size bike with 700c wheels designed for all-purpose riding. It comes with a Shimano 3x9 drivetrain and disc brakes for powerful stopping power. Wide, 35mm tires are ready for gravel detours, and an aluminum frame keeps the weight down.  The rack and fenders make the Navigator a solid choice for daily commuting or light touring. The Octagon stem is also adjustable without tools, so it’s easy to dial in a comfortable fit. At 29 pounds, the Navigator is a bit less portable than some other folding options, but the full-size wheels make it a great choice for longer rides and commutes."
14526,A drag racer for cyclists who don't have a throttle
14527,"At 38 pounds, the Vika is among the smaller and lighter folding e-bikes out there—and much like its fellow 16-inch-wheeled colleague, the Brompton, the aluminum alloy bike is powered by a 250w front hub motor. Included with the motor and electric system are four levels of pedal assist and a throttle mode for burning rubber in the bike lane (well, up to 17mph), all of which can be controlled by an LCD display that shows your speed, range, trip meter, and odometer. The battery has a range of up to 30 miles. As for the non-electric components of the bike, 7-speed Shimano Acera gearing gives you everything you need to keep pedaling with the e-assist turned off, with Tektro V brakes for stopping. Ultimately, it’s a pretty great bargain for a fast-folding bike that packs down smaller than most e-folding bikes. Plus, the entire bike also comes with a canvas carry bag so you can tote it around easily when not in use."
14528,"Light (the lightest on our list) and compact (fits into a backpack)Price: $1,270 Buy Now "
14529,"The PakIt is one of the lighter folding options out there. According to Bike Friday, it weighs just 15 pounds and can fit into a backpack for easy carry. The PakIt is built with 16-inch wheels to help keep it compact. Choose from a variety of builds and five colors or upgrade to the Elite Custom build and choose from 20 colors. Bike Friday’s size range should accommodate riders from 4-foot-5 to 6-foot-3. Bike Friday also offers three belt-drive options, which are easy to maintain and great for keeping the grease off your pant legs. Add an electric-assist motor for easy climbing. Builds start at $1,019."
14530,Comes with a host of practical additions that add to an already solid build 
14531,
14532,
14533," The ExpressWay is Giant’s entry into the folding-bike world, and it comes with a solid selection of parts and a host of add-ons that don’t come on some of the bikes on this list. It has a light, aluminum frame with 20-inch wheels that roll fast and smooth out the ride on bumpy city streets. The wide-range, 8-speed drivetrain will get you over hills and goes fast enough to keep up with traffic. To make sure it’s as practical as a commuter bike should be, it comes with a rack with a strap, fenders to keep you clean and dry, a kickstand, and a storage bag to make it easier to carry and stow. We love Giant for its quality builds and great value, and this expressway is no exception.   "
14534,"Easy to fold and unfold, and ready for any type of transport"
14535,"One of the cheaper options on our list, the Mariner 8 is an aluminum folding bike with 20-inch wheels, a steel fork, and an 8-speed Shimano drivetrain. A telescoping handle and seatpost, foldable pedals, a forged hinge on the frame, and Fusion technology on the stem make the Mariner D8 a breeze to fold and unfold. Dahon claims the Mariner D8 is its most popular and an ideal companion for multi-modal—train, bus, boat—transport. Claimed weight is 28 pounds."
14536,A Brompton but with added capacity for distance and cargo 
14537,"The folding bike with the cult following (check out #bromptonmafia on Instagram) got a motor this year, adding even more capacity for distance and cargo to an already ultra-practical bike. We’ve long loved Bromptons for being one of the only folding bikes that can fit in an airplane overhead compartment; the electric iteration of the 16-inch-wheeled bike still folds to the same small dimensions but adds a custom-developed 250W front-hub motor with a removable 300Wh battery pack that offers a riding range of 25 to 50 miles between charges. Available in a two- or six-speed model, the bike shifts and accelerates smoothly with or without the e-assist. Although the motor and battery do add weight for when you have to haul the bike up stairs, at 35 to 37 pounds (including the battery), this is still one of the lighter e-folding bikes. The e-assist tops out at 15.5 mph."
14538,Fits into an airline-friendly case and weighs just 20 pounds
14539,"The Burke 20 from Seattle Cycles is a perfect urban-riding companion and bike for frequent flyers. It can be folded—no tools or disassembly required—to fit it into an airline-friendly case in one minute.  Based on our experience with folding bikes, the Burke 20 will probably take some practice to hit that mark, but to make it easier, it has quick-release flat pedals that can be removed in seconds. And at just 20 pounds (without saddle), it’s easier than most to carry up a flight or two of stairs. Seattle Cycles also offers an electric version of the Burke 20 as well as versions with 8- and 16-inch wheels."
14540,An e-assist model that gets you to the top of climbs fasterFull Review
14541,"The 2019 Tern Vektron S10 improves upon the original’s über-compact folding design with more power and a bigger rack. The Bosch Active Plus motor delivers 25 percent more torque to help you conquer hills on the nearly 50-pound bike, and the 10-speed Shimano Deore drivetrain gives you options when you’re pushing more of the weight in Eco mode. Tern uses 20-inch wheels to position the weight lower to the ground and keep the bike from becoming top-heavy while hauling cargo on the integrated rear rack, which is now longer and lower, thanks to a diagonally mounted battery. It’s a bike that disguises its heft well and folds up to stand on its rear end for a portable package that goes wherever you do. "
14542,A nimble folding bike that’s half titanium/half steel 
14543,
14544,
14545,Comes with an optional suitcase-style carry bag
14546," With an aluminum frame atop 16-inch wheels, the Rome weighs only 20 pounds, making it an ideal travel companion. The singlespeed belt drive means no fuss and no mess, and it doesn’t require any tools to fold, so it can be quickly stored away. Citizen offers the Rome as a base model with a ton of add-ons at the time of purchase. You can buy a folding basket for $40, a wireless computer for $27, or a quick-release rear rack for $40. If you want to fly with your bike, the airline-friendly travel suitcase fits the Rome perfectly, weighs only 30 pounds with the bike inside, and costs $70. "

There are sealed pockets for your phone and other valuables, and a fit that's made for pedaling while providing more coverage than a lot of cycling rain jackets. "

14555,"This svelte little bag solves a lot of problems for bike commuters. It sits above your top tube and attaches to your frame with three secure straps. That position provides easy access when you’re stopped at a light or pull off the road. There’s room for a tube, small pump or CO2 canister, ride snacks, and other essentials. The top has a see-through pocket for you phone so you can navigate, check your speed, and thumb through your IG feed right from the saddle. "

It was a groundbreaking product that could be seen from a mile away even in noon-time glare. And its small size, easy attachment system, and relatively low cost made it an easy add-on for most bikes. It wasn’t perfect, but it was damn good. The new version is even better. It’s brighter, has better water proofing, uses a sensor to automatically adjust brightness based on conditions, and will pair with a Garmin and Bontrager Ant + devices for wireless control. "

And it brings that same attention to detail to this all-conditions commuter backpack for riders who’d rather carry gear over their shoulders than over the rack of their bike. It’s made of polyurethane-coated Nylon to keep rain out, and the roll-top closure (just like the bags white water rafters use) will keep water from sneaking in through the top. There are loops to attach LED lights and bike locks, and a purposeful style won’t look out of place whether you’re wearing a blazer or cutoffs for your cross-town commute."

14629,A recall of nearly 1.5 million quick releases that could jam into disc-brake rotors when improperly used has brought lots of attention to an important bike part that usually receives little notice.
14630,"Sure, if your bike has the faulty quick releases you will be issued new ones—but now is a great time to talk about what defines a great quick release, and share a few of our favorites."
14631,     RELATED: Massive Quick Release Recall Expanded
14632,Anatomy of a Good Quick Release
14633,
14634,
14635,"Internal Cam
	Though heavier, the internal cam design is less likely to get contaminated than an external cam. A gritty cam is less smooth and reduces clamping force."
14636,
14637,
14638,"Serrations
	Look for good toothy serrations on both the lever side and adjusting nut. Steel serrations are the best, particularly if the wheel is being clamped into a metal frame. Aluminum serrations aren’t worth much if they’re trying to bite into steel, which is harder than aluminum. To save weight, some QRs use a pressed-on, serrated-steel ring, or a small serrated adjusting nut topped with an aluminum cover."
14639,"Long and Wide Lever
	Nothing radical here; it just makes the lever easier to use. Length increases leverage, and a wide lever is nicer to your hands."
14640,"Steel Skewer
	When you’re talking about the thing holding your wheel in your frame, you want stiff and you want strong. That’s steel. Titanium makes a fine material for a skewer, but it’s generally used for QRs designed to be very light. That means a smaller diameter skewer, and an external cam."
14641,"Big Skewers
	Get the biggest skewer that will fit through a hub. That’s generally a touch under five millimeters."
14642,RELATED: The Right Way to Use a Quick Release
14643,A Few of our Favorite Quick Releases
14644,"We checked, and all of the QRs below pass the “#2 pencil test” described in the quick release recall. However, you should always check for yourself that the skewers on your bike are safe."
14645,
14646,
14647,"Shimano Dura Ace 9000
	If we were to recommend just one quick release, the Dura Ace 9000 would be it. It has all the stuff in our anatomy list above, including steel serrations on the adjusting nut, and the smoothest, best-working internal cam around. These particular QRs cost about $100 a pair. The Shimano Ultegra 6800 QRs are almost as good and will run you around $40 per pair."
14648,
14649,
14650,"Campagnolo
	Tullio Campagnolo is credited with inventing the internal cam quick release, and the company continues to make a fine one with all the features we like. This one comes with its higher-end wheels. It is also sold aftermarket, though at a premium price—about $120 a set—while a lower-end version is available for $100. A similar quick release is also offered with Fulcrum branding."

It also has captured springs, so it won’t fall on the floor when the QRs are pulled from the hubs. A new, sleeker-looking Bontrager internal-cam QR will be unveiled soon. They currently cost about $40 a set."

14655,"Shimano released an update to its top-end mechanical road group in June. (For a detailed rundown on what’s new, you can read our post from the launch.) This week, we got a first ride on the rim-brake groupset from Las Vegas to the Outdoor Demo at Interbike in Boulder City, Nevada. (To keep up with the latest gear & tech news coming out in the bicycling world, be sure to subscribe!)"
14656,"I’ve been riding the Dura-Ace 9000 mechanical group on my personal road bike for the past several months. R9100 is largely a refinement rather than an overhaul, so unsurprisingly, the new group feels very similar to the 9000 group I’ve come to know well. But there are some differences."
14657,         RELATED: Shimano's Dura-Ace 9000 Groupset
14658,"For starters, both front and rear derailleurs are new. The front derailleur has been redesigned into a smaller form, in part to provide more tire clearance and to tuck the cable away. It also has an integrated adjuster for cable tension, taking the place of the traditional dial adjuster. The rear derailleur borrows Shimano’s Shadow technology from the mountain bike world, bringing it further inward under the cassette for protection in the event of a hit or crash, and to improve shifting performance. It also has a longer cage to accommodate anything from an 11-23 to 11-30 cassette, allowing the rider to change cassettes for different rides or races without swapping derailleurs."
14659,"With two new derailleurs, it’s remarkable that R9100 still shifts very similarly to 9000. But as before, it's smooth, precise, and quiet. Shimano said shifting in the front should require slightly less effort, and it does, which I particularly noticed when shifting from the small to the big ring. Our other test rider noted and liked that all of the paddles required slightly less throw."

14663,"The new group also received textured hood covers, and slightly different shaping. The difference is subtle, but generally made the bar feel a little more supportive on my palms when I had my hands behinds the hoods, and provided good additional grip for riding gloveless. (It was a cool day, so I didn’t get to see how they felt when my hands got a little sweaty.)"
14664,         RELATED: How to Keep Your Hands Pain-Free on a Ride
14665,"There was no steep climbing on our test ride, but where there was some gradual ascending, the 30-tooth cog on the new 11-30 cassette made it a little easier to spin uphill than the 11-28 I usually ride. The ratio increase compared to the 11-28 is subtle but there—yet small enough that I would be happy riding the 11-30 as my everyday cassette."
14666,"The brakes received longer arms so that they now officially fit up to 28mm tires (if your frame will clear them), and Shimano says the calipers are stiffer, too. I was impressed by the power of the R9100 rim brakes. Particularly when I was coming to a quick stop, they had enough additional bite compared to my 9000 rim brakes that I felt myself adjusting how hard I pulled on the levers. While I’d like to ride them more and on carbon rims (we were riding aluminum), the initial impression from our 18-mile ride is that this is one of the quickest-stopping rim brakes I’ve ridden."
14667,"Of course, we’re also eager to try the new Dura-Ace R9100 hydraulic disc brakes and the Di2 group, and to get a version in for long-term testing. Look for a full review in the coming months on Bicycling.com."

14670,"Blurring the lines between road racing and the current crop of adventure bikes, the Synapse has been Cannondale’s endurance model since its introduction in 2002. The latest generation of Synapse models offers generous tire clearance (up to 32mm) and modern flat-mount disc brakes on a new frame that was redesigned for the 2018 models. This is a go-anywhere bike that is able to tackle dirt roads, light singletrack, and faster group rides. It’s at home in races, too, especially those with rough roads. Some Cannondale professional riders will choose the Synapse for racing in the spring Classics. "
14671,What’s New for 2018?
14672,"For 2018, Cannondale went all in with disc brakes. The new-for-2018 frame shaves a claimed 220 grams by optimizing material placement, refining tube shapes, and further integrating the mounts for disc brakes to take up less real estate. The 2018 Synapses also feature size-specific design to optimize tube diameters and use three different offsets to ensure the same ride characteristic across the seven sizes (44cm to 61cm). Only one model, the Synapse Carbon 105, uses the previous-generation frame and will be available with rim brakes."
14673,"All disc-equipped Synapse bikes use the newer flat-mount disc-brake standard, which results is a lighter frame and a more compact and lighter brake caliper."
14674,"There Is a Synapse Road Bike for EveryoneThe 15-bike family features both budget-friendly entry-level models with simple-to-shift, single-ring drivetrains and high-end race bikes with electronic drivetrains. The Synapse comes in several frame options: four aluminum, seven carbon, and three high-end, Hi-Mod carbon models that are lighter and stiffer. Prices start at $1,000 for the aluminum Synapse Disc Sora, jump to $2,000 for the Synapse Carbon 105 (the least-expensive carbon option), and top out at  $10,000 for the Synapse Hi-mod Dura-Ace Di2. All carbon models have the same geometry and size-specific carbon-fiber layups to offer a similar ride across frame sizes.  "

14676,"The Synapse SAVE SuspensionThe SAVE micro suspension allows for up to 3mm of deflection at the hubs to help smooth the ride and add comfort. Additional seated comfort comes from a smaller-than-normal 25.4mm-diameter seatpost that flexes more than posts with larger diameters. This bike can be ridden hard and fast in any weather, so we appreciate the removable bridge on the rear of the frame that gives you the ability to install fenders—and that leaves the bike looking clean when you don't. Like a lot of companies producing modern road bikes, Cannondale routes cables and electronic wires inside the frame for a clean look."
14677,Cannondale Strives to Make the Synapse Fit You Better
14678,"The Synapses' taller head tubes and and relaxed geometry combine for a ride that is stable and comfortable over rougher ground. Those relaxed angles (it’s not a comfort bike by any means, just a little more upright than a nose-to-the-stem dedicated race machine) extend to the wheelbase, which is longer than the company’s Supersix and CAAD race bikes, to increase stability. "
14679,"Along with the size-specific tubing profiles, Cannondale uses three different fork offsets and steerer diameters to ensure every-size rider gets the same ride feel. For more performance-oriented riders looking for a slightly more aggressive position, a lower top cap and different stem will easily accommodate any changes to position. The aluminum bikes have geometry similar to the carbon option, but the chainstays are 3mm longer. "
14680,2018 Synapse Gets a Performance Edge
14681,"Started as an accessory and bag maker in Wilton, Connecticut, Cannondale has been at the forefront of bicycle design for decades, starting with some of the first mass-produced, oversize aluminum frames in the mid-'80s. The company produces bicycles in a wide range of styles, including road, mountain, hybrid, and children's models. The Synapse was introduced in 2002 and was Cannondale's first all-carbon model. SAVE has been a key feature of the bike since its inception. The early model used flattened stays to dampen the ride; newer versions included longer strands of carbon to provide damping without reducing stiffness. That gives the latest models a performance edge that was missing from the first Synapses. "
14682,This Endurance Bike Delivers on the Road and Off
14683,"We tested the bike on paved and dirt roads, and the occasional singletrack, around our offices. The ride is comfortable thanks to built-in SAVE micro suspension. While not an active suspension, SAVE takes the edge off rough roads and gives the bike a pleasant demeanor off-piste. Steering is very neutral, and the taller head tube puts the rider in an upright position, good for eying the road ahead. No matter the terrain we hit, the steering remained light and friendly. It was easy to hold any line. "
14684,"The ability to take 30mm tires meant a simple change of air pressure was all it took to transform the bike between surfaces. During those times when we hit gravel tracks for most of the day, a simple swap of tires on the tubeless-ready WTB rims offered up better durability and more confidence. Given the Synapse's versatility, blend of comfort and performance, and wide range of models in the line, it’s easy to understand why it's one of the better endurance bikes we’ve tested. "

When I noticed aspens in my yard turning yellow, I called in the Jamis Supernova Elite."

From my house at 6,500 feet, I can ride over an 11,000-foot pass and down again, through variable temperatures and weather conditions. A base layer prevents me from getting waterlogged on the way up and goosebumps on the way down. Lycra jerseys tend to trap moisture; a base layer lifts the clammy fabric off my skin so I stay dry and happy. Beyond moisture management, a base layer has a few other comfort-related perks. It buffers against itchy seams and bib straps that chafe and renders a see-through jersey opaque. I’ll admit that in extreme heat I do forgo one. But on most rides, the right base layer makes this sweat-prone rider a lot more likely to keep pedaling. Here are eight that we recommend."

14785,"Women looking for a capable, lower-cost bike to ride hard, catch big air, and even hit the downhill bike park can make all their badass dreams come true with the Diamondback Clutch. The Clutch is a versatile, mid-travel trail bike designed around Diamondback’s Level Link suspension, with 130mm of rear travel and a 150mm fork. With the same frame geometry (and frame) as the men’s Release model, the Clutch has the current long, low, slack layout typical of other bikes with similar travel and intended use. Shock tune and touch points (grips, crank length, and saddle) are geared toward smaller, lighter riders. Both the Clutch 1 and 2 promise stable pedaling, minimal pedal feedback, capability on big hits, and excellent small-bump compliance. Both models are a great choice for women who are looking to hit aggressive trails and get rowdy."
14786," A Women’s Bike, Built Around a New Suspension Platform"
14787,"The Clutch uses Diamondback’s four-bar Level Link suspension system, which is designed to be more stable under pedal pressure while you climb but able to activate quickly when you hit bumpy terrain. Level Link consists of two counter-rotating links that create a floating instant center, with the lower link sitting inline with the chain and perpendicular to the lower link at sag—a feature Diamondback says lets bump forces activate the suspension and overcome pedaling forces for better traction and control while pedaling. Largely due to this design, we included the Release 4c Carbon and the Clutch 1 on our Best Mountain Bikes lists. "
14788,
14789,
14790,“Long and Low” Geometry 
14791,"The Clutch is designed to have a shorter rear and longer cockpit to move your weight back and give you more power and control through corners and a planted feel on descents. And unlike the Release (the men's version), the Clutch is offered in a size XS, for riders between 5- and 5-foot-3. Other differences include: a WTB Deva saddle, a slightly narrower bar (760mm), a shorter stem (35mm), and 170mm cranks (on the XS and small sizes; medium and large get 175mm). "
14792, What’s the Reach?
14793,"The alloy-frame Clutch models have fairly standard head-tube lengths and reasonably long reach. The bottom bracket is on the low side, with a 14mm drop, and the head and seat angles are 66 and 73 degrees respectively. What this means to the rider is that it will put you in a centered position over the bike that supports hard carving in fast turns and G-outs, plus stability at high speed over uneven terrain. The seat angle places the rider over the cranks for good climbing prowess and keeps the saddle in a position so it's easy to get over the back of the bike on steep descents, dropper post or not. All models include a 760mm handlebar and a 35mm stem, which keeps steering on the nimble side while taking into account the slighter build of the intended user. As a bonus, the narrower bar will fit through smaller gaps in tight trails. "

Paired with a wide-range 1x11 GX drivetrain (with a RaceFace Aeffect alloy crank), this bike has the oomph to get you to the top of any climb. Stopping power comes courtesy of SRAM Level T hydraulic disc brakes with a smart spec of 180mm rotors front and rear. The Clutch 1 is similarly spec’d with RockShox Monarch DebonAir R shock and Yari RC fork. The drivetrain on the Clutch 1 swaps to full SRAM NX components and Level brakes, which gives up a few grams but shares the same crisp braking and shifting as well as a wide, 11-42-tooth 11-speed cassette. Other details we like: the KS Lev Integra dropper post on the Clutch 2 and aggressive Schwalbe Hans Dampf tubeless tires of both models.  "
14798, More About This Trail Bike
14799,"The two bikes in the Clutch line range in size from XS to L and fit riders between 5 feet and 6-foot-2 (the Release is offered in S to XL and fits riders up to 6-foot-6). Although the Clutch 1 and 2 share the same frame, the difference will be found in the components. Even the weights are similar—the Clutch 1 is 31.7 lb. (claimed); the Clutch 2 is 31.2 lb. (claimed). But take into account that the lower-priced Clutch 1 doesn’t come equipped with a dropper post, something we think is a necessity on this type of bike (or any mountain bike, really.)

14820,"When you’re shopping for a winter jacket, there are a number of things to consider before choosing the one that’s best for you: namely insulation, water resistance, wind protection, and features (like zippers and pockets). Whether you need a new one for the last month of winter, or looking to grab a deal to prepare for next year, these are you top options (with some expert advice on how to find the right one for you)."
14821,"How much you love a winter jacket will likely depend on several factors: how well it fits, how well it keeps you warm, how well it keeps you dry, and how well it breathes. The last one is maybe the trickiest, and hardest to get right. "
14822,"Breathability is a measure of how much moisture a membrane can transport. Moisture here means sweat, and if your cozy winter jacket doesn’t breathe, you’ll be drenched in the stuff during hard efforts, making you feel cold. The best jackets let a lot of moisture escape without allowing too much cold air or moisture in. But you’ll pay more for them. "
14823,"Waterproof and water resistant and different points on the same continuum, and what you want varies by how you’ll use it. According to Rob Pickels M.S. a physiologist working on Pearl Izumi’s Advanced Concepts team, you don't actually want a waterproof jacket for most cycling because, along with keeping the rain out, it will likely keep all of your sweat in. The result: a soaking wet rider. Most manufactures use a scale to show how much water a garment will keep out. Pickels suggests a jacket with a breathability rating of 5,000 grams per square meter is good enough for most of the rainy weather that you are likely to ride in, while 10,000 will handle just about any deluge you’d reasonably encounter."
14824,"Think about the type of riding you do (and the type of rider you are). If most of your winter riding consists of moderately paced commutes or leisurely rides on bike paths, you’ll need a jacket with more insulation because you won’t be sweating too much. If you know you’ll be working hard and pushing yourself into the upper zones of your heart rate, though, you might want to opt for something close-fitting and minimalist, with windproof panels and good ventilation. "
14825,"Of course, there’s more to how well a jacket functions than fit and fabric alone. Features count, too—things like waterproof zippers, multiple pockets, fleecy collars, sleeve length, reflective details and, of course, colors. If you ride on the road, for example, the more visible you are, the better. "
14826,"Every jacket on this list has been thoroughly evaluated and vetted by our team of test editors. We research the market, survey user reviews, speak with product managers and engineers, and use our own experience wearing these products to determine the best options. Our team of experienced testers spent many hours, through the dead of winter, using these jackets in various weather conditions and in a wide variety of rides, from casual trail days to long road rides, intense hammer-fest rides, and everything in between. We pushed the limits of their insulation, and put water-resistance claims to the test. We evaluated them based on performance, fit, price, and comfort to come up with this list of jackets that will best serve you in you battle to keep riding through the winter. "
14827,The best cold weather jacket we’ve tested. 
14828,"The insulated Gore-Shakedry is so good at keeping you warm and dry you might actually start looking forward to winter rides. We did during our tests. The jacket has a previously impossible combination of warmth, water resistance, windproofing, breathability,  low weight, and high comfort. It feels like a spring windbreaker but protects you like a ski parka. The magic comes from two sources: Gore’s excellent Shakedry, which is lighter and more breathable than standard Gore-Tex fabrics, and a thin layer of Polartec’s Alpha insulation, which is incredibly warm for how light it is. With just a baselayer, you can wear the jacket down to freezing temps, and the jacket is just loose enough that you can add another layer if needed. It keeps you amazingly dry when it’s 34 and raining, but it’s so breathable that you’ll want to wear it even on dry winter days.  "

Based on our testing, this is conservative on the low end and generous on the high end, although personal preference and ride intensity allow for a dramatic range in appropriate temperatures. The jacket is constructed with two-layer, four-way-stretch fabric. The outer layer does the heavy lifting, keeping bone-chilling winter winds and water at bay, while the second, inner layer does the insulating. The brushed, fleece-type fabric is soft, cozy, and also wicks away sweat. A built-in neck gaitor, which can be easily tucked away when unwanted, is a nice feature."

Its material is fairly water-resistant, although the bright red collar stained and darkened after a few sweaty rides.

The vest features 2 rectangular zippered front pockets and one large zippered rear pocket that sits low on the extended rear hem and is broken up into two compartments. Both sets of pockets are spacious and the YKK zippers have a quality feel about them. Although not explicitly water resistant, the vest does repel water when caught in a light drizzle. "

14839,"The obvious use for this softshell hoodie is for commuting, but it’s technical enough that it also makes a great cold-weather jacket for mountain biking or even gravel riding. A subtle drop tail provides full coverage in the riding position, but doesn’t scream THIS IS A BIKE JACKET! when you’re out in the world. The softshell material provides some windproofing, and a layer of foam material between the softshell layers repels water while promoting breathability. A roomy zippered pocket extends all the way across the back panel, allowing you to fit in bulky items like a pair of winter gloves or leg warmers. "

This jacket is constructed from a three-layer, windproof and water-resistant material that stretches a little to provide a comfortable and close fit, while also featuring fleece side panels and an internal layer of fleece that’ll help you stay comfortably warm. Three rear pockets and a full, two-direction zipper in the front allows for enhanced storage capacity and breathability.

The soft, fleecy fabric is warm enough to be worn in freezing temps with just a baselayer underneath, and the lightweight ripstop outer shell has elbow panels for added protection. Last but not least, a DWR treatment sheds rain quickly, and cinch cords at the waist keep mud out. "

14916,"The first thing you should know—which is pretty obvious—is that this is an aerodynamic road bike. Actually, Trek claims this is the most aerodynamic road bike, thanks to the slippery frame shaping and highly integrated components, which hide every possible wire, cable, and small piece from the wind. (It has yet to be compared with the new Specialized Venge ViAS in a wind tunnel.)"
14917,"The second thing you should know is that everyone at Bicycling who has ridden the bike loves it. It's rare for a test bike to receive unanimous praise; in fact, it's never happened before with an aero road bike."
14918,    Related: 
14919,"Our testers are also unanimous on what they like about this Madone. One evaluation summed up the praise I heard from all seven riders we put on the bike: ""It's one of those bikes that just feels incredibly fun to ride—speedy and snappy, but also surprisingly stable and comfortable."" The Madone incorporates Trek's IsoSpeed Decoupler (bendy seat tube). And besides feeling fast, this aero bike is more compliant and comfortable than many road-race bikes."
14920,
14921,
14922,"It is expensive. Models start at $6,000 and hit more than $13,000 in Trek's Project One program, through which we chose the parts for our tester and ordered up this flamingo-pink paint job. The integration forces riders to make sacrifices (don't like the aero handlebar? Tough). And the bike does amplify drivetrain and road noises. Still, this is one of the most remarkable bikes you can buy and one of the best Trek has ever produced."

Calfee is one of the most accomplished and respected names in frame building, and played an important role in carbon’s ascendency as a frame material. The Manta Pro is the company’s top-of-the-line and highest performance frame."
14927,

These days, styles skew toward looser fits and are generally dictated by discipline: XC and trail riders still tend to prefer slimmer cuts and lighter-weight fabric while their gravity-oriented counterparts (think: downhill, enduro, and all-mountain riders) go for sturdier materials and cuts that leave room for pads and protection.

"
15029,"The CAAD12 improves upon the sublime ride of the Bicycling Editors' Choice-winning CAAD10. Cannondale's aim was to get the best-riding, most compliant aluminum race frame possible, without sacrificing the cornering, control, and precision of the existing model. The company succeeded: The CAAD12 Disc does a magical job of shielding you from the road at both ends, with a front that's still stiff enough that it allows you to wallop the bike in all-out efforts and sprints."
15030,Related: Amazing New Road Bikes for 2016
15031,"The 12 feels similar in ride characteristics to a CAAD10 with rim brakes, though it edges out the 10 for overall compliance, even with the stouter frame needed to handle the discs. The skinny seatstays sport an update with Cannondale's SPEED SAVE technology: Flattened sections and computer-optimized wall thickness and shaping mean the stays can flex or stay strong where needed and save weight where possible. Up front the all-new, full-carbon fork is compliant and comfortable and incorporates fibers that run from the fork tips to the top of the steerer tube for improved strength. Best of all, the great ride is still a great value: The CAAD12 is available in both rim- and disc-brake versions and seven different builds, starting at $1,680."
15032,Cannondale says it skipped the CAAD11 moniker because there was just too much goodness in the new model for only a single point increase. We heartily agree.

15038,"3. Speaking of the tires….
	The Kenda Flintridges blend a smooth rolling center section with aggressive side knobs for fast pace on smooth terrain and excellent grip off-piste. I could ride them in the low 40s psi for exceptional comfort, with little squirm and supreme traction. One ding, though—this version of the Flintridge isn’t tubeless-compatible, though the rims are."
15039,"4. The ride lives up to Bianchi heritage, too.
	The hydroformed alloy frame (mated to a carbon fork) is super comfy, both in terms of fit—boasting a taller head tube and moderate reach—and ride quality, with a ride that’s damped but not mushy. The frame has good power transfer, but it’s not so stiff that a section of washboard makes your life flash before your eyes. Pair that with handling that is sharp when it needs to be—allowing you to juke around potholes and debris—yet forgiving, with a weight at the bar that really lets you drive around turns and hold a line."

A blend of Shimano 105 with non-series RS505 shifters and a RS510 crank, along with flat-mount hydraulic disc brakes, offers reliable shifts with good stopping power and lever feel. The compact, 50/34 crankset and 11-32 cassette give you the gears to get into (and out of) any adventure."

15045,"1. Huck into a rocky chute at breakneck speed. The Instinct’s 140mm suspension feels lively and smooth, soaking up big and small impacts without hesitation. It tackles the most aggressive root- and rock-strewn trails with finesse, floats almost effortlessly off ledges, and stays glued to the ground through rock gardens."
15046,"2. Rage buff singletrack with friends. The Instinct can also hang on faster and flowier trails without feeling like too much bike. It’s nimble and easy to maneuver on technical uphills, and snaps through turns. Increasing its versatility, the angles of the bike can be changed in up to nine different ways with Rocky’s RIDE-9 adjustable geometry, allowing you to fine-tune the head-tube angle (by up to a total of 1 degree) and bottom bracket height with only a set of Allen keys."

15048,3. Pootle on a greenway to a local brewery. Even the most basic rides can be exciting when you have a bike that isn’t afraid to drop off of a retaining wall or jump a set of stairs on the way to an after-work beverage.

15050,4. Skip the lift and ride to the top of the bike park trails. The middle setting on the shock gives the bike a solid pedaling platform on sustained climbs (it does sink a little when it’s fully open). And the bike can kill it on speedy jump trails.
15051,"5. Traverse ridgelines for seven hours in the rugged Pisgah National Forest. When you’re riding for hours, extra heft adds up. At 27.2 pounds, the Instinct provides a lot of adventurous capability at a relatively light weight—especially for its price."

"
15063,"We've been so pleased by the smooth, compliant ride quality of many of the latest aluminum bikes that we're used to the idea that the harsh-riding reputation of the material no longer holds. Yet the BMC teammachine ALR01 is still a revelation: Rolling up the road on my first ride, I marveled at the bike's sweet, smooth, and planted feel. It soaked up potholes and square-edged bumps so well that I later double-checked the tires to see if I was rolling on something wider than the bike's Continental Ultra Sport 23s."

15065,"The ALR01 shares almost identical geometry to its pro-racer big brother, the SLR01, with a slightly taller head tube that puts you in a more comfortable riding position. Thanks to this racy lineage, the ALR is fast and fun: It jumps to attention at the first couple of stabs of the pedals, and its front end steers quickly and easily. It does need a little more coaxing to lean into a turn, but holds a steady line at speed."
15066,"This model comes with the smooth-shifting Shimano Ultegra group, and I'd pick it over many $2,000 carbon bikes with lower-end composite and parts. Within the line, my value pick would be the ALR01 105 for $1,599, and prices get as low as $1,099 with Sora. Whichever you choose, you'll get a massive range of gears with 50-34 chainrings and an 11-32 cassette. As one riding partner exclaimed, ""You could climb to heaven on that thing."" One Sunday, I took the ALR01 on a fast and furious weekly group ride that averaged nearly 30mph on the flats for several miles. The ALR01 hung right in there next to all the carbon race bikes. I finally did pop, but it wasn't the bike that held me back. On this plucky, capable machine, I think that'd be true for plenty of time to come."
