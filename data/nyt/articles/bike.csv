0,"Two years ago, Nola and Brent Peacock of Jackson, Wyo., weren’t sure their daughter, Annika, then 13, was ready to take on the Cache Creek Mountain Bike Race."
1,"“It’s really hard, it’s not a kid’s race. It’s not that long, but there’s a lot of elevation gain,” said Mrs. Peacock, whose husband decided he’d ride behind his daughter in case she needed extra motivation. She didn’t. “She had her own grit and eye of the tiger inside her, and I had not seen that before that race,” Mrs. Peacock said."
2,"Like many of today’s parents striving to raise strong daughters, the Peacocks had heard no shortage of advice on how to grow gritty girls: Take them to a march. Let them fail. Make bossy a virtue."
3,Now they are ready to add a new activity to the list: Ride a bike in the woods.
4,"A small but dedicated group of organizations are using bikes as tools for female empowerment, and some research backs them up. A 2015 study published in The Journal of Adventure Education and Outdoor Learning found that girls showed significant gains in measures of resilience after completing a five-day mountain bike camp called Dirt Divas. One month later the benefits persisted, “even after they went back to their home environments,” says Anja Whittington, the lead author on the study."
5,"Dr. Whittington notes that other adventure sports might have produced similar results. And to be sure, such sports can be good for boys. But ask any fat-tire rider and she’ll tell you, anecdotally, the sport is a perfect fit for building women’s confidence and drive."
6,"Bicycles have a storied historical role in empowering women. “Suffragists used to say, ‘Woman is riding to suffrage on a bicycle,’” said Dr. Danielle Swiontek, a professor of women’s history at Santa Barbara City College. “This was independent transportation that allowed women to go and do what they wanted.” The requirements of riding also pushed women to reject heavy hoop skirts and restrictive corsets, playing a critical role in women’s dress reform."
7,"Today, mountain biking can help to counterbalance two of the challenges of adolescent girlhood: increasing concerns about adhering to gender and beauty ideals, and decreasing feelings of confidence."
8,"“Girls, at large, experience so much hesitancy and a normative drop in confidence over the middle school and high school years,” said Andrea Bastiani Archibald, a developmental psychologist and the chief girl and family engagement officer for Girl Scouts of the USA. The organization has worked to counter the cratering of confidence that can occur during the teen years in part by sending girls out into the woods to do things like mountain biking. In the period where most girls are experiencing a confidence drop, “our girls actually experience a confidence boost,” says Dr. Bastiani Archibald."
9,"Lea Davison, a two-time Olympic mountain biker and co-founder of Little Bellas, a nationwide program that teaches girls ages 7 to 17 how to ride, has found that the earlier girls start, the better. “At 7, 8, 9, they don’t have any fear. It’s ideal because you’re learning these mountain bike skills when you don’t have any fear. So with them, we actually have to hold them back a little bit,” she said. But as girls get older, “there’s this really interesting transition that happens where they get more timid. I think they’re concerned of what other people think.”"
10,"Kristin Borda, who is the program lead for a Little Bellas chapter in New Jersey, witnessed how concerns about what their peers might think can melt on the bike trail on her group’s first outing. “There’s a super steep dirt hill on the trails we ride,” she explained, and many of the girls were wary. But then a couple of them asked if they could try it."
11,"The first girl didn’t make it to the top of the hill. That spurred another rider to try. “Before you know it, everyone is saying ‘I want to try next.’ I mean, they’re not making it up this hill. We spent 30 minutes, and they were not making it, but they would not give up. They wanted it so badly,” she said. And no one seemed to care how they looked when, stalling out mid-climb, they tumbled over sideways."
12,"Concerns about beauty standards can likewise lift the moment a mud puddle turns a girl riding a bike into a Jackson Pollock painting. “On cold, rainy days we have mud competitions, so it takes the girls’ minds off of ‘Oh, it’s 35 degrees and raining.’ It’s kind of the opposite of gender norms for girls,” said Ms. Davison."
13,"Dr. Whittington, who takes young women on canoe trips as part of her research, adds: “I love to watch them transition from caring what they look like to not caring. I love how it challenges their femininity and the social constructs they live in.” By day five, when the girls need to portage over land, they happily embrace the challenge. “When someone asks if they want help they’re like, nope, we’re all set, we’ve been carrying these for several days.”"
14,"Of course, there’s mud on soccer fields, and you can learn stick-to-itiveness from basketball drills or batting practice. But mountain biking doesn’t come laden with the politics and expectations of team sports. “No one sits on a bench,” said Ms. Davison, “and no one gets stuck playing just a single position.”"
15,"Even better: Parents are often left sitting in cars at the trailhead. “Parents are parents,” she says, and every now and then one gets aggressive about his or her child’s performance. But as soon as the kids ride off and into the woods, they’re free to recreate on their own terms."
16,"What they do, once they get into those woods, can be pretty empowering. “There’s a certain work ethic you have to have to be a mountain biker,” said Annika Peacock, who is now 15. “If there’s a section of the trail that’s really hard for me, I’ll go try it five more times. I say to myself, yes, yes, yes, I can do this.” And then the next day? “I go back and do it again.” She now competes against other teens as part of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, an organization working to bring mountain biking programs to high schools throughout the United States."
17,"Annika’s mother says of her daughter, “She’s this petite little bundle of smiles, but she has this self-talk inside her that says ‘I can do this’, and she will ride and re-ride something until she gets it. There’s this resilience she’s trained in herself. She’s fierce.”"
18,"SANTA ANA, Calif. — Nearly two months after a federal jury decided that a notorious motorcycle club must forfeit the rights to its trademarked emblem, a judge on Thursday nullified the verdict, finding that seizure of the intellectual property was unconstitutional."
19,"In a 51-page ruling, Federal District Judge David O. Carter said the government’s strategy of trying to devastate the Mongols motorcycle club by confiscating its treasured Genghis Khan-style logo would violate the group’s First Amendment right to free speech and the excessive fines clause of the Eighth Amendment."
20,"The decision upended years of efforts by prosecutors to weaken the Mongols, which a federal jury in January deemed a criminal enterprise after finding the group guilty of racketeering and racketeering conspiracy for the crimes of murder, attempted murder and drug dealing. In the second phase of that wide-ranging, eight-week trial, the jury found that the Mongols must give up their rights to the emblem, which is emblazoned on the vests, T-shirts and motorcycles of hundreds of members."
21,But Judge Carter declined to order the Mongols to forfeit the logo until he had a chance to review their arguments and consider their free speech rights.
22,"“The Mongol Nation’s and its members’ right to express their identity through the noncommercial display of symbols constitutes speech subject to First Amendment protections,” Judge Carter wrote in the ruling released Thursday. He added that the First Amendment bars the government from using forfeiture laws in racketeering cases “to chill this expression.”"
23,"Judge Carter further wrote that since the jury determined that the Mongols logo was forfeitable only on the racketeering conspiracy count, but not racketeering itself, taking away the insignia was an inordinate punishment."
24,"What’s more, Judge Carter wrote, “There is no evidence that forfeiture of collective membership marks will lead to a less violent or capable organization.”"
25,[Read: How to Crush an Outlaw Biker Club: Seize Its … Logo?]
26,"The Mongols, who feared that losing the rights to their logo — a brawny Genghis Khan-like man sporting a queue and sunglasses and riding a chopper while brandishing a sword — would have severe consequences, hailed the ruling as not just a victory for the group, but for other biker clubs that law enforcement authorities have tried to take down."
27,"“The Mongols MC is ecstatic that they could successfully defend the First Amendment for themselves and all motorcycle clubs,” the club’s general counsel, Stephen Stubbs, said. “Today, Judge Carter stood strong against the United States government’s attempt to ban symbolic speech in an epic win for all Americans.”"
28,Judge Carter’s ruling was a severe setback for California prosecutors who spent more than a decade going after the Mongols patch.
29,"A spokesman for the United States attorney’s office for the Central District of California, Thom Mrozek, said in a statement that prosecutors were disappointed by the decision and that they believed Judge Carter was required by law to issue the forfeiture order that the government had requested. He said the office was considering an appeal."
30,"“While affirming the jury’s guilty verdicts on racketeering charges, the court’s ruling nullifies the jury’s finding that these marks are a core component of the Mongols’ decades-long pattern of murder, assault and drug trafficking,” Mr. Mrozek said."
31,"The roots of the government’s case date to 2005 when four undercover agents for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives managed to become full members of the Mongols."
32,"The result was a jarring blow to the club. In October 2008, a grand jury returned an 86-count federal racketeering indictment against 79 Mongols, accused of crimes ranging from murder to drug trafficking to money laundering. Except for one defendant who died in custody and another who was deemed incompetent, all others eventually pleaded guilty."
33,"Donald Charles Davis, who writes the biker blog “The Aging Rebel,” said that he felt Judge Carter’s ruling was “inevitable.”"
34,"“The government’s ambition was blatantly unconstitutional,” Mr. Davis said. “The government sought to turn symbols like the Mongols insignia, the club’s name and sentiments associated with the club like ‘Support The Mongols,’ into contraband.”"
35,"Judge Carter’s ruling was drawn from a flood of legal opinions that were submitted by academics, law firms and think tanks. He upheld the Mongols’ convictions on racketeering and racketeering conspiracy, and tentatively granted the forfeiture of the various weapons and property that had been seized."
36,"Despite certain members of the club wearing the symbols “while committing violent crimes” or being “rewarded with other patches for the commission of crimes” that did not justify the forfeiture of the logo, Judge Carter wrote."
37,"David Santillan, the national president of the Mongols, pumped his fist into the air as the decision was read before a courtroom audience that included several Mongols members."
38,"“He upheld our constitutional rights, not only as the Mongols motorcycle club, but as citizens,” Mr. Santillan said. “A big weight has been lifted off the club’s shoulders.”"
39,"LOS ANGELES — A 19-year-old Los Angeles man suspected of slashing at least nine people with a sharp-edged object as he rode through the city on a bicycle has been booked on suspicion of attempted murder, police said on Thursday."
40,"Lenrey Briones was taken into custody shortly after 1 p.m. on Wednesday near a homeless camp where detectives believe he lived, said Officer Rosario Cervantes of the Los Angeles Police Department. "
41,"His arrest came after police released photo and video images of the suspect in the seemingly random attacks, which left parts of America's second-largest city on edge, and called on the public's help in apprehending him."
42,Local KABC-TV reported that officers were tipped off to Briones by his probation office. A bike resembling the one used by the slasher was found at the homeless camp. 
43,"The string of slashings began on March 20, according to the LAPD. They often took place in broad daylight and included victims ranging in age from 13 to 85."
44,The latest two attacks occurred on Monday when officers responding to a radio call at around 8:40 p.m. found a man suffering from a severe wound to the left side of his face. 
45,"About 15 minutes later, a young woman was attacked nearby."
46,"""He just came in back of me and hit me,"" Stefany Coboz told local KNBC-TV, displaying a stitched and bandaged wound in her neck. ""I just started looking at him, he looked back, I grabbed myself full of blood."""
47,Coboz said her assailant did not speak to her but laughed as he rode away.

50,"Biking to work in the winter can seem like a daunting, insurmountable activity. The snow! The ice! The freezing temperatures!"
51,"But listen here, friends. I’m here to tell you about the simple ways to address the elements and enjoy cold-season commuting."
52,"For my first winter of riding to work, I used a hand-me-down mountain bike with two studded tires, for better grip on the snow and ice. I dressed in layers — recycling the same clothes I use for cross-country skiing and frosty running — put on a pair of old mitts, and I was on my merry way."
53,"I’ve refined my low-key approach slightly, but am still convinced you don’t need to own a lot of fancy equipment to be comfortable when winter biking. While it might be nippy outside, just a few key pieces will make a significant difference."
54,"In collaboration with Wirecutter, a New York Times company that reviews and recommends products, here are five cheap(ish) things that will keep you commuting on your bike all season."
55,"(And if you’re new to commuting by bike, here are all the basics you’ll need.)"
56,"I live in Calgary, a Canadian city that is wintry for multiple months per year. The secret to survival? Long johns, which are crucial to making outdoor pursuits comfortable. Though base layers are on the higher end of cheap(ish), keep in mind they’re extremely versatile; I wear the same long johns for multiple activities."
57,"The Arc’teryx Rho LT Bottom is Wirecutter’s favorite long john for women, while the Smartwool Merino 150 Base Layer Pattern Long Sleeve is their favorite top. For men, Wirecutter recommends the Icebreaker Men’s BodyfitZone Zone Leggings along with the Smartwool Men’s Merino 150 Base Layer Long Sleeve."
58,"For years I associated Buffs with the reality show “Survivor,” where contestants on tropical islands wear the closed tubes of fabrics as wristbands, headbands, scarves and even tube tops. Turns out Buffs are also multipurpose must-haves for cyclists, especially ideal for keeping your neck and face warm in frigid weather. I adore the adaptability: If it’s chilly, I start my ride with a Buff covering my ears and nose then tug it down to my chin once I get toasty."
59,"Wirecutter recommends an “Original Reflective for lightly cold or breezy rides; a ThermoNet for rainy or almost-winter conditions; and for freezing or below, the Polar for slower rides, the Tech Fleece for faster, windier rides, and the Heavyweight Merino” for truly frigid temperatures."
60,"One of my biggest concerns when I started bike commuting year-round was that my hands would freeze, so I relied on the thickest pair of mitts I owned. But they were bulky, making shifting and braking precarious. I’ve since switched to a layered approach: a light glove liner, an insulating pair of mitts, topped with a waterproof shell. The problem now is that I have six separate pieces of clothing to keep track of (and that’s just for my hands)."
61,"Avoid my mistake and pick up Wirecutter’s recommendation, the Pearl Izumi P.R.O. Am-FIB Lobster Glove, a hybrid mitt and glove with a split-finger design."
62,"Every snow season commuter has a different preference for footwear. Some people opt to stick with cycling shoes and add shoe covers for more warmth, others shell out for winter specific cycling shoes, while some people (like me) prefer hiking boots or winter boots. No matter your choice, you’ll want to start with good socks, and I’ve found that hiking socks keep my feet warmer than cycling socks."
63,"The Darn Tough Light Hiker Micro Crew Light Cushion sock for men and women is Wirecutter’s top pick for best hiking sock, thanks to its mix of comfort, durability and cushioning."
64,"This is a no-brainer: It’s cold out, so you want something to keep your morning beverage hot."
65,Wirecutter’s favorite travel mug to keep that coffee warm — even on a winter bike ride — is the Zojirushi SM-SA48 Stainless Steel Mug.

78,I was biking west on 21st Street when I came to a barrier between Second and Third Avenues. 
79,"Whatever, I thought. I’m on a bike. "
80,"As I rode past the barrier, I noticed several police vans parked along one side of the street. The only sound was the click of a shutter. Looking around, I saw a photographer kneeling down and taking pictures of something I couldn't see. "
81,"I was continuing on when I had to stop suddenly. What looked like the entire 13th Precinct was standing there dressed in their finest, posing for what I figured was their annual photo. "

87,I was stepping up to order at Planet Smoothie in Penn Station when a man who had just gotten a smoothie stomped back to the counter. 
88,“What’s in this?” he said. 
89,The cashier looked nonplused.
90,“Which one did you order again?” he said. 
91,The man waved at the board on the wall. The cashier continued to have a nervous look on his face.
92,"“It looks like strawberries, blueberries, nonfat yogurt,” he said."
93,"“I can read,” the man said. “But it doesn’t taste like it.” "
94,The people waiting behind me began to shuffle impatiently. The cashier shrugged and shifted his feet. Two other employees moved in closer. I started contemplating whether a smoothie was worth waiting out this scene for. 
95,“I can make you another one if you like?” the cashier said.
96,There was a pause. 
97,"“Nope, that’s all right, it’s good, ” the man said. “I like it and I was just hoping for the recipe to make it at home.”"

100,"It was spring 1968, and my classes at Columbia University had been suspended because of student protests. I had also just quit my part-time job as the social secretary for a wealthy older man. He was not giving me enough hours for me to survive in New York."
101,"So it was with a “What do I do now?” feeling that I decided to walk from near Central Park down Fifth Avenue toward 34th Street, where I had plans to meet friends for dinner."
102,"I took my time, stopping to gaze in the store windows. One was a framing and print shop. I was startled when an older man who had apparently been watching me from inside knocked on the window. Before I knew it, he had come outside and was talking with me."
103,He said I looked a bit down. I told him I had just quit my job. He commiserated with me. He told me he had just broken up with his girlfriend. I commiserated with him.
104,"“Let me take you to lunch,” he said. His favorite restaurant was not far away. Since I had nothing to do until dinner, I agreed."
105,"We had a wonderful lunch, and the conversation never stopped. It was as if we were two old friends."
106,"We returned to the shop and he invited me in. He sorted through some drawers and boxes, and then he handed me two beautiful small wooden frames. He insisted on wrapping them before I went on my way."
107,"I left the city that summer to get on with my life. The frames have housed two lovely paintings for 50 years. When I look at them, they evoke a crystal clear memory of my lunch with a stranger."

121,"SANTA ANA, Calif. — For its members, a motorcycle club’s logo is both sacred and hard-earned, the banner under which its brand of rugged brotherhood and individualism exist."
122,"But in a setback to the future of one of the country’s most notorious biker groups, a federal jury in California on Friday found that the Mongols motorcycle club must forfeit its rights to the trademarked Genghis Khan-style emblem that identifies the organization."
123,"The jury’s verdict — which concluded the second phase of a wide-ranging eight-week racketeering trial in which jurors also branded the Mongols a criminal enterprise — was not the final word. The group’s lawyers have filed a motion for acquittal and the presiding judge, who in the past has ruled in favor of the Mongols, said he would not immediately order the club to forfeit the logo until he has a chance to review the club’s arguments and consider their free speech rights."
124,"Going after their trademark, which prosecutors have sought for a decade, was an innovative approach intended to break the Mongols by striking at its visual identity, a patch that has been linked to the organization’s culture of violence and intimidation and appears on the vests, T-shirts, caps, mouse pads and motorcycles of hundreds of its members, many of whom also have tattoos of the image."
125,"The Santa Ana, Calif., jury last month convicted the biker club of racketeering, and racketeering conspiracy for the crimes of murder, attempted murder and drug dealing committed by individual members over the past dozen years."
126,"In addition to the logos, the jury found Friday that the government could keep various items bearing the mark — including vests, clothing and documents such as the Mongols’ constitution — as well as a number of guns, ammunition and armored vests it had seized in earlier raids against the group. But the jury denied forfeiture rights for belt buckles, jewelry, lighters, bandannas, stickers, and motorcycle parts — apparently unable to find the “required nexus” between the items and the group’s criminal activity."
127,"Friday’s verdict confounded Mongols members and their lawyers. Stephen Stubbs, the club’s general counsel, described the outcome as “very strange” because the jury did not find the logo forfeitable on the count of racketeering, but did so on the racketeering conspiracy count."
128,"“How can we make sense out of that?” Mr. Stubbs said, adding that it appeared to be a compromise verdict, one agreed upon so the jury could go home after long days of deliberations. “So, we continue to fight so that Americans can’t be banned by the government from wearing symbols.”"
129,[Read: How to Crush an Outlaw Biker Club: Seize Its … Logo?]
130,"Robert Draskovich, a Las Vegas lawyer who has represented the Hells Angels and the Bandidos on criminal matters, said that while the verdicts were a potential “death blow” for the Mongols, the outcome was also foreboding for other motorcycle clubs that have been the focus of law enforcement ire over the years."
131,"“I would say that other clubs are now liable and in danger of being targeted, trampled on and dismantled,” Mr. Draskovich said."
132,"Because the case was focused on the organization itself, no members or associates faced any time behind bars."
133,"But in many ways, some lawyers said, stripping the club of its identifying mark was worse."
134,"“It is the holy of holies,” said Fritz Clapp, a lawyer who has done intellectual property work for the Hells Angels and the Devils Diciples motorcycle clubs."
135,"Indeed, “everyone in the bike gang business agrees that you never want to lose your colors because it shows you can’t defend your turf,” Terry Katz, a board member of the International Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association, said in an interview. “And without that set of colors, you are not rock stars.”"
136,The emblem at issue is a black-and-white rendering of the word “MONGOLS” over a drawing of a cartoonish Genghis Khan-like figure sporting a queue and brandishing a sword while riding a chopper motorcycle.
137,Other lawyers opined that the forfeiture verdict would not hold up on constitutional grounds.
138,"“It is clearly an overreach to sweep up all innocent people by virtue of being part of a motorcycle club,” said Richard Gaxiola, a Phoenix lawyer who has represented the Hells Angels for 15 years."
139,"United States District Judge David O. Carter, who has scheduled a hearing for Feb. 28, acknowledged that the verdicts would likely face constitutional challenges. Talking to lawyers in the case last month, without the jury in the courtroom, Judge Carter said that since the “forfeiture provision is quite literally without limitation, it may exceed constitutional bounds in a particular case.”"
140,"The government has long sought the group’s trademarked patch. A seizure order a decade ago was unable to withstand a constitutional challenge after a Mongols member, Ramon Rivera, who was not indicted on any criminal charges, filed a complaint with the help of the American Civil Liberties Union and successfully argued that the confiscation of Mongols items violated his First Amendment and due process rights."
141,Experts in intellectual property law said that efforts to gain control of the trademark rights to the logo were not enough to claim ownership of them.
142,"“You are only a trademark owner if you are using it in commerce or as a collective membership mark, like the Mongols,” said Viva Moffat, a professor at the University of Denver’s Sturm College of Law who specializes in intellectual property law."
143,"During the trial, prosecutors for the United States attorney’s office for the Central District of California argued that the Mongols club was a violent criminal enterprise to its core and that its leaders were aware of the illicit activities of its members and associates."
144,"Prosecutors presented the jury with a battery of crimes over the years allegedly carried out by Mongols members, ranging from drug dealing to firearms offenses to murder, including the fatal shooting of a Pomona, Calif., police officer in 2014."
145,"Assistant United States Attorney Steven R. Welk told the jury this week that the Mongols club was a gang that had been “a beehive of pernicious criminal activity” since it was founded in Montebello, Calif., in 1969."
146,"“These men, fueled by, based on the evidence which you’ve heard, by rage and methamphetamine, empowered by these symbols that they wear like armor, roaming the world like urban predators searching for people to victimize,” Mr. Welk said."
147,"The roots of the government’s case date back to 2005, when undercover agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives set out to infiltrate the Mongols. Known as Operation Black Rain, it was a notably large undertaking for the A.T.F., a three-year investigation in which four agents managed to become full members."
148,"The result was a jarring blow to the club. In October 2008, a grand jury returned an 86-count federal racketeering indictment against 79 Mongols, alleging crimes from murder to drug trafficking to money laundering. The lead defendant was Ruben (Doc) Cavazos, the club’s national president until he was voted out weeks before the charges were filed. Except for one defendant who died in custody and another who was deemed incompetent, all those charged eventually pleaded guilty."
149,"Calling the prosecution’s case “the best book of fiction I’ve ever heard in my life,” Joseph A. Yanny used part of his closing statements last month to assail the integrity of the A.T.F. He argued that its agents used entrapment and lies to build their cases against the Mongols."
150,"Mr. Yanny also stated that crimes carried out by Mongols were “spontaneous rogue acts of individuals” that were not hatched or approved by club officers. Referring to the brutal 1991 beating of Rodney King by a group of Los Angeles police officers, he told the jury “that doesn’t make the L.A.P.D. a criminal organization.”"
151,"This week, Mr. Yanny told the jury before it deliberated over the fate of the Mongols marks, “It’s the death penalty phase of this case. Have they made mistakes? We never denied that they have. Have they cleaned up their act? You bet they have.”"
152,"The case has highlighted how resolved prosecutors are to hobble motorcycle organizations like the Mongols, which rely on striking optics to convey an air of toughness and intimidation, and how determined biker groups are to protect their logos."
153,"David Santillan, the national president of the Mongols, said in an interview that the club has spent more than $1.5 million in lawyers’ fees over the last 10 years to fight the government’s charges. “You can’t put a price on our patch,” Mr. Santillan said. “It’s priceless.”"
154,"Twenty years ago Sunday, a fire deep inside an Alpine tunnel killed 39 people and turned a motorcycle-riding security guard who worked there into a hero. In the chaos just after the blaze, local French and Italian newspapers reported that the biker had raced in and out of the burning tunnel, saving as many as 10 people before dying in one last rescue attempt."
155,"It was some time before investigators released a final, accurate account of the disaster at the Mont Blanc Tunnel: The biker, who was known by his nickname, Spadino, an Italian riff on his skinny frame, had not saved anyone. But he died trying to do so, and local bikers still gather at the tunnel mouth once a year to honor him."
156,"While the legend was exaggerated, the horror of the fire — and its impact on tunnel safety — cannot be overstated. The lessons of the tragedy have guided tunnel design and engineering ever since, including recent American projects like the Port of Miami Tunnel and Seattle’s new S.R. 99 Tunnel."
157,"The Mont Blanc Tunnel opened to traffic in 1965. When built, it was the world’s longest road tunnel, linking the French and Italian highway systems and shortening truck routes between Italy’s industrial north and other parts of Europe. It had been open nearly 35 years without a single fatal incident until the morning of March 24, 1999."
158,[Read the original Times coverage of the 1999 fire at the Mont Blanc Tunnel.]
159,"Around 11 a.m., a Volvo FH12 tractor-trailer, registered in Belgium, stopped to pay the toll. It was an ordinary truck with ordinary cargo: nine tons of margarine and 12 tons of flour."
160,"To this day, no one can say with certainty why the rig caught fire. The driver, who had been alerted to a problem by oncoming vehicles, stopped almost in the middle of the 7.2-mile tunnel. When he climbed out of the cab, flames burst from under the truck, and he leapt back. Witnesses reported that the fire had very quickly become too intense to drive past."
161,"Spadino — Pierlucio Tinazzi, who got his nickname, Italian for a thin, light sword, when he was young — was just outside the French portal on his motorcycle. It’s not clear whether he suspected trouble or thought he was making a routine trip back to the Italian portal. Regardless, he followed a few other heavy trucks in."
162,Mr. Tinazzi was most likely the first tunnel employee to realize the Belgian truck was trailing smoke. The last few drivers who made it into France said the motorcyclist had appeared to be trying to catch up to the burning truck.
163,"He never quite got there. Near the fire, he came upon Maurice Lebras, a French truck driver who was unconscious. In his last radio communication with the control room, Mr. Tinazzi said he had dragged the trucker into a fire refuge off the main tunnel. He closed the fire door and waited."
164,The refuge had a fire door rated to a “four-hour” standard. The fire burned for 50 hours.
165,"A few minutes after Mr. Tinazzi rode in, two trucks from the Chamonix Fire Department arrived carrying 14 firefighters. They plunged into thick, toxic smoke. Moments later, the fire melted the wiring for the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness. Their trucks stuck now, the firefighters retreated into two refuges."
166,"In the tunnel, the margarine had melted and then turned into a highly flammable vapor. A strong breeze created a blast-furnace effect, igniting the fuel in other abandoned vehicles. Temperatures reached 1,000 degrees Celsius, or 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit."
167,"Five hours later and with no time to spare, a rescue crew reached the firemen via a ventilation duct. All of them survived but their commanding officer, who died in a hospital."
168,It was a week before the tunnel cooled enough for forensic investigators to recover bodies. Most of the victims had almost certainly suffocated before they burned. That was a small mercy.
169,"The blaze was traumatic for the close-knit Alpine communities of the French Haute-Savoie region and Val d’Aosta in Italy. Compounding the emotional toll, a lengthy renovation closed the tunnel and hurt tourist traffic."
170,"The region needed a hero, and soon after the fire, the government of Italy honored Mr. Tinazzi with a gold medal for civilian bravery. The International Motorcycle Federation, the world governing body of motorcycle sport, presented its highest award to his family. Its citation, like those early newspaper reports, credited Mr. Tinazzi with saving several people, even though the legend of the biker-hero “had been woven by the Italian media before anyone knew exactly what had really happened,” said Antoine Chandellier, a French journalist who has reported on the region for decades."
171,The magnitude of death and destruction reverberated widely. It so shocked civil engineers who specialize in tunnel construction that many remember where they were when they learned the news.
172,"William Connell, a tunnel systems engineer, was working on the enormous tunnel project known as the Big Dig in Boston at the time of the fire. “Initially, there was a lot of conjecture, and uneasiness, about how a fire of that size could become so deadly and produce so much damage,” Mr. Connell said."
173,"Before Mont Blanc, tunnel engineers were divided on the benefit of sprinkler systems. Concerns included impaired visibility for motorists as well as reliability and maintenance costs. Only five United States road tunnels had been equipped with sprinklers."
174,"“When the full report on the Mont Blanc fire finally came out, it was evident that additional measures of fire protection and emergency response planning would have reduced the significance of the fire,” Mr. Connell recalled."
175,"In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association publishes a document with a dry title but life-or-death consequences: “NFPA 502: Standard for Road Tunnels, Bridges and Other Limited Access Highways.”"
176,"Mr. Connell served as chairman of the association’s technical committee on tunnel safety from 2005 until 2015. After the Mont Blanc report highlighted the French and Italian operators’ lack of preparedness, the committee made formal emergency response plans and regular training exercises part of the standard. Recognizing that road tunnels were more common in Europe, Asia and Australia, he recruited international expertise to the committee."
177,"The association writes standards, not laws; it’s up to the local authorities to adopt them. When the Florida Department of Transportation decided to construct its first major road tunnel in 2010, the association’s 502 standard was incorporated into the Florida Fire Prevention Code."
178,"Chris Hodgkins is the chief executive of Miami Tunnel, the company that built and operates the three-quarter-mile tunnel connecting the Port of Miami with the Interstate highway system. The tunnel diverts traffic that used to crawl through downtown."
179,"“We learned from Mont Blanc that people don’t die from the fire — they die from the fumes and smoke,” Mr. Hodgkins said. “We have 44 jet fans that can operate in either direction, so we can suck air away from the fire, so toxins don’t affect people in the tunnel.”"
180,"The Miami tunnel is a “twin-bore” tunnel, with a separate passageway for traffic in each direction. It has cross-passages every 450 feet so that, in a fire, people can escape through the other tunnel."
181,"In Seattle, the recently opened S.R. 99 Tunnel carries two stacked roadbeds, in an immense single-bore tunnel under downtown, running for nearly two miles. It includes heat detectors that can locate a fire to within 10 feet, and, as in Miami, a deluge system can dump several tropical rainstorms’ worth of water into a fire zone, while leaving the rest of the tunnel dry."
182,"Brian Russell, the civil engineer who served as project manager on the S.R. 99 Tunnel, said the boring machine was 57½ feet in diameter, providing room for spaces for safety systems in addition to the roadways."
183,"“People think of tunnels as a hole through the ground,” he said, “but that’s not the case anymore. I tell people, ‘This is like a building for cars.’”"
184,"The Seattle tunnel includes refuges every 650 feet, which open into a passage with its own fresh air supply — a tunnel within the tunnel — for escape."
185,"The Mont Blanc Tunnel finally reopened in 2002. A French engineer, Jean-Marc Berthier, led development of a unified safety protocol for the Franco-Italian venture, and served as the tunnel’s administrator for the next few years. Since then, Mr. Berthier has become a global evangelist for tunnel fire safety."
186,"“In 2016, we had Jean-Marc perform a safety review of the Port of Miami Tunnel,” Mr. Hodgkins recalls. “At one point, I mentioned that we’d never had a fire, and he banged his hand on the table and said, ‘Yet!’”"
187,"Sure enough, in December 2017, a car erupted into flames in the tunnel. The driver escaped unhurt; the deluge system kept the fire under control until a Miami-Dade fire crew arrived. The jet fans kept the tunnel air clear while it was evacuated."
188,"There were no casualties. In less than two hours, the tunnel was reopened to traffic."
189,"BERLIN — As he held up one of the new posters about the importance of wearing a helmet when cycling, the German transport minister said the safety campaign was intended to draw attention."
190,"“It’s all about getting noticed,” the minister, Andreas Scheuer, said at the official unveiling last week."
191,"The posters have certainly achieved that. The focus has not been on the helmets, though, but rather on the lack of other clothing worn by the models, who are pictured in their underwear, and on the language used, which many consider vulgar."
192,"“Embarrassing, stale and sexist,” was how one lawmaker described the campaign."
193,"“Half-naked women and men should not be put onto posters at taxpayers’ expense,” the lawmaker, Katja Mast, told the German daily Passauer Neue Presse."
194,"Ms. Mast is a member of the Social Democrats, which is part of the governing coalition that also includes Mr. Scheuer’s party, the Christian Social Union in Bavaria."
195,"The safety posters with women in lingerie and bare-chested men — though no bicycles in view — seek to make the point that although it is difficult to look good in a helmet, the headwear can save lives. The campaign uses models from the reality television show “Germany’s Next Top Model,” which is hosted by Heidi Klum, and features a slogan in English that includes a profanity."
196,"According to the Transport Ministry, the campaign is aimed especially at young women who think helmets are unattractive. The posters will line bicycle paths in major German cities and will cost 400,000 euros, or about $453,000, the ministry said."
197,"The campaign, with its hashtag “helmets save lives,” immediately drew scorn on social media."
198,"Franziska Giffey, the minister for families, posted a picture of her pushing her bike wearing a helmet and everyday clothes. “Dear Andreas Scheuer,” she wrote, “You can also be dressed while wearing a helmet.”"
199,"Another Twitter user, Udo Güngerich, wrote: “I would have preferred it if an S.U.V. had run over a half-nude helmet wearer. Just for realism’s sake.”"
200,"Apart from the nudity, the profanity in the slogan was a reminder of how Germans can fall foul of using words in official settings that English speakers would usually balk at hearing in public. In December, Chancellor Angela Merkel used an English profanity to describe chaos during a speech in German at a technology conference."
201,"Injuries to cyclists have become a significant concern in Germany. In 2018, 432 cyclists died in accidents, according to ADAC, a German automobile association, 50 more than the year before. Wearing a helmet when cycling is not mandatory in Germany — 40 percent of riders under age 30 do not even own one, and only 8 percent of riders aged 17 to 30 wear one, according to a poll commissioned by the Transport Ministry."
202,"Mr. Scheuer, the transport minister, has a history of awkward public messaging. The 44-year-old goes to some length to show a breezy, youthful side. He uses a shortened version of his name on Twitter and has posed as a guest D.J. at a dance club. He has also filmed himself giving a speed tour through his ministry and using a bike-sharing service to head home from work, despite having a reputation as an advocate for cars."
203,"A spokeswoman for the Transport Ministry, Svenja Friedrich, said on Monday that the campaign had been intended to garner interest. “We can absolutely understand the criticism from various sides, but we still stand by the images,” she said."
204,"In a post on Twitter responding to the furor generated by the posters, Mr. Scheuer expressed gratitude for the attention and called it one of his ministry’s most successful campaigns to date."
205,The crime scene was one of the more shocking that Texas had witnessed in years: Nine people killed and 20 wounded in a lunchtime shootout among members of the Bandidos and Cossacks motorcycle gangs in a restaurant parking lot in Waco in May 2015.
206,"But the response by prosecutors was widely criticized as brazen overreach: the arrests of 177 people, nearly everyone who had been at the scene that day. Serious criminal charges were later filed against almost all of them, and many were jailed on $1 million bond."
207,"The end result came this week: None of those 177 people, or anyone else, will be held accountable for the biggest motorcycle-gang shootout in United States history. The case is ending after almost four years without a single conviction."
208,"The last 24 pending indictments, involving lesser charges than the defendants initially faced, are being dismissed, the McLennan County district attorney, Barry Johnson, said on Tuesday."
209,"Mr. Johnson, recently elected to the post, cited what he described as a real possibility that conviction on even those lesser charges would be overturned on appeal. He also said that statutes of limitations made it impossible to pursue charges against anyone else."
210,"And he expressed frustration with the course of the case, saying that there could have been real accountability for the shootout if his predecessor, Abel Reyna, had done a better job. But he said Mr. Reyna had failed to focus on the people most responsible for the carnage and bring them to trial with charges tailored to fit their individual culpability."
211,"Mr. Johnson said Mr. Reyna should have used the available time and resources “to charge only those offenses where the admissible evidence would support a verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” And he added, “In my opinion, had this action been taken in a timely manner, it would have, and should have, resulted in numerous convictions and prison sentences.”"
212,"Only one defendant was ever tried: Jacob Carrizal, the president of the Bandidos chapter in Dallas. The case was declared a mistrial in 2017 after a majority of jurors voted to acquit him."
213,Mr. Johnson defeated Mr. Reyna in a Republican primary last year after sharply criticizing Mr. Reyna for the conduct of the shootout prosecution.
214,In a statement to the local newspaper — which had described the case as “a four-year prosecutorial fiasco” — Mr. Reyna suggested that his successor wasn’t being honest.
215,"“I absolutely disagree with the overall result, as well as several statements and accusations within Mr. Johnson’s press release,” Mr. Reyna said. “However, it is solely his decision on how to proceed with any case in the district attorney’s office. I respect the fact that the voters of McLennan County chose Mr. Johnson to make these types of decisions.”"
216,"Another top prosecutor in Waco, Tom Needham, said that proving who, precisely, was culpable was very difficult because the shootout had been “a battlefield situation.”"
217,"“There were dozens of guns and hundreds of weapons collected after a five-minute brawl,” Mr. Needham said, according to The Austin American-Statesman. “With the video evidence and the forensic evidence that’s available, it’s simply not possible to establish proof beyond a reasonable doubt who fired the shots that killed people.”"
218,"The Houston Chronicle reported that tests later indicated that four of the people who died that day were actually shot with weapons fired by Waco police officers, not by motorcycle gang members."
219,"Johnny Holmes, the famously tough prosecutor and longtime district attorney in Houston, told the newspaper last year that the initial dragnet of arrests appeared to be an overreach, given how many of the cases were later dismissed."
220,"“If you can prove that 177 people committed crimes, you don’t dismiss them because of the numbers,” Mr. Holmes said. “Or at least, I wouldn’t. The truth is, they probably didn’t commit a crime.”"
221,"While the criminal case is now over, the legal battle is not."
222,"McLennan County, the City of Waco, Mr. Reyna and others are defendants in lawsuits filed in Federal District Court by more than 100 bikers, who say that their civil rights were violated because they were arrested without probable cause. A judge in Waco ruled in November that the lawsuits could proceed."

246,"The Kingdom of Bhutan is perhaps best known for its credo of Gross National Happiness, or G.N.H., an official index of prosperity and quality of life in place of gross domestic product. G.N.H. is based on four guiding pillars: good governance, sustainable socioeconomic development, environmental conservation, and the promotion and preservation of culture. "
247,"Part of this philosophy champions a healthy, active lifestyle as a vehicle to help citizens maximize their pursuit of happiness. Toward that end, in 2010, His Royal Highness Prince Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck, president of the Bhutan Olympic Committee, started the Tour of the Dragon competition, billed as “the toughest one-day mountain bike race in the world.” "
248,"Last fall, after a summer of hard, solitary, sometimes less-than-happy training, I went to Bhutan — nestled above the far northeast corner of India — to compete in the Dragon race. The 167-mile course follows a chewed-up, menacing road under major construction while snaking its way over four mountain passes, three of which stand above 10,000 feet, all in one long, masochistic day with over 15,000 vertical feet of climbing. At 132 miles in, my system was fried and my G.N.H. had plummeted, and I still had another 22 miles of steep, uphill pedaling in front of me, followed by a 13-mile descent."
249,"By comparison, one of the hardest stages of the 2019 Tour de France will cover just over 13,000 feet of climbing, and that’s on ultralight race bikes on fully paved roads. The Dragon race’s course profile looks like an alarming EKG reading. "
250,"I expected my body to protest. It began with a three-part barrage of cramps that surged across my lower limbs in paralysis of all forward progress: As I staggered up the steepest section of the whole course, a painful stab seized my right IT band while another twisted knots into my groin, followed by an aftershock rumbling across the left thigh for good measure. "
251,"A fervent bicycle culture has seen rapid development in Bhutan. Its northern border with Tibet runs along a treacherous seam of the Eastern Himalayan mountain range, which has historically protected the Switzerland-size country from outside influence and fortified it as one of the only nations in the world to never be colonized. This geographic and political isolation has long delayed Bhutan’s modernization. The cycling culture has grown thanks to the bike-crazy former Druk Gyalpo, or Dragon King, who spends his days cruising trail networks throughout the mountains. Bhutanese citizens idolize the royal family, often wearing lapel pins with the current king’s handsome sideburned portrait."
252,"“My goal has always been to create a world-class cycling event in Bhutan,” His Royal Highness Prince Wangchuck said. “For someone who is a believer of healthy living, cycling is a very important sport to promote national happiness.”"
253,"The roadside scenery alone was enough to warm the heart, with hydropowered prayer wheels spinning beneath canopies of colorful prayer flags and wrinkled old women smiling toothless smiles as they shyly waved to passing cyclists. The landscape is so lush and green (over 70 percent of Bhutan is still covered in forest) that the hillsides explode with dense treetops resembling ripe heads of broccoli. It’s a constant collage of enchanted scenery."
254,"At 10 hours into the race — after a bleary-eyed 2 a.m. start, a headlight dying prematurely in the dark, gravelly mud caked inside my eyelids and the onslaught of cramps as I pedaled through the upper end of a 50-degree temperature swing — I found it hard to smile. My achy legs felt like bags of concrete. My seizing lower back muscles were on the verge of snapping. My neck and shoulders were so fatigued that I couldn’t even hold my head up to see where I was going. I had already doubled the distance of my longest training ride, and I was starting to look for a place to pull over and rest, or maybe just quit. "
255,"The road banked into a left turn, and I slowly coasted through, gazing down at the pavement. Just then, I was hit with an eruption of cheers coming from 100 schoolchildren posted on the side of the road. Spectators across the entire country had lined the course to cheer for the riders while handing us bananas and chocolate. It was the largest crowd of “cheering team” volunteers I’d yet to encounter, and their energy was colossal. In a sea of white khata scarves, the fanatic children chanted “Do your best! Do your best!” while running alongside me, clapping and screaming as if I were locked in a dead sprint."
256,"This unexpected surge of motivation from the children’s impassioned cheers and encouragement instantly revived my near lifeless body and spirit and jolted me into high gear. Although it had been hours since I had seen another cyclist, I was no longer alone. The support cascaded down upon me until I burst into happy tears, something I’ve never experienced in team sports or recreational cycling. "
257,"My pedal cadence quickened as my body lurched with a replenished energy. Several more cheering congregations propped me up along the rest of the ride. Infected with the stoke, I began passing other riders one by one, offering my own upbeat cheers and words of encouragement, which ultimately propelled me across the finish line in a decent 13 hours 45 minutes 24 seconds. "
258,"I’d cycled thousands of miles all summer in dreadful preparation of this ride, and while I had never felt so much pain in my training, I had never felt so much happiness, either."

272,Exactly how humans came up with the idea of roasting and brewing coffee beans isn’t clear. More certain is the fact that coffee has grown into a global industry worth billions of dollars. And with that popularity comes climate consequences.
273,"There’s deforestation to grow more beans, the shipping emissions that come from moving them to market and the resources that go into packaging. So, with more than 80 percent of Americans regularly drinking a cup (or three), greening our collective coffee habit could have positive effects."
274,"That process starts at the source. Today, there are myriad labels, seals and certifications that promise you information on the human and environmental impact of your beans. An organic label, for instance, implies limits on the chemicals (like pesticides) used to grow the coffee, while a fair trade seal should signal better treatment of workers and communities."
275,"Bob Schildgen, who writes the Mr. Green column for the Sierra Club, said the main labels he trusts for coffee are the United States Department of Agriculture organic certification and the Fairttrade seal. He said Smithsonian Bird Friendly and Rainforest Alliance Certified also offer at least some assurances that the beans are produced with care."
276,"Once you’ve found beans with a lower environmental impact, what else can you do?"
277,"Ditching single-serving pods is one step. Not only do they require more packaging, but single servings also take significantly more energy to brew than traditional drip methods."
278,"Even John Sylvan, one of the founders of Keurig, says he wishes he he’d never introduced coffee pods to the world. “I feel bad sometimes that I ever did it,” he told The Atlantic, in 2015. “No matter what they say about recycling, those things will never be recyclable.” (A Kuerig representative disputed that, saying many of the company’s pods were already recyclable and that it aimed to make all of them recyclable by 2020)."
279,"You can skip the pods, and the electric coffee machine, by opting for pour-over preparations. You might also consider a metal or cloth filter instead of paper (though the metal allows more acid to pass through). Or, eliminate the filter altogether by pressing your coffee. Best yet, try cold brew. No boiling water, and thus no electricity, needed. And some aficionados say it delivers better flavor with less acidity."
280,"Once you’ve made your coffee, some of the things that go with it can be just as important as the brew itself. Milk, for instance, accounts for more than half the emissions footprint of the average coffee (and that percentage is drastically higher for dairy-heavy orders like lattes). "
281,"Single-use cups generate a lot of waste, so be sure to reach for a reusable mug instead."
282,"Finally, don’t forget: Those coffee grounds are compostable. Next time forgo the trash for the compost bin, or dump the grounds directly in the garden."

284,"I’m a wimp when it comes to the cold. I don’t like being cold. I most certainly don’t like riding a bike on cold and windy days with sharp, icy rain poking me in the face."
285,"But that’s is exactly what I found myself doing, over the course of five days in the depth of winter in Copenhagen."
286,I loved it.
287,"I went to Copenhagen to report on the city’s plan to be net carbon neutral by 2025. Some 43 percent of Copenhageners commute to work or school on their bikes. So I got a bike from my hotel, adjusted the saddle to my non-Viking height, and set off. The parking lot at the Norreport train station was a sprawling jumble of two-wheelers."
288,"Some of the busiest bike lanes are elevated a couple of inches above the car lane, so there’s not much of a risk of a car cutting you off or opening a door and knocking you over. Commuter trains from the suburbs are packed with bikes. Copenhageners are not as aggressive as Amsterdammers on their bikes, and so I was only occasionally berated for going too slow."
289,"There were lots of simple things that Copenhagen had done. Apartment buildings have eight separate recycling bins, including for hard plastic, soft plastic, electronics, and food waste. At Tivoli, an old-fashioned amusement park, there was a kiosk to return reusable coffee cups. "
290,"The drains don’t back up into the street after a few hours of rain — like they do in my neighborhood in Brooklyn — not even when there’s heavy, wet snow that turns into sloppy slush on the ground. "
291,"The road to carbon neutrality is paved with imperfect solutions. You can read about them in my story here — like, is it smart to burn garbage for heat and electricity?"
292,"Cities are going to have to do some heavy lifting if the world is to slow down climate change. Half of humanity now lives in cities, which produce most global emissions. Cities are both the source of the problem and, potentially, the source of big fixes. "
293,Copenhagen’s experience could show what works and what doesn’t.

297,"Samantha Nicole Marpe and Kristofer Andy Sandor were married April 6 at the United States Naval Academy Chapel in Annapolis, Md. The Rev. Eric Hoog, a Roman Catholic priest, performed the ceremony."
298,"The bride, 34, is a recruiter with Henkel Search Partners, a company in New York that specializes in recruiting investment professionals for private equity firms. She graduated from Penn State."
299,"She is the daughter of Mary Ellen Marpe and James S. Marpe of Westport, Conn. The bride’s father is the first selectman of Westport and a retired senior partner of Accenture, a global management and technology consulting company in New York. Her mother serves on the board of trustees of the Westport Country Playhouse."
300,"The groom, 40, was until December 2018, the general manager of Citi Bike, a bike share company based in New York. He previously served nine years on active duty in the Navy as a nuclear submarine officer, having achieved the rank of lieutenant, and was last stationed at the Office of the Secretary of Defense in Washington. He also served as a White House social aide in the Bush and Obama administrations before entering the private sector. He graduated from the Naval Academy and received an M.B.A. from Stanford."
301,"He is a son of Maria Sandor and Istvan Sandor of Lake Worth, Fla. The groom’s father, who worked in Boonton, N.J., retired as the president and founder of the Bio-Chem Valve Corporation, a manufacturer of high-quality fluidic components used in clinical diagnostics and analytical chemistry. His mother was a stay-at-home parent."
302,The couple met in November 2016 through the online dating app the League. Their first date was at a wine bar that same month in New York’s West Village.
303,"Miami-raised and Fordham-educated, Ally Love is the in-arena host of the Brooklyn Nets, an Adidas global ambassador, a Peloton instructor, an Alvin Ailey-trained dancer, a certified health coach and the founder of Love Squad, a company that empowers young women through panel discussions and group workouts. “Sunday is my favorite day of the week,” said Ms. Love, who lives in Chelsea. “It’s just really nice to be in places that aren’t too overwhelmed. I’m always running, on the go, the city is always busy, so to feel the city when it’s less busy means a lot to me.”"
304,"TEA, NEWS AND PREP When I wake up at 7, the city is quiet. You almost feel like the only one up, and I like that feeling. I am not a breakfast person, so I’ll have a cup of tea and catch up on news, engage with the social media community; I’ll go over my Nets scripts to prepare for games that week."
305,"GET PUMPED I go to the 9:30 service at Redeemer Downtown on 14th Street, and I love hearing the sermon. It grounds me, reminds me how great God has been to me, my family and friends, and I leave more knowledgeable. Timothy Keller, the founding pastor of Redeemer in Manhattan, is a well-known author, so I knew I wanted to check out his teaching when I came to New York. I found Redeemer and fell in love with the Bible-based teaching. That’s a priority to me. We can all preach on feelings, but teaching on truth is what I live for, and learn from."
306,"SPIRIT AND BODY Right after church, I walk to 23rd Street and teach a 12:45 class at Peloton. It’s a live class that is broadcast to all bikes and app members. It’s literally my “Feel Good Ride” — the name of the class — as it allows me to bridge the gap of how great I feel from church and being on the bike, working out with thousands of riders at the same time, inspiring them through uplifting and encouraging language. I love Peloton because of its community. It’s not only the leader in the hybrid of technology and fitness, but we are able to build social relationships that are magnified both on the bike, which uses a leader board that syncs with other riders, and off the bike, through real friendships across the country."
307,"A LITTLE BUSINESS I’ll get off my bike around 1:30 and meet with Faye Farrales, who helps me run Love Squad. It’s really informal on Sundays, but we’re a small business, so it’s important to work in those off-peak hours and get ahead of the game so we know what we’re doing and build a strategy for the upcoming week."
308,"HANG I meet my friends around 2:30 or 3 for afternoon brunch. My favorite place is Joseph Leonard on Waverly Place in the West Village. There’s usually a wait, so we have some drinks at the bar before sitting down. And it really depends on how much fun we’re having, but brunch can end anywhere between 5:30 and 6:30. When it’s over, I’ll go home to change and meet my boyfriend, Andrew."
309,"THE BOYFRIEND Andrew and I see each other every day. I start my mornings with him, and sometimes on Sundays he joins for church, and he often comes to class, as well, but we always meet up for comedy and dinner. At 8 we go to the stand-up show at the Village Underground on Third Street. We love to laugh, so comedy is perfect — we thoroughly enjoy and respect those who can get up, live, and make people laugh. Making people laugh on the spot is real talent. Anyone can tell one good joke, but very few people can thread jokes together to tell a story, be impactful, and just make it super funny. My favorite comics include Hasan Minhaj, Stephen Colbert, Kevin James. After the show, we always go around the corner to Mint Masala on Macdougal Street for amazing Indian food. We love the curry chicken and lamb rogan josh."
310,"BEDTIME SWEET After dinner, it’s about 11 or 11:30, and I’m so ready to go back home where I like to have a small piece of chocolate before I wash my face, brush my teeth, and pray before I hop into bed."
311,"LOS ANGELES — A 19-year-old ex-convict who prosecutors say slashed the faces of nine people as he rode through the streets of Los Angeles and surrounding communities on a bicycle was charged on Friday with aggravated mayhem and attempted robbery, prosecutors said."
312,"Lenrey Briones, who was taken into custody earlier this week in the attacks, which disfigured seven of his victims and left parts of America's second-largest city on edge, faces a possible sentence of life in prison if found guilty. "
313,"Briones did not enter a plea to the charges during a brief initial appearance in Los Angeles Superior Court on Friday where he was ordered held on $9 million bail, said Paul Eakins of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. "
314,"It was not clear if Briones had an attorney. He was serving three years probation for a September 2018 arson conviction at the time of his arrest, Eakins said."
315,"Briones is accused of slashing the faces of nine people, seemingly at random, as he rode a mountain bike through Los Angeles, South Gate and Lynwood between March 20 and April 1. Victims included men, women and a 13-year-old boy, prosecutors said. "
316,"He was charged with seven counts of aggravated mayhem, two counts of attempted aggravated mayhem, and one count of attempted robbery, with allegations that he used a dangerous weapon in commission of the crimes and attempted to steal a purse from a female victim."
317,Briones was taken into custody shortly after 1 p.m. on Wednesday near a homeless camp in the city where a bike resembling the one used by the slasher was found.
318,"Los Angeles police officials say they were tipped off to Briones after releasing photo and video images of the suspect in attacks, which often took place in broad daylight. "
319,"The latest two slashings occurred on Monday when officers responding to a radio call at around 8:40 p.m. found a man suffering from a severe wound to the left side of his face. About 15 minutes later, a young woman was cut by the same assailant."

321,"Last week, a college admissions bribery scandal made the news. In fact, we asked students for their responses. Today, we ask about the parental behavior that may give rise to such situations."
322,"How involved do you think parents should be in their children’s lives? What can young people do if they feel their parents are crossing lines in trying to ensure things like academic success, placement on sports teams and, yes, acceptance at their top-choice college or university?"
323,"In “How Parents Are Robbing Their Children of Adulthood,” Claire Cain Miller and Jonah Engel Bromwich describe “snowplow parents” who, in trying to “keep their children’s futures obstacle-free,” prevent their children from learning necessary skills and having experiences that will help them prepare for challenges they’ll face in college and beyond. They write:"
324,"It starts early, when parents get on wait lists for elite preschools before their babies are born and try to make sure their toddlers are never compelled to do anything that may frustrate them. It gets more intense when school starts: running a forgotten assignment to school or calling a coach to request that their child make the team."
325,"Later, it’s writing them an excuse if they procrastinate on schoolwork, paying a college counselor thousands of dollars to perfect their applications or calling their professors to argue about a grade."
326,"… Learning to solve problems, take risks and overcome frustration are crucial life skills, many child development experts say, and if parents don’t let their children encounter failure, the children don’t acquire them. When a 3-year-old drops a dish and breaks it, she’s probably going to try not to drop it the next time. When a 20-year-old sleeps through a test, he’s probably not going to forget to set his alarm again."
327,"Snowplowing has gone so far, they say, that many young people are in crisis, lacking these problem-solving skills and experiencing record rates of anxiety. There are now classes to teach children to practice failing, at college campuses around the country and even for preschoolers."
328,"Students, read the entire article, then tell us:"
329,"— What, if anything, from the article resonates with you, either based on your experiences or on what you have witnessed with friends and classmates?"
330,"— Does anyone you know fit the description of a “snowplow parent”? If so, what examples can you give about the person’s words or actions to support your claim?"
331,— Why do you think some parents try to shield their children from difficulty? Make a list of the advantages and disadvantages — both short- and long-term — that these children may have.
332,"— What are some signs that parents should stop doing things like waking their children in the morning, interceding with coaches, teachers or employers, and setting up playdates? Or is there a certain age at which the child should no longer have such things happen?"
333,"— The article mentions Cathy Tran, a senior at the University of Pennsylvania and the daughter of people who immigrated from Vietnam who did not attend college. Ms. Tran states, “I actually think that I have a sense of independence and confidence in myself in a way that some of my friends whose parents attended college might not have.” Do you think Ms. Tran’s experience might be common among other young people in her situation? Why or why not?"
334,"— In “Building Grit in Girls Through Mountain Biking,” another recent article about resilience and young people, A.C. Shilton writes about how mountain biking helps participants find strength in themselves, in part by having no place for parents to be involved:"
335,"Even better: Parents are often left sitting in cars at the trailhead. “Parents are parents,” she says, and every now and then one gets aggressive about his or her child’s performance. But as soon as the kids ride off and into the woods, they’re free to recreate on their own terms."
336,"What they do, once they get into those woods, can be pretty empowering. “There’s a certain work ethic you have to have to be a mountain biker,” said Annika Peacock, who is now 15. “If there’s a section of the trail that’s really hard for me, I’ll go try it five more times. I say to myself, yes, yes, yes, I can do this.” And then the next day? “I go back and do it again.” She now competes against other teens as part of the National Interscholastic Cycling Association, an organization working to bring mountain biking programs to high schools throughout the United States."
337,"Annika’s mother says of her daughter, “She’s this petite little bundle of smiles, but she has this self-talk inside her that says ‘I can do this’, and she will ride and re-ride something until she gets it. There’s this resilience she’s trained in herself. She’s fierce.”"
338,"Are there any activities you’ve taken part in that are similarly empowering? To what degree, if at all, do those activities limit or prevent parental interference?"
339,"Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public."

341,"When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly called off the L train shutdown, he upended years of careful planning to ensure that 275,000 displaced riders were not left stranded in an L-pocalypse."
342,"Now, even as officials forge ahead with a widely debated alternate plan, many transit advocates are calling for those contingency measures — more bus and ferry service, new bike lanes, traffic restrictions — to be put in place even with no shutdown. The planned changes, they say, are still needed in a growing city facing critical transportation challenges from congestion to a broken subway system."
343,"Why turn back, they say, when so much of the groundwork is done. Bike routes have been expanded. Bus lanes have been painted, and the skeletons of bus fare machines have been installed on sidewalks. New bus and ferry services have been announced."
344,"“What we have in front of us is a city that has to expand our transportation system,” said Ydanis Rodriguez, the chairman of the City Council’s transportation committee. “We have an opportunity to become the most pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly city in the whole nation.”"
345,"But critics counter that some of the changes would turn their neighborhoods into testing grounds for transit experiments that focus largely on moving commuters, and that the plans should be re-evaluated and weighed against the safety, health and quality of life of residents."
346,"Across the country, cities are grappling with similar issues as they try to reimagine their aging and increasingly inefficient transportation networks for modern needs. Many cities have overhauled subways and buses to attract more riders, and redesigned streets to make more room for cyclists, pedestrians and green spaces. They have embraced a host of initiatives to raise money for public transportation and reduce congestion and pollution."
347,"San Francisco has transit-only lanes on 30 miles of streets and plans to add 20 more miles in the next decade. It has even highlighted some busy lanes with red paint to make them more visible to drivers, resulting in fewer cars blocking the lanes, transit officials said."
348,"Portland, Ore., is spending millions to promote walking and cycling in its downtown area, and working to make bus service faster and more reliable. It has also offered incentives to commuters to take alternative transportation, including a program that gives free transit passes to those who turn in their city-issued parking permits."
349,"“Major cities across the country face the same challenges, and they are likely to only get worse unless we take action now,” Chloe Eudaly, Portland’s transportation commissioner, said. “Investment in our active transportation infrastructure and increasing ridership on public transit is critical to preserving and maintaining the livability of our city and our planet.”"
350,"In New York, there are more alternatives than ever for subway riders who tire of delays and overcrowding. Ferry routes will serve all five boroughs next year. New bus lanes are being installed at an average of seven miles a year, for a total of 111 miles so far, with city officials planning to pick up the pace. The city’s network of bike lanes has grown to 1,240 miles, including 300 miles of bike lanes added to streets since 2014 alone."
351,"But the 15-month shutdown of the L train had been the catalyst for faster and more sweeping changes. It spurred the installation of more Manhattan crosstown bike lanes — cyclists complain that there are not enough — on 12th and 13th Streets, and a bike lane on Delancey Street to keep cyclists moving on and off the Williamsburg Bridge, the city’s busiest bicycle bridge crossing with 7,300 trips per day."
352,"The city’s first “busway,” or bus-only corridor, was designed to restrict car and truck traffic on 14th Street. Officials also planned to impose high-occupancy-vehicle requirements on the Williamsburg Bridge: Private vehicles with fewer than three passengers — including taxis and ride-hailing cars — would be barred from using the bridge between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. to make room for a fleet of new temporary buses carrying displaced L riders."
353,"Under the alternate plan backed by Mr. Cuomo, weekday L train service — including during morning and evening rush hours — will remain unchanged, and repairs will be carried out at night and on weekends, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
354,"The agency plans to increase bus and subway service — including on the G, M and 7 lines — to accommodate L riders affected by the construction, but has not yet released specific details. Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman, said no final decisions had been made on other specific plans or services in the previous shutdown plan."
355,An M.T.A. draft memo obtained recently by Streetsblog NYC suggested that there would no longer be a need for the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge and the new ferry service. Mr. Tarek said the memo was outdated and that options were still being studied.
356,"Veronique Hakim, the M.T.A.’s managing director, said the agency was seeking public input and working with city officials to come up with a new plan “serving the needs of our customers while being sensitive to local communities.” The plan would be constantly monitored and adjusted as needed, she added."
357,"“New Yorkers can be certain that the alternate service plan for the new and improved L project will include additional transportation options designed to accommodate every affected L customer,” she said."
358,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
359,"Still, Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University, said that without the pressure of a looming shutdown, “there is now a risk that momentum will be lost,” adding that “planning for bus lanes, better ferries and more bike options is hard enough without sudden shifts in policy.”"
360,City officials would not answer questions about whether specific contingency measures would go forward or the costs incurred in planning for the shutdown.
361,"Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a recent news conference that the city was evaluating the new L train plan to decide “if there’s anything that we were planning that is no longer needed because of the L train, but that we might want to do anyway.”"
362,"The mayor has made improving bus service a priority, and many transit advocates said he could start by keeping the new bus lanes that are already on the ground."
363,"“It would be lame to peel a bus lane off after pledging in his state of the city to get bus riders moving,” Jon Orcutt, a former city transportation official, said. “These are standing city policies and — L train shutdown or no L train shutdown — they should continue to be city policies and programs.”"
364,"Even without a shutdown, commuters will need backup options during “the great L train slowdown” on nights and weekends, said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders. He added, “We can’t just go back to the norm and pretend nothing’s happening.”"
365,"The uncertainty about the alternate plan has also raised concerns among New Yorkers. On the Lower East Side, residents had braced for more gridlock and air pollution from the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge. Now they do not know what to expect. Susan Stetzer, the manager of a local community board, said she remained concerned “about all the unknowns.”"
366,"The 14th Street Coalition, which represents more than two dozen residential buildings, block associations and businesses in the West Village, Chelsea and Flatiron neighborhoods, has called for officials to abandon the plans for a busway and wider pedestrian areas on 14th Street — which in some places would narrow the street to two lanes from four lanes — and restrictions that would divert car and truck traffic to nearby streets. Some residents also want the crosstown bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets removed."
367,"Judy Pesin, 66, a member of the coalition, said the 14th Street changes would restrict deliveries to homes and businesses, slow down emergency vehicles, and make it harder for older people, parents with young children and those with disabilities to access cars."
368,"“Clearly the change in plans means it’s time to listen to the community,’’ she said, “because the commuters are still going to have a moving L train.”"
369,Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is easier in some neighborhoods than others. But which ones?
370,"To determine the healthiest places to live in New York City, StreetEasy recently analyzed data from its listings, along with information from Yelp and the city’s Open Data portal."
371,"For each neighborhood, the company considered the number and availability of bike rooms and bike lanes; gyms, pools and other fitness facilities; medical offices and health centers; and parks, community gardens and athletic fields. (All of the information was weighted per capita, and neighborhoods with fewer than 3,000 residents were excluded.)"
372,"The company also partnered with Seamless, the takeout-food app, to find out which areas had the most restaurants that would accommodate requests for healthy food — things like specifying brown rice over white. "
373,"Not surprisingly, most of the top 10 neighborhoods on the list were in the outer boroughs. Parks and open space were a big part of the reason, and the relative affordability was no doubt a mental-health bonus."

427,COPENHAGEN — Can a city cancel out its greenhouse gas emissions?
428,"Copenhagen intends to, and fast. By 2025, this once-grimy industrial city aims to be net carbon neutral, meaning it plans to generate more renewable energy than the dirty energy it consumes."
429,"Here’s why it matters to the rest of the world: Half of humanity now lives in cities, and the vast share of planet-warming gases come from cities. The big fixes for climate change need to come from cities too. They are both a problem and a potential source of solutions. "
430,"The experience of Copenhagen, home to 624,000 people, can show what’s possible, and what’s tough, for other urban governments on a warming planet. "
431,"The mayor, Frank Jensen, said cities “can change the way we behave, the way we are living, and go more green.” His city has some advantages. It is small, it is rich and its people care a lot about climate change."
432,"Mr. Jensen said mayors, more than national politicians, felt the pressure to take action. “We are directly responsible for our cities and our citizens, and they expect us to act,” he said."
433,"Want climate news in your inbox? Sign up here for Climate Fwd:, our email newsletter."
434,"In the case of Copenhagen, that means changing how people get around, how they heat their homes, and what they do with their trash. The city has already cut its emissions by 42 percent from 2005 levels, mainly by moving away from fossil fuels to generate heat and electricity. "
435,"Politics, though, is making it hard to go further. A municipal government can only do so much when it doesn’t have the full support of those who run the country. Mr. Jensen, 57, a left-of-center Social Democrat, for instance, has failed to persuade the national government, led by a center-right party, to impose restrictions on diesel-guzzling vehicles in the capital. Transportation accounts for a third of the city’s carbon footprint; it is the largest single sector and it is growing."
436,"By contrast, the national government, in a move that its critics say encouraged private car use, has lowered car-registration taxes. The transportation minister, Ole Birk Olesen, said the government wanted to reduce what he called “the over-taxation of cars,” though he added that, ideally, Danes would buy only zero-emissions cars in the coming decades."
437,"And so, Copenhagen’s goal to be carbon neutral faces a hurdle that is common around the world: a divide between the interests of people who live in cities and those who live outside. "
438,"Many opposition politicians and independent analysts say they doubt Copenhagen can meet its 2025 target, and some critics say the plan focuses too much on trying to balance the city’s carbon books rather than change the way people actually live."
439,"“We run around in fossil fuel burning cars, we eat a lot of meat, we buy a hell of a lot of clothes,” said Fanny Broholm, a spokeswoman for Alternativet, a left-of-center green party. “The goal is not ambitious enough as it is, and we can’t even reach this goal.”"
440,"Mr. Jensen, for his part, is bullish on what he calls the capital’s “green transformation.” City officials say this is only the start."
441,"A new Metro line, scheduled to open this year, will put the vast majority of the city’s residents within 650 meters, a bit less than half a mile, of a station. Bicycle paths are already three lanes wide on busy routes for the whopping 43 percent of Copenhageners who commute to work and school by bike — even on wet, windy days, which are plentiful. "
442,"All that wind helps generate the city’s electricity. Buildings are heated, in part, by burning garbage in a new high-tech incinerator — what garbage there is to burn, that is, considering that every apartment building now has eight separate recycling bins. For every unit of fossil fuels it consumes, Copenhagen intends to sell units of renewable energy. The city has invested heavily in wind turbines."
443,"In big cities, you have the money and the scale to change things, Mr. Jensen said as he led me on a bike tour from City Hall, where excavations for a new Metro station recently turned up the remains of two Vikings. We crossed a bicycle bridge that led to a once-industrial district, now home to trendy restaurants. "
444,"As we rode, Mr. Jensen talked about parliamentary polls set for this spring. “Elections will come up in the next few months, and a lot of people living in the suburbs still have diesel cars,” he said. “It’s a political challenge. It’s not a technological challenge.” "
445,"For Copenhagen, the path to carbon neutrality is paved with imperfect solutions."
446,"Some of the city’s power plants have switched from coal to wood pellets, shipped in from the Baltics. That’s carbon neutral, in principle, if more trees can be planted in place of those that are cut down, and that has helped the city bring down its emissions significantly. But burning wood produces emissions; a lawsuit filed in the European Court of Justice argued that wood pellets should not count as renewable energy. Critics contend that big public investments in biomass only compel the city to use it for years to come."
447,"Then, there’s garbage. The city recently opened a $660 million incinerator, 85 meters tall, or about 280 feet, resembling a shiny half-built pyramid, with an even taller stack. It’s just a short walk from one of the city’s most popular restaurants, Noma. Designed by one of the country’s best-known architects, Bjarke Ingels, it comes with a year-round ski slope to attract visitors (and recoup some of the expenses). The mayor was one of the first to take a test run."
448,"Every day, 300 trucks bring garbage to be fed into its enormous furnace, including trash imported from Britain. That has a carbon footprint, too. But the chief engineer, Peter Blinksbjerg, pointed out that instead of going into a landfill, the rubbish of modern life is transformed into something useful: heat for the city’s long, cold winters."
449,"Scrubbers remove most chemical pollutants before releasing steam into the air. By summer, a cafe is set to open in the shadow of the stack."
450,"Pedaling through the city these days, it is difficult to imagine what Copenhagen once looked like. There were factories in the narrow streets and ships in the oil-stained harbor. Coal-fired power plants brought electricity. The air was smoggy. A generation of city dwellers moved out to the clean-air suburbs."
451,"Today, even on wintry, wet days, commuters move along a busy bike highway that connects the warrens of the oldest part of the city, where some buildings date to the 1400s, to the northern neighborhoods, whizzing past the stately apartment blocks that overlook the lake. The bike lane is slightly elevated above the car lane, which feels safer than just a white line that demarcates bike lanes in many other cities."
452,"Inside a cozy neighborhood cafe, a medical student named Mariam Hleihel said she welcomed Mr. Jensen’s efforts to reduce the number of polluting cars in the city. “If we don’t do anything about it now, the consequences could be irreversible,” she said."
453,"She reflected a widespread sentiment among Danes. A 2018 survey by Concito, a think tank, found that addressing climate change was a top issue for voters. Slightly more than half of those polled said they would need to change their way of life to tackle global warming."
454,"Simone Nordfalk, a cashier at a bountiful outdoor vegetable market, considered the prospect of changing eating habits for the sake of climate change. Figs had been shipped in from Brazil. Strawberries from Spain. It would be tough to return to how Danes ate a generation ago. “I don’t think that’s going to happen,” she said. “It sells.”"
455,"Copenhagen is girding itself for the impact of climate change, too. The rains are more intense, and the sea is rising. In the most vulnerable neighborhoods, the city is creating new parks and ponds for water to collect before it can drain out. There are new dikes by the harbor, and a proposal to build a new island in the northeast to block storm surges."
456,"Politically speaking, public apprehension about climate change may be the strongest wind in the mayor’s sails. "
457,"“People are honestly concerned about it,” said Klaus Bondam, a former politician and now head of a bicyclists’ lobby. “You are an extremely tone deaf politician if you don’t hear that.”"
458,Martin Selsoe Sorensen contributed reporting.
459,"For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter."
460,"The title of Ivan Ayr’s debut feature is a bit misleading: “Soni” is only partly about the titular cop (Geetika Vidya Ohlyan); her immediate superior in the Delhi police department, Kalpana (Saloni Batra), plays an equal role in this quiet character study. Despite their difference in rank, the two women forge a reserved friendship after Soni blows a fuse during an undercover operation — verbally harassed while biking at night, she gives the offender a piece of her mind, and her fists."
461,"While the film is set among cops, it does not involve any crime solving."
462,"Relying almost exclusively on single-take scenes and eschewing music, Ayr details the obstacles in Soni and Kalpana’s way with low-key, quasi-documentary detachment. At its best, that pace creates a trance-like feel, but a few scenes extend their welcome and become plodding."
463,"In this world, men casually assume they are entitled to say or do whatever they want to women, and the slightest interactions can become fraught. After the biking episode, Soni is transferred to the police switchboard and watches as a caller asks an operator for her personal number. Even a women’s restroom becomes a contested space."
464,The pressure is less overt but just as constant at home. Soni’s ex-boyfriend (Vikas Shukla) sweetly but insistently tries to talk her into a reconciliation. Kalpana’s mother-in-law keeps asking how long she’ll have to wait for a grandchild.
465,"Kalpana’s calm never wavers while Soni struggles, usually unsuccessfully, to control her temper amid the casual machismo. Ayr does not offer any tension-releasing catharsis, making his film efficiently disquieting in its own unassuming manner."

478,Barry Diller’s park
479,"Initially, the plan for a new park on the West Side of Manhattan was modest, and the billionaire Barry Diller was tapped to help fund it. “He embraced the notion, but brought in his own experts and commissioned a space age structure,” The New York Times reported in 2017."
480,"Before Mr. Diller got involved, the park was projected to cost $35 million; its budget has since ballooned to $250 million."
481, Jeff Bezos’ planned helipad
482,"When Amazon was looking to open a major campus, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio lured it with nearly $3 billion in tax incentives and waterfront property in Long Island City. “They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive,” The Times’s J. David Goodman reported last year. (Could you imagine him taking the 7 train?)"

503,It’s hard to overstate the revolutionary impact that bicycles have had on mankind.
504,"Paved roads were made for cyclists, not drivers, one author has argued."
505,"The Times’s Natalie Angier wrote, “Bicycles also gave birth to our national highway system.” And Ms. Angier also noted that suffragist Susan B. Anthony said, “I think it has done more to emancipate women than any one thing in the world.”"
506,"There are, of course, more recent examples of the impact of bicycles."
507,"In 2008, an East Harlem resident, Dulcie Canton, had not just one but half a dozen jobs: dog-walking, cat-sitting, fine-arts modeling, coffee shop barista, just to name a few. And she biked to each of them. Why? “I was struggling to make MetroCard money,” she said in a recent interview."
508,"“I thought of cycling as a way to save money, going to my gigs,” Ms. Canton said. Besides, she added, “mass transit is crazy.”"
509,"So, she hopped on her bike and rode. Later, Ms. Canton connected with other female cyclists of color through groups like Black Girls Do Bike and Brown Bike Girl. “I felt like I found my family,” she said."
510,"Ms. Canton now works as the Brooklyn organizer for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that promotes bicycle and pedestrian-friendly policies."
511,"The “first human-powered two-wheeled machines,” debuted in New York in 1819, according to a news release from the Museum of the City of New York. Those machines did not have pedals, and riders mainly coasted. Those machines were called velocipedes."
512,Bicycles have evolved a lot since then.
513,"On Thursday, the museum will open the exhibit “Cycling in the City: A 200-Year History.” It will explore the history and cultures of cycling, as well as the machines themselves. The exhibit includes 150 objects, 14 bicycles and three stationary bicycles."

517,I was stepping up to order at Planet Smoothie in Penn Station when a man who had just gotten a smoothie stomped back to the counter.
518,“What’s in this?” he said.
519,The cashier looked nonplused.
520,"“Which one did you order, again?” he said."
521,The man waved at the board on the wall. The cashier continued to have a nervous look on his face.
522,"“It looks like strawberries, blueberries, nonfat yogurt,” he said."
523,"“I can read,” the man said. “But it doesn’t taste like it.”"
524,The people waiting behind me began to shuffle impatiently. The cashier shrugged and shifted his feet. Two other employees moved in closer. I started contemplating whether a smoothie was worth waiting out this scene for.
525,“I can make you another one if you like?” the cashier said.
526,There was a pause.
527,"“Nope, that’s all right, it’s good, ” the man said. “I like it, and I was just hoping for the recipe to make it at home.”"

531,"The first challenge you face on arriving somewhere new is usually how to get around, but the right technology can make it easier. There are tools suited to specific destinations, or to modes of transport, whether you want to hail a ride in Tel Aviv, explore Paris by scooter or catch a bus from Bangkok to Chiang Mai."
532,"Here are some free transportation apps, beyond the usual Google Maps and Google Translate, to consider downloading before your next trip."
533,"Sometimes walking is faster than taking the bus, or the most direct route includes a tram and a bike ride. Citymapper helps you figure all that out, and it works in 39 cities around the world, including Tokyo, Copenhagen and Sydney. Plug in your starting and ending points, and get a list of possible routes organized by mode of transport. The app also displays trip duration and any applicable prices (like estimated cab or subway fares), along with tips for where to sit on the train and which station exit to use to reach your destination faster."
534,"You can receive alerts when it’s time to disembark, and when there are line delays or closures. You can even use it to plan your daily commute, and get a warning to leave before you’re late for work, or estimates on when you’ll get home depending on when you leave the office. The app also shows how many shared bikes and free bike spaces are available at a given location in real time, making pickup and drop-off more efficient."
535,"Depending on your destination, you may have to break your Uber or Lyft habit when you arrive: the former is banned in several European countries and parts of Australia, and operates in a gray area in others, like in Hong Kong . The latter only operates in the United States."
536,"You may also prefer to hail rides from licensed taxis. You don’t have to give up the convenience of an app to do it, though. Gett will get you a cab in Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom; and in New York City, the company has merged with ride-sharing platform Juno. Gett allows you to book a ride with an economy or higher-end car up to two weeks in advance, or on-demand. Like any good ride-sharing app, your driver’s location is displayed in real time while you wait to be picked up, but with Gett, you can pay in cash or through the app. "
537,"Taxify is a similar option that’s available in 60 cities across 29 countries, including throughout Europe and Africa. Like Uber or Lyft, its drivers are not actual taxi drivers however; the company is called Txfy in France to avoid confusion. Taxify offers different vehicle tiers, displays real-time driver location and it lets you pay through the app. Some destinations offer alternatives to cars. For example, you can hail motorcycles and auto-rickshaws in East Africa, and rent GPS-enabled scooters in Paris."
538,"If you want to explore Europe or North America without renting a car, Wanderu can help you find and book bus, train and ferry tickets instead. The app aggregates options from big-name carriers like Amtrak and Deutsche Bahn, as well as niche brands, like FlixBus and the Tallink Silja Line, a Baltic Sea ferry service."
539,"You can quickly sort options according to your schedule, budget and preferred mode of transport — maybe you want the cheapest overnight bus or the earliest luxury train."
540,"Currently, Wanderu has a separate flight finder powered by Skyscanner, but flights will be integrated into overall search results next year, so you’ll be able to see airfares along with ferries and ground transportation options in one place."
541,"A website called Bookaway provides a similar service in developing countries, including throughout Southeast Asia. You can search for bus, train and ferry options, and see whether a carrier offers amenities such as bathrooms and Wi-Fi before booking your tickets."

543,"After New York City and Amazon went to war over a new campus in Queens, the city is heading into battle with another tech giant: Uber."
544,"Mayor Bill de Blasio approved a yearlong cap on Uber vehicles last summer, making New York the first major American city to rein in the booming ride-hail company. Now Mr. de Blasio wants to extend the cap, prompting Uber to sue the city last week to overturn the law."
545,"Uber has fiercely opposed the cap, arguing that it hurts New Yorkers who rely on the app, especially outside Manhattan where there are fewer transit options. The lawsuit called the city’s regulatory approach “unfortunate, irresponsible and irrational.”"
546,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat with presidential ambitions, responded by saying the city’s new rules — both the cap and a measure to raise wages for drivers — were needed."
547,"“No legal challenge changes the fact that Uber made congestion on our roads worse and paid their drivers less than a living wage,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the mayor. “The city’s new laws aim to change that.”"
548,"Like many other cities across the world, New York is struggling to respond to the explosive growth of the ride-hailing industry. The influx of vehicles has raised concerns about street congestion, working conditions for drivers, the decimation of the yellow cab industry and the siphoning of riders from public transit."
549,"The lawsuit comes at a critical moment for Uber and its main competitor, Lyft, as both companies rush to go public. Uber, which could be valued as high as $120 billion, is likely to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company."
550,"The two ride-hail companies have bristled over new regulations in New York, Uber’s largest market in the United States. Lyft recently sued to stop the rules aimed at raising driver pay."
551,"Uber and Lyft are also battling each other to dominate New York’s thriving bike markets. Lyft bought Motivate, the company that operates CitiBike, the city’s popular bike-share program. Uber bought another bike company called Jump and began offering electric bikes in the Bronx and Staten Island."
552,"Uber supports the driver pay rules, but argued that the cap hurts drivers who want to join its app."
553,"“It is disappointing to see the de Blasio administration remain singularly focused on a cap that evidence suggests is doing nothing to relieve congestion while preventing thousands of New Yorkers from earning a living wage,” Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement."
554,Some business leaders worry that Amazon’s decision to abandon its deal with New York could hurt the city’s image as a tech hub.
555,"But Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the struggle with Uber is not a tech issue — it’s about worsening street traffic."
556,"“We’re not really afraid of being branded anti-tech,” Ms. Gelinas said. “In the long term, our problem is how do we deal with all of this growth — and not the risk that we’re going to drive away that growth with a little bit of rhetoric and a little regulation.”"
557,"Mr. de Blasio has a bitter history with Uber. When the mayor first proposed a cap in 2015, Uber launched an aggressive attack, introducing a “de Blasio view” in the company’s app to blame him for long wait times. Uber won the debate and became shorthand in his administration for an embarrassing defeat."
558,"But Uber was on the defensive last year when the cap idea was revived by Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker. Uber’s reputation had been harmed by accusations of gender discrimination and other scandals. It hired a new chief executive and a new leader for New York to try to improve its image."
559,"The number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 60,000 in 2015. But while Uber and other companies are flourishing, many of their drivers are not. About 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps, according to a study by prominent economists last year."
560,"The cap was expected to last a year while the city studied the proliferation of ride-hail trips. At the end of that period, the city’s taxi commission would review the number of vehicle licenses and decide on how they would be regulated."
561,"Last month, Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview that he wanted to ""put ongoing caps in place on the for-hire vehicles.” Officials at City Hall confirmed that the mayor was considering extending the cap."
562,"Uber’s lawsuit argues that it was not legal for the city to delegate the power to cap vehicles to the taxi commission. If Uber cannot meet growing rider demand, the lawsuit says that could hurt the state’s efforts to raise money for the subway through new fees on ride-hail trips."
563,"The lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in Manhattan, questions the city’s motives: “This is less a ‘study’ and more a ‘post hoc rationalization’ of a remedy the city appears to have already selected.”"
564,"Lyft also opposes a permanent cap. “Any extension of this misguided policy would do even more significant, long-term damage to drivers and riders,” Lyft said in a statement."
565,"The City Council is proud of the new regulations imposed on the ride-hailing industry and had the authority to approve them, said Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson. The speaker, his office said, wants the taxi commission to make a decision about any future limits on vehicles based on data from its study."
566,"The city’s taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi, recently announced that she was stepping down in March. Her successor will have a powerful role in determining the industry’s future."
567,"In a separate lawsuit, Lyft challenged the city’s rules to raise driver wages to more than $17 an hour. Lyft claims the rules give Uber an unfair advantage because it judges companies differently based on their “utilization rate,” or how often drivers have a passenger in their car versus driving around empty."
568,"The approach gives “the largest company with the biggest market share a built-in and perpetual advantage over companies with lower utilizations,” Lyft’s lawsuit said."
569,"Lyft has sold itself as the more ethical ride-hail option. But the lawsuit hurt its image among some riders like Brad Lander, a councilman from Brooklyn, who said he deleted the app."
570,"After facing harsh criticism, Lyft announced that it would comply with the new pay rules while its legal case proceeded."
571,"Uber and Lyft say they care about public policy, but the lawsuits show their first priority is self interest, said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who has closely studied the industry. The companies face a difficult challenge of balancing both profits and their public image. In this case, Mr. Schaller said, Uber chose to protect its bottom line."
572,"“Uber in particular has been playing super nice since its change in management a year ago and particularly as they get closer to the I.P.O.,” he said. “Suing the biggest city in the country isn’t playing super nice.”"
573,“I saw you.”
574,I swallowed hard and looked up at my therapist.
575,I began a rapid mental inventory of where I’d been in the week since our last meeting. Had I done anything incriminating?
576,"I finally licked my dry lips and asked, “Where?”"
577,"“At spin class,” she said, calmly."
578,Spinning was something that she had suggested. To help me relax. Take my mind off things.
579,"“At Bernie’s class,” she continued."
580,"Bernie was my favorite spin instructor. He played classic rock instead of techno music, which made the grueling 60-minute class feel more like a bearable 45."
581,“How do you feel about my presence there?” she pressed.
582,"“It’s fine,” I said, waving my hand. “I mean, it’s not like anyone there knows you’re my therapist.”"
583,"“True,” she said. “But you do.”"
584,"“I don’t care,” I replied. “It’s a gym! Everyone is allowed in.”"
585,"Therapists must run into their patients all the time, right? I later wondered if there was any policy on how it’s supposed to be handled, so I reached out the American Psychological Association to ask."
586,"“There isn’t any specific ethical or best practice guidance,” said Vaile Wright, the association’s director of research and special projects. But she said that generally, therapists should let clients take the lead. “So if they say ‘hi’ to you on the street, you would respond in kind. If they ignore you, you would respond in kind.”"
587,"So, my therapist hadn’t done anything wrong."
588,"But when I spotted her on the stationary bike directly in front of me at the next class, her black ponytail stuck to the back of her neck, I realized that I didn’t feel as Zen as I’d thought I would. She probably knew more about me than I knew about myself."
589,"When our eyes met in the mirror, I quickly looked away. I had to wonder if she was observing me and if she could feel the unease her presence was causing. Had she taken this class to spy on me?"
590,"But I knew it was a mere coincidence. After all, as the self proclaimed “Spin Master,” Bernie had a devoted following in this Northern New Jersey town. People enjoyed his playlists as well as the show he put on. His raunchy jokes and random factoids about various musicians and their lyrics as well as his unique dance moves on and off the bike made spinning with Bernie feel more like you were watching a stand-up comedian perform than exercising. That and the gym’s proximity to my shrink’s office made her presence understandable."
591,"Once when we ran into each other while filling our water bottles, my heart skipped a beat. I smiled briefly in her direction and she smiled back. I turned around and made a beeline for my stationary bike. It was like being a child seeing a teacher outside the classroom, going about everyday life. Seeing her participate in a basic activity was, somehow, disappointing. She had no weight to lose. She shouldn’t have to spin. She was better than that."
592,"I’d been seeing her for a year to help keep my anxiety in check, and I knew that she had the mental skills to cope with all of life’s tribulations. In other words, she was beyond spinning."
593,"In the months that followed, she never mentioned our new-shared bond. Had she forgotten that we had climbed that same outrageously long hill with Tina Turner’s help? Because I hadn’t. Mornings, when I searched for a parking space outside the spin studio, I instinctively looked around for her white Toyota. On the days when I spotted it, my jaw tightened while my hands gripped the steering wheel. Stop overreacting, I told myself. She’s riding a bike in the same room with you. Who cares?"
594,"But I did care. I wanted to tell her, “Get out of my class! How dare you. You are making me uncomfortable and you should know that!”"
595,"Was it possible she didn’t know what spin class meant to me? It was an excuse to ignore my phone, let go of my anxieties and allow the music to whisk me back to my glory days. I purposely went to a gym outside of my town so I didn’t have to chitchat with other mothers and feign concern about our kids’ upcoming social studies project or the latest changes to the soccer schedule. I wanted anonymity and a way to burn off the cupcake or wine I indulged in the previous night."
596,At spin class I could pedal away my fear that my career was stagnating as well as my perpetual worry that I wasn’t a happy enough mother. I wanted to spin in peace.
597,"It was not a place that I wanted to share with my shrink, who reminded me of my anxiety — the reason I was in therapy."
598,"So, in our next therapy session, instead of studiously ignoring the fact that we’d been sweating together for four months, I had to tell her that we could no longer share Bernie. He was mine — not hers. But when I looked into her dark, compassionate eyes, I said, “Bernie has a great playlist, doesn’t he?”"
599,"She smiled and asked, “Is it weird for you to see me in class?”"
600,"I wanted to say, “No. Of course not.” I wanted to be a woman so comfortable in her skin that sharing a spin class with her therapist didn’t bother her."
601,"But I wasn’t that person. According to my therapist, I was a person who needed to speak up when I was upset instead of carrying around a simmering rage."
602,Exposing my true feelings felt dangerous. What if my feelings were wrong or worse — what if I was overreacting?
603,"“Well,” I said. I wanted to look down at my feet, but I forced myself to maintain eye contact. “I have to admit that it is weird to see you in class. It makes me feel,” I paused. “Awkward.”"
604,"Not the most assertive response, but it was all I could manage. To avoid conflict, I almost always kept any feelings of discomfort to myself."
605,"She looked me in the eye and said, “I’m glad you said something. We’re making progress.”"
606,"I unclenched my jaw, let my shoulders sink into the leather couch behind me and listened to my heart rate slow down. I wondered if she had she planned all of this. Was she testing me? Was she going to quit Bernie? It didn’t matter."
607,"The anger quickly melted away when I told her how I felt. It was a sensation I had never before experienced. I wanted to jump up off the couch and hug her, but I decided it was best to remain seated. We had plenty of other issues to discuss before my session was up."
608,Addie Morfoot is a journalist and screenwriter who is completing her first novel. 
609,"In a dive bar underneath the Williamsburg Bridge in Brooklyn, fans of an obscure soccer team gathered after an entire workday of information blackout. They spent their Tuesday avoiding calls from family members and social media in its entirety because they didn’t want to spoil the outcome of a match that technically ended long ago, halfway across the world in Germany."
610,"When their team scored what would be their only goal of the game, the supporters chanted raucously for “the boys in brown,” thrusting their pints in the air, none the wiser that it was, as it frequently has been, already a lost cause."
611,"“One of the biggest crimes you could commit with this group is to mention you know the outcome,” said Karl Paranya, who lives in the neighborhood and has been watching the matches since he first stumbled into East River Bar about seven years back. “It can be a bit awkward because our cries don’t do anything for a team that finished eight hours ago, but it feels the same for us.”"
612,"The team they follow is F.C. St. Pauli, a tiny club whose games no cable soccer package broadcasts live; it would be like expecting to find an Orlando Solar Bears hockey game on ESPN."
613,"But what draws Mr. Paranya and the rest of the supporters here is the team’s unusual politics: F.C. St. Pauli is an avowed anti-fascist soccer team based in Hamburg that plays in Germany’s second division and hasn’t won the title in more than 40 years, though it runs a kindergarten inside the stadium, which displays signs proclaiming “no person is illegal.” The club has a worldwide, international fandom that defines itself in opposition to the racism and violence that characterizes European football hooliganism."
614,"The East River Pirates, as they’re known, are still only maybe one of 10 supporters’ groups in North America, and the only official one in the city. As such, East River Bar has become an unlikely spiritual home for German tourists, as well as a set of extremely devoted American fans who are far more interested in the team for their politics than whether or not they’re in possession of the ball at any given time."
615,"“It’s not like we’re that invested in the game play or the results,” said Shawn Roggenkamp, age 32, who helps coordinate the loose gathering of fans. “But it is a reason for us to get together every week and bring this group of people together who maybe wouldn’t have found each other any other way.”"
616,"East River Bar, which began as paint factory and was also a biker hangout in a previous life, was purchased about 15 years ago by Marek Gregorski, a Polish expatriate. His intention was originally to serve food, though he said the money for that part of the business fell through. The cheap drinks, cavernous space, and location next to the Williamsburg Bridge soon attracted a specific clientele, which Mr. Gregorski happily catered to. “At some point we started to get some bike messengers, more and more of them, and we became a staple for hosting messengers and their parties,” Mr. Gregorski said. “They get off work, and this is their first stop to get a beer and relax a little bit.”"
617,"The Pirates, who celebrated their 10th anniversary this past November, were initially regarded as oddballs at East River, which is decidedly not a sports bar, unless you count billiards or biking. Out front, there’s a sign featuring an enormous gear and a vending machine selling spare inner tubes. The backyard has communal grills for customer barbecues in warm weather. The inside is sparsely decorated, and being a classic dive, contains only a couple of tiny televisions that are always on but no one pays much attention to. A regular game day will bring a mix of bike punks, New York soccer heads, and Germans on a pilgrimage to watch St. Pauli on a giant projector screen instead."
618,"Ms. Roggenkamp, who works for the auction house Christie’s, was introduced to the cult of St. Pauli about five years ago when she was studying German through a private program. A classmate took her to watch a game at East River. Over the next year and a half, she slowly started to take on a leadership role in the supporters’ club. In keeping with the team’s philosophy, that typically involves passing a collection cup for charity during halftime. The ritual takes on an air of communion — a characterization that Ms. Roggenkamp agrees with."
619,"“I was having a conversation about it with one of my friends the other day,” she said. “And he was like, ‘You talk about this as if it’s your church group.’”"
620,"Jah Jah Brown, half of the Brooklyn-based rap duo known as Ninjasonik, has been coming to watch games at East River Bar for the past six years because he’s enamored with the team’s politics. He said that German tourists regularly walk into the bar, which is typically full of bicycles, and have to ask, “Are we in the right spot?”"
621,"In fact, the bar is a bridge between the two nations. Mr. Paranya remembered being with a Turkish friend years ago and lamenting that he didn’t have a geographical allegiance to a soccer team as an American. The friend immediately pegged him as a would-be St. Pauli fan, though the comment was initially forgotten. Years later, he and his wife popped into East River Bar for a beer, where a game happened to be screening. After about five minutes, he realized who was playing. “I remembered that I was supposed to like these guys,” Mr. Paranya said. “By the end of the game I was singing all the songs and had purchased a T-shirt.” A few years later, he took a trip to Germany, which he described as a pretense to visit St. Pauli’s stadium. He wore his supporters shirt and made about “20 new best friends,” some of which he now sees occasionally when they come to visit the United States and make their obligatory trip to Williamsburg."
622,"With about 10 minutes left in the game that Tuesday, the other team scored, though not many fans seemed to notice. When they sunk another goal and things seemed good and over, one of the Pirates’ organizers, Sören Thode, switched the broadcast to a YouTube video of the German entertainer Hans Albers’s ode about the Reeperbahn — the red-light district district of working-class Hamburg. People finished their beers and said their goodbyes until the next match on Monday afternoon, though they, of course, wouldn’t be watching until nightfall."
623,"The whirring bikes streaked over the rough ribbon of asphalt through the Sahara in Mauritania, and the intensity of the landscape shifted."
624,"Miles of flat, desolate sand stretched to the horizon in all directions, dissolving into an immense dome of pale blue."
625,The sun in the cloudless sky was so searing it had bleached the bones of a camel protruding from the sand.
626,"A headwind, relentless and gusting, drained legs and thrashed the robe of a tribesman striding along on the roadside."
627,"Then there were the tractor-trailers. Every 10 minutes or so, an oncoming rig appeared in the distance, gathering sheets of swirling sand in its wake. With only two tight lanes, the best recourse was to grip your handlebars and duck as the truck roared by, its vortex jerking the front of your bike and sandblasting every piece of uncovered skin."
628,"In the fast-growing category of adventure cycling vacations, it’s safe to say that this one — West Africa en Vélo, TDA Global Cycling’s first expedition through West Africa — was on the extreme end. Not just for the duration — nearly 4,000 miles through seven countries and one disputed territory over 10 weeks, averaging about 70 miles a day — but for the location. The region has been more associated with civil war, disease and extremists than bucket-list challenges. But as political and economic stability has increased in recent years, so has the number of foreign tourists."
629,"The idea was to cycle and camp from Casablanca to Cape Coast in Ghana, through the Atlas Mountains in Morocco, the desert in Western Sahara and Mauritania, and rolling farmland, tropical forests or palm-fringed shores in Senegal, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast and Ghana."

650,"Dozens of cyclists signed on for the trip, which cost $12,900 for the entire 72-day, 3,865-mile ride; those, like me, who joined for a two-week section, paid $2,900. "
651,"Riders — most in their 50s and older, many from North America and Europe, and a third of them women — brought their own bikes and camping gear, which was carried ahead each day in a truck. A van would stop and set up lunch around the halfway point of each ride, while tour leaders covered the route in SUVs, with a staff member riding sweep behind the group. Those who couldn’t complete the day’s section could hitch a ride on one of the vehicles. "
652,"Most people on the ride were strong cyclists and veterans of one or more TDA tours, keen to conquer a new frontier. They do the rides because they have the money, the time and the inclination, and for deeper reasons tied to wanderlust, ego, camaraderie and mortality. "
653,"“Multiple times when we go out on a ride in the course of a day, you get something that’s extremely tiring or exhausting,” said David Jones 61, a former candy company executive from Toronto. “And just as you’re thinking, ‘Geez, man I don’t want to do this,’ the road turns and you get a tailwind, or you get brand-new pavement or smiling kids at a village. I think it’s a great place to learn the benefit of hanging in there, just keeping at it.”"
654,"I joined the tour in late October, 1,100 miles into the ride in Western Sahara, the disputed territory south of Morocco that is claimed by that country and the Polisario Front separatist movement.  This two-week section would stretch 800 miles down the coast through Mauritania and into Dakar, the boisterous capital of Senegal. On my first morning, I pedaled hard for a half an hour to catch two riders ahead of me as the sun rose over the desert."
655,"The pair — Annegrete Warrer, 65, who lives in Austria, and Hanne Renland, 62, of Norway — had met on their flight from Paris to Casablanca three weeks earlier and became close friends. Ms. Warrer was on her seventh TDA tour and riding until Dakar, and Ms. Renland, who took up cycling in 2017, was on her second and riding the whole route. "
656,"“We want to live life to the fullest,” Ms. Renland said, as her bike computer displayed 35 km/h, or 22 miles per hour. “It’s time to put some Ks down.”"
657,We rode flat out for a half-hour. The cobalt ocean was on our right as we passed several kite surfing lodges on the Dakhla peninsula that cater to a growing number of European visitors. We were flying through the salt air as sea gulls veered overhead. Spotted butterflies flitted around our bikes.
658,"We rested near an abandoned desert village, a few square blocks of empty, one-story concrete buildings and a silent mosque. I asked them what they liked about the tour."
659,"“It’s the total experience,” said Ms. Warrer, who used to own a travel agency. “It’s an everyday thing that we have; the rhythm, putting up the tent, sleeping, eating together, going out on the bicycle and then seeing if there is something interesting to engage us along the way.”"
660,"Ms. Renland, a psychologist who runs an educational charity in Tanzania, said she was inspired to cycle when she attended a presentation by a fellow Norwegian who had biked the continent of Africa from north to south."
661,"“It’s like when you discover something you didn’t know you could do; then it’s so funny to explore how far you can go,” she said."
662,"Two hours later, we rolled up to our desert camp, completing one of the tour’s longest rides, 100 miles. My crotch was raw, my legs were spent and my feet ached from my cycling shoes."
663,"There was no rest yet. I was introduced to the routine that the three dozen other riders had already adopted: Lug your duffle bag down from the truck. Find a spot and pitch your tent. Fill a bucket for a splash bath. Gather for the riders’ meeting at 5:30 p.m. Line up for dinner of rice and chicken or pasta and meat. Sit around and talk about the ride, past rides and injuries. Grab a shovel and dig a hole for a toilet. Duck into your tent. Collapse exhausted, usually by 8 or 9 p.m., to wake up at 5:30 in the chilly morning dark."
664,"That night, the wind was gusting and my one-person tent was buckling as we slept under a vault of glittering stars."
665,"The crossing into Mauritania took us through a forsaken stretch of land a couple of miles long, like a scene out of “Mad Max.”"
666,"After getting our passports stamped at a border checkpoint controlled by Morocco, we rode into the buffer between the countries on a rutted road. Amid the trash and sand off to the right were long rows of battered, abandoned cars. Men in robes with scarves covering their faces were moving through the makeshift junk yard, calling out to us in French."
667,"Parked in the left lane, a line of tractor-trailers extended for a half mile, some with rocks wedged under tires. Drivers said they waited days for inspections and entrance into Morocco."
668,"The road turned to deep sand and jagged rock, wending through barren flats up to two small buildings where touts called out, “Whachu need, whachu need.” They carried wads of cash, stacks of phone cards and cartons of cigarettes."
669,"We waited in a sunny courtyard with four young Belgians and locals in colorful wraps and billowing robes. The line moved slowly to the two visa officers who sat in a dingy office with cardboard taped to the window to block out the sun. By the time they took our fingerprints and photos and we handed over 55 euros each, nearly three hours had passed."
670,"“This is harder than the riding,” Ms. Warrer said as we headed to our bikes."
671,"I spent the most time on the ride — seven days — in Mauritania, which like several other countries in the region gained independence from France around 1960. The impoverished Islamic republic is covered mostly by desert. It has a ban on alcohol and an abundance of beat-up Mercedes discarded from Europe. It was the last country to outlaw slavery, in 1981, and is thought to have links to terrorist groups."
672,The United States State Department advises citizens to “reconsider travel to Mauritania due to crime and terrorism.”
673,"The biggest threat to riders is not getting attacked by militants but being hit by a driver, Henry Gold, the owner of TDA, told me as we chatted at a campsite one night. "
674,"He used to run a nongovernmental organization in east and southern Africa before starting TDA in 2003 with its flagship expedition, Tour d’Afrique, a four-month ride from Cairo to Cape Town. Now TDA runs 16 tours on six continents, one of a handful of operators offering multiple-country odysseys."
675,"“The reason I did Tour d’Afrique, even though other people said I’m suicidal, is that I knew Africa,” he said. "
676,"There were a few areas that he was unfamiliar with, and to make sure they were safe, he took the same steps that his staff members followed before this West Africa tour. They drove the prospective route several times and talked with government and security officials, diplomats and N.G.O. workers. A big advantage, Mr. Gold said, is that police and military commanders are determined not to let anything happen to a group of international tourists on their watch. Mr. Gold said TDA provides the authorities with the cycling route, and they determine the level of security. "
677,"On our last night in Mauritania, soldiers in three trucks came roaring into our camp with spinning lights and machine guns mounted on the roofs. They took up positions on the periphery of our tents. When we walked over to talk to the commander, he said they were there to make sure we were safe. "
678,"Between the Moroccan border and the Mauritanian capital of Nouakchott, there were occasional checkpoints where police waved us through, and random herds of goats or camels crossing the road. Villagers warily stared at us or exchanged greetings in French, and children ran into the road, hands out for whatever we might offer. At one stop I was surrounded by boys calling “ça va” and slapping me on the backside as I rode away."
679,"“We are having fun now,” Christine Rousseu, a 65-year-old nurse from Montreal, one of a dozen Canadians on the trip, shouted as a rig blew past us on our 90-mile ride into the headwind."
680,"Ms. Rousseu often was in the back of the pack, riding solo, as she prefers. She has done cycling tours on her own or with TDA since 1980, but has been ill in recent years, she said. “I’m not supposed to be here,” she told me. “I prayed a lot to return to my health to be able to suffer again on my bicycle.”"
681,"She said this would likely be her final TDA ride. Some of the cyclists were too competitive, and, she said, it seemed to her that as soon as she pulled up to a Coke stop or lunch, “they jump on their bikes and go, go, go,” because they didn’t want to arrive at the next stop after her. "
682,"A couple of days later, on our rest day in Nouakchott, I told her that I had been talking with some of the younger riders — in this case a group of men in their 40s and 50s — who singled her out as an inspiration: “Ordinary people doing extraordinary things every day,” as one of them put it."
683,She looked at me for a moment and her eyes welled up. She touched my arm and walked away.
684,"Over the days, I’d heard some riders talking about whether these expeditions were the hardest things they’d done in their lives, how many of their friends and relatives thought they were crazy. I asked riders whether they were missing a gene for sensitivity to pain and suffering."
685,"“I think all agony and frustrations fade way over time and I just remember the happy points,” said Caroline Derouet, a 43-year-old forensics officer in a police department near Toronto. “It takes awhile for the degradations to just kind of be part of your daily life. I think we all go home with a sense of gratitude at how easy we have it.”"
686,"The most common ailments were related to sore bottoms and diarrhea. After a few days, I lost strength in my hands, but they improved when I added padding to my handlebars. Over the tour, several riders were sidelined with infections or viruses for days or weeks, and two were seriously injured in crashes, including a broken arm and a broken collarbone. Of the 33 people signed up for the whole ride, 28 finished."
687,"On our first full day in Senegal, the desert was behind us and the 70-mile ride ahead would end at the former capital, the small island of Saint-Louis."
688,"We spun past lush rice paddies and fields of corn and sugar cane in the Senegal River valley. The traffic was heavier, including bus-like Mercedes vans often so stuffed with passengers that several men stood on back platforms."
689,"After 45 miles my head ached and my legs were sapped. I reached the lunch truck under the shade of a thorny acacia tree, I got a second wind. I paired up with Trixie Wagner for the rest of the ride."
690,"Ms. Wagner said she took up triathlons as she neared 50 a few years ago and was using this tour in part to train for her third Ironman. A scientist at a drug company in Switzerland, she has developed a radical work-life balance. She works full-bore most of the year, at times putting in 14-hour days, then plunges into her passions of cycling and photography for extended periods, as on this 10-week ride."
691,"“It really reduces your day to the bare necessities,” she said. “It’s a total reset.”"
692,We tooled past the once-grand French Colonial buildings of Saint-Louis and over another bridge to a busy waterfront crossroads where Ms. Wagner took photos. 
693,"We finished the day with a leisurely ride to a beach camp with bungalows and a bar. At the riders’ meeting, our Senegalese tour guide, Philippe Nelson Ndiaye, 29, told us how the stable democracy was abuzz about the coming presidential election, and how a cemetery in the middle of the country that holds Christians and Muslims speaks to Senegal’s tolerance."
694,"The next day our ride along a deserted, hazy stretch of beach turned into a 25-mile slog."
695,"“This is where people start to explode,” said Mr. Gold, as we surveyed the roiling Atlantic."
696,"The rutted and sandy, 12-mile road to the beach had already drained us. Now the temperature was over 100 degrees and low tide — and hard-packed sand for smooth riding — was still a couple hours away. "
697,"Searching for a strip of firm sand, right at the edge of where the waves crest was exasperating. Sudden waves raced up the shore and swamped our wheels, knocking over some riders, and leaving many of us pushing our bikes."
698,"After an hour, there was more ebb than flow and the wind was at our backs. We waved from our saddles at the occasional horse-drawn cart, frowned at the multitude of discarded plastic bottles."
699,"Several riders had a meltdown in the sand, and Mr. Jones was on the verge. But his partner, Mimi Viviers, a South African he had met three years ago on the Tour d’Afrique, rode back to give him a hug and a pep talk."
700,"“I often tell my kids that cycling is very much like life,” Ms. Viviers, 56, a retired telecom consultant, said later. “If you see a hill, it always looks worse than it is. You just take it in small chunks.”"
701," At the campsite that night, as we feasted on roasted goat and couscous under a tent, the tour leader Max Dionne had an announcement. Nodding to widespread grousing and the reality that low tide was coming too late in the day, he said, “Tomorrow we do a change. We’re not doing a beach ride.”"
702,"From the tables came a sarcastic, collective, “Aaaawwwww.”"
703,"On my final day, the 30-mile ride was supposed to follow the coastal road to Dakar, the first four-lane highway of the trip. But there was an option for a beach ride, and five of us signed waivers exempting TDA for any mishaps on our detour. "
704,"We rolled out of camp and passed Lac Rose, a saltwater lake with algae that at times makes the water pink. But on this hazy morning, it was glossy gray. Shirtless men in waist-high water scooped out the salt crystals for sale to gourmets in Europe."
705,"When we reached the ocean, the breakers swamped us again. As I swerved up the slope trying to dodge a wave, my gears hopped and my chain busted — my only malfunction of the tour. This was a problem, because I had no idea how to fix it and the waiver made it clear we were on our own until the hotel. Luckily, André Marcoux, our informal leader, had the right tool."
706,"Twice we had to move the bike to higher ground as the tide swept in. When I told the group to go on without me. Mr. Marcoux, a 65-year-old retired forest engineer, insisted, “It will work.” After 25 minutes the chain links were coupled, and we rode to the route’s end and had a swim in the surf."
707,"For the next two days, we rested in the sprawling capital. We tried the local fish and rice dish at seaside restaurants. We piled onto a ferry for a tour of the Gorée Island, where former slave-trading houses and narrow stone lanes shaded by bulky baobab trees were crowded with Western tour groups."
708,"Though I was glad to see the end of bush camping and pedaling eight to 10 hours a day, I also wanted to continue. But my ride was finished. The group had 2,000 miles to go. "

713,"Just over a week before the Armory international art show was due to open in Manhattan, a city inspection has revealed that one of the two West Side piers that house the event is structurally unsound."
714,"Organizers of the high-profile art fair, set to open on March 7, have decided to relocate most of its exhibitors from damaged Pier 92 to nearby Pier 90, where the show’s sister art fair, Volta, had been scheduled to run concurrently."
715,"The Volta fair has been canceled for 2019, its organizers said."
716,"“We all agreed that presenting the New York 2019 edition in an extremely modified status would be a disservice to our galleries, the artists or the visitors,” Amanda Coulson, Volta’s artistic director, said in a statement. All exhibitors will be reimbursed, she said."
717,"“It’s been quite heartbreaking for us as well as for the galleries” that planned to exhibit at Volta, Ms. Coulson said in an interview. “It takes a good six months to plan for a fair at minimum,” she said. “Eleven days is just not enough time to produce another fair.”"
718,"The Armory Show, one of New York’s leading art fairs, drew an estimated 65,000 visitors last year and showed work from 31 countries, according to organizers. Volta began in 2008 as a platform for emerging artists and now attracts 15,000 visitors, Ms. Coulson said. Pieces from the two fairs sold last year for prices ranging from $10,000 to $600,000 for a painting by Cuban-American artist Carmen Herrera, ARTnews reported."
719,"The pier inspection was carried out by the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which is charged with inspecting publicly and privately owned piers."
720,"“Following a routine inspection, we discovered structural issues at Pier 92,” the corporation spokesman Christopher Singleton said in a statement. “Out of an abundance of caution, we have made the decision to relocate any activity to Pier 90 while we conduct further analysis at the site.”"
721,"New York City’s piers have experienced a renaissance in recent years as the dilapidated structures, once the heart of the city’s industrial commerce, have transformed into public parks, restaurant hubs and event spaces."
722,"But as old piers have taken on new lives, their structural integrity after years of disuse has proved problematic."
723,"Five years ago, an engineering firm report revealed that 57 percent of the 3,500 steel pilings in Hudson River Park’s Pier 40 had severely deteriorated, putting the structure in danger of collapsing into the Hudson River."
724,"When park officials’ yearslong attempts to generate funds to repair the pier fell short, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo stepped in to strike a deal with park officials and a developer to transfer unused development rights and subsequently infuse $100 million to repair the pilings. After two years of fraught negotiations, the City Council approved the deal."
725,"Last year, a routine inspection of Pier 36 on the Lower East Side revealed structural damage, compelling organizers of Bike Expo New York, one of the largest bike shows on the East Coast, to move the show to Red Hook, Brooklyn."
726,"The executive director of the Armory Show, Nicole Berry, said that in the new setup, Pier 90 will be accessible by a covered walkway or a one-minute shuttle that will run continuously during the fair."
727,"“Unfortunately, this situation is beyond our control,” Ms. Berry said in a statement. “Our chief priority is the safety of the exhibitors, visitors and artworks exhibited.”"
728,"Recently I found myself on the receiving end of a tarot card reading at a summer potluck. A woman I had met only 30 minutes earlier peered at me over her glasses, the cards spread out on a cooler between us. Holding the five of pentacles, she said, “Have you grieved the loss of your husband?”"
729,"The directness of the question, from a stranger, shook me. Especially since my husband was still very much alive, less than three miles away in our house."
730,"Yet it was not the first time this had come up. Various people, from my stepmother-in-law to my therapist, have said something along the lines of, “I think you need to grieve the loss of your husband.” My chiropractor said, “Something is stuck inside of you. You need to let it out.” That something, she suggested, was grief."
731,"This may have been good advice, but it’s not easy to implement when you still text your husband the grocery list, negotiate holiday family visits and sleep in the same bed."
732,"Christian and I met in our mid 20s on the first day of graduate school orientation at the University of Washington. According to his retelling, he had chosen me to pursue after evaluating the full roster of single women in our entering class."
733,"A few days later, we found ourselves unlocking our bicycles next to one another at the rack outside of our department building. He offered to bike home with me."
734,"Our biking friendship quickly turned to romance. Five years later, in our early 30s, we married in a ceremony in a mountain town outside of Seattle, exchanging a kiss, rings and a vow to provide “a hand to hold in yours through each tomorrow.”"
735,"Eighteen months after saying those words, I got one of those calls you dread. Actually, it was a series of urgent texts from his sister, brother and stepmother, each saying, “Call me.”"
736,"When I reached his stepmother, I learned that Christian was in the emergency room at the trauma hospital. He had flipped over his bike handles and was on life support."
737,"Christian remained in a coma for more than three weeks with a tracheotomy tube and a feeding tube. He was in a teaching hospital, so teams of doctors would come to check on him and evaluate his tests. It was early in that process that I learned, as they pored over grainy scans, that Christian had sustained a traumatic brain injury. He had obvious damage to his left temporal lobe and likely also had experienced shearing, or micro-tears."
738,"Doctors, nurses and rehab specialists told me to grieve my old husband, and learn to love the new one. They also urged me to take care of myself, citing statistics about high levels of depression and sickness among caretakers. “This is a marathon, not a race,” they said. “Prepare for a new life.”"
739,"When Christian began waking up, it was agonizingly slow. For weeks he didn’t speak. His family and I weren’t sure if he even knew who we were until one day he pointed at me from his wheelchair and said to the medical assistant, in a raspy voice, “My wife.” Upon tasting applesauce, his first real food in more than a month, he licked his lips and devoured several cupfuls."
740,"For Christian’s first steps, one aide stood chest to chest with him, talking through the process, while a second held a strap looped around my husband’s waist to help him balance. A third aide physically picked up his foot and put it down. Going to the bathroom, brushing teeth and bathing all took a similar team effort."
741,"When Christian finally came home after three months, I would look at him across the room and wonder, “Who is this stranger?” My new husband walked and talked differently. He used to be the one who led us confidently on hikes in the backcountry. Now he got lost on short walks to the grocery store, often turning the wrong way when leaving the house."
742,"Always described as “laid back” and an “eternal optimist” by those who knew him, he was now quick to anger, especially when his things weren’t where he expected them to be. A once successful and busy urban planner, he could no longer do professional work, nor could he keep pace with carpenters or handymen, jobs he had excelled at previously."
743,"Before his accident, he was often the life of the party, cajoling friends into dance competitions. He designed an obstacle course for my birthday, made a glow-in-the-dark hula hoop to use at our annual big group camping trips and organized 10 grown men to dance to Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for my bachelorette party. Now he tired easily in social situations and would nap in a quiet room or sit with his eyes closed in the corner."
744,"Our marriage suffered, mostly because our once shared burdens of work and home now fell so much more on me. But there were also surprising upsides. Early in our relationship, Christian had resisted getting a dog, even though I wanted one, because of how it would tie us down and hamper our travel. Neither of us wanted children and he’d happily gotten a vasectomy. Now he expressed a desire for both dogs and children, and talked about reversing his vasectomy, making me second guess my decisions."
745,"Eventually we were able to resume our long bike rides, with him on a recumbent tricycle (lacking the balance for a two-wheeler). He used to ride in front, acting as my wind block, guide and protector. Now he trails behind. I look down at his helmet, at the person on the bright yellow recumbent tricycle and wonder, “Who is this stranger?”"
746,"His sense of humor has remained more or less intact, if differently delivered. For the first Halloween after his crash, he dressed up as a person with a head injury, wrapping his head in gauze upon which he’d dribbled red food coloring. Around his neck he wore a sign that read: “Too soon?”"
747,"Yes, too soon, his friends said. (But it was funny.)"
748,"What does it mean to grieve someone who is alive, but who walks, talks, thinks, acts and looks different from before? The experts call this kind of loss “ambiguous grief” or “unconventional grief.” People with loved ones who fall prey to Alzheimer’s may experience this, as may parents whose children become alcoholics or drug addicts."
749,Naming my grief is helpful because it invites me to engage in rituals of grieving.
750,"When I lost my old husband, there was no funeral, no burial, no going through his items to decide what to keep or discard. No questions about when I might consider dating again. I never removed my wedding ring and gazed at my bare finger. I simply carried on, missing my husband and occasionally crying among strangers."
751,"My new husband isn’t the same person I married, but he has his beauty. I admire so much about him. Having lost the ability to hustle, he enjoys life at a slower pace."
752,"Every morning he sits on the porch with a cup of coffee, chatting with neighbors. Lacking a crisp memory of the past and unable to plan for the future as he once did, he lives in the moment. He meditates regularly on the couch with closed eyes. He rarely complains about anything."
753,"He supports others who have experienced brain injury and cares for his aging mother. He enjoys holding our friends’ babies, playing with our toddler niece and spoiling our dachshund with treats and belly rubs. He’s already planning next year’s Halloween costume."
754,"Our eighth wedding anniversary recently passed. The traditional gift is linens and lace, but I decided to create a new ritual that is more fitting for my unconventional grief."
755,"On the morning of our anniversary, I sat outside by our fire pit, coffee cup in hand, reflecting. For 18 months, I was married to the old Christian. For six and a half years, I have been married to the new one."
756,"On small pieces of paper, I wrote down what I miss about my old husband. With my basic drawing skills, I sketched him going no-handed on a bike and confidently starting a new home-remodeling project. I described the future I once imagined for us."
757,I burned those pieces of paper in a small fire.
758,"On a fresh piece of paper, I wrote, “Welcome.” Below that, I jotted down dozens of words and phrases describing my new husband — “doesn’t rush,” “gets lost but enjoys the experiences and keeps trying,” “revels in simple pleasures” — alongside sketches of him playing with our dog and hanging out with his new friends."
759,That page I didn’t burn. I used it to welcome this stranger into my life.

765,"OLD SCHOOL MEDIA I generally get up at 7:30 or 8 a.m., which is a little later than the rest of the week. For me, as long as I can remember, Sunday morning has always meant “CBS News Sunday Morning.” It’s also the day I read the print version of The New York Times instead of the digital version."
766,"JOE AND JOHNNY I’m not a big brunch person, so around 10:30, I go to Joe Coffee Company on East 13th Street, because it’s around the corner and because it has good coffee and muffins. Plus, it’s on The New School campus and right next to N.Y.U., so I get a good dose of feeling like a college student. My son Johnny lives in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, which means I don’t get to see him as often as when he lived a few blocks away, but he is often in Manhattan on the weekends to coach improv comedy, so sometimes he’ll come with me."
767,"KISS THE RING My first grandchild, whom I call Baby K, was born in September. She led a successful coup to replace me as the head of the family. My daughter, Brynne, and my son-in-law Julio work in Bogotá, Colombia, and when Baby K brings them to town, I’m the first one to kiss the ring, or the pacifier, as it were. If Baby K agrees, I take my daughter out to lunch at Fig & Olive on Lexington."
768,"I WANT TO RIDE MY (TEMPORARY) BICYCLE This is followed by a trip to SoulCycle, where I get my dose of endorphins and check in with myself and ask important questions such as, “Why the hell did I let Brynne talk me into this?” When Baby K is not in town, I’m still on a bike, but in a much more relaxed manner and setting with my boyfriend, Bruce McEver. He’s an investment banker and a published poet. We like to rent Citi Bikes and pedal around Central Park. They’re big and slow and easy to see coming — perfect for Sunday in the park with 60-somethings."
769,"FUR BABY Finn, my other grandchild, is a big White Swiss Shepherd. When I say big, I mean about 70 pounds. He belongs to my son Kevin, who works in Connecticut but lives in the West Village on the weekends. Whenever possible, I like to walk with them in Washington Square Park. Kevin always gets leash duty — Finn is a sweetheart but full of so much energy that he needs to be out for at least an hour. Probably a third of that time is taken up by young women stopping Kevin to ask to pet Finn. I understand now why Kevin chose him."
770,"TAKING IN THE SIGHTS I always make time to call or FaceTime my mother, who is 94 and lives outside of Philadelphia. I lived in Short Hills, New Jersey for 20 years before moving to Manhattan eight years ago, so I’m happy to say that I do far more New York things than I expected or than I did when I was a tourist. One of the best things about my apartment is that I live near the Strand bookstore, which I consider a cathedral of culture. If I’m not at the Strand, I’m at Washington Square, Central Park, the Met Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, MoMA or the High Line."
771,"DINNER WITH FRIENDS I’m out of town a lot during the week, so I catch up with friends on the weekends, either at the Regency Bar & Grill on Park Avenue if I’m on the Upper East Side with Bruce — we have a long-distance uptown-downtown relationship — or the Gotham Bar and Grill on 12th Street if I’m home."
772,"VIEWS FROM THE COUCH By 9:30 p.m., I’m usually at home being a couch potato. Bruce never watched much TV, but I’m converting him to my bad habits. We got hooked on “Stranger Things” on Netflix and now we’re watching “Outlander,” a historical time-travel show on Starz. I try to make it to bed by 11."

774,"So 2019 starts with whiplash. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that the L train was not completely shutting down for repairs after all. "
775,"Wait, what? "
776,"Despite nearly three years of hand-wringing, community meetings and general upheaval to prepare for the so-called L-pocalypse, the governor announced a new plan that would avoid requiring a full closing. "
777,"The backlash was immediate, the confusion compounding. And then on Friday, Governor Cuomo swerved slightly again, telling reporters that he actually needs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board’s approval, which he said on Thursday that he did not need. He called an emergency meeting of the board."
778,"In the original plan, a 15-month shutdown was deemed necessary to repair corroded cables in the tunnels spanning the East River that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. "
779,"Instead, the governor said, they would be fixed with a new technology not yet used in the United States, with the work taking place only on nights and weekends. "
780,"In one hour on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo upended years of planning and hundreds of thousands of lives. It may be for the better. But will it even work? Why did he wait so long to do this? On the second day of L-Gate, more questions arose. We will answer them here as soon as we can. "
781,"Here’s what we do we know about what this means for Brooklynites, East Villagers and the rest of the city:"
782,"Maybe. The date of the authority’s board meeting has not yet been set. Generally, according to The Times’s transit reporter, Emma Fitzsimmons, the board goes along with what the authority has decided. But there are representatives of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office on the board, and the mayor expressed skepticism on Thursday. "
783,"The Times’s Albany reporter, Jesse McKinley, posted on Twitter what the governor told reporters on a conference call Friday morning: “If they decide to, great … if not … but make a decision.” @NYGovCuomo says. “It’s up to the M.T.A. board.”"
784,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will keep both tunnels open during weekdays for full L train service and do its work on nights and weekends, shutting down only one tube at a time. "
785,"Trains will run in both directions, but that will result in long waits between trains — up to 15 and 20 minutes — during repair times. The authority still plans on running more G, M and 7 trains to handle passengers who are rerouted during the repairs. "
786,"If the board approves, the work would probably start at the end of April, which was when the shutdown was supposed to begin. "
787,Transit officials said it could take 15 to 20 months. The previously planned shutdown was supposed to take 15 months. The governor stopped short of guaranteeing that it would not go beyond 20 months. 
788,"“It’s a silly question, ‘am I going to promise on a construction project?’” he said."
789,"L-train riders who work nights and weekends, or those who play on nights and weekends. "
790,"A luxury ride share company that started just for the shutdown, The New L, said it would keep its wait list open, just in case the new plans didn’t work, and there was still a need for the $155-a-month service."
791,"Construction and congestion on side streets in the East Village could be abated, sparing neighbors fumes from supplemental buses and asbestos in the debris removed from the tunnel. "
792,"Andy Byford, who oversees New York City’s subways and buses, said there would likely not be a high-occupancy vehicle lane over the Williamsburg Bridge, as had been planned. Additional ferry service from Brooklyn to Manhattan will also not be needed. "
793,No decision has been made regarding shutting down 14th Street in Manhattan for bus service. 
794,"On Friday, the City Department of Transportation said a new two-way protected bike lane along Delancey Street that was recently opened at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side will stay. The city is still reviewing other planned bike and bus lane changes. "
795,"In December, the governor asked experts from Cornell University's College of Engineering and Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science to suggest alternatives to a shutdown. "
796,"Their solution was to abandon the old electrical cables now embedded in a cement bench wall that runs along the base of the tunnel; construct a new racking system on the sides of the tunnel, and hang new cables wrapped in fireproof material; and then fortify the bench wall with fiberglass polymer. "
797,Sit tight. Kind of like waiting for a late-night L train.
798,We can’t track knowledge work the way we did factory work.
799,Production-line metrics aren’t useful for a lot of the work that requires only your mind. The language is wrong. The whole paradigm is wrong. Knowledge work is much more about the quality of the thinking than the quantity of the output.
800,"Professional runners have to rest their leg muscles. Carpenters have to rest the muscles in their hands. If the primary muscle you use to do your job is your brain, you need to learn how to rest it, too. For the knowledge worker, that means large chunks of unstructured time spent doing nothing."
801,"That’s right, nothing. Not reading Twitter, listening to a podcast or texting with your customers. I’m talking about the kind of nothing where the brain finally gets to relax. Sitting still, taking a nap, riding a bike. That kind of nothing."
802,The problem with this completely reasonable idea is that we live in an unreasonable world. People wear “busy” like a badge of honor. It almost feels like a cult.
803,"Here’s a secret: Some of the most successful creative workers I know appear way more lazy than busy, at least at first glance. Meanwhile, I have other busy friends who are getting burned out from the 24/7 grind."
804,We need to rethink the paradigm.
805,"For knowledge workers, large chunks of unstructured time are not rewards for doing good work — they’re prerequisites for it."
806,"So take the “busy” badge, throw it in the trash and replace it with one that says “rested.”"
807,"And after you do, don’t go post about it on Twitter. Step outside, lie down in the grass and look at the clouds. And don’t get up until you’re good and ready."
808,"WABASHA, Minn. — In the weeks before the Olympic cyclist Kelly Catlin killed herself, she felt her mind slipping."
809,"She could not focus on her schoolwork at Stanford, where she was a first-year graduate student in computational mathematics. In an email she sent to her family, a coach and a friend in January, she said her thoughts were “never-ending spinning, spinning, spinning” as if they were “never at rest, never at peace.”"
810,"She wrote that she cried about it, and that made her feel even worse. For years, Catlin, 23, was someone who took pride in holding back tears."
811,"Catlin told her sister, Christine, that seeking therapy meant she was weak and that she would rather suffer. She told her brother, Colin, that she thought she was going insane and she worried that she was a danger to others because she was filled with rage."
812,She wrote that she was scared of dying.
813,"“What is it like to no longer have a mind?” she wrote in January, just days before a first suicide attempt. She answered the question."
814,"“It is unimaginable,” she wrote. “Terrifying.”"
815,"Catlin was poised for stardom at the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, where she had a reasonable shot for Olympic gold that eluded her in 2016. With the advanced degree from Stanford she was working toward, she could have her pick of jobs in computers."
816,"How, those who knew her are asking now, could she find no purpose to keep living? How could she be so unknown to the people closest to her?"
817,"Kelly Catlin had sought to explain herself and her distress, both over the phone and in notes before she was found dead in her Stanford apartment on March 8. In one note she wrote in January, she even asked, “What do you wish to know?”, leaving a trail of cryptic answers."
818,"“You think you know your children,” her mother, Carolyn Emory, said, “but there was so much about Kelly, especially this secret personal code she lived by, that was startling to me in the end. She was very private.”"
819,"On Friday, a month after she killed herself, a white van showed up at her parents’ farmhouse to drop off her things."
820,"Three bikes. Nearly a dozen boxes of clothes, books and cycling gear. Her carbon-fiber violin. Duffel bags stuffed with cycling gear and United States Olympic team uniforms from the 2016 Rio Games, where she won a silver medal."
821,"Her mother and her brother, Colin Catlin, sifted through the belongings, retrieved from her apartment. Her father, Dr. Mark Catlin, could only join them in spurts because he was so distraught."
822,"Every item provoked a memory, none a clue."
823,"Colin Catlin had hoped to find telling information on her phone, but instead he found the wallpaper she selected for it haunting: an album cover featuring a body with daggers in its back. The album title was “Try to Die.”"
824,He broke into tears.
825,"It was hard to absorb that just months before, in November, on the podium at a World Cup track cycling race, where Catlin’s squad finished second in the team pursuit, she soaked in the moment: flags waving, fans cheering, adrenaline pumping. A three-time world champion, Catlin considered the victory a prelude to finally winning an Olympic gold medal."
826,"Off the track, she was fulfilling a lifelong obsession with numbers and order through her academics and planning for a career in Silicon Valley."
827,"This solid trajectory she appeared to be on had made her mental downward spiral and death all the more mystifying to teammates, friends and family members."
828,"Catlin’s father, who is a pathologist, blames her suicide on a combination of factors, including her success-at-all-costs personality, overtraining, stress, and physical injuries from a January suicide attempt about a month before she was found dead in her dorm. On both occasions, she inhaled noxious gas."
829,"But the breaking point, he and other family members believe, was a concussion she sustained during a training ride on Jan. 5. They have donated her brain to researchers to find out if the head injury contributed to her behavior changes."
830,"Regardless of the results, nothing can give the family a definitive answer. Suicide is much more complicated than lab results can reveal and multiple factors, like destabilizing life events, brain chemistry and persistent mental struggles, almost always come into play."
831,"“I wake up every two to three hours at night to go through all of these permutations on what could have saved her,” said her father, whose eyes were reddened by weeks of crying. “I can’t help but wonder what she would’ve done with her life.”"
832,"Kelly’s mother answered, weeping, “Something great.”"
833,"Catlin and her triplet siblings, Christine and Colin, grew up in Arden Hills, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis. Her parents — her mother is a former Alzheimer’s researcher — met in a lab dissecting brains."
834,"The Catlins lived in a large house with an indoor gymnasium. They took European vacations and roasted s’mores in the backyard. They were a family of introverts who enjoyed staying at home for tea parties. For Kelly, Christine and Colin, school and sports were equally important. They excelled at both."
835,"Kelly was the super-focused athlete, a first-chair violinist who studied nonstop. Christine was the creative writer and runner who played three instruments. Colin was the math whiz who played guitar and rode bikes competitively. In middle school, the siblings tied for Most Likely to Succeed."
836,"“Our parents always told us that we could be great at anything we wanted to, if we worked hard enough,” Christine said. “Looking back, maybe we kind of twisted that into thinking we weren’t worth anything if we weren’t the best. I think Kelly believed that.”"
837,"Kelly’s parents said she was an intense child who grew socially awkward with age. In elementary school, when she could not figure out addition or subtraction, she would scream for hours in frustration, they said, and refused to take a break."
838,"For years in her youth, she was obsessed with horses. She studied the 512-page book “The Ultimate Book of the Horse and Rider” so much that she had to tape the binding because the book was so worn. She maintained a collection of dozens of model horses that she did not allow anyone to touch because they were arranged in a certain order."
839,"Christine Catlin described her sister as a once outgoing, friendly girl who began closing herself off in middle school because she was “so obsessed with success.”"
840,"Kelly Catlin also began to limit her social interactions to “robotic social motions,” as Catlin herself put it in the January note to family and friends. Around third grade, Catlin established her lifelong code to live by and included some of it in the note, which was shared with The New York Times:"
841,"Fear not physical discomfort. Never love. Never engage in a relationship that could be defined as having a significant other. (In my case, a so-called “boyfriend.”) Never allow yourself to become close enough to another that their actions or inactions might cause you (any amount of) distress or pain. If kindness and gentleness are at all an option, they are the only option. "
842,"“We all knew that she didn’t like to express her emotions,” Christine Catlin said. “She never really told anyone how she ever felt, until the very end, that is.”"
843,"Colin and Christine Catlin were cycling for a local development team, NorthStar, when Kelly quit high school soccer and joined them, at Colin’s prodding. She loved long training rides and used cycling as a way to practice memorization, another passion."
844,"She would remember dozens of license plates of cars passing her and would recite the number pi to hundreds of decimals, Colin Catlin said. She mapped out training routes in her head."
845,"“She liked that cycling kept her mind focused, but I think she liked it most when she started winning everything,” said Colin, a data scientist. “Her mentality was, if you wanted to be an Olympian, all you had to do was train hard.”"
846,"And Kelly did make it seem easy. Within two years of starting to race, she was invited to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado, where coaches put cyclists through testing to see if they are national team material. Kelly was that, and more."
847,"Her power output on the stationary bike was higher than every other recruit and higher than several athletes on the national track cycling team, said Neal Henderson, one of the coaches back then."
848,"Track cyclists compete on a banked oval, called a velodrome, and Catlin seemed suited for it because it required both power and precision."
849,"She was drawn to the science of cycling. She wasn’t comfortable with the social aspect of it. In the notes she wrote in her final weeks, she acknowledged not having many friends."
850,"“It’s not that she didn’t want friends,” her brother said. “It was just a matter of priorities. And her priority was to be successful and respected.”"
851,"Like her siblings, Catlin could not stand to be hugged, family members said. She would rather bury herself in a book than chat with peers. She had a playful sense of humor — often dark humor — within her family circle, but rarely showed it to outsiders."
852,"Although she exuded confidence, she described in a note having a “phenomenally powerful fear of social embarrassment,” and also long worried that she would not be able to keep up with other cyclists, said Charlie and Sherry Townsend, the co-founders of her development team. It was a classic impostor syndrome, they said."
853,"“But she changed because of cycling, she really did,” said Sherry Townsend, a psychologist, adding that Catlin’s self-esteem rose after she competed in the Olympics. “She was slowly learning how to be better engaged with people, slowly learning how to share her thoughts with others. But it was still hard to really know her.”"
854,"Catlin’s nickname at the Olympic Training Center, where she lived before the 2016 Olympics, was Roy Orbison, because she always wore dark glasses. She wore her hair short because it was practical for the sport, so short that she was sometimes mistaken for a young man."
855,"Chloé Dygert, an Olympic teammate, said she was thrilled when Catlin started to open up, even occasionally agreeing to a quick hug. Dygert and a teammate once convinced Catlin to play the violin for them."
856,"“It was, like, whoa, so good that it was jaw-dropping,” Dygert said. “Kelly was just amazing. She read a book every day, even while brushing her teeth, and it was hard to keep up. She was a lovely girl on the inside.”"
857,"The concussion that her family said changed everything happened on Jan. 5 when Catlin crashed while riding with her professional road cycling team, Rally UHC Cycling. A team spokesman said there was “no indication that she hit her head or had a serious injury” when the team evaluated her."
858,"But at a national team training camp two days later, Catlin felt dizzy and could not continue working out. She told the team about her crash. Medical personnel at the Olympic Training Center placed her on concussion protocol and suggested rest, said Guillermo Rojas, a spokesman for USA Cycling."
859,"Yet Catlin continued to complain to her parents of headaches, sensitivity to light and trouble sleeping. And this was coming months after a fall in October that left her with a broken arm and weakened interest in the national team."
860,"“There was this profound apathy,” her father said. “She didn’t care about winning medals anymore.”"
861,"Life at Stanford was much different than she was used to. She moved into a dorm there after living with her brother at the University of Minnesota while finishing her undergraduate degree. Colin had cooked her meals and often had to trick her into taking breaks from studying and training, playing episodes of the television show “Stargate” because she could not resist science fiction."
862,"At Stanford, she spent a lot of time alone because her roommate, a law student, was often not there."
863,"After the concussion, Catlin simply could not focus anymore on school or cycling — or anything. In late January, she wrote that she had started planning her suicide before her crash and concussion. But her family thinks that was not true."
864,"“For the first time in her life, Miss Stoical couldn’t force herself to go on,” her father said, choking up. “This is when she began planning her suicide.”"
865,"After her first suicide attempt, Catlin spent about a week in a hospital psychiatric ward. When she left that treatment, she began attending group therapy sessions, which she deemed useless, her parents said, and she said she could not find an available psychiatrist who met her needs."
866,"When Catlin moved back into her on-campus apartment, her parents flew home to Minnesota to give her space, telling her, “We love you, we want you alive,” her father said. They banked on her assurances that she wouldn’t try to kill herself again. She had given her word, a part of her personal code they knew."
867,"“She fooled us all,” her mother said."
868,"The suicide attempt and concussion had damaged her brain and heart, her family said, so competing at the world championships on Feb. 27 was not possible. The day the championships began, Catlin wrote a blog post in which she described managing her cycling career with her graduate studies as “juggling with knives” and said, “I really am dropping a lot of them.” In a note she wrote in March, she said, “If I am not an athlete, I am nothing.”"
869,"Looking back, her father said, it was clear she needed time for her brain to heal, but it appeared nobody could impress that on her."
870,He said her lifelong resolve played a big factor in trying to kill herself again.
871,"“She was furious that she survived her first suicide attempt,” her father said."
872,"Christine Catlin’s phone rang in late February, and it was Kelly. They had not spoken at length in years because they were busy with their own lives after high school, but now Kelly wanted to talk. Christine found it strange. It was nothing Kelly would have done before her concussion."
873,Kelly said she worried that the physical effects of her concussion or her first suicide attempt — or both — were affecting her judgment.
874,She asked: What could Christine see her doing in the future?
875,The sister answered: You could do public speaking about suicide awareness and help people. Or you could do remote computer programming so you don’t have to be around people. You could own a farm and be around horses all day.
876,"“You could bike, if you want to,” Christine said. “Or not.”"
877,"Kelly seemed to feel better after the call, which lasted two and a half hours."
878,"Still, she told Christine, “If things don’t change in a month, I’m probably going to kill myself.”"
879,Christine begged Kelly not to do it.
880,"“O.K.,” Kelly said, with a tone Christine now realizes was less than convincing."
881,"The call was over. Christine rushed to call her parents, and for days afterward the family repeatedly checked on Kelly. Two weeks after that conversation, Catlin’s life was over."
882,"At a memorial service in Minneapolis on March 23, Kelly Catlin was dressed in the uniform the United States team wore for the Rio Games opening ceremony, and the majority of her pallbearers were her cycling teammates. She was buried at the foot of a 50-foot oak tree at Lakewood Cemetery, near one of her favorite bike paths."
883,"Before the coffin was closed, her sister, Christine, slipped in a handwritten note that included these words:"
884,"Kelly, if I could trade my life for yours, I would. I love you without all your accomplishments."

888,"The number of traffic deaths in New York City dropped in 2018 to the lowest level in more than a century, a sign of progress for Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to eliminate fatalities on the city’s streets."
889,"The news, however, was not all promising: Although overall deaths declined, the number of pedestrians killed in traffic increased last year, city officials said on Tuesday."
890,"Mr. de Blasio has implemented a number of safety improvements in his aim to eliminate all traffic deaths by 2024, a program he named Vision Zero after a Swedish plan."
891,"The total number of people killed in traffic crashes in New York City fell to 200 last year, down from 222 deaths in 2017 and the lowest level since the city began tracking such deaths in 1910, according to preliminary data from the city."
892,"The reduction is part of a five-year decline from 299 deaths in 2013, the year before Vision Zero began and the speed limit on most streets was lowered to 25 miles per hour."
893,"“Vision Zero is clearly working,” Mr. de Blasio said in an interview, calling the drop since 2013 stunning."
894,"But pedestrian deaths, which account for the largest share of traffic fatalities, increased last year to 114, from 107 in 2017 — a troubling sign that the city’s streets remain dangerous for many New Yorkers."
895,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who began his second term a year ago, called the rise in pedestrian deaths disappointing. He said the city would do more to redesign streets to make them safer and to enforce laws requiring vehicles to yield to pedestrians."
896,"“Drivers haven’t taken their responsibility to yield very seriously,” Mr. de Blasio said. “There has been a lot of enforcement, and there will be more.”"
897,"The number of bicyclist deaths dropped last year to 10, from 24 in 2017, according to the city. The number of people who died in vehicles also fell to 37, from 58 in 2017. But the number of motorcyclist deaths increased to 39, from 33 in 2017."
898,"Nationally, more than 37,000 people died in traffic crashes in 2017, according to federal transportation data that is not available yet for 2018. The number of traffic fatalities in the United States fell by about 2 percent in 2017, but that followed increases in deaths in 2016 and 2015."
899,"In New York, safety advocates have pressed Mr. de Blasio to move faster to improve streets. Marco Conner, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said there were still too many deaths and injuries."
900,"“It’s an achievement, and it should be celebrated,” Mr. Conner said of the drop last year. “But I think the big question is: Why aren’t we doing more against the enormity of the epidemic? We’re only really taking baby steps.”"
901,"The people who lost their lives represent a cross section of New Yorkers: A 5-year-old girl, Abigail Blumenstein, and a 1-year-old boy, Joshua Lew, were killed by a driver in Brooklyn while crossing the street with their mothers; an 89-year-old woman, Beatrice Kahn, was hit by a car in the Bronx; and a 9-year-old boy, Giovanni Ampuero, was struck by a driver who fled the scene in Queens."
902,"In August, a 23-year-old Australian woman died after she was hit by a garbage truck while riding a bicycle near Central Park. She was cut off by a livery cab that entered a bike lane. Her death led to calls for better bike infrastructure, such as protected lanes with a physical barrier."
903,"The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said that her agency completed 138 street improvement projects last year and added more than 20 miles of protected bike lanes. She called the 2018 figures “encouraging results unparalleled among American cities.”"
904,"New York City was once plagued by a huge number of traffic fatalities, which reached a peak of 1,360 deaths in 1929, even though there were far fewer cars than there are today. As recently as 1990, there were 701 traffic deaths, making the current lower figures even more notable."
905,"The city’s Vision Zero program faced a major hurdle last summer when state lawmakers failed to reauthorize speed cameras posted at 140 school zones — a policy the city said reduced speeding during school hours by as much as 63 percent. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, intervened to keep the cameras on."
906,"Mr. Johnson recently won the “Vision Zero Hero of the Year” award from Streetsblog, a website that reports on street safety, besting Mr. de Blasio for the top honor. The website praised Mr. Johnson for his support of speed cameras and congestion pricing, a proposal to collect tolls from cars entering Manhattan that Mr. de Blasio has resisted."
907,"Mr. Conner, of Transportation Alternatives, said Mr. Johnson had become a strong advocate for prioritizing street safety above cars — a leadership role that Mr. de Blasio had failed to achieve."
908,"“The mayor is still tied up in somewhat of a windshield perspective,” Mr. Conner said in reference to Mr. de Blasio’s reliance on cars to travel across the city."
909,"Mr. de Blasio dismissed the criticism that Mr. Johnson had taken the lead on Vision Zero, calling the safety program one of the “central missions” of his administration."
910,"“There’s plenty of credit to be shared,” Mr. de Blasio said."

912,"When New York City’s transportation commissioner returned from a recent trip to California, she seemed downright jealous. There were electric scooters in Oakland. New train lines in Los Angeles. Self-driving cars in the Bay Area. She tried them all."
913,"“It is an incredibly exciting time to be in urban transportation,” the commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, told a breakfast gathering of powerful New Yorkers, pointing to California’s progress."
914,Her glee signaled a noteworthy and sobering shift. Wasn’t it her city that was once the envy of the nation when it came to transportation?
915,"Not anymore. The subways on the East Coast that allowed New York, Washington and Boston to thrive are showing their age and suffering from years of neglect, while cities on the West Coast are moving quickly to expand and improve their networks."
916,"The Los Angeles area, the ultimate car-centric region with its sprawling freeways, approved a sweeping $120 billion plan to build new train routes and upgrade its buses. Seattle has won accolades for its transit system, where 93 percent of riders report being happy with service — a feat that seems unimaginable in New York, where subway riders regularly simmer with rage on stalled trains."
917,"“It’s a tale of two systems,” said Robert Puentes, the president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan research center in Washington. “These new ones are growing and haven’t started to experience the pains of rehabilitation.”"
918,"In New York, Ms. Trottenberg returned to a laundry list of messes: a subway crisis, buses that move at a snail’s pace, the looming shutdown of the L train between Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the rebuilding of the dilapidated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway."
919,"“There is a political will to invest in expansion” on the West Coast, Ms. Trottenberg said in an interview, though she noted that New York’s system was still the country’s largest by far. Its daily subway and bus ridership of nearly 8 million dwarfs Los Angeles’s 1.2 million riders."
920,"Still, transit systems on the East Coast are losing ridership. New York’s subway has not expanded in decades, besides a handful of new stations in Manhattan — one on the Far West Side and three on the Upper East Side."
921,"City officials have been reluctant to embrace electric scooters or self-driving cars, even as scooters have become a popular way to get around a growing roster of cities — including Austin, Tex., and Detroit — and provide an alternative to sitting in clogged traffic. A proposal by Mayor Bill de Blasio for a streetcar in Brooklyn and Queens appears to be stalled."
922,"There is at least one bright spot: Citi Bike has become an essential part of the city’s fabric. The bike-share system has 12,000 bikes across Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens and recently announced plans to expand under new ownership by the ride-hail company Lyft, which will triple the number of bikes."
923,"Only a decade ago, the New York region was flying high. More than 90 percent of subway trains were on time, compared to about 70 percent today. In the 1990s, New Jersey Transit won a coveted award three times from the American Public Transportation Association."
924,"But in recent years, the East Coast has been notably absent from the awards ceremony, the Oscars of public transportation. Cities including Seattle, Salt Lake City and Houston have captured the title of outstanding transit system."
925,"“In some of these growing communities like L.A. and Seattle, they haven’t been blessed with great infrastructure, and they’re trying to play catch up, frankly,” Paul Skoutelas, the association’s president, said."
926,"When Seattle’s King County Metro won the award in September, it was praised as “a system that is expanding and innovating to meet rising demand” — not to mention a program that offers lower fares for poor riders that has served as a model for New York and other cities. Transit ridership in Seattle is growing, and car use is down."
927,"One key difference is the West Coast has the ballot measure, while New York State does not allow voters to directly approve measures like transit funding. In 2016, both Los Angeles County and the Seattle region approved measures to boost transportation funding. The Los Angeles proposal, known as Measure M, won nearly 70 percent of the vote, greenlighting $120 billion in spending by raising the sales tax."
928,"“The ballot initiative allows them to proceed without the political angst you’d have in Albany,” said Jon Orcutt, a director at TransitCenter, a research group in New York. “It takes some pressure off politicians. The voters go out and do it, and that creates political cover.”"
929,"Los Angeles plans to build 100 new miles of rail — essentially doubling the Metro system, whose first rail line opened in 1990. There are now six lines and 93 stations. Huge machines recently began digging new tunnels for a Purple Line extension to the county’s Westside — part of a plan to attract younger people who are more likely to favor transit and worry about the environmental impact of cars."
930,"“We had a political miracle,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in an interview. “A permanent 1-cent sales tax.”"
931,"Mr. Garcetti, a Democrat, hopes the new rail lines will boost transit ridership. The number of train and bus trips in Los Angeles has dropped in recent years, though he blamed that on low gas prices and national trends in declining transit ridership."
932,"Mr. Garcetti makes a point of using the subway. He took the Red Line recently, from City Hall to MacArthur Park, to visit Langer’s for the city’s “best pastrami sandwich.” He is also deciding how best to regulate the electric scooters that have flooded Los Angeles."
933,"“I want to make them work,” he said. “I’m excited by them. They’re generally taking car trips off the road.”"
934,"New York has unique challenges when it comes to funding and governance, Ms. Trottenberg said. In Los Angeles, the transit system is controlled by Mr. Garcetti, while New York’s subway is controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state lawmakers, many of whom rarely use the system and have shown little interest in making it a priority."
935,"If New Yorkers had been asked to approve new transit funding in a ballot measure during the midterm election, Ms. Trottenberg believes it would have won."
936,"“It would have to be a mixture so that we’re fixing the old, and you have to put in some new things in, too,” she said."
937,"Instead, the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, is pleading with state leaders to approve new revenue sources when they return to Albany in January. Mr. Byford says it will cost more than $40 billion to fix the system — a figure that does not include any expansion or new lines."
938,"In Seattle, a $54 billion ballot measure approved two years ago will help extend the region’s light rail system to 116 miles from about 20 miles."
939,"Dow Constantine, the executive of King County, which is home to Seattle, said the city’s culture was changing, too."
940,"“Folks are tired of sitting in traffic,” Mr. Constantine, a Democrat, said. “They’re mindful of the environmental implications of driving.”"
941,"Seattle also wants to learn from the East Coast’s mistakes, Mr. Constantine said."
942,"“I made sure we included funding for long-term maintenance,” he said, “so you don’t get the situation we’re seeing in New York and Washington where the systems have been neglected and it’s expensive and inconvenient to rebuild.”"
943,The president of the United States suggested last week that his political supporters might resort to violence if they didn’t get their way.
944,The statement didn’t even get that much attention. I’m guessing you heard a lot more about the college-admissions scandal than about the president’s threat of extralegal violence. So let me tell you a little more about the threat.
945,"In an Oval Office interview with writers from the right-wing news site Breitbart, President Trump began complaining about Paul Ryan. As speaker of the House, Ryan blocked efforts by other House Republicans to subpoena and investigate people on the political left. Trump’s loyal allies in the House “wanted to go tougher,” Trump said, “but they weren’t allowed to by leadership.”"
946,"To Trump, the incident was part of a larger problem: “You know, the left plays a tougher game. It’s very funny. I actually think that the people on the right are tougher, but they don’t play it tougher. O.K.? I can tell you I have the support of the police, the support of the military, the support of the Bikers for Trump. I have the tough people, but they don’t play it tough — until they go to a certain point, and then it would be very bad, very bad.”"
947,[Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]
948,"This wasn’t the first time Trump had mused about violence, of course. He has talked about “Second Amendment people” preventing the appointment of liberal judges. He’s encouraged police officers to bang suspects’ heads against car roofs. He has suggested his supporters “knock the hell” out of hecklers. At a rally shortly before 2018 Election Day, he went on a similar riff about Bikers for Trump and the military."
949,I’m well aware of the various see-no-evil attempts to excuse this behavior: That’s just how he talks. Don’t take him literally. Other Republicans are keeping him in check. His speeches and tweets don’t really matter.
950,But they do matter. The president’s continued encouragement of violence — and of white nationalism — is part of the reason that white-nationalist violence is increasing. Funny how that works.
951,"After Trump’s latest threat, I reached out to several experts in democracy and authoritarianism to ask what they made of it. Their answers were consistent: No, the United States does not appear at risk of widespread political violence anytime soon. But Trump’s words are still corroding democracy and public safety."
952,"His latest incitement fit a historical pattern, and one with “scary echoes,” as Daniel Ziblatt, who co-wrote the recent book “How Democracies Die,” told me. Trump combined lies about his political opponents — Democrats who need to be investigated (for made-up scandals) — with allusions to a patriotic, violent response by ordinary citizens. Latin American autocrats, including Hugo Chávez in Venezuela, have used this combination. So did European fascists in the 1930s."
953,"The United States, thank goodness, does not have armed citizen militias carrying out regular attacks, as those other countries did. But our situation is still worrisome. “Violent talk can, at minimum, encourage lone-wolf violence,” Steven Levitsky, Ziblatt’s co-author and a Harvard political scientist, said. “It can also slowly normalize political violence, turning discourse and ideas that were once unsayable and even unthinkable into things that are sayable and thinkable.”"
954,"These risks are not just hypothetical. In 2017, a House candidate body-slammed a reporter who asked a probing question — behavior with no recent precedent. Trump praised the now-congressman, Greg Gianforte, for the assault. In the Bright Light Watch survey of political scientists late last year, only 49 percent said the United States did not tolerate political violence, a notable decline from earlier levels. Some respondents cited Gianforte."
955,"Statistics on hate crimes are notoriously unreliable, but the evidence strongly suggests that they’re rising. The F.B.I.’s data shows an increase. The Anti-Defamation League reports a 73 percent rise in “extremist-related killings” during the last four years. "
956,"Not all attacks come from people who identify with the political right, obviously: The 2017 attempted mass murder of House Republicans on a baseball field is one horrific example. But most politically motivated attacks do indeed come from the right. Last year, 39 of the 50 extremist killings tracked by the A.D.L. were committed by white supremacists, and another eight were committed by killers espousing anti-government views. "
957,"Drawing a direct line from the purveyors of hateful rhetoric to any specific hate crime is usually impossible. And it’s usually a mistake to try. The motive for these crimes — be it in New Zealand last week or Pittsburgh last year — is typically a stew of mental illness, personal anger and mixed-up ideology. Trump doesn’t deserve to be blamed for any specific crime. But he does deserve blame for the trend."
958,"It isn’t very complicated: The man with the world’s largest bully pulpit keeps encouraging violence and white nationalism. Lo and behold, white-nationalist violence is on the rise. You have to work pretty hard to persuade yourself that’s just a big coincidence."

961,SAN FRANCISCO — Lyft’s debut on the stock market is off to a bumpy start.
962,"The ride-hailing company went public in a blaze of glory on Friday, as its stock jumped 8.7 percent from its initial public offering price of $72 a share. On Monday, in its second day of trading, Lyft’s stock plunged nearly 12 percent to below $72, closing the day at $69.01."
963,"The rapid decline raises questions about investors’ appetite for fast-growing but unprofitable tech companies. While Lyft has been expanding and gaining new revenue, it lost nearly $1 billion last year. Ride-hailing companies often subsidize the cost of rides and pay incentives to drivers, which is expensive. And Lyft is also spending heavily on initiatives including electric bikes and self-driving technology."
964,"Other tech companies that went public while recording large losses, such as Snap, Twitter and Groupon, also eventually fell below their offering prices."
965,"“Everyone is taken up with the idea of the ride-hailing business; it’s exciting and high-growth,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages an I.P.O.-focused exchange-traded fund that will include Lyft later this week. “But it’s hard to figure out their valuation.”"
966,Lyft declined to comment.
967,[Not everyone who invested in Lyft is reaping the spoils.]
968,Lyft’s performance could sway other high-profile tech companies that are planning to go public.
969,"Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing company, is planning to go public in the next few months; it is also deeply unprofitable. Others stampeding toward the public market include Pinterest, the digital pin board; Slack, the messaging company; and Peloton, the home-fitness company."
970,"“The ones following in the wake of Lyft will be priced more reasonably,” Ms. Smith said."
971,"Even if Lyft eventually makes money, its margins might be low, she cautioned. Lyft is constantly dealing with new competitors, which means that it may have to continue subsidizing its drivers and cutting the prices that it charges passengers. That makes profits a faraway prospect."
972,"The volatility in Lyft’s stock was not unexpected, said Tom White, a senior vice president at the wealth management firm D. A. Davidson. “Nothing has changed on the fundamental outlook for the business in the last few days,” he said."
973,"MELBOURNE, Australia — “I’ve never done this before,” Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova said as she climbed on a stationary bike in front of a crowd that didn’t feel that much smaller than the one that had watched her 6-7 (3), 6-3, 6-3 upset of fifth-seeded Sloane Stephens at the Australian Open."
974,"The fourth-round match ended six minutes before 2 a.m. on Monday morning, and Pavlyuchenkova was mentally making a list of all the tasks that stood between her and a good morning’s sleep: the stationary bike, the reporters with their notebooks and microphones, the ice bath, the shower, the change of clothes, the drive back to the hotel."
975,"Pavlyuchenkova asked if she could field questions from reporters while she pedaled so she could kill two tasks with one bike ride. She was so tired, she had struggled to construct her points on the court, and now she was having trouble organizing her thoughts in front of reporters."
976,"That’s what a starting time of nearly half-past 11 will do to a player. “It’s honestly terrible,” Pavlyuchenkova said, adding, “It’s not ideal time to play tennis.”"
977,"Describing the match, she said, “I was like, ‘This match is so intense, why am I like still sometimes feeling like I’m going to fall asleep now?’”"
978,"The late, late, late show, with hosts Pavlyuchenkova and Stephens, started Sunday and ended Monday. Nine matches in the first eight days of the tournament ended after midnight, but Pavlyuchenkova’s win over Stephens wasn’t close to being the latest finish."
979,"It was 12 minutes past 3 a.m. on Friday when Garbiñe Muguruza clinched her second-round match against Johanna Konta. By the time Muguruza met with her coach, showered, changed out of her tennis outfit, received a massage, fulfilled her media obligations and returned to her hotel, it was one hour before sunrise."
980,"And Muguruza’s match wasn’t close to being the latest-ever finish in Australian Open history; that feather is in the pillows of Lleyton Hewitt and Marcos Baghdatis, whose third-round slugfest here in 2008, won by Hewitt, ended at 4:33 in the morning."
981,"The prime-time television hours in Muguruza’s native Spain are from 10:30 p.m. until 1 a.m., so she knows from flawed time systems."
982,"And yet, Muguruza, 25, readily acknowledged that playing that late “is not normal.” She added, “It was very awkward.”"
983,"The post-midnight hours would pose no problem if the players had the body clocks of the mostly nocturnal koala bear, who can sleep up to 22 hours. But the human body’s inner clock has a circadian low, a window roughly between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m., when focus, strength, reaction time and physical flexibility ebb, the better to promote sleep."
984,The circadian rhythm can be reset by changing sleep or eating patterns. But how can players adjust their internal clocks for optimal performance when they’re playing at 2 a.m. one day and at 2 p.m. another?
985,"“There is no way to train that,” said Maria Sharapova, who advanced to the third round in a match that ended at 12:36 a.m. — or roughly two hours past her preferred bedtime."
986,"“If you ask any player that goes into this tournament how many times they have trained after midnight, unless you’re jet lagged or just crazy, you don’t train for that.”"
987,"On the same night that Muguruza barely beat both Konta and daybreak, Novak Djokovic outlasted Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a match that ended 41 minutes past midnight. Djokovic, the men’s world No. 1, has a reputation for leaving few routes unexplored to gain a competitive edge. Over the years he has tried hyperbaric chambers, yoga, meditation, biofeedback and restrictive diets."
988,So is he crazy enough to have tried practicing after midnight?
989,"“No, I have not done that I don’t think ever,” Djokovic said."
990,"He added with a laugh, “I’m not doing push-ups at midnight before I go to sleep. You train a bit later, and the whole routine is pushed back a little bit. But you also want to get a good night’s sleep so your biological rhythm keeps going in the right way.”"
991,"Djokovic has one strategy, grudgingly adopted, that helps him sleep longer and sounder during tournaments: he leaves his two small children at home. He may be on to something. Norah Simpson, a clinical assistant professor at Stanford who studies the role of sleep on athletic performance, recommends that players get good, quality sleep in the days before matches so they don’t go into a late-night match already sleep-deprived."
992,"“It’s very challenging to navigate the variable schedule in respect to both your internal clock and the amount of sleep you’re able to obtain,” Simpson said in a telephone interview."
993,"The potential for late-night matches is part of tournaments with stadium lights and no curfews. Madison Keys played mostly night matches on her way to the final at the 2017 United States Open, and recalled going to bed after 4 a.m. many mornings, waking up around noon and taking power naps whenever she could. “It’s not natural,” she said, adding, “If I know I’m playing a night match, I sleep as much as I can the day before.”"
994,"Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova’s coach, Simon Goffin, encouraged her to stay up until 1 a.m. the night before playing Stephens to help reset her body clock."
995,"“I pushed her to watch a movie, do something, even after midnight, to be used to this kind of late match,” said Goffin, who also insisted that she sleep in until noon. “It’s important for the body and the mind to have this routine.”"
996,"Still, Pavlyuchenkova said she felt sluggish. “It was so, so strange because I was like ‘Come on, I have to make rallies!’” she said. “My energy level was on and off as well. I was trying to get as many energy drinks and gel packs as I could take.”"
997,"After ingesting all that caffeine, how did Pavlyuchenkova plan to get to sleep? “I don’t know honestly,” she said, adding, “Try to take chamomile tea?”"
998,"Lyft was not the first ride-hailing company. But it is poised to become the first publicly traded one, and investors’ appetite for its shares proved enormous."
999,"The company priced its shares at $72 each on Thursday, after raising its price range amid significant demand from prospective shareholders. That puts Lyft’s value at more than $24 billion as it prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday, under the ticker symbol LYFT."
1000,"In total, the company raised about $2.3 billion, having also increased the number of shares that were sold. (That amount could grow if Lyft’s underwriters sell an additional block of shares to meet even stronger-than-expected investor demand.)"
1001,"The offering marks the arrival of a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings on the public markets. Many of the companies promised new business models, upended established industries such as transportation and triggered a chain effect on how people work and make a living. The public offerings cement the place of the companies in people’s lives, promise millions of dollars in investment gains for their longtime backers and are set to unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry."
1002,[Lyft’s shares soared on Friday when it began trading on public markets.]
1003,"Among those set to follow in Lyft’s footsteps is its archrival, Uber, whose initial public offering in the next few months is expected to be the biggest in years. Others on the docket include the digital pin board company Pinterest, the messaging platform Slack and the delivery service Postmates, all betting that they will also gain enthusiastic backing from investors."
1004,"Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors."
1005,"“The strong demand for Lyft certainly bodes well for other unicorns,” said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business, using a term for start-ups valued at $1 billion or more."
1006,"But some investors worry that these companies, awash in red ink and unlikely to turn a profit for years, are being valued too highly and could ultimately disappoint their new public-market backers. Some companies that went public while running big losses, including Groupon and Snap, now trade well below their I.P.O. prices."
1007,"In its offering prospectus, Lyft revealed that it lost close to $1 billion in 2018. Lyft and Uber regularly lose money in their competition to win new markets, where they spend amply on subsidies for riders and drivers. The companies also burn cash on other transportation initiatives, like bikes, scooters and autonomous vehicles. Last year, Lyft bought the largest bike-sharing company in the United States for around $250 million."
1008,"“With Lyft, obviously, the market is saying, ‘We’re willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on a lot of things,’ given that there are huge uncertainties about its future,” Mr. Ritter said."
1009,"At its I.P.O. price, Lyft’s market value puts it within range of old-line auto companies like Ford Motor. It is a significant increase from the $15.1 billion that Lyft earned in its last private fund-raising round last year."
1010,"Over the past week and a half, Lyft executives and their bankers embarked on a roadshow that took them from New York to Kansas City to San Francisco, pitching their business to institutional investors. Lyft initially set a price range of $62 to $68 for its shares, before raising that range on Wednesday to $70 to $72. The offering was led by JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse."
1011,"Between 2001 and 2018, I.P.O.s that were priced above their initial range averaged a return of 37 percent, Mr. Ritter said."
1012,"But Lyft must now prove that it is worth the eye-popping valuation bestowed upon it by its new public-market investors. That challenge includes maintaining its enviable growth rate — it more than doubled its revenue in 2018 — while showing that its focus on transportation, rather than branching out into ever-more business lines as Uber has, can be lucrative."
1013,"The offering’s success will bring windfalls for Lyft’s biggest existing investors. Among them: the company’s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, who are poised to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars; Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant; and venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz."
1014,"Though Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer are taking their company public, they will still retain control, following in a long tradition of founder-led technology businesses. The two own special holdings that give them nearly 49 percent of voting shares, despite owning less than 5 percent of the overall stock."
1015,"Lyft also plans to give cash bonuses to drivers who have completed a large number of rides for the company, so that they can buy shares at the I.P.O. price. Drivers with 10,000 rides will receive $1,000, which at the $72 price would allow them to buy 13 shares before taxes. Drivers who have finished 20,000 rides will receive $10,000."
1016,"Only full-time drivers who have been with the platform for several years are likely to make the cut, said Harry Campbell, an Uber and Lyft driver who runs the driver blog and resource site The Rideshare Guy."
1017,"“It was the right thing to do,” he said of Lyft’s cash bonuses for drivers. “If you gave 10,000 rides for Lyft, you actually were a big part of helping build this company.” He added that the I.P.O. was “kind of exciting to be part of” for drivers."
1018,"Unlike Lyft’s employees and early investors, who are restricted by a lockup period from selling their shares, drivers will be able to sell any Lyft stock purchased through the cash bonus program as soon as the company begins trading on the public market, according to an email sent to qualifying drivers and reviewed by The New York Times."
1019,"But the cash bonuses ultimately did not satisfy many drivers, who work as freelancers for Lyft and Uber and do not receive full-time employee benefits. This week, hundreds of them protested in San Francisco and Los Angeles against lower pay rates."
1020,"“If political will starts to shift against Uber and Lyft, that’s a scary proposition,” Mr. Campbell said."
1021,Room start at $239.
1022,"Carved out from Orange County by cliffs that slope down to the sparkling Pacific, Laguna Beach is a wildly popular bolt-hole for all manner of Californians, from Tesla-entombed tech worthies vaping down the freeway from Los Angeles to burbling families in boxy Odysseys looking for relief from the San Fernando Valley’s canned heat. It is also now home to the Hotel Joaquin, which opened in September 2018 after a gut-renovation of the shabbily serviceable Motor Inn at Laguna Beach. The Joaquin comes under the Auric Road corporate umbrella, which includes other swank “petite resorts” such as the Korakia Pensione in Palm Springs and the Lone Mountain Ranch in Big Sky, Montana. The airy redesign, featuring exposed rafters, oiled white oak ceilings, turntables instead of TVs, and vintage furniture from France, was the concept of the modish, New York-based studio of Robert McKinley, whose other laurels include The Surf Lodge in Montauk and The Hall in Miami."
1023,"The eight-mile stretch of Laguna Beach, with over 20 beaches and coves, three summer arts festivals, 50-plus art galleries and a population of eco-obsessed locals, was a favorite refuge for Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, Bing Crosby, Mary Pickford and fellow members of Hollywood royalty who lived, tippled or trysted amidst the town’s fragrant eucalyptus groves. Other notable residents have included the Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary, who commended the “Orange Sunshine” LSD brewed by a shaggy local outfit calling themselves Brotherhood of Eternal Love, and, more recently, the billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who dropped $19 million on an 8,000 square foot home in December. The three-tiered, 22-room Joaquin is perched along the North Coast Highway, providing ocean views and salty breezes from several of its rooms and is a reasonable walk or short drive to all of the town’s surfing or paddling beaches, boutiques, galleries and restaurants."
1024,"Despite being on the lowest of three levels, my garden-side room had ample natural light and was invitingly divided by a couch to provide lounging space. I skipped the minibar, which had pre-mixed bottles of Negroni and Ginger Buck, and, turning to the Marantz turntable, ending up supplementing the in-room vinyl — The Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations,” Carole King’s “Tapestry” — with the Thelonious Monk Quartet’s “Monk’s Dream” from the hotel’s stash. Books also furnished the room, including the poems of Rumi and a deckle-edged paperback of Kerouac’s “On the Road.” My off-season room cost $239; I’d highly recommend reserving one of the several rooms with an ocean view, which off-season start at $389. In-season, ocean-view rooms start around $522."

1026,"The hotel’s Mediterranean-inflected restaurant, Saline, serves a good breakfast (included with your stay featuring items such house-cured salmon and Berkshire pork sausage) as well as lunch and dinner, and so far is only open to hotel guests. At dinner, I ordered the charred artichoke with garlic aoli, dill and caper oil ($12), followed by the black sea bass ($25) and both did credit to the Argentine chef, Leo Bongarra. The cocktail list leans toward health-conscious inebriation; the “Saline g&t” contains opihr oriental spiced gin, Junipero gin, artisanal tonic syrup, soda, lemongrass, aloe vera and star anise, for $14. For the teetotaler, there’s the “No Booze Cruise,” a concoction of seedlip garden, fever tree Mediterranean tonic, ginger and pineapple at $11. The sparse wine features under-aged California pinots and lesser cabernets, with a few obligatory bottles of southern French reds."
1027,"Walking in to the “Living Room,” the hotel’s sun-streaked lounge, can feel like walking into an old (and rich) friend’s beach house. A retro vibe announces itself by the turntable and collection of vinyl records. Glistening water dispensers hold teardrop-shaped vials filled with gems, promising qualities such as “Love,” “Fitness,” and “Forever Young.” (Make mine a double!) At night, the hotel acquires the martinis-and-midnight swim mood of a chic Mid-Century California motel, updated for the hygge generation. By day, the hotel provides an “adventure guru” who will outfit you free of charge with surfboards, kayaks, paddle boards, bikes and even diving gear, and point you toward the miles of nearby hiking in the Laguna Beach Wilderness Park, biking trails such as the Rock-It/Cholla Loop, or surf breaks such as Brooks Street Beach, where 1960s surf champion Corky Carroll had many epic afternoons."

1034,"Grab, which is based in Singapore and serves eight countries in Southeast Asia, announced on Wednesday that it had secured nearly $1.5 billion from the SoftBank Vision Fund, the technology investing arm of the Japanese conglomerate. "
1035,"With this latest funding, Grab said it had raised more than $4.5 billion in its current financing round from investors that include Toyota, Hyundai, Microsoft and Booking Holdings, the online travel services company. Grab is now valued at around $14 billion, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly."
1036,"The seven-year-old company’s diverse roster of backers is an indication of the breadth of its ambitions. Grab hopes that people will use its app not only to get from place to place, but also to order meals, send packages, pay for things offline and book hotel rooms, among other tasks."
1037,"Last year, Grab acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move aimed at expanding its presence in both food delivery and rides. Grab said that from last March, when the tie-up with Uber was announced, to the end of the year, its transport revenue almost doubled, while its food-delivery revenue grew 45 times."
1038,"The “super-app” concept is already well established in China.

1041,"Reveling in abundant displays of toxic masculinity and pumped-up posing, the Australian biker drama “Outlaws” is a punishing watch — more so when you can decipher the dialogue. Between the thick Aussie cadences and the tight-lipped, tough-guy delivery, I found myself paying closer attention to body language than a couple on a first date."
1042,"Here’s what I gleaned, but don’t hold me to it. The nastiest piece of work (the designation is entirely relative) is Knuck (Matt Nable), the newly sprung president of a motorcycle gang whose stint in the slammer has left him with a taste for rape and a bloodthirsty need to reclaim his territory. His smarter deputy — again, relative — Paddo (Ryan Corr), has set up a mutually beneficial money-laundering deal with a rival gang, threatening Knuck’s supremacy. And because few things are more volatile than an emasculated thug, we guess it won’t be long before mattresses and ammunition are at the top of everyone’s shopping list."
1043,"Directing his first feature (from a screenplay by Nable), Stephen McCallum fashions an unremittingly vicious, leather-and-ink slugfest whose women are just as distasteful as its men. The movie’s misogyny is baked into its stereotypes — like the decorative, viperish enabler and the drug-dependent plaything — unmitigated by a late power flip that feels tacked on. Also problematic is Mark’s simple-minded brother (Josh McConville), whose persistent screw-ups precipitate much of the violence, yet whose character remains no more than a sketch."

1052,"A travel tip for the Dolomites: You don’t want to be the driver, negotiating steep hairpin turns and bands of Italian cyclists pedaling through dangerously narrow mountain passes. You want to be the passenger, the one hanging her head out the window, mouth agape, transfixed on the mountain peaks and gloriously green valleys. This monumental mountain range in northeastern Italy is one of the world’s most beautiful playgrounds for outdoor adventurers, from winter skiers to summer hikers, bikers, mountain climbers and more. But equally fascinating is its cultural heritage."

1055,Sometimes the seemingly small things in life can be major stressors.
1056,"Nobody likes sitting in traffic, for example. According to one study, commuting is one of the least pleasant things we do. But it’s not just an annoying time waster — there’s a case that it’s a public health issue."
1057,"According to analysis by the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, the average American commuter spends 42 hours per year stuck in rush-hour traffic. In the Los Angeles area, the figure is nearly twice that, equivalent to more than three days. A 2015 Los Angeles Times poll found that among residents of that city, traffic concerns exceed those pertaining to personal safety, finances or housing costs."
1058,"The total cost of traffic associated with lost time and wasted fuel exceeds $100 billion per year. As time slips away, idling vehicles add pollution, which has environmental and health consequences, including contributions to climate change.  Long-term exposure to vehicle exhaust is associated with respiratory problems, especially in children. "
1059,"Another toll is to psychological well-being, stemming from the sense of helplessness we experience in traffic, and its unpredictability. This, too, can be quantified. One study found that to save a minute of time spent in traffic, people would trade away five minutes of any other leisure activity. Another study found that we deal better with the commuting delays that we can anticipate."
1060,"Stressed-out people can take out their frustration on others. We’ve probably all experienced or seen road rage, but aggressive behavior can carry over beyond a commute. "
1061,"A recent analysis of Los Angeles traffic, published in the Journal of Public Economics, documented a link between congestion and domestic violence. From 2011 to 2015, the study found, extreme evening traffic on two major highways — I-5 and I-10 — increased the incidence of nighttime domestic violence by about 9 percent."
1062,"What the researchers, Louis-Philippe Beland, an economist at Louisiana State University, and Daniel Brent, an economist at Penn State, mean by “extreme traffic” in their study is best explained with an example: The average evening commute along I-10 for residents of Santa Monica in their study was 45 minutes. Extreme traffic would increase this to 87 minutes."
1063," “Life stressors act as emotional cues,” Mr. Beland said. “What our work shows is that in extreme cases some people’s responses to those cues can be quite large, leading to violence.”"
1064,"Teaching children how to manage stress and traumatic events from a young age can be important. “Throughout life, mindfulness, healthy eating, sleeping and exercise, and hobbies that blow of steam all help,” said Rebecca Mooney, director of Melrose Alliance Against Violence, which raises awareness about domestic violence and related issues in and around Melrose, Mass."
1065,Officials are not powerless before the problems that stressful commutes can cause. Los Angeles has put in a system that charges solo drivers more to use certain lanes of the I-10 and I-110 highways during periods of heavy traffic. This encourages drivers to move their commutes to less congested times or routes. A study of congestion pricing on Seattle’s SR-520 Bridge found that drivers using the route and its alternatives were less stressed and more satisfied with their commutes after the pricing change.
1066,"In addition, many states have been replacing tollbooths with electronic and cashless tolling systems like E-ZPass. More employers are allowing people to work remotely. Troubled transit systems in some cities may be partly behind an increase in car ownership in those areas, but certain West Coast cities are making sweeping expansions of their public transit systems, and many cities are adding bike lanes. "
1067,"Those who can walk or bike to work tend to have a double advantage. Not only do they avoid the harmful consequences of traffic, but they can also improve their health through exercise. Younger people are more likely to prefer that style of commuting, and are driving less than previous generations. "
1068,There may be more good news in coming decades for those who loathe gridlock. Although self-driving cars won’t cure traffic woes on their own — the way that economics-based approaches like congestion pricing can — they may be able to reduce stress.
1069,"If you’re crawling along in traffic and are late to an appointment, but are allowed to take a nap, play video games, watch your favorite TV show or sip on a cocktail, will that reduce your stress? We don’t know for sure, but we look forward to the studies on that. "
1070,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Erin Griffith, a start-ups and venture capital reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she’s using."
1071,You focus on start-ups. Do any of the tech products you use come from start-ups?
1072,"If very old, highly valued pre-I.P.O. companies like Slack, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest still count as start-ups, then yes, every day. Every few minutes! I’m Slacking in between each sentence I write."
1073,"We’re no longer in an era when hot new social media apps are bubbling up every few months, and if they are, I’ve aged out of the early-adopter demographic. Now whenever I stumble upon a new social media app, my only “friends” using it are the venture capitalists I write about. (Even those apps tend to be copied or bought by Facebook.)"
1074,"I use Nuzzel, which sends alerts for stories my Twitter friends are talking about. This is a good way to catch things that elude push notifications and newsletters, including whatever hate-read everyone is angry about."
1075,"Pocket, an app for saving articles, lets me feel better about not finishing all the Important Long Reads I encounter throughout the day. I can tell myself I’ll get to them later. (I probably won’t.)"
1076,"Giphy, a search engine for GIFs, allows me to express myself when words, emojis or Bitmojis are not enough."
1077,"I also use a combination of Swarm, the check-in app that grew out of Foursquare; an IFTTT (If This, Then That) recipe; and Google Calendar to record my whereabouts. It’s helpful for doing expenses or remembering the name of a restaurant I went to last month."
1078,"And Strava, an app for workouts, lets me track my bike rides and jogs. A lot of this creates a privacy mess, I know."
1079,What tech tools do you rely on the most for work?
1080,"This is least techie answer possible, but aside from email and my phone’s voice recorder, it’s probably paper. (Sorry, trees, including the one this article will be printed on.) For every big story I do, I print out huge stacks of background reading on the executives and industry. They’re good for flights since there’s no danger of bad Wi-Fi or no outlets."
1081,"When I’m writing a longer story, I print out all my interview notes and spread the pages across my kitchen table (or floor), in the manner of a chef’s mise en place. This helps me organize my thoughts before I dive into the writing. I don’t understand how people can work off 30 different documents on one tiny laptop screen."
1082,"I also find it very comforting to constantly make and remake to-do lists on whatever paper I can find — old envelopes and junk mail, receipts, notepads shaped like my first initial, Post-its. I leave a trail of these everywhere I go, like the Johnny Appleseed of productivity."
1083,Anything that doesn’t contribute to deforestation?
1084,"To transcribe interviews, I use Temi, a service that relies on artificial intelligence. The quality is not great, but it is very cheap and gets me over the impossible procrastination hump of not starting the article because I don’t want to listen to my own voice. And it presents the messy interview transcript in a way that I can find what I want and easily play it back, sometimes without having to endure any of my stammering."
1085,"Like every other reporter, I use Signal and way too much Twitter. I also use some of the data services the venture capitalists use to identify and track up-and-coming start-ups: App Annie, Crunchbase, CB Insights, Pitchbook, LinkedIn."
1086,"The most crucial reporting tool I have is probably a gigantic purse that fits my entire life: laptop, tangled masses of chargers and headphones, numerous snacks and water bottles, a dozen pens, a bunch of notebooks, and at least three half-read New Yorkers that have traveled across the country with me so many times they’re basically my emotional support animals."
1087,"What trends do you see emerging in the start-up scene? Which of them do you think have potential to be successful, and which ones will be a flash in a pan?"
1088,"Being new to San Francisco (I moved from New York last year), I felt it was important to go full native. I acquired AirPods, downloaded the Mr. Chilly weather app for the city’s “microclimates” and briefly embraced scooters. I have not yet bought a vest from the vending machine at San Francisco International Airport, but given the aforementioned microclimates, I see their appeal."
1089,"The scooter services rode a wave of hype, and I suspect the severity of the backlash to scooter debris — and the vandalism — was greater than the companies and their investors expected. Between injuries, regulatory scrutiny, higher-than-anticipated replacement costs, potential tariffs and the wearing off of the initial novelty, the companies seem to be experiencing a trough of disillusionment just in time for spring."
1090,"I stopped riding the scooters because I was spending every scooting second thinking about how this would be an especially embarrassing way for a tech reporter to die. Even imagining myself explaining to strangers that, heavy sigh, yes, these crutches are from a scooter accident was enough to convert me back to a boring old analog bike."
1091,You’ve written about hustle culture and toil glamour. Is the idea of work-life balance dead?
1092,"Unfortunately, a lot of the companies that outwardly promote the concept of work-life balance are the ones with the worst cultures of overwork. Over time, I imagine, hypocrisy will turn people off working at those places. Until then, it’s up to the workers to draw their own boundaries. "
1093,"One way to do that is to understand the difference between taking pride in their work and defining their self-worth by their jobs. And maybe lowering sky-high expectations about their company’s do-gooder missions, and being realistic about how fulfilling their jobs will actually be."
1094,"Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life?"
1095,"I have exactly one useful product endorsement: Everyone should abandon the tyranny of bulky, uncomfortable U-shaped neck pillows for the Trtl sleep pillow."
1096,"When I covered the tech industry from New York, I traveled to San Francisco all the time, and the Trtl saved me on countless red-eyes. It’s basically a plastic neck brace attached to a Velcro scarf. It looks absurd. It easily fits into a purse. It’s glorious."
1097,"SAN FRANCISCO — In a rush to beat its rival Uber to the public market, Lyft is preparing to start trading in early April, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans."
1098,"Lyft intends to begin its roadshow, in which it meets with investors to talk up the initial public offering, the week of March 18, the two people said. Companies usually start trading a week or so after a roadshow."
1099,"If Lyft wins this race, it will be the first ride-hailing company to go public. The two companies have been locked in a competition to go public, with Lyft facing pressure to be first to avoid being overshadowed by Uber, which is much larger."
1100,"The start-up, founded in 2007 by Logan Green and John Zimmer, is one of several tech companies pushing to go public early this year. Slack and Pinterest are among the others."
1101,Lyft and Uber declined to comment.
1102,"Lyft and Uber have competed fiercely for riders and drivers since their earliest days, often introducing copycat services within days of each other. In keeping with that tradition, both filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day in early December."
1103,"The review of their filings stalled briefly when the government partially shut down later that month. The review process may take longer for Uber than for Lyft, because Uber is involved in several secondary businesses, like food and freight deliveries. Uber and Lyft both operate bike and scooter services, as well as self-driving car development wings."
1104,"Lyft will list on the Nasdaq and expects to be valued between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to the people familiar with the company’s plans. The details about Lyft’s pending roadshow were first reported by Reuters."
1105,"The Lyft listing is a win for Nasdaq, which struggled to attract tech companies after the exchange suffered delays and technical issues during Facebook’s I.P.O. and faced tough competition from the New York Stock Exchange for tech debuts. In the aftermath of the Facebook fumble, tech firms like Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, Square, and Twitter went public on the Big Board."
1106,"Lyft was last valued by private investors at $15.1 billion, and has selected JPMorgan Chase to lead its public offering."
1107,$109 to $629
1108,"Before the Hotel Peter & Paul opened this past fall, the clutch of buildings it now occupies had been vacant for years: a Catholic school shuttered in 1993, and a beautiful mid-19th century church that fell out of use in 2001. The property, which also includes a former convent and rectory, has been revived by the buzzy ASH NYC design and development firm, with local partner Nathalie Jordi, into a 71-room hotel aiming to mix vintage aesthetics with modern perks. Located in a residential section of a city that can be surly about yet another offering to the tourists, its most impressive design achievement may be how well it blends in. The red brick structures have been elegantly restored, with no added flash and minimal signage; on a street level, nothing announces “hotel.” That light touch goes a long way. Check-in was easy, and the front desk workers seemed pleased when they figured out my companion and I were locals."
1109,"That these lovely buildings were vacant may suggest that the surrounding Faubourg Marigny neighborhood is somehow neglected, but in fact it’s thriving. The hotel is two blocks from Frenchmen Street, where a vibrant collection of live-music venues and restaurants (The Maison, Snug Harbor, Three Muses, and more) has evolved into a sort of Bourbon Street alternative for people with a modicum of taste. The Marigny is situated between the French Quarter and its many famous attractions (Café du Monde, Preservation Hall, etc.) and the Bywater, which to the surprise of longtime residents has developed a reputation as the Brooklyn of New Orleans, with various hip restaurants and bars (Bywater American Bistro, The Joint, and several dives I’d prefer you didn’t ruin). The local Blue Bikes bike-sharing system is a really useful way to explore — just factor in the raggedy condition of many New Orleans streets."
1110,"Most rooms are in the former school building, but I opted to spend a little extra for one in The Convent ($229 for a “classic” room, compared to $149 for a Schoolhouse Classic), a smaller building at the edge of the property. The room was spacious and nicely furnished; I liked the bed’s fancy wrought iron canopy frame with crosses on the corners. But it felt a little isolated compared to the school (where you check in) and its warmer and more active vibe. Worse: the Wi-Fi didn’t work. The front desk, while immediately responsive to my irritable call, seemed familiar with this issue in my second-floor room, and offered to move me. But by then I’d unpacked and it was 10 o’clock, and I wasn’t in the mood."
1111,"Surprisingly large, tile-floored and tidy, with bath products “made exclusively for Hotel Peter & Paul.” When we checked in, we were given the option of a room with a claw-foot tub, or a balcony, and chose the latter. For us this meant a disconcertingly huge shower; seriously, you could wash a pony in it. The water heated quickly and the pressure was great. (On the other hand, our balcony overlooked the parking lot.)"
1112,"The developers clearly mean for the Elysian Bar, in the old rectory space, to be a destination of its own, and have partnered with the stalwart Bywater neighborhood wine shop, restaurant, and music venue Bacchanal. The food is inventive and solid: smoked gulf fish with pickled mustard seeds and avocado on toast ($11); chorizo with kale and mixed grains topped with a fried egg ($15); and confit chicken leg over excellent braised white beans ($15) all impressed. The bar is situated toward the back of the rectory building, with several warm and inviting spaces to drink or nosh, and the Thursday night crowd was lively. It felt like a discovery."
1113,"You’re on your own for breakfast, however. The “café” that opens at 7 a.m. offered only some puny muffins and a single cheese biscuit. The barista endorsed Cake Café a few blocks away. That’s further than I wanted to walk while starving, so I had a perfectly pleasing eggs, sausage, and biscuit with house jam combo ($7) at Who Dat Coffee Cafe, across the street. The hotel menu, which kicks in at 10:30 a.m., includes some brunch-y options, including a duck egg omelet with “Cajun caviar beurre monte” ($13)."
1114,"On the third floor of the old school building, its auditorium has been converted into a kind of reading lounge, with the stage intact, comfy furniture, an eclectic library, and a nifty trompe l’oeil depiction of a posh drawing room. There’s also a nice courtyard area, and the church has been restored and converted into an impressive event space. As my companion noted several times, the communal space décor is somewhat comically gingham-heavy, but then some people really like gingham."
1115,"Hotel Peter & Paul is a beautiful spot in a great location for exploring New Orleans from a downriver home base, and its Elysian Bar deserves a visit. The place already feels like part of the city."

1117,A new adaptation of a classic novel debuts on HBO. And Kit Harington hosts “Saturday Night Live.” 
1118,"NATIVE SON (2019) 10 p.m. on HBO; Stream on HBO platforms. The conceptual artist Rashid Johnson makes his feature-directing debut in this adaptation of the 1940 novel by Richard Wright. Ashton Sanders (“Moonlight”) stars as Bigger, a rebellious bike messenger in the South Side of Chicago with big ambitions. Opportunity arrives when a wealthy white businessman, Henry Dalton (Bill Camp), offers him $1,000 a week to be his chauffeur, and suddenly Bigger is thrust into a world of money, luxury and power. His hopes for a better life collapse, though, when a night alone with Henry’s spoiled daughter (Margaret Qualley) ends in tragedy. James Baldwin was famously hostile toward Wright’s novel; he argued that Bigger’s character perpetuated the stereotype that black men are predisposed to violence. And that view didn’t go unnoticed. “Baldwin’s criticism is unavoidable,” Johnson said in an interview with The New York Times. He added: “I mean, now, Wright and Baldwin are so matched together, that it would be foolish and disingenuous to tell the story without taking into account what we know.”"
1119,"TRUE LOVE BLOOMS (2019) 8 p.m. on Hallmark. The premise of this will-they-won’t-they romance comes from the mind of one of its stars, Sara Rue (“Will & Grace.”) As a child, Rue worked in a community garden in Manhattan that was demolished to make way for a new building. That memory stuck with her, and here she gives it a twist: Rue plays Vikki, an urban gardener who fights to save her plot of land from a hunky real estate developer (Jordan Bridges) who threatens to replace it with condos. Because this is from Hallmark, viewers might be able to guess what happens next."
1120,"SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE 11:30 p.m. on NBC. Kit Harington hosts “S.N.L.” for the first time, ahead of the premiere of the eighth and final season of “Game of Thrones” on HBO, and Sara Bareilles performs songs off her new album, “Amidst the Chaos.” “S.N.L.” has had “Thrones” stars poke fun at their own show in the past: Peter Dinklage appeared in a behind-the-scenes sketch with Kate McKinnon as Emilia Clarke leading up to Season 6, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau showed up in a sketch about a fake trivia show called “Game of Game of Thrones” in 2013."
1121,"SUPERSTAR (1999) Stream on Amazon; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu or YouTube. Molly Shannon has had a long, prolific career — and she returns to the big screen next week in the historical comedy “Wild Nights With Emily.” But it was when Shannon was a regular cast member on “S.N.L.” that her star began to rise. One of her most popular sketches on the show inspired this feature-length comedy about Mary, an awkward schoolgirl who has two goals: to become a “superstar!” and to kiss her crush, Sky (Will Ferrell). The movie has many flaws, but Mary’s tense posture, finger-sniffing and signature pose still draw laughs 20 years later."
1122,"Welcome to the Running newsletter! Every Saturday morning, we email runners with news, advice and some motivation to help you get up and running. Sign up here to get it in your inbox."
1123,"Earlier this week, I read an article about what runners should eat while training for a 10-mile race. One piece of advice it offered: Take a banana and bagel to eat before the start of the race."
1124,"I don’t mind bananas. I have a bunch of them in my kitchen. But the few times I’ve eaten one before running, I tasted leftover banana for the entire run. Gross. I’d much rather drink a glass of whole milk before a run (which I’m sure has some of you thinking “gross!” too)."
1125,"That’s because there is no one runner diet. There are no absolutes except that you’ll probably want to eat something if you’re going to run for a long time. That was the big challenge of writing our How to Feed a Runner Guide, which is why it’s more about setting up guidelines to help you figure out what works for you than dictating absolutes. I didn’t want to declare that one way is the right way when there are as many right ways as there are runners."
1126,"It’s not a finite process, either. I’ve been running for more than a decade and I’m still experimenting. While writing the guide, one expert suggested eating dates for pre-run fuel, so I tried it. That worked, but then I tried dried apricots, which I liked better. When my nephews did not finish all of the Wegmans animal cookies I had gotten for them to eat on a vacation, I tried a few before a five-mile run, and now they’re a pre-run staple. And there’s nothing I love more than nonalcoholic peach cider after a long, hot summer run."
1127,"But that’s me. That may not be you. The only way to figure out what works for you is to try things out — and long before race day, so you know whether a banana before a race is a good idea for you, or makes you say “gross!” like it does for me."

1140,"SAN FRANCISCO — Big wealth doesn’t come in monthly paychecks. It comes when a start-up goes public, transforming hypothetical money into extremely real money. This year — with Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb all hoping to enter the public markets — there’s going to be a lot of it in the Bay Area."
1141,"Estimates of Uber’s value on the market have been as high as $120 billion. Airbnb was most recently valued at $31 billion, with Lyft and Pinterest around $15 billion and $12 billion. It’s anyone’s guess what prices these companies actually will command once they go public, but even conservative estimates predict hundreds of billions of dollars will flood into town in the next year, creating thousands of new millionaires. It’s hard to imagine more money in San Francisco, but the city’s residents now need to start trying."
1142,"Welcomed finally into the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area, the fleet of new millionaires are already itching to claim what has been promised all these years."
1143,They want cars. They want to open new restaurants. They want to throw bigger parties. And they want houses.
1144,"One recent night, in a packed room with a view of the Bay Bridge and an open bar, real estate investors gathered. Standing at the front presenting was Deniz Kahramaner, a real estate agent specializing in data analytics at Compass."
1145,“Are we going to see a one-bedroom condo that’s worth less than $1 million in five years?” he asked the crowd. “Are we going to see single family homes selling for one to three million?”
1146,"No, he said, not anymore. The energy rose as he revealed more data about new millionaires and about just how few new units have been built for them. San Francisco single-family home sale prices could climb to an average of $5 million, he said, to gasps."
1147,"[Sign up for California Today, our newsletter for Californians and people who care about California.]"
1148,"“All cash. These are all cash buyers,” he said. “It’s just going to be astounding.”"
1149,"Now, seemingly the whole city — and not just the financial planners and the real estate agents and the protesters who block tech buses — is scrambling to prepare."
1150,"As the idea of the coming I.P.O.-palooza took on currency, sellers started pulling their houses off the market. The broader California housing market has softened, and home sales are down, but here’s one fix for that. "
1151,"“Even if just half the I.P.O.s happen, there’s going to be ten thousand millionaires overnight,” said Herman Chan, a real estate agent with Sotheby’s. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaires everywhere left and right.’”"
1152,"One of those is his client Rick Rider, a 61-year-old C.E.O. who decided not to publicly list his Bay Area house until some of the I.P.O.s have happened."
1153,"“Our particular house is not a family home. It’s a Double Income No Kids sort of home,” Mr. Rider said. “So it would potentially play well for a lot of the people that would be benefiting from the I.P.O.s.”"
1154,The spending wars will likely stay close to work. 
1155,"“The millennial tech workers are really looking for convenience,” said Christine Kim, the president of Climb Real Estate. “They seem to not want to own cars, and food deliveries are really easy now, and they want to be close to entertainment, so they’ll stay in the city.”"
1156,"When Google in Mountain View and Facebook in Menlo Park went public, their workers were spread across the Bay Area, and so the impact on housing was diffuse. Now, many of the biggest start-ups are based in San Francisco, in part thanks to the city’s tax breaks. Brokers say San Francisco is where the workers want to stay."
1157,"In 2018 there were 5,644 properties sold in San Francisco and only 2,208 of those were single family homes. Software employees represent more than 50 percent of those buying, according to Compass. One real estate firm estimates an average one-bedroom in the city now rents for $3,690 per month. (Another firm puts that average at $3,551.)"
1158,"“Now you’ve got all these I.P.O.s at the same time, and we’ll potentially have thousands of young people, all now with money, looking to buy homes,” said Shane Ray, a real estate agent. “You’ll be able to feel it.”"
1159,Those in the market for a house are trying to buy them fast while the inventory shrinks but before the wave hits.
1160,"“I had this sense of existential dread that if we didn’t buy before all the I.P.O.s, we would forever be priced out,” said Tom McLeod, the founder of storage start-up Omni, who has been renting for nearly a decade. “We ended up pulling the trigger.”"
1161,"Companies instill in their employees a belief that stock only goes up. At this point, a decade since their founding, start-ups like Uber and Airbnb have been asking their employees to hold that faith for a long time. Now, wealth managers are hoping to rattle the religious."
1162,"Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, said he has started getting an influx of new clients who are preparing for wealth. He is worried. This generation of the start-up wealthy seem especially bullish on their company’s success."
1163,"“We’ve been trying to get them to exercise a little more caution, just because they’re so excited,” Mr. Cole said. “I don’t think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturn.”"
1164,"He cautions that no one can be sure how well a stock will do. A company like Uber is still dramatically unprofitable, he tries to remind his clients. So many I.P.O.s turn out to be busts. Groupon opened around $26 a share and now trades around $3; Snap opened around $27 and now trades at $9."
1165,"“A lot of them are young — they’ve just seen their valuations going up forever and they don’t really understand that tech stocks are volatile,” Mr. Cole said. “And they have their managers painting especially rosy pictures of where the company is headed to get them to work harder.”"
1166,"Mostly, he just urges his clients not to spend too much yet."
1167,"“They shouldn’t be buying boats,” Mr. Cole said. “We see a little bit of that.” "
1168,"Electric bikes, on the other hand, are a favorite mode of transportation for the San Francisco tech worker. Owners of the electric bike shop New Wheel say they are preparing for the I.P.O.s by ordering 30 percent more of the Stromer ST3 — the most popular configuration retails for around $7,500 — and 200 percent more of the Riese & Muller front-loader bikes, which sell for around $9,500. "
1169,"Michael Biggica, the founder of Pixel Financial Planning, said 2019 is the year of “pent-up demand” and that the excitement of a windfall can be intoxicating."
1170,"“My role is eliminating that emotion,” Mr. Biggica said."
1171,"Jonathan K. DeYoe, another private wealth adviser in the region, started working with tech clients in 1997 during the first dot-com boom. He said it was pretty exciting back then. Now, as he thinks about thousands of new millionaires coming onto the scene, he is worried about the region’s inequality."
1172,"“There’s some who’ve talked about pitchforks,” Mr. DeYoe said. “And I don’t think we’ll go there, but there’s a point when that makes sense.”"
1173,"“It’s very visible,” Mr. DeYoe said. “This kind of wealth is very visible.”"
1174,"In cities like Oakland and Berkeley and San Francisco, millennials obsess over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter and attend Democratic Socialists of America meetings. But the socialist passion doesn’t seem to have impacted the city’s zeal for I.P.O. parties, which the party planning community says are going to surpass past booms."
1175,"Jay Siegan, a former live music club owner who now curates private entertainment and music, is gearing up. He has worked on events for many of the I.P.O. hopefuls, including Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Postmates and Lyft."
1176,"“We see multiple parties per I.P.O. for the company that is I.P.O.ing, as well as firms that are associated to them,” Mr. Siegan said. Budgets for start-up parties, he said, can easily go above $10 million. “They’re wanting to bring in A-list celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives. They want ballet performers.”"
1177,"A popular new feature he’s noticing is clients hoping to curate their own theme concerts featuring fleets of bands. Mr. Siegan says he put on one for a 1980s loving tech executive, featuring the B-52s, Devo, The Bangles, Tears for Fears and Flock of Seagulls."
1178,"In a warehouse in Concord, Calif., the I.P.O. ice sculptor is getting ready to staff up for what he says will be a long year."
1179,"“It’s going to be a lot of 14-hour days,” said Robert Chislett, founder of Chisel-it, who has around 15 ice sculptors currently employed."
1180,"Together, they have chiseled a full-size ice car for a tech executive’s party in Atherton and a 10-foot ice Taj Mahal for another’s swimming pool in San Jose. "
1181,"But, he says, I.P.O.ing executives usually want predictable things. An ice chair with the logo on the back, for photos. A lot of logos carved into ice rockets, to indicate that the company’s stock will be like a rocket. And ice cubes, for drinks, with the company logo on each one."
1182,"And of course, the tech backlash, mostly quiet as stocks have vested, is preparing for its own revival."
1183,"At Radio Habana Social Club in the Mission district, housing rights activists gathered one recent evening for a drink. By now, there is a well-known choreography: the cash comes flooding in to a few and the stock-less masses begin to gather. They will protest evictions, fight developers, organize against tax breaks and unfurl banners in front of tech buses."
1184,"“It’s going to mean mass displacement,” said Sarah “Fred” Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco, of the coming wealth influx."
1185,She paused for a moment. 
1186,"“It feels like the same game,” she said. "
1187,Activists stood elbow-to-elbow around a table of hummus and pepper jack cheese. 
1188,"“We’ve lived through boom times before,” said Maria Zamudio, the group’s associate director. “We’ve learned our lessons. We know what a massive influx of money looks like. Concessions we made in the past, we will not make this year.”"
1189,"SAN FRANCISCO — Lyft pulled back the curtain on its business for the first time on Friday as it prepared to go public, officially starting the countdown on a horde of technology offerings that are set to bring new wealth to Silicon Valley this year."
1190,"By publicly unveiling the prospectus for its initial public offering, Lyft signaled its intention to meet investors in what is known as a roadshow in about two weeks, after which it will most likely start trading on the stock market in April. The ride-sharing company leads a stampede of other highly valued private tech companies that plan to go public this year, including its archrival, Uber, as well as Slack, Pinterest and Postmates."
1191,"But Lyft’s filing also raised questions about the financial health of the tech companies that are planning I.P.O.s. Its filing revealed that while it was growing quickly, its losses were widening. Last year, the company’s revenue totaled $2.2 billion, while it lost $911.3 million."
1192,"“We have a history of net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,” Lyft said in the filing, adding that it expects to spend more as it expands into new offerings and locations."
1193,"The prospectus is the first time that Lyft has made extensive details of its finances publicly available. Its public offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies. Lyft did not disclose the market valuation it is seeking from public investors; it was last valued at $15.1 billion by private investors during a financing round in June."
1194,[Lyft and Uber said to offer drivers a chance to participate in I.P.O.s.]
1195,"Lyft filed confidentially to go public in December, the same day Uber did. Both companies are dueling to hold their offerings ahead of the other, in an attempt to be the first publicly traded ride-hailing company. But the onus has mostly been on Lyft to get out first because Uber — estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as $120 billion — would potentially steamroll its much smaller rival."
1196,"Both companies are set to face questions about when and how they will become profitable. The ride-hailing business is inherently expensive because companies typically pay incentives to recruit drivers and offer discounts to riders. In addition, the companies are spending heavily to grow in areas such as autonomous driving and bike sharing."
1197,"In 2018, Lyft’s revenue more than doubled to $2.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2017, according to its filing. But losses mounted, rising to $911.3 million last year from $688.3 million in 2017, though they declined as a percentage of revenue. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017."
1198,"Uber, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $842 million in the final quarter of 2018 on revenue of $3 billion. The firm has been trying to turn its image around after a series of scandals involving its workplace culture and onetime hardball business tactics."
1199,"Lyft also said 18.6 million people took at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016. And based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft, the company said it had a 39 percent share of the ride-sharing market in the United States, up from 22 percent in 2016."
1200,"“Two years ago, I definitely viewed Lyft as a second-tier player,” said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida and an I.P.O. expert. “But Uber’s problems with bad publicity, a lot of self-inflicted stuff, really benefited Lyft.”"
1201,"Matt Kennedy, a senior I.P.O. market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research on public offerings, said that it was possible Uber would bite back and that Lyft’s growth would decline."
1202,"“The number of I.P.O.s that we’ve seen with $2 billion in revenue and growing at 100 percent are few and far between,” he said."
1203,"Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. By 2012, the pair had renamed their company Lyft and shifted the business to providing brief local trips, mimicking taxi rides."
1204,"The company presented itself as a genial alternative to Uber. In its early days, Lyft encouraged drivers to strap fuzzy pink mustaches to their front bumpers and to greet riders — who often sat in the front seat — with fist bumps. Although Lyft has since lost the furry fender ornaments, it has maintained its softer image."
1205,"On Friday in its prospectus, Lyft continued to emphasize that image as giving it an edge. In a founders’ letter, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer wrote that their focus on doing the right thing provided them with a “lasting competitive advantage.”"
1206,"Unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe, Lyft operates in the United States and Canada. It has matched Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving cars and has also expanded into short-term bike and scooter rentals."
1207,"The company also disclosed that it planned to have two classes of stock: Class A shares, which carry one vote each, and Class B shares, which carry 20 votes apiece. Lyft plans to sell only Class A shares in its public offering."
1208,"Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who could become billionaires from the offering, each own millions of shares of Class B stock, giving them significant control over the company. In having separate classes of shares — and letting its founders have more power than other shareholders — Lyft is following a well-worn tech company tradition, one adopted by Facebook, Snap and others."
1209,"“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car,” Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer said in their founders’ letter. “We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”"
1210,"Among Lyft’s biggest investors are Rakuten; General Motors; Fidelity, the investment management giant; Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm; and Alphabet, the parent of Google, according to the filing."
1211,"One group that helped build Lyft — its drivers, who are independent contractors — will not share much in the public offering spoils since they do not own stock in the company. Lyft is now working on a cash program to give some drivers money to buy its stock at the time of the I.P.O. The company intends to give $1,000 each to drivers who have completed 10,000 rides for the service; those who have done 20,000 rides will receive $10,000."

1213,"A seemingly offhand remark in a high school lunchroom set off an investigation that uncovered an arsenal of weapons and a plot to attack a Muslim enclave in upstate New York, law enforcement officials said."
1214,"The comment was made by a 16-year-old student at Greece Odyssey Academy in Greece, N.Y."
1215,"On Friday, he showed classmates a photo of someone and said that person looked like a potential school shooter, authorities said."
1216,"The statement alarmed fellow students, who reported it to school officials. The local police became involved and started interviewing people at the school to determine whether there was a potential threat."
1217,"The threat, it turned out, came from the 16-year-old whose comments had triggered the investigation, authorities said on Tuesday. He and three young adults stockpiled 23 firearms and three homemade bombs as part of a plan to target the secluded Muslim enclave of Islamberg, a rural settlement about 150 miles northwest of New York City, authorities said."
1218,"The men, Vincent Vetromile, 19, Brian Colaneri, 20, and Andrew Crysel, 18, all from suburban Rochester, were arrested and charged with criminal possession of a weapon and conspiracy, according to court documents."
1219,"A fourth person was arrested and charged with the same offenses as an adolescent offender, Greece’s police chief, Patrick Phelan, said at a news conference on Tuesday. His name was not revealed because of his age."
1220,"All four suspects remained in custody as of Wednesday morning. The juvenile suspect is being held on a $1 million bail and is scheduled to return to court next week. The three adults, who are being held on $50,000 cash bails or $100,000 bonds, are scheduled to appear in court next month."
1221,"No federal terrorism charges have been filed. But Monroe County’s district attorney, Sandra Doorley, said Tuesday that the U.S. attorney’s office is involved in the investigation and that federal charges were possible."
1222,"It was unclear how all four of those charged were linked or how they initially connected, though at least three of the four were boy scouts, Mr. Phelan said. Two of them, Mr. Vetromile and Mr. Crysel, were eagle scouts."
1223,"The three adults were also enrolled at Monroe Community College in Rochester at various points in the last two years, a college spokeswoman said. It was not clear whether their enrollment dates overlapped. Mr. Vetromile was last enrolled during the summer term in 2017, Mr. Colaneri in the fall semester of 2017 and Mr. Crysel in the spring of 2018, the spokeswoman said."
1224,"Mr. Phelan said the four suspects had been planning their attack for about a month. They communicated on Discord, a group chat app created for video gamers that later became popular among far-right activists."
1225,"Officials only discovered the planned attack through their investigation at the school, Mr. Phelan said."
1226,"Had students not come forward with their concerns, he said, “people would have died.”"
1227,"As part of the investigation, the police recovered 23 legally owned shotguns and rifles from multiple locations, Mr. Phelan said."
1228,"Law enforcement officials also found three improvised explosive devices, homemade bombs that appeared to be filled with black powder and nails, Mr. Phelan said. It was unclear whether they were capable of being detonated, he said, but they were sent to an F.B.I. laboratory in Quantico, Va., for further examination."
1229,"Court documents described the devices as a large cylinder, a medium-sized cylinder and a Mason jar, all wrapped in duct tape."
1230,"Mr. Phelan said that officials were not yet sure why the four suspects had chosen to target Islamberg, which is more than three hours from Greece by car. But he said that officials were continuing to examine the men’s electronic devices to determine a motive."
1231,"Islamberg, a rural hamlet in Delaware County, covers at least 60 acres of rolling tree-covered hills, lakes and fields. Reaching it requires driving along country roads that wind through thick woods."
1232,"The community was settled in the 1980s by followers of a Pakistani cleric, Mubarik Ali Shah Gilani. The initial settlers were predominantly African-American Muslims who left New York City looking for a better place to practice their religion and raise their children. It serves as the headquarters for an organization called Muslims of America, which operates similar communities throughout the United States, according to a 2017 Associated Press story."
1233,"Over the past several years, Islamberg has been attacked by anti-Muslim groups and some right-wing conspiracy theorists, who have said that the town is actually a terrorist training camp despite its peaceful history."
1234,"For the past three years, a group called “Bikers United Against Jihad” has organized a motorcycle protest against the community — though the bikers have been outnumbered by counterprotesters."
1235,"Islamberg has also previously faced threats of violence. In 2015, a man from Tennessee, Robert Doggart, was arrested and charged with plotting an attack on the community. Prosecutors said that he planned to recruit a militia to shoot Islamberg residents and blow up the mosque there. He was convicted and sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison in 2017."
1236,"In a statement, Muslims of America said the plot caused fear and “sent shock waves” through its community."
1237,"“It is beyond tragic that our nation continues to fester with Islamophobia, hate and religious intolerance,” the group said."

1239,"When President Trump said on Twitter that an Uzbek man charged with using a pickup truck to kill eight people “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” the man’s lawyers asked a judge to bar prosecutors from seeking execution, saying the decision had become too politicized."
1240,But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Thursday that prosecutors could seek capital punishment despite the president’s comments.
1241,"Defense lawyers had argued the president’s tweet and other statements he made on Twitter had put political pressure on the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, to seek a death sentence. The lawyers pointed to public reports that Mr. Trump was considering firing the attorney general for not following his wishes, and said Mr. Sessions would not be able to make an impartial decision."
1242,"NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!"
1243,"In his ruling, Judge Vernon S. Broderick wrote that Mr. Trump’s statements advocating for the death penalty “were perhaps ill-advised given the pendency of this case.” Still, the judge said the argument that Mr. Sessions was improperly motivated to seek execution was “pure speculation made without a scintilla of direct factual support.”"
1244,The judge said that without more evidence he could not interfere with “the attorney general’s presumptive authority to make charging decisions.”
1245,"In September, Mr. Sessions went ahead and directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for the defendant, Sayfullo Saipov, 31, if he is convicted at trial, even though Judge Broderick had not yet ruled on the motion concerning the president’s tweets. Six weeks later, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Sessions."
1246,"Mr. Saipov is accused of driving the truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River on Oct. 31, 2017, and, after smashing into a school bus, jumping out and running down the highway, shouting “God is great” in Arabic. He was taken into custody after being shot by a police officer."
1247,"He has pleaded not guilty to eight capital counts of murder and other charges, and is scheduled for trial in October."
1248,Judge Broderick wrote that Mr. Saipov had “offered no evidence that the president’s remarks impacted the attorney general’s decision-making process in any way.”
1249,"To the contrary, the judge said, Mr. Sessions had “categorically renounced other provocative remarks made by the president” and had vowed that the Justice Department would “not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”"
1250,Federal prosecutors and Mr. Saipov’s federal public defenders declined to comment on the ruling.

1252,Scott Siegel plans to walk across a stage not far from Broadway on Monday night and introduce songs from musicals that lit up the nearby marquees — in 1928 and 1935.
1253,"He will probably get some applause just for walking across the stage, one uneasy, uneven step after another, steadied by a cane, after a disastrous 2018, a year not celebrated in Monday’s show."
1254,"Mr. Siegel is the impresario behind “Broadway by the Year,” a series at Town Hall that anthologizes Broadway shows by the year in which they had their premieres. It draws a nostalgic crowd, largely people like Mr. Siegel, a baby boomer uncomfortable about having his actual age published. But it also has some appeal among younger song-and-dance fans who want to hear Broadway tunes from before “Cats” or “A Chorus Line” that are rarely performed anymore."
1255,"When he gets around to staging his show about 2018, his personal drama may eclipse “Mean Girls,” “King Kong” or “The Prom.”"
1256,"Last October, he was riding a CitiBike to a rehearsal of a show to be staged later in St. Louis, a spinoff of another project. The rehearsal was in the West 50s in Manhattan. “Somebody’s apartment who has a piano,” he explained."
1257,That meant pedaling across town from his apartment in the East 50s.
1258,"“I was late and it had rained,” he said. “I was hurrying to get there.”"
1259,"He knew the terrain: the descent on West 55th Street and the uphill section on 10th Avenue, where he planned to turn."
1260,"“Anybody who’s ever ridden a bicycle knows that if you have to go up a steep hill, you want to get as much momentum behind you before you turn,” he said, “so I was going as fast as I could.”"
1261,"Probably not as fast as the pack in the Tour de France, but fast enough that when he saw a pedestrian step off the curb, he had no more than a nanosecond to rethink the turn. He figured the options were to go wide, which would put him in front of the pedestrian, or short and sharp, which would leave him behind the man."
1262,He chose short and sharp. It was the wrong call.
1263,"“The bike hydroplaned out from under me,” he said, “and I slammed into 10th Avenue.”"
1264,"To hear Mr. Siegel tell it, the unfolding drama was peopled by helpful extras, starting with a couple of bystanders. One asked, “Can you get up?”"
1265,"He played the role of the indefatigable, ever-practical New Yorker. To one of them he said, “I’ll shake this off, give me a minute.”"
1266,"To the other, he said: “Can you take the CitiBike that’s lying in the middle of the street and put it in the rack?” There was a dock less than a block away; he worried that CitiBike would assess a charge if the bicycle was not properly returned. (CitiBike waives late fees for riders involved in accidents, a spokeswoman said.)"
1267,He still figured that he would be up and rehearsing again before long.
1268,"After 19 days in three hospitals, a three-hour operation and four pins in his broken pelvis, he went home."
1269,"So he missed the rehearsal, but the St. Louis show went on. “It was one of the rare times I was ahead of the game. It was cast, the songs were assigned, the script was pretty much written,” he said."
1270,"He did miss a performance of another of his productions at Feinstein’s/54 Below two days after the accident. From his hospital bed, he wrote checks to pay the cast."
1271,"Some of the performers tore them up. One of Mr. Siegel’s regulars, the pianist Ryan Shirar, started a GoFundMe campaign that has raised about $24,000 for Mr. Siegel’s bills, which included rent on a temporary apartment. His own place, in a building between First and Second Avenue, was off limits. “There are five steps down from the street to the lobby,” he said, “and I couldn’t take steps.”"
1272,"He planned Monday’s show at Town Hall between physical therapy sessions. The “Broadway by the Year” series, which started in 2000, was a career change for Mr. Siegel, who with his wife had written more than 40 books, including “Jack Nicholson: The Unauthorized Biography,” “Richard Chamberlain: An Actor’s Life,” “The Encyclopedia of Hollywood” and “American Film Comedy.” They had also written as critics for a number of publications and websites; currently, they write “The Siegel Column” for theaterpizzazz.com."
1273,"“Town Hall, even though it’s in the theater district, did not have any theater-centric programming,” he recalled. “They wanted a theater audience. I had the idea for ‘Broadway by the Year.’ I didn’t have the title but I had the idea. They said, ‘Would you produce it for us?’ I said, ‘Happy to do it, but I haven’t produced anything in my life, not even a puppet show in the backyard” when he was growing up in Fair Lawn, N.J."
1274,"He started with 1943, “for the heavy anchor of ‘Oklahoma!’” — the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit — and got a taste of the performer’s life."
1275,"“Five minutes before the first curtain, I peeked out from stage left and saw the audience was full,” he recalled, “and I started to quake, literally shaking. I said, ‘I can’t go out there. I have to find a way to calm down.’” He did so by telling himself the audience was not there to see him but the performers he had hired. He said he has not had a case of nerves since."

1366,The traffic choking New York City streets has brought new congestion fees on taxis and Ubers and rallied support around a broader congestion pricing plan to charge all cars and trucks entering the busiest neighborhoods.
1367,Now city officials are ratcheting up the fight against another traffic headache: parking scofflaws.
1368,"On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce new measures aimed at municipal employees who abuse city-issued parking placards that are intended to help them carry out their official duties, but too often are abused and contribute to clogged streets."
1369,"Many employees brazenly display the placards while parked illegally — including in crosswalks, on sidewalks and blocking bus and bike lanes — or while using personal vehicles when not working."
1370,"Under the de Blasio administration, the number of city-issued placards has soared and critics have accused the mayor of doing little to tackle the problem."
1371,"Now, city officials are promising a more aggressive campaign. A new enforcement team of traffic agents will issue tickets and target placard abuse in neighborhoods that have become hot spots, such as Downtown Brooklyn and Chinatown. Any placard found to be misused three times will be revoked under a new “three strikes” policy; previously, it had been left to the discretion of the agencies that issued the placards."
1372,"In addition, the city will make the misuse or fraudulent use of a placard a separate violation on top of any parking violation. Currently, placard abuse is treated as a parking violation and carries a $50 fine. City officials said they would push for changes to state law to establish a $250 fine for placard abuse."
1373,The city also plans to test out stickers as a replacement for paper placards to make it harder to transfer placards to unauthorized vehicles. It will also develop a digital parking system by 2021 in which physical placards will be unnecessary because license plates will already be linked to a database and parking violations will be automatically issued through a so-called pay-by-plate system.
1374,"Still, none of the mayor’s measures will significantly reduce the total number of city-issued placards, which have nearly doubled to 125,500 in 2018 from 67,297 in 2008, according to city records. The largest chunk, 50,000, is issued by the Transportation Department for its own employees as well as those at other government agencies, and others. The Police Department issues another 44,000 to law enforcement officers, and the Education Department, 31,500 to teachers and school employees to park near their schools."
1375,"Transportation advocates say the police fail to vigorously target scofflaws, in part, because some officers themselves abuse their placards."
1376,"Advocates also accuse city officials of doling out parking placards as political favors to the powerful teachers’ unions and others, including 50,000 new placards for teachers and school employees in 2017. They said the city has helped create the problem because more placards lead to more opportunities for abuse and the oversupply of placards has encouraged more people to drive to work, putting more cars on the road."
1377,"“The elephant in the room is whether they can reduce placard abuse to everyone’s satisfaction without a meaningful reduction in the sheer number of placards,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders."
1378,"The placards, Mr. Pearlstein said, have essentially created a large class of privileged city workers, many of whom would otherwise be taking buses and subways. “It’s a question of fairness,” he said. “Plenty of people have to get to work on time and do work that is important to the life of the city.”"
1379,"City officials said that 50,000 temporary placards for school employees were issued to resolve a labor dispute with the teachers’ union. But the number of placards dropped to 31,500 later that year when the Education Department moved to an online application system that set out clear eligibility standards. The department has also tightened oversight of placards, including tracking names and vehicle information for every placard in a database and printing permits on paper that cannot be illegally copied."
1380,"The previous mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, challenged the city’s tradition of bestowing parking placards on city employees and in 2008 his administration cut the number in half to 67,297 from 144,048 the year before. Mr. de Blasio’s aides said the number of placards had crept back up to 103,000 by the time he took office in 2014."
1381,"Bruce Schaller, a consultant who helped lead the Bloomberg efforts, said any comprehensive effort to curb placard abuse would sputter unless placard numbers were reduced."
1382,"Still, Mr. Schaller said he believed the new measures were at least a start. “If there’s real follow-through to what they’re announcing, then people should be able to see improvement,” he said. “Will it completely solve the problem? I can guarantee you no, but New Yorkers are more realistic than that.”"
1383,"The new measures follow renewed efforts by the City Council to cut down on placard abuse. Council members led by Speaker Corey Johnson have recently proposed bills that council aides said were similar to the mayor’s measures or would go even further, such as requiring at least 50 targeted enforcement sweeps every week by the Police Department that would be monitored by the Department of Investigation. The bills would also require enforcement officers to call for towing any vehicle blocking bike and bus lanes, crosswalks or fire hydrants."
1384,"“The council is thrilled the mayor has seen the light on placard abuse,” Mr. Johnson said. “And we are very much looking forward to working with him to remove this scourge from our streets once and for all.”"
1385,"This is not the first time Mr. de Blasio has vowed to take on the chronic problem. In 2017, the mayor announced a citywide enforcement plan, including creating a new anti-placard-fraud police unit. As a result, city officials said, the number of summonses for illegal parking has risen to 54,608 last year from 28,269 in 2016. But placard abuses have continued, with egregious examples often documented on social media."
1386,"“Placard abuse erodes faith in government and has no place in our city — it’s simply a question of fairness,” the mayor said in a statement. “Misused and fraudulent placards increase congestion and pose a public safety risk. These initiatives give us the tools we need to start making a real dent in this pervasive issue, to help build a fairer city for all.”"
1387,"Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which manages three business improvement districts, said she welcomed the new measures. The neighborhood, which is home to city agency offices and courthouses, has been inundated with placard-carrying drivers who double park on streets and block traffic, leave cars on sidewalks and take up metered spots meant for visitors and shoppers, she said."
1388,"“I think it will go a long way in starting to check this problem,” she said. “Sadly, Downtown Brooklyn is really the Wild West of placard abuse.”"
1389,"Swarms of any other insect might provoke fears of a coming apocalypse, but clouds of butterflies migrating through Southern California are captivating onlookers who are relishing the otherworldly spectacle."
1390,"The orange butterflies, called painted ladies, are known to travel annually from the deserts of Southern California to the Pacific Northwest. This month, people are taking notice because of the sheer size of the migration: Scientists estimate the teeming painted ladies number in the millions."
1391,"Substantial rainfall in the deserts near the Mexican border, where the North American painted ladies lay their eggs, is the reason for the unusually large swarms. The rain caused plants to thrive, giving the painted lady caterpillars plenty of food to fuel their transformation, said Arthur M. Shapiro, a professor of evolution and ecology at the University of California, Davis."
1392,Butterfly in the skkkyyy... #paintedladies @WindwardSchool pic.twitter.com/4YYV107br0
1393,"To human observers, the painted ladies move with speed and intention, as if they have somewhere to be. They can fly as fast as 25 miles per hour."
1394,"“The striking thing is they’re moving very rapidly and directionally,” said Professor Shapiro, who has studied butterfly migrations in California for more than 40 years. “So it’s almost like being in a hail of bullets.”"
1395,"They tend not to veer from oncoming cars, which can prove troublesome in Los Angeles traffic. When the painted ladies smash into a windshield, the result is a glob of yellow, butter-like ooze. That’s the result of the butterfly’s stored fat, used to make the long journey north, Professor Shapiro said."
1396,"Monika Moore, a butterfly enthusiast who lives in Fullerton, Calif., said she noticed that the mass moves in a strange way. The butterflies will fly low to the ground in an open field or yard, but when they encounter a tall building, they will fly over it — creating a “funky” up-and-down dipping pattern, said Ms. Moore, who has a Facebook page called California Butterfly Lady."
1397,"“They’re in a hurry, like the rabbit in ‘Alice in Wonderland,’” she said. “They have a very important date.”"
1398,"This year, the painted lady migration in California appears to have veered off its customary course. Professor Shapiro said that if the painted ladies were following their annual pattern, they should have arrived in Northern California about a week ago, yet they appear to be staying in Southern California."
1399,"One possible explanation, Professor Shapiro said, is that there has been such abundant rain and plant growth in Southern California that the butterflies have settled down and reproduced there."
1400,Professor Shapiro reported on Sunday evening that he had seen nine painted ladies near where he lives in the Northern California.
1401,"“Presumably these are the vanguard,” he wrote in an email. “We’re off and running.”"
1402,"The explosion of plant growth in Southern California that has fueled this migration of butterflies is in itself a spectacle. The growth of colorful wildflowers, called a super bloom, has attracted a steady stream of tourists. In 2017, wildflower blooms in Southern California were so dense that they were visible from space."
1403,"[One of our reporters visited Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, a site of the super bloom.]"
1404,"Although this year’s butterfly migration is significant, it pales in comparison with the swarms of 2005. That year, scientists estimated more than a billion butterflies traveled across California. Cars on California highways looked as if they had been splattered with raw eggs."
1405,"As the painted ladies linger in the southern part of the state, Californians are getting a prolonged look at the clouds of flapping orange wings."
1406,"On an overcast day last week, Jessica McGhee biked to the waterfront in Redondo Beach to collect plastics to use to make art. Ms. McGhee said she saw a couple of butterflies flit by, then a few more. Soon they flew by in the dozens, and then in the hundreds."
1407,"“I just sat and watched them for like two hours,” she said. “I felt like I was in a Disney movie.”"
1408,"HERAT, Afghanistan — A 2017 wall calendar dangled from a nail over Kawsar Roshan’s bed on the otherwise blank wall of her room. “Best year for me” she had written, in curly script, above aerial photos of lakes and waterfalls. She drew a smiley-face next to her wobbly English letters."
1409,"The out-of-date calendar was “nothing too special,” said Kawsar, though she does love waterfalls, especially Niagara Falls — which she saw with her own eyes during that best year. "
1410,"Kawsar, then 16, saw a lot of places as a member of Afghanistan’s first-ever girls’ robotics team. More than any other Afghan girl she knows. Or boy. Or even grown-up, for that matter."
1411,"You may remember hearing about that team. In the summer of 2017, Kawsar and five teammates, along with their coach, were denied visas into the United States for a robotics competition in Washington, prompting an international outcry. "
1412,"Eventually, 53 members of Congress signed a petition and President Trump intervened to get the girls travel documents on special humanitarian grounds. They received a silver medal in “courageous achievement” and Congressional certificates of merit. Back in Afghanistan, they were received as icons of progress, though some sniped that they had dressed immodestly while abroad and compromised their marriageability. "
1413,"In the time since, the photogenic troupe of teenage girls in head scarves and protective goggles has shuttled between their homes in Herat and competitions in North America, suitcases bulging with robotics contraptions, trophies and rice cookers. "
1414,"They met Ivanka Trump three times. Justin Trudeau offered to be their backup robot driver. The rapper Will.i.am, one of their sponsors, took so many selfies with the girls that Lida Azizi, the team’s robot driver, called him, “a true friend.”"
1415,"Over and over again, they were showered with a compliment to which they never quite knew how to respond: “It’s so inspiring to see an all-Muslim team.” "
1416,"They amassed tens of thousands of Facebook followers and, as their English improved, learned the art of the sound bite, delivering messages about “resilience” and “self-confidence.” "
1417,"It was an unimaginable odyssey between two worlds, as their friends and families faced continued violence in Afghanistan. While at a major competition in Mexico City last summer, the girls awoke to news that a suicide bomber in Kabul had killed 47 boys about their age in a college-exam prep class. They traded pajamas for black head scarves and posted a selfie on Facebook with a sign that read, “We continue for you.”"
1418,"Now, with peace negotiations underway involving the Taliban, many inside and around Afghanistan are fearful that recent gains in women’s rights and girls’ education could be washed away. Earlier this month, Roya Mahboob, an Afghan expat tech entrepreneur and the team’s founder, sent a letter to Ms. Trump, who had been so enthusiastic about the team, pleading that the youth of Afghanistan not be forgotten in the talks; last week, Ms. Mahboob met with the United States’ special envoy for Afghan reconciliation. "
1419,"The girls’ one-year visas expired in the fall, so they are focused now mostly on school: Kawsar and Fatemah Qaderyan, the team’s pint-size captain and a “Harry Potter” fan, study English in an after school program, and Lida, dreaming of college in Canada, where the team trained last winter, is being tutored by an uncle."
1420,"They are eager for peace, of course, though concerned that a newly empowered Taliban could further stifle girls’ ambitions. Such a future, Kawsar said recently via What’sApp, “would be unbelievable for me.” She added a sad-face emoji."
1421,"It is not often that teenagers get to travel the world. It was unheard-of for 16-year-old girls from Afghanistan — girls not used to leaving the house without a male chaperone, girls whose peers were getting married — to travel the world competing in robotics. "
1422,"Before it all started, the only robots they had known were the drones used by the American military. And the only Americans they had seen outside of television were soldiers in armored cars."
1423,We followed Kawsar and her teammates through much of that “best year.” These are snapshots from their journey.
1424,"[For more on women and girls, sign up for In Her Words, a weekly newsletter.]"
1425,"Their odyssey started with an invitation from an American inventor named Dean Kamen, who had founded a robotics league in the United States decades before and in 2017 planned an Olympics-style competition. He enlisted Ms. Mahboob to put together an Afghan team."
1426,More than 150 girls turned up to try out. A dozen made the first cut. 
1427,"As they awaited the robot parts sent by Mr. Kamen, they set up a workshop in the basement of Ms. Mahboob’s parents’ home in Herat, watching YouTube how-to videos and tinkering with scrap metal that their coach, Ms. Mahboob’s brother, Alireza Mehraban, picked up in the market. "
1428,"They hammered nails with rocks, twisted chains by slamming doors on them, and searched for kitchen knives sharp enough to make slits in aluminum. They worked barefoot, as is customary inside Afghan homes, and without any safety equipment. "
1429,"“When you have Taliban outside, goggles aren’t your biggest security problem,” one of the girls joked."
1430,"They came from different schools, neighborhoods and ethnic groups, but most were born in 2001, the year United States troops began what the military called “Operation Enduring Freedom.”"
1431,"When the team returned to Herat after that first competition, Fatemah’s father, Mohammad Asif Qaderyan, planted a congratulatory kiss on her cheek in front of the TV cameras at the airport — a public display of affection not looked kindly upon by all. "
1432,"He had been the team’s biggest booster, helping persuade other fathers to let their daughters travel. A building contractor with a ninth-grade education, Mr. Qaderyan was an avid supporter of girls’ schools, of robotics and, above all, of Fatemah."
1433,"They had a special closeness, staying up late to watch science documentaries on DVDs. “We would talk about complicated stuff, and I could ask him any question,” she said. “Sometimes he would be surprised by my questions, but he always tried to answer.”"
1434,"Exactly one week after the team came home from Washington, Fatemah waved to her father as he shut the gate of their home and headed to the mosque. When the blast hit a bit later, her mother ran into the street, panicked. Fatemah kept dialing his cellphone. "
1435,"The Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, whose official death toll was 36, though neighbors counted more."
1436,"“All our neighbors thought I was the cause of his death,” she said. “They said if I had not been on the robotics team, it would not have happened.”"
1437,"In early 2018, the girls were invited to train with a robotics team in Canada, and ended up qualifying for a 700-team competition in Detroit. They arrived late one evening at a suburban hotel, where the bar was filled with men and women drinking, laughing and eating chicken wings."
1438,"Somaya Faruqi, the team’s mechanical whiz, cocked her head toward the bar, her eyes widening."
1439,"“In Afghanistan we laugh differently,” she said."
1440,"Yes, like, not loudly, the others explained. And no teeth showing."
1441,"“At home,” Kawsar said, “they stone women to death for adultery — or even if they just suspect it.” Then she added: “But the truth is, I like to smile.”"
1442,"Sometimes, when no one was around, the girls would crack each other up with a routine."
1443,"“You are so awesome,” one teammate, Sahar Barak, would say in her best American accent, mimicking the people who kept telling them as much."
1444,"Kawsar, batting long dark lashes, would join in: “You guys are really inspiring!”"
1445,"Lida might make a little heart shape with her fingers: “Yes, yes, you have touched our hearts!”"
1446,"Without fail, this would reduce the girls to a heap of giggles, hands flying to cover mouths and hold onto slipping head scarves, eyes darting to make sure Coach Ali wasn’t watching."
1447,"“When we go home, we will change our behavior,” Fatemah said. “We will know how to hide our smiles when we need to.”"
1448,"A trip to Canada that was supposed to last a few weeks turned into months on the road, and the girls began to worry about missing too much school. They liked the freedom to ride bikes in New York — “At home, if you are a boy you can go bike riding, but not us,” Kawsar said —  and loved using the swings in Central Park. They also appreciated the flip-flop selection at Kmart. But their suitcases were getting heavy and they missed their mothers. "
1449,"They slept on beanbags at Ms. Mahboob’s apartment in Queens, N.Y., for a few weeks between competitions, taking turns cleaning, cooking, and painting each others’ nails with glitter polish."
1450,"“I’m so happy for Ed Sheeran that he is getting married,” Lida said one day. She was a big fan of Ed Sheeran, as well as of Lionel Messi. And she loved everything having to do with World Wrestling Entertainment, including Mr. Trump."
1451,"“He might be a W.W.E. fan, but he doesn’t like Muslims like you,” Sahar told Lida."
1452,“Is it true Trump supports ISIS?” Kawsar asked.
1453,"They discussed their collective crush on Prime Minister Trudeau, whom they called “Justin.” They wondered who — “besides us” — might be the most famous Afghans outside of Afghanistan, and dissected another famous young Muslim woman who promoted girls’ education: Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is Pakistani."
1454, “She repeats the same lines to everyone!” Fatemah argued.
1455, Then they wondered aloud: “Do we do that?”
1456,"They had recently learned the word “weird,” and were pleased with its ability to encompass feelings about the unfamiliar. "
1457,"People kissing in the streets in America, for example, was weird. Billboards with women half-undressed? Weird. Or strangers talking to you in the street: “You don’t know them, and suddenly they are saying something,” Fatemah said. "
1458,"Once, riding the subway from Queens to Manhattan, a stranger called Lida a “cookie” and asked to touch her head scarf. Another time, somebody leaned over and said: “People get blown up right on the street in your country. What do you think about that?”"
1459,"But the worst was on an overnight Greyhound bus from Detroit to New York. They had showed up in high spirits, with matching blue eye shadow and mascara they had been trying on in a Sephora that afternoon."
1460,"Then, on the bus, one man was watching porn on his phone. When they asked another to change seats, he cursed and pushed them. “You are rude!” Sahar retorted in her best English before bursting into tears."
1461,"They missed the way time moved slowly in Herat, where aunts and uncles were constantly visiting, and dinners were long, and always homemade."
1462,"“There is no greater pleasure in life,” Somaya said, “than a family picnic at the park, at home.”"
1463,"“No one would ever push you there,” Kawsar added."
1464,"After one competition in Albuquerque, N.M., the girls stopped for ice cream at an outdoor mall, where, after long discussions on the merits of each flavor, they all ordered pistachio."
1465,"They discussed the robotics team from Burundi, whose members had disappeared after the competition in Washington and then resurfaced a few weeks later, requesting asylum."
1466,"“It’s annoying that Americans think everyone wants to sneak into their country,” said Fatemah. “I don’t.”"
1467,"“When I grow up, I’m going to start a robotics company with Somaya,” she said. It would be a fleet of robots to monitor security issues. Or maybe agricultural robots to help farmers collect saffron."
1468,"That is, if she doesn’t become president of Afghanistan, which is her real dream. Somaya could be her chief of staff, Fatemah said. The others could help with her campaign."
1469,Sahar rolled her eyes.
1470,"“Yes, it would be nice to live, for a while, in a country where girls are allowed to ride bikes and swim and where there are Baskin-Robbins everywhere,” said Kawsar."
1471,"And it would be “awesome” to study overseas, they agreed."
1472,But stay?
1473,"“Not us,” they said."
1474,"The girls had been traveling for 30 hours, changed planes five times and gone through 13-and-a-half time zones. It was the first day of Ramadan when they touched down in Herat last May, and they would soon be fasting. As they prepared to exit the plane, they put on their medals and dialed down their smiles."
1475,"Awaiting them on the tarmac were TV cameras, a government minister with bouquets of plastic roses, and families relieved to have their daughters safely home."
1476,"The only mother missing was Fatemah’s. Someone made an excuse, saying she was sick. “Not exactly sick,” she said later. “I am sick in my heart.” It had been less than 10 months since the mosque attack that killed her husband."
1477,"With their U.S. visas having run out, the team’s activities have quieted. Fatemah, Somaya and Lida went to a robotics competition in Estonia in November and, with three new girls, to one in Istanbul in February."
1478,"Fatemah and Ms. Mahboob met with Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, about a plan to start a robotics club in Kabul, as well as a technology-focused school, which the Yale Engineering Department has offered to design. He offered support, but there is as yet no budget."
1479,"At a school assembly, Lida and Kawsar spoke to hundreds of girls in matching black tunics and white head scarves about how the team had won the all-rookie award at a championship in Canada and how they each came home with six medals and how, above all, they were proud to serve their country."
1480,"One girl asked if they had seen the Statue of Liberty. Yes, they had. And they had met Justin Trudeau! It was unclear how many in the audience knew who that was. "
1481,"Afterward, one girl said: “I could do robotics, too.”"
1482,"“If I just knew what it was,” she added. “And if my dad allowed.”"
1483,"Danna Harman is a London-based journalist who has reported from across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America."
1484,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Venezuelan authorities on Tuesday began investigating the leader of the opposition and detained a prominent journalist, claiming they had played a role in the supposed sabotage of the country’s electrical system. Government critics said it was an effort to deflect blame for a four-day national power failure."
1485,"Attorney General Tarek Saab accused Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who leads a parallel government backed by the United States and about 50 other countries, of masterminding the blackout. He provided no evidence."
1486,"Hours earlier, intelligence police detained a prominent radio producer and social media activist, Luis Carlos Díaz, as he rode his bike home from work, according to his wife, Naky Soto. He was charged with inciting violence and freed on parole a day later."
1487,"Mr. Guaidó, who has not been detained or charged, brushed off the accusations as baseless, and spent Tuesday addressing small flash protests around the capital, Caracas."
1488,"“I ask you to trust this process, confidence in your own capacity to withstand the hardships,” he told supporters in the middle-class Chacao neighborhood, referring to the government transition he is attempting."
1489,"A human rights group, Foro Penal, said about 80 people had been detained by the government since Thursday in connection with the blackout. The vast majority have not been charged."
1490,The detention of Mr. Díaz has jolted Venezuelan civil society. Some called it President Nicolás Maduro’s most brazen attempt yet to scapegoat critics for the blackout — and for the country’s accelerating economic collapse.
1491,"On Thursday, a failure at the Guri hydropower plant plunged most of the country into darkness for days. The blackout collapsed Venezuela’s foundering health care system and decimated scarce food stocks in an economy that has shrunk by half since 2013."
1492,"The government said it was able to restart the Guri plant early Monday after several failed attempts, and lights returned to most major cities by Tuesday."
1493,"Mr. Maduro and his ministers have claimed that industrial sabotage was behind the power failure. They have talked of cyberattacks and electromagnetic attacks on the grid, without providing evidence."
1494,"Energy analysts and power sector unionists say the failure was a disaster in waiting caused by years of mismanagement, corruption and brain drain."
1495,"Mr. Díaz’s wife, who is fighting breast cancer and chronic neurological disease, held back tears as she pleaded for his release outside the attorney general’s office. She was surrounded by hundreds of supporters and prominent Venezuelan clergymen, journalists and opposition politicians."
1496,"Ms. Soto accused Mr. Maduro of abusing her husband to deter Venezuelans from sharing information on social media, which has become the main source of news for most in the country. “The fact that this has happened to such a public person, who has created so many networks, is a message in itself that this could happen to any citizen,” she said."
1497,Her plea brought tears to many who came to hear her speak.
1498,"A number of foreign journalists have been taken into custody and deported from Venezuela, but Mr. Díaz is the highest-profile Venezuelan journalist to be held in a prison cell."
1499,"Early Tuesday, Ms. Soto and several witnesses said, 16 heavily armed secret police officers brought her handcuffed husband home with a search warrant, taking all his electronic equipment and all the family’s cash savings."
1500,"Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations human rights chief and former Chilean president, said she was deeply concerned about Mr. Díaz’s detention, and delivered a rare direct rebuke to Mr. Maduro’s government. Her team is currently on a fact-finding mission in Venezuela."
1501,No public official has been fired or publicly criticized by the central government for the management of the electrical system since the start of the blackout.
1502,"MILAN — When Phoebe Philo left Celine just before Christmas in 2017, an entire swath of female shoppers went into mourning. The designer who had given them a wardrobe that spoke to their minds and ambitions — that provided intelligent comfort without glitz, that swaddled in a most subtle way — was stepping down. When she was replaced by Hedi Slimane, fetishizer of the skinny suit and truncated hemline and dash of rock star desiccation, they despaired. Where would they shop?"
1503,"Then Bottega Veneta, the Italian brand that had been defined for 17 years by Tomas Maier, the insistence that your own initials are enough and its woven intrecciato leather bags, announced that Mr. Maier would be leaving the company and would be replaced by Daniel Lee, a young British designer most people had never heard of. What they knew, however, was this: Mr. Lee’s previous job has been as the head of ready-to-wear at Celine under Ms. Philo."
1504,Wait! Maybe more was going on than boring designer musical chairs.
1505,"Was Bottega going to reimagine itself as the brand for loyalists of what has become colloquially known as Old Celine? Were they going to have a new place to shop? Was Mr. Lee’s aesthetic also — maybe? — a Philo-phile aesthetic? If so, was that, in fact, a good thing or had its time come and gone (has it been idealized in retrospect)?"
1506,"On Friday morning in Milan, as Mr. Lee unveiled his first runway collection for the brand, everyone got to find out."
1507,And the answer is … a qualified yes.
1508,"Though clearly in the vernacular of Old Celine as well as the house he has just joined, Mr. Lee’s Bottega was tougher, cooler, less interested in tête-à-têtes in an arty corner, and less well-behaved than either past brand. That’s a good thing."
1509,"It was also, on occasion, overly tricky (especially when it came to quilted skirts that folded into an A-line shape at the sides and linked across the groin with a fancy chain) and sometimes too literal (full-body leather biker jackets and pants). But those are relatively little quibbles. Given the weight of expectations and Mr. Lee’s youth (he’s in his early 30s), it was an impressively confident and coherent debut."
1510,"A new geometric V was introduced as closures on coats and the flap shape of a pocket, and the aforementioned chain repeated as gold trim on deep round-necked sweaters, and in the form of leather links woven together into a new sort of intrecciato coat. "
1511,"The neck was the erogenous zone, both in reference to Renaissance portraiture and because, Mr. Lee said after the show, “it’s a part of the body most people are comfortable exposing.” Jackets had their collars raised and the lapels wrenched open, the shoulder dropped just off the bone, to create a heart-shaped curve. There were mirrored shirt dresses (shirt dresses are a thing this season) layered atop each other, and two-tone knits twisted up and around and over. There was men’s wear in a similar mode."
1512,"“He’s not afraid of the heritage,” François-Henri Pinault, chief executive of Kering, the French group that owns Bottega, said of Mr. Lee before the show, and he was right. But as a designer, Mr. Lee is also mature enough not to reject the past out of hand. Instead, he had some fun moving it forward."
1513,"Even if afterward, with the stress of the reveal finally over, he looked a little played out."

1523,"Punches of snow and life-threatening cold temperatures are crippling much of the region, with school closings and canceled flights. The danger is only expected to grow, with forecasts of highs in the negative teens, and wind chills as low as minus 50 in Chicago and minus 60 in Minneapolis."

1536,"A self-described “lifelong Democrat,” Mr. Schultz said he would begin a three-month crisscross of the country before making a decision. But Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City who is eyeing a Democratic run, argued that Mr. Schultz could split the vote and enable a second term for President Trump."

1541,"Why? During a discussion about President Trump’s border wall, he said Hispanics should work harder to assimilate: “They ought not to be just codified in their communities but make sure that all of their kids are learning to speak English, and that they feel comfortable in the communities, and that’s going to take outreach on both sides, frankly.”"
1542,"Among those objecting was the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which noted that “most U.S. Hispanics are born in the United States; English is their native language.” Mr. Brokaw apologized."
1543,"Separately, according to tabloid reports, Jennifer Aniston should have given birth to some two dozen babies in the last few years. Our media columnist looks at how readers are drawn to stories they simply want to be true, whether they’re about celebrity baby bumps or President Trump."

1556,"Awkwardly, for starters. On Sunday night, the live television broadcast of “Rent” had to use footage from a recorded dress rehearsal after a lead actor broke his foot. Only the final 15 minutes or so were live. Much of the hit musical was disappointing, our critic writes, “but clearly there was love in this production, too.”"
1557,"We also took a second look at “My Fair Lady,” 10 months into its run in New York."
1558,"With four replacement principals in place, the revival is nicely evolving with new stars, our theater critic says. It’s all the more satisfying “when a musical not only lives in the moment but also changes and grows over time,” he says."

1569,"The first two years of Stuart Singer’s retirement were pure play, spent whisking through New York City by bike, visiting museums and art galleries."
1570,"“At some point I realized I need to do more than this,” said Mr. Singer, a former high school guidance counselor."
1571,"Now Mr. Singer, 74, and his wife of 46 years, Madine, 69, are involved with the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. Mr. Singer volunteers with the Community Health Advocates program, which started in 2010. It is a program of Community Service Society, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund."
1572,[Read: How the Community Health Advocates program eliminates dental woes.]
1573,"The program helps consumers navigate the often confusing world of health insurance coverage. And it helps them find access to low-cost or free care. Mr. Singer answers phones for the Community Health Advocates’ helpline, then engages in runarounds of a less-athletic sort."
1574,"“There are lots of times that people are calling, and they’re dying and they need medication, and they can’t get it because their insurance company won’t pay for it,” he said. “And you got to go through doctors, getting the papers filled out, and the appeals. But when you get it done, yeah, it feels good.”"
1575,"The helpline assists about 250 callers each week and has saved consumers $12.1 million since it began. Mr. Singer comes in once a week, assisting roughly 10 callers every shift. In total, he estimates he has saved New Yorkers $443,000."
1576,"Despite the challenges, Mr. Singer said the work is a joy, not drudgery, which inspired his wife to sign up for volunteer training after she retired in late 2013 as vice president of the Insurance Information Institute. It put her apprehension about retirement, which she likened to jumping off a cliff, at ease."
1577,"Ms. Singer trained with the Advocacy, Counseling and Entitlement Services Project before being placed with the Actor’s Fund, a national human services organization for performing arts and entertainment professionals founded in 1882."
1578,"“It just seems so unfair that these people have trouble finding housing,” said Ms. Singer."
1579,"Since she started in early 2015, Ms. Singer has had more than 270 appointments with clients, from ticket takers to screenwriters to dancers."
1580,"“Having someone help them navigate the system really means a lot to them,” Ms. Singer said."
1581,Much of her work is assisting clients who are applying for affordable housing sort through a variety of income sources they receive.
1582,"“It keeps the mind going,” Ms. Singer said. “It keeps the social life going, and I’m doing something.”"
1583,"In the first episode of the final season of “Broad City,” BFFs Abbi (Abbi Jacobson) and Ilana (Ilana Glazer) celebrate Abbi’s 30th birthday by walking the length of Manhattan, Inwood to the Battery. They shoot video of dirty water — “city juice” — on the subway tracks. They visit the stately Morris-Jumel Mansion. They get chicken and waffles at Red Rooster in Harlem. They get their hair braided on the sidewalk."
1584,"Then Ilana falls into a manhole. (Or as she calls it, a “womanhole.”)"
1585,"The episode, an ingenious love letter to friendship and the city in the form of an Instagram Story, perfectly encapsulates the relationship of “Broad City” with the second half of its title. Its New York City is a frenemy that charms you and grosses you out, embraces you and picks your pocket, shows you a good time and tries to break your foot."
1586,"The series, returning Thursday to Comedy Central, heads up a group of recent series — including the just-returned “High Maintenance” and the also-ending “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” — depicting New York life and hustle in the era of gentrification, student-loan debt and gig work."
1587,"If “Friends,” the Patient Zero of New York’s TV upscaling, was set in a fantasy Manhattan of cappuccinos and massive apartments, these series each present a version of the city that the generation raised on “Friends” actually found, landing in tiny flats that are a long commute from Central Perk."
1588,"Abbi and Ilana work a string of jobs in the online and service industries, the sort of work that reminds you the city is filled with people with more disposable income than you have, disposing it everywhere. (The new season has Abbi, an aspiring artist, working at Anthropologie, selling products like “robin’s nest Caucasian headdresses.”)"
1589,"The absurd vision of “Broad City” reflects how money has warped the reality of the city itself. In a second-season episode, Abbi, whacked out on painkillers after wisdom-teeth surgery, goes on a shopping spree at the Gowanus Whole Foods, loading her cart with $1487.56 worth of manuka honey and hearts of palm, accompanied by the hallucination of a giant stuffed bunny."
1590,"It’s surreal — but then, so is building an upscale grocery paradise next to an industrial Superfund site. As Ilana says, as she bikes into the store parking lot to retrieve her friend, “Damn, this neighborhood is changing.”"
1591,"A constant theme of “Broad City” is what adulthood means, and how much of that has to do with money. Often, it’s defined in small milestones. Ilana resolves to do her own taxes. Abbi decides, “I’m an adult; I should be buying my own pot.”"
1592,"At the beginning of the final season, time seems to be weighing on the series’s mind. But to its credit, it seems to resist the standard conclusion of young-people-in-the-city sitcoms: that characters must “grow up,” which means getting a steady job, kids and a mortgage. When Abbi, in the premiere, runs into a college acquaintance who is settled with children, she feels inadequate, until she realizes that parenting has made her friend a stressed-out mess."
1593,"Free spirit Ilana, meanwhile, confronts her own crisis when her boyfriend, Lincoln (Hannibal Buress), reveals that he has a long-term plan to leave the city for the suburbs. This is a bridge, or tunnel, too far. “I’m only 27 — what am I, a child bride?” she says. “I’m on a New York City timeline.”"
1594,"HBO’s “High Maintenance,” airing its third season Sundays on HBO, runs on a more stately, chill timeline. Simultaneously naturalistic and dreamy, it’s like the artsy cousin of “Broad City” that went to film school. In geography and spirit, though, its depiction of New York’s Kombucha Belt is much the same — even when, in its season premiere, it visits a pocket of the Catskills that functions as a kind of hipster-Brooklyn-in-exile."
1595,"Constructed as an anthology about a Brooklyn pot dealer (Ben Sinclair) and his clients, the show covers a wide swath of New Yorkers united by the need for weed. But money stress is a recurring theme: A couple saves cash by moving farther down the subway line, then buckles under the feeling of isolation; another couple wins a housing lottery but they feel like second-class citizens in their spiffy building, squeezed into a tiny space and barred from the bike room and sauna."
1596,"The show combines a winning slacker charm with a detail-perfect sense of life as lived, right now, in its slice of the city. It is particularly sharp on how the app economy has brought Airbnbs to every corner of the boroughs and flooded the streets with Lyfts — the virtual terraforming of the city into one New York of actual wealth and another of gigs and hustles."
1597,"For all that, there isn’t a touch of bitterness to the generous-hearted “High Maintenance.” (The second-season premiere, “Globo,” set after an unspecified tragedy — violent? political? — is a wry testament to the city’s neurosis and unbreakability.) It embraces its oddball subjects — con artists, Craigslist obsessives, exhibitionists, even dogs — and the city that, for all its demands, gives them the space to be who they are."
1598,"If “Broad City” is a story of febrile friendship and “High Maintenance” one of buzzed benevolence, then “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” which ends Friday on Netflix after four seasons, is like an affectionate Bronx cheer. Or make that an East Dogmouth cheer, named for the fictional neighborhood, somewhere in far north Manhattan, that took in the title character (Ellie Kemper) after she spent 15 years imprisoned by a misogynist cult in Indiana."
1599,"“Kimmy Schmidt,” from Tina Fey and Robert Carlock of “30 Rock,” has always been a comedy of trauma and recovery, which the final run of episodes underlines by tying its story, with mixed results, to the #MeToo movement that it anticipated. But it has also been one of TV’s sharpest satires of a changing city."
1600,"East Dogmouth is a little island in a borough drowning in money and being homogenized by corporations. (A sign at a construction site in Season 2 reads, “Coming Soon: 9 Banks!”) It is proudly unpretty, a stubborn piece of gum stuck to the $1,000 shoe of Manhattan, and that’s precisely what makes it affordable for Kimmy and her underemployed actor roomie, Titus (Tituss Burgess)."
1601,"Its fiercest champion is Kimmy and Titus’s landlady, Lillian Kaushtupper (Carol Kane), an anti-gentrification militant who chases off encroaching hipsters and fights the opening of a Whole Foods-like grocery store (Big Naturals, not to be confused with the local strip club of the same name)."
1602,"Lillian, with a voice coated in five layers of peeling lead paint, is the pure, scamming heart of the city and one of the greatest New Yorkers TV has created. “Kimmy Schmidt” is itself a kind of anti-fantasy fantasy of New York, celebrating the city’s dirt in an era in which even “Sesame Street” has gotten an expensive face-lift, and Lillian is its indomitable Oscar the Grouch."
1603,"East Dogmouth may be gross and unmarketable, but that’s exactly why it can make a home for broke misfits like Kimmy and Titus. That openness to the weird and outcast is what “Kimmy Schmidt” and “High Maintenance” and “Broad City” love, in their different ways. It’s what Lillian hopes to preserve when she fantasizes about dying and becoming a ghost, so she can “make sure this neighborhood stays terrible forever.”"
1604,"If that’s not the spirit of New York, what is?"

1609,The Times’s Ashley Southall reports:
1610,Twenty thousand extra eyes are now watching police encounters with civilians in New York.
1611,"The Police Department announced last week that uniformed officers patrolling neighborhoods, public housing developments and the transit system have been assigned body cameras. New York’s camera program is twice as large as any other police department’s in the country."
1612,"An additional 4,000 officers in specialized commands, like the Emergency Service Unit, are supposed to get the cameras by August, which would make the city’s body-camera program the largest in the world."
1613,"The department started distributing the cameras in April 2017 and has moved forward despite a malfunction last October that caused one of the devices to burst into flames, delaying the rollout and forcing officials to replace thousands of devices over safety concerns."
1614,"Still, don’t expect the Police Department to release videos of every arrest or encounter anytime soon. The department has kept most of the footage away from the public despite promises from Mayor de Blasio and Police Commissioner James P. O’Neill to be more transparent."
1615,"One reason had been a lawsuit brought by a police union, the Police Benevolent Association, that argued that judges, not the police commissioner, should make decisions about releasing videos. But two weeks ago, an appeals court threw out the suit and said the videos could be made public."
1616,"The department, however, has yet to release any of the videos that were held up while the lawsuit was pending."
1617,Officials say they are grappling with a backlog of public disclosure requests. The window of opportunity for releasing footage may close when the union appeals to the state’s highest court.

1622,The couple did not announce a date or a venue. The news was met with excitement in the obvious borough of choice for the former Bronx Bomber and Jenny From the Block.
1623,"“Have it here? That would be great!” said Paulie Carigliano, an assistant manager at Scavello’s on the Island, a catering hall on City Island in the Bronx. Ms. Lopez grew up near his family’s farm nearby, Mr. Carigliano said, and his restaurant would be ideal for the woman he still thinks of as a neighbor."
1624,"“This place here is known for its food,” he said yesterday. “We don’t buy sauce in the can. We don’t buy cheese for the pizzas. The chef does everything from scratch. People rave.”"
1625,"The hall holds 300 guests “legally,” Mr. Carigliano said. “You could see the Manhattan skyline. They want to take pictures, all they have to do is go down the block. I would think this would be the best place for them to get married.”"

1662,"I was continuing on when I had to stop suddenly. What looked like the entire 13th Precinct was standing there dressed in their finest, posing for what I figured was their annual photo."

1669,"Who doesn’t want to be a little cooler in the new year? If one of your resolutions involved staying ahead of the curve, you’re in luck. These four new and under-the-radar labels will help you get there (and look good in the process)."
1670,"Adam Selman began his career creating costumes for Rihanna, Britney Spears and Lady Gaga before becoming a full-time designer with a namesake label. Now he’s taking another leap, this time transforming his ready-to-wear line into a full-fledged active wear collection. "
1671,"It will have its debut this week at Net-a-Porter, under the name Adam Selman Sport. The collection is distinguished by a refreshing dose of sass and a nightclub-y aesthetic that will delight SoulCyclers who’ve swapped the dance floor for the bike. Most important, the line is sustainable, affordable, unisex and inclusively sized."
1672,"Adam Selman Sport nylon spandex leggings, $135, and cropped racer top, $95, at net-a-porter.com. "
1673,"This may just be the year of Cienne. Though the label was introduced in 2014 by Nicole Heim and Chelsea Healy, it really hit its stride in 2018, becoming a semifinalist in the International Woolmark Prize and appearing on the backs of Gigi Hadid and Gwyneth Paltrow. "
1674,"There’s little mystery why. Its sustainable business model is welcome today, and, for many of us, its subversive staples and fuss-free design fill a smidgen of the hole left by Phoebe Philo’s departure from Celine."
1675,"Cienne cotton-linen pants with slit-front detail, $640; silk crepe dress with smocking detail, $780; textured linen shirt, $560; at shop.ciennenewyork.com."
1676,"Billing itself the “Sephora of CBD,” Fleur Marché caters to the cannabis enthusiast (or curiosity seeker) who shops at Barneys and subscribes to Goop. Which isn’t too surprising, since its founders, Ashley Lewis and Meredith Schroeder, formerly served as directors at Goop. "
1677,"The site looks as if it should sell barely-there lipstick or nifty scented candles but instead offers CBD starter kits, including Le PMS Kit, Le Sleep Kit and Le Beauty Kit. Each comes with products from well-regarded companies, with detailed information regarding sourcing, production and potency. "

1679,"After 2018, we could probably use a little reminder to have fun. Think of Viva Aviva as the sartorial permission to do just that. Designed by Aviva Falk, a Diane von Furstenberg alum, and produced in Brooklyn, the line is a riot of ruffles, bold colors and cute-but-not-too-cute details (imagine bandeaus cinched with a bow) that work especially well on frocks and date-night tops. "
1680,"Here’s the label’s tag line: “If you always dress for a party, life will always be one.” Take it to heart."
1681,"Viva Aviva cotton prairie dress, $475 at vivaaviva.com. "
1682,"The Church of the Redeemer, which was built in 1866 in Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill, mirrored the Gothic style of medieval churches in Europe. The condominium building rising in its place, however, looks toward Japan for inspiration."
1683,"Ryoko Okada, a principal and director of interior architecture and design at ODA New York, said she tapped into the Japanese aesthetics of “wabi-sabi,” or the art of finding beauty in imperfection, when designing 561 Pacific."
1684,"“It’s about finding natural materials that have an unconscious aesthetic,” she said of the many warm brown and gray materials she chose. The wood, stone, concrete and steel used in the interior all have knots and grains with very subtle imperfections, some of which will also change over time, she said. “It’s about celebrating what’s naturally incomplete.”"
1685,"Ms. Okada, a native of Japan, said the wooden slats found in the entryway of the 63-unit building resembles “koshi,” or wooden lattice entryways and window coverings found in traditional wooden townhouses in Japan called “machiya.” It allows some light in, but also keeps the entryway private, Ms. Okada said."
1686,"The hallway in the ground-level lobby lounge is made with light gray concrete-look porcelain tile, with dark solid wood and metal inlays separating each slab. This is inspired by “tobi-ishi,” or steppingstone, and “roji,” a lush, garden path that leads to a teahouse. Both are Japanese design features that make you consciously focus on where you are walking and block the outer world."
1687,"“I thought it would be great if residents can use the same thought process, where you can consciously start decompressing from the outside chaos when you get home,” Ms. Okada said."
1688,"The building is in a particularly hectic area, just a block from the major traffic intersection of Atlantic, Flatbush and Fourth Avenues, and close to the Barclays Center and the Atlantic Terminal and Atlantic Center shopping complexes."
1689,"Developed by Adam America Real Estate, the 12-story building will offer studios from $550,000, one-bedrooms from $850,000, two bedrooms from $1.375 million, and three-bedrooms from $2.275 million. Over a third of the apartments will come with private outdoor space. Sales start later this month."
1690,"Building amenities include a gym, a playroom, a rooftop sun deck with barbecue and dining stations, and bike storage. Sixteen parking spaces will be available for purchase for $150,000 each."
1691,"The building, expected to be finished early next year, will also have about 7,000-square-feet of ground floor retail space available."
1692,"Like other parts of the city, the Brooklyn condominium market was slower in the fall and winter months, but the mood has been rather upbeat from the start of the year, said Brendan Aguayo, senior vice president and a director at Halstead Property Development Marketing, the firm in charge of sales. Mr. Aguayo said he has seen a large increase in traffic, demand and deal velocity as interest rates have stabilized."
1693,"“Brooklyn condominium buyers are very sophisticated,” Mr. Aguayo said, noting their desire for “everything,” including high-end interior finishes, proximity to transportation and a vibrant neighborhood."
1694,"Being within easy walking distance to Park Slope, Fort Greene, Gowanus and Downtown Brooklyn will likely appeal to many buyers, Mr. Aguayo said."
1695,"“I think this building is on the forefront of the shift happening on Fourth Avenue and the renaissance of this corridor,” he said, referring to an anticipated rezoning of nearby Gowanus."
1696,"“Wabi-sabi embraces the imperfect and accepts that change happens,” Ms. Okada said when describing the building’s Japanese design inspiration. It’s a notion that works extremely well for a calm, welcoming home, but is undoubtedly hard for some neighbors to swallow as their immediate surrounding gets denser."
1697,"For those nostalgic for the Episcopal church that once stood here, one relic remains. A well-preserved mosaic tile that signaled the prominence of the church, which closed in 2010, still exists in the northwest subway exit on the corner of Pacific and Fourth Avenue."

1700,"The man accused of mailing pipe bombs to critics of President Trump is expected to plead guilty next week in federal court in Manhattan, the court’s docket shows."
1701,"The defendant, Cesar A. Sayoc Jr., a fervent Trump supporter, sent homemade bombs created with PVC pipe and glass shards to prominent Democrats, including Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama, as well as to CNN and the actor Robert DeNiro, the authorities said."
1702,"The court’s docket entry states only that there is a plea scheduled for Thursday, but it does not indicate what charges Mr. Sayoc will plead guilty to. He was indicted in November on 30 federal charges, including using a weapon of mass destruction and interstate transportation of an explosive."
1703,"Ten of the counts carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, and under federal law, if he were convicted of a certain combination of those counts, the judge would be required to give him a life sentence. A possible plea deal might center on whether Mr. Sayoc could plead guilty to counts that leave the judge the discretion to sentence him to less time."
1704,Mr. Sayoc’s federal public defenders and the United States attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment on his expected plea on Friday.
1705,"Mr. Sayoc, 56, was arrested on Oct. 26 outside an auto-parts store near Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he appeared to be living in a white van covered with images and slogans condemning liberals that are often found on fringe, right-wing social media accounts. One was an image of Mrs. Clinton under cross hairs."
1706,"His social media feeds were an electronic version of his van. On Twitter and Facebook, he railed against Mr. Obama and Oprah Winfrey with misspelled racial epithets, and threatened former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. He also praised Mr. Trump and conservative causes."
1707,"The arrest came after a fast-moving investigation and manhunt, as investigators tried to discover the source of 16 pipe bombs sent through the mail. The authorities said they were able to pull Mr. Sayoc’s fingerprints from two bomb packages and found his DNA on components of 10 of the improvised bombs."
1708,"The indictment against Mr. Sayoc only charges him in connection with five devices that were sent to victims in Westchester County and Manhattan, which are both part of the Southern District of New York."
1709,"In addition to Mrs. Clinton and Mr. DeNiro, those packages were sent to John O. Brennan, a former C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence; and George Soros, a billionaire Democratic donor."
1710,Federal prosecutors have called Mr. Sayoc’s actions “a domestic terrorist attack.”
1711,"Mr. Sayoc’s trial had been scheduled for July. Last fall, one of his lawyers asked the judge, Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court, for additional time to investigate the case to determine whether, among other things, there was the possibility of a plea agreement."
1712,It is possible that Mr. Sayoc’s plea could fall through. A defendant preparing to plead can change his mind up to the last minute and opt to go to trial.
1713,"Before his arrest, Mr. Sayoc held himself out as an entrepreneur and bodybuilder who promoted exotic-dance shows in southern Florida. But he was also an angry, bankrupt loner who often lived out of his van, held far-right political views and was prone to racist and sexist tirades, according to court documents and people who knew him."
1714,"A guilty plea by Mr. Sayoc would resolve one of the major terrorism prosecutions pending in Manhattan. In another case, Judge Vernon S. Broderick on Tuesday granted a defense request for a six-month delay in the trial of Sayfullo Saipov, scheduling it for April 13, 2020."
1715,"Mr. Saipov was charged with using a pickup truck to kill eight people on a Manhattan bike path in 2017. He has pleaded not guilty, and if he is convicted, he could face the death penalty."
1716,I AM GOD By Giacomo Sartori Translated by Frederika Randall
1717,"Comic depictions of God are not, by nature, awe-inspiring, though some have been very fun. Hollywood has given us silly Gods, like George Burns in “Oh, God!” complaining about avocados — “I made the pit too big” — or Morgan Freeman in “Bruce Almighty” singing the jingle to “The Clapper.” Literature has gone deeper and darker, with Stanley Elkin’s Borscht-belt God in “The Living End” kvetching “I never found my audience,” before wiping out the world. Somewhere in the middle of this silly-to-grim spectrum sits the narrator of the Italian writer Giacomo Sartori’s new novel, “I Am God,” who begins by announcing that, for the first time ever, He has started to think."
1718,"“Up to now I’ve never thought, and I’ve never felt the need,” He gripes, annoyed to be participating in such mundane activity. He is even keeping a diary — these pages before us — in which He rants with the gusto of someone who has kept His opinions to Himself for a very long time and finally has a chance to unload them. Much of the novel that follows is composed of His thoughts on everything from materialism and television to genetics and global warming. It’s precisely the sort of thing we might hope for from God in a novel — that He would tell us what He really thinks! — but it does set a high bar for the novelist."
1719,"Sartori’s God is male, jokey and, in Frederika Randall’s translation, fairly hokey, with a colloquial diction out of the 1950s and a propensity to wink and nudge. He calls human reason “cerebral yackety-yack,” writes off human conversation as “balderdash” and blames the yackety-yack and the balderdash for “the whole shebang of infamy and atrocities.” He points out His own puns (“I’d be in heaven once again, as they say”) and overexplains Himself in footnotes (“I want to be sure this point is crystal clear”). He mocks the Catholic Church, but shares many of the church’s more conservative views on subjects like gender (“Frailty, thy name is woman!”) and sexuality (“Progress my backside: By now pornography and homosexuality flourish unchallenged!”). He’s half heteronormative deity, half embarrassing uncle."
1720,"He is also frustrated. For reasons He can’t understand, He has fallen in love with a human woman, a “post-punk” atheist lab assistant named Daphne. (Greek mythological references are peppered throughout the book.) We quickly learn that His infatuation with this “lofty biker” and “lanky unbeliever” (she drives a motorcycle and steals and burns crucifixes as a hobby) is what has started Him thinking in the first place, and that many of His grumbly opinions about humanity are at least partly pretenses for avoiding His desirous thoughts about her. The novel’s drama lies in Daphne’s tale, which God gradually tells: the story of her own messy existence, and the mess she is making of His. Unfortunately, Daphne’s story proves a little scattered, in part because she is kept at such a remove from the reader that she never emerges as a complex, coherent character, only as an object of God’s fascination."
1721,"Humor is famously tough to translate, and perhaps “I Am God” is a more successful book in Italian than in this English version. The premise is certainly fun. The problem is that God, here, isn’t provocative or charismatic enough to pull off a one-man show. If God in a novel is going to offer insights, they should be more compelling than “When things are gained with difficulty, humans appreciate them more.” If God in a novel cracks a joke, it can be silly or grim or anywhere in between, but it has to be funny."
1722,"COPENHAGEN — Describing his work as an undercover agent among a group of heavily armed Qaeda terrorists, Morten Storm said his job as a jihadist-turned-informant was dangerous and grueling."
1723,"Spy agencies never acknowledged his secret service. But now a Danish state agency, in a breakthrough ruling for Mr. Storm, has awarded him about $27,000 in damages for loss of work ability because of post-traumatic stress disorder, which he said in his claim was a result of his undercover role for the Danish and other intelligence agencies."
1724,"Labour Market Insurance, a state body, concluded that he had experienced “exceptionally dangerous events” during his tenure, the newspaper Jyllands-Posten reported on Monday. A future review will decide to what extent he may still be able to work, and could award additional compensation."
1725,"The payout is, in effect, the first formal recognition by the government of his undercover work; it has never been acknowledged by the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, PET, or by other Western intelligence agencies, which generally refuse to comment on secret sources."
1726,"Hans Jorgen Bonnichsen, a former chief of operations of the Danish intelligence service, said he was stunned when he heard of the decision to compensate Mr. Storm. Agencies that conduct their work in secret are put in a tough spot when former operatives talk publicly about their work, Mr. Bonnichsen said, but the intelligence service usually maintained its silence “until hell freezes over” to protect its current employees."
1727,"Mr. Storm’s lawyer said the compensation case was “a little peculiar,” though he said the size of the initial award was fairly standard. Mr. Storm had no pay slip or contract to show for his work, and PET refused to submit any corroboration."
1728,"“In regular work-damage cases both the injured and the employer offer information, but PET chose to be completely silent,” said the lawyer, Brian Bruun Hansen."
1729,"In an email message, a PET press officer said the agency “generally does not confirm or deny whether a person is working or has worked as a source.”"
1730,"Instead of documents proving his relationship with state intelligence agents, Mr. Storm submitted voice recordings and proof of Western Union money transfers that included the names of PET operatives. His past claims about his undercover work have been taken seriously by the international news media and by Atlantic Monthly Press, which published his 2014 memoir, “Agent Storm: My Life Inside Al Qaeda and the C.I.A.” A New York Times review called his account “highly credible.”"
1731,"Before he joined with militant Islamists, Mr. Storm, now 43, was an armed robber and, at 21, a prospective member of a criminal biker gang. In 1997, in his early 20s, he converted to Islam and moved first to Britain, and then to Yemen to learn Arabic. There, he befriended senior members of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula."
1732,"In 2006, according to his account, he lost faith in jihadism and turned on his terrorist comrades to become an informer for the Danish intelligence service, as well as for agencies in Britain and the United States."
1733,"Mr. Storm claims that information he provided helped lead to the drone killing of the American cleric and Qaeda recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen in 2011 and also to the arrest that year of Ahmed Abdulkadir Warsame, a Somali aiding Al Shabab, a terrorist group in Somalia, and Al Qaeda in Yemen. His claims have never been publicly confirmed by the C.I.A."
1734,"In 2012, Mr. Storm broke with PET and started speaking to the news media."
1735,"He said he had worked directly with American and Danish agents and received monthly payments, but never rewards or help to restart his life — a source of great resentment to him."
1736,"Mr. Storm is apparently now hiding in a village in Denmark, saying he is fearful of his former comrades in the jihadist network who have threatened him online. In 2018, four people were convicted of threatening him on a Danish beach during a trip with his three children."
1737,"It was the strains of a dangerous double life, Mr. Storm said, that led to his PTSD. Today, he says, simple grocery shopping in the Danish countryside causes him fear."
1738,"“At night, I scream and kick,” he said in a telephone interview. “Just talking about it now makes me uneasy.”"
1739,"“Schitt’s Creek” returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, and all 10 episodes of YouTube’s original series “Wayne” are available to stream."
1740,"SCHITT’S CREEK 10 p.m. on Pop. When we last saw the Roses, they seemed to be actually liking Schitt’s Creek, the small town that the formerly wealthy family landed in after being defrauded by their business manager. They were still living in adjoining rooms at the Rosebud Motel, which the patriarch, Johnny, now co-owns with Stevie, and visiting Twyla at the Café Tropical, but over all, things were looking up. David and Alexis found love, and Moira even seems to have gotten her acting career somewhat back on track. On Wednesday, the comedy, created by the father-and-son team Eugene and Dan Levy, returns for its fifth season with a special two-episode premiere, reuniting fans with an uncharacteristically happy Rose clan."
1741,"EQUUS: STORY OF THE HORSE 8 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Dogs might be considered man’s best friend, but horses and humans have a long and storied history. The anthropologist Niobe Thompson takes a deep dive into the species’ origins, emotional intelligence and connection with humans in this special two-part “Nature” series on PBS, which was filmed over 18 months across three continents."
1742,"WAYNE on YouTube Premium. Described by YouTube as an “action comedy and a punk-rock teen romance,” this original series follows 16-year-old Wayne (Mark McKenna) as he travels from Boston to Florida on a dirt bike to retrieve a stolen 1978 Trans Am his ailing father wanted to leave him after his death. But before he sets off, he grabs a pair of nunchucks and his new crush, Del (Ciara Bravo), whose meathead brothers eventually come looking for them."
1743,"SEX EDUCATION on Netflix. If you’re in the mood for more teenage angst, check out this new comedy starring Gillian Anderson and Asa Butterfield as a very open sex therapist and her teenage son, Otis, who discovers he has a surprising talent for helping his peers navigate the awkward obstacles that come with dating and having sex for the first time. With help from his best friend, Eric (Ncuti Gatwa), who’s gay, and his crush, Maeve (Emma Mackey), Otis turns his skill into a side hustle, charging sexually frustrated “clients” for his guidance, despite having his own set of intimate issues. In his review for The New York Times, James Poniewozik named the show a Critic’s Pick, and called it “a little bit ‘Masters of Sex,’ a little bit ‘Doogie Howser, XXX.’ But it blooms, over eight episodes, into a smart, sensitive look at teens finding their place and figuring out the owner’s manuals for their bodies.”"
1744,"AMERICAN GANGSTER (2007) stream on Netflix; rent on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play. This Ridley Scott-directed cat-and-mouse crime drama follows the story of Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington), a heroin smuggler who ran the Harlem crime scene in the late 1960s and early ’70s, and the New Jersey detective, Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), who tries to take him down."
1745,"The government shutdown is over, at least for now, but it was a busy week of Ping-Ponging politics. Here is some of our best journalism you may have missed."
1746,"Rustic shelters called bothies — more than 100 of which are scattered throughout England, Wales and Scotland — are an indispensable, if little-known, element of British hill culture. Our reporter visited 20 of them over two weeks, while hiking some 200 miles. Travel"

1869,It’s Thursday. A dog on the tracks on the Williamsburg Bridge delayed subways for over an hour last night.
1870,Alternate-side parking: in effect till Jan. 21.
1871,Maybe we should call it the Soggy Apple. New York City just experienced its fourth-wettest year on record.
1872,"In 2018, 65.55 inches of precipitation fell in Central Park, according to the National Weather Service. That’s more than 15 inches, or 31 percent, above normal."
1873,This is part of a broader pattern caused by global warming. The Northeast is getting wetter; the Pacific Northwest is getting drier; and the South is getting hotter.
1874,"Out of the 149 years of weather data collected at Central Park, the 10 wettest have all happened since 1972."
1875,To put it another way: New York City’s wettest years all occurred since “The Godfather” hit movie theaters.
1876,Weren’t around for that movie? Try this: five of New York City’s 10 wettest years have taken place since 2003 — when the first “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie was on the big screen.
1877,Not that excess wetness is a consistent phenomenon — the three years before 2018 were all unusually dry. But the overall trend is real.
1878,"How does global warming fit in? Warmer air can hold more moisture. And if that warmer air is holding more moisture, it can drop more moisture."
1879,"And if you think all that moisture is coming down nice and easy, think again."
1880,"Precipitation is coming in “big, flood-producing events, extreme events,” said Jessica Spaccio, a climatologist at the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University."
1881,“We’re seeing a lot of precipitation coming down quickly and not so evenly spread throughout the year.”
1882,"The on-the-ground effects of all that stuff falling from the sky include overwhelmed irrigation systems producing pollution-carrying runoff (yuck) and washed-out streets, Ms. Spaccio said."
1883,"And, based on my own scientific research: Everybody forgets how to drive, subway stations get flooded and sidewalks fill with people carrying obnoxiously large umbrellas."
1884,Meteorologists at the National Weather Service were not available to comment because they’re dealing with their own problem: a government shutdown.
1885,"Today, however, the rain is taking a day off. Skies will clear, with a high of 47. But it returns on Saturday."
1886,Here’s what else is happening:
1887,Showtime at the Apollo: The history of the legendary theater is told in a new graphic novel.
1888,"Acquitted: A jury found a former top police official not guilty of bribery, though prosecutors contended he did favors for businessmen who gave him expensive gifts and trips."
1889,"Illegal silicone injection proves fatal: An unlicensed, self-styled plastic surgeon was charged with manslaughter."
1890,"$400 million, and counting: Ridership on the Port Authority’s PATH train is up, but it is losing money."
1891,"Only in New York: “For $7,000, you too can bathe like a very wealthy person.”"
1892,"Floating billboards: They’re here, and could make the water around Manhattan feel like Times Square. [Gothamist]"
1893,More people left New Jersey than any other state: That’s according to data from a moving company that has tracked this information since 1977. [NBC New York]

1904,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
1905,The L train shutdown is not funny. But it is a game.
1906,"More than $3,000 has been raised on Kickstarter for the creation of Escape from HelL, a “board game about getting to Manhattan from Williamsburg once the L train shuts down.”"
1907,"How it works: As in Chutes and Ladders, players roll dice and move around the board to reach a destination."
1908,"In Escape, each player is a hipster in Bushwick trying to get to work in Manhattan. Since the L is not running, players have to rely on buses, ferries, bikes and cabs."
1909,Along the way are cards of chance.
1910,For example:
1911,Move back three spaces because “Your ex is the other person in your carshare. You open the door and jump out.”
1912,Another card: “Your SoulCycle sweat looks like you peed yourself. Go back and change clothes.”
1913,Go back two spaces because “You finally got on the J/M/Z but your subway car only has one person on it. And it smells like a toilet.”
1914,"The board is colorfully decorated, with ride-sharing bikes, a graffiti mural and a bridge. (The song about the game is pretty catchy, too.)"
1915,The L train shutdown starts in April and is expected to last 15 months.
1916,"Unlike the train, the board game is moving ahead without problems. It will be delivered to Kickstarter supporters next month, according to Hunter Fine, a co-creator."
1917,"If games are left over, Mr. Fine said he would try to sell them, possibly in subway stations."
1918,Dear Diary:
1919,"It was summer 2001, and my mother and I were having lunch at the Cupping Room in SoHo."
1920,"“That guy over at that table is the one who wouldn’t pitch on Yom Kippur,” my mother said out of nowhere."
1921,What would Sandy Koufax be doing here? I replied.
1922,"A few minutes later, the man she was referring to got up from his table and walked past the one where we were sitting."
1923,“Are your initials S.K.?” my mother said without hesitating.
1924,"“Yes,” he said before continuing on his way."
1925,I don’t know what amazed me more: seeing Sandy Koufax or my mother recognizing him.

1929,"On a Monday afternoon in mid-March, in the mezzanine office of her studio near the Ménilmontant neighborhood of Paris, the French designer Christelle Kocher pauses briefly to re-bedazzle her blue acrylic nails. She carefully pulls a diamanté out of a pile and, using tweezers, daubs it with glue and then applies it to her nail bed. “I have to touch them up, as a few have fallen off,” she says."
1930,"Kocher, who founded her eponymous line, Koché, in 2015 — and who also currently serves as the artistic director of the Parisian Métiers d’Art feather and floral embroidery house, Lemarié — is known for her mastery of rich embellishment. At Lemarié, she collaborates with luxury houses such as Chanel, Dior and Valentino, festooning their haute couture garments with feathers. For Koché, she brings her hands-on crafty sensibility to streetwear-inspired ready-to-wear, finessing nylon sports jackets with lace inserts and encrusting catsuits with studs and Swarovski crystals. “I love the culture of couture, and I am fascinated to see how I can continue the story and make it more contemporary with a relaxed attitude,” she says. “To create a new vocabulary between these worlds.”"

1935,"Her fall 2019 collection, presented in Paris last month, was perhaps her most apt mash-up yet — a pastiche of iconic sportswear fabrics and racy graphics mixed with evening wear in the form of bias cut gowns assembled from deconstructed soccer jerseys (representing 19 soccer teams all around the world) and bike shorts paired with a sequin-and-satin tuxedo jacket. Some of these looks heralded Kocher’s new collaboration with Nike, a partnership that reached full bloom at a sports-star-studded fashion show last week, at which Nike unveiled 14 national team soccer kits for their sponsored women’s teams, ahead of the Women’s World Cup in Paris this summer. Featured alongside the new team uniforms were 13 one-off looks — dresses, jerseys, track pants and bodysuits — that Kocher designed and spliced together from an assortment of Nike women’s soccer jerseys specifically for the occasion."
1936,"An alignment with Nike seems like a natural fit for the designer, who was an avid athlete throughout her teenage years in Strasbourg. She played in the French Junior League for handball from a young age; now, she runs in the nearby Buttes-Chaumont Park almost every day. “Sports really helped me to develop my personality: I was a very shy kid, and it gave me this sense of team spirit,” Kocher says. “I liked the comfort of the clothes as well, and I think that has influenced me a lot.”"
1937,"Still, high fashion, not sportswear, has been the constant on her CV. After studying at Central Saint Martins, Kocher clocked up experience at Chloé, Dries Van Noten and Bottega Veneta — the latter while also juggling her role at Lemarié, where she has honed her skills in applied crafts. “The history is so interesting because it developed through women who obviously were always working on it from home,” Kocher says of the art form. Though there was a moment when she was tempted by a cleaner aesthetic, she has stayed her course. “I read a lot about the feminist art movement of the ’70s, the work of Louise Bourgeois and Sheila Hicks, and I realized they used craft as a medium for emancipation and empowerment,” she says."
1938,"After the Nike World Cup show wrapped at Paris’s Palais Brongniart, Kocher describes how proud she was to have U.S. soccer star Brandi Chastain, the 10-year-old British skateboarder Sky Brown, the German boxing champion Zeina Nassar and the South African track-and-field gold medalist Caster Semenya modeling her garments. “We wanted to bring together different athletes of different nationalities, generations and disciplines, and this is very much the same message I have at my show: this diversity and inclusivity,” she says."
1939,"The following day, we’re in the decorous salons of the Mona Bismarck American Center, an exhibition space in Paris, which Nike has taken over for the day. Here, guests are invited to follow Kocher’s lead and customize their own soccer jerseys using an array of hardware, fabrics and patches. The space hums with a sense of excitement — adults given leave to dabble in craft — and Kocher, decked out in a patchwork tuxedo suit with satin lapels from her fall 2019 collection, roams around the room offering up tips. Though she works on 12 collections a year (eight for Chanel and four for her own brand), it is here, when she’s fixated on the minutest details, that she seems most in her element."
1940,"Halletts Point, the mega development planned on a knobby peninsula in Astoria, Queens, has been years in the making, but apartments in the first building will finally be available for rent beginning this month. "
1941,"In truth, this 404-unit project, known as 10 Halletts Point, has practically sailed through construction compared with the rest of the $1.5 billion mixed-use development, which eventually will have seven buildings containing 2,020 units, nearly a quarter of them affordable, according to officials with the developer, the Durst Organization."
1942,"Sure, there were minor snags with this first member of the Halletts Point family — uneven “soil conditions” from landfill that had to be dealt with and a contractor who had to be replaced."
1943,"But the larger development is stalled, once again, after hitting multiple roadblocks since the summer of 2013. That was when the seven-acre site was first presented to Durst by the Lincoln Equities Group, which had assembled the site, according to Alexander Durst, a principal and chief development officer of the company and great-grandson of its founder. "
1944,"Durst broke ground for 10 Halletts Point in 2016, just in time for the expiration of the 421a program, which had long provided tax breaks to developers building affordable housing. Work on the rest of Halletts Point halted until a replacement program kicked in, and now the larger development — which will include two all-affordable buildings built on the campus of the nearby Astoria Houses, a public housing complex sprawling over several blocks — is waiting for bond financing, Mr. Durst said."
1945,"But brokers are eager to show prospective renters around 10 Halletts Point, which has two towers — one 17 stories, the other 22 — built on a base containing common amenities. Most of the project’s 404 units will be studios and one-bedrooms, 81 of them affordable units that were parceled out in a lottery held last spring for applicants who met income requirements."
1946,"On a recent tour of the building — an angular form with a copper-colored aluminum skin designed by Dattner Architects — the main selling point was clear: sweeping views of the East River, with the Upper East Side rising on the opposite shore."
1947,"A model apartment on the fifth floor offered a glimpse of Gracie Mansion, peeking out from the trees of Carl Schurz Park, and a bird’s-eye view of tiny Mill Rock Island. The Robert F. Kennedy Bridge loomed to the northeast. Roosevelt Island spread to the south. And a big red barge chugged by."
1948,"The development gets its name from the peninsula on which it sits. Dotted with low-rise buildings containing metal fabricators and other businesses, the waterfront here retains some of its old gritty industrial feel — at least for now."
1949,"Two large common terraces at 10 Halletts Point — with areas for lounging, barbecuing and, yes, taking in that view — are among the 25,000 square feet of amenities the project will offer. A grocery store, Brooklyn Harvest Market, is slated to open in May; the first to open in the area in years, it is sure to benefit neighborhood residents as well as tenants. A waterfront esplanade will be extended, according to Durst."
1950,"It’s about a mile from the peninsula to the Astoria Boulevard subway station for the N and W trains, though Halletts Point will run a shuttle to speed the journey. There is also a nearby Citi Bike dock, and the Astoria ferry stop is a five-minute walk away."
1951,"The minimalist lobby, designed, like the other interior common areas, by Spacesmith, features white walls, reclaimed white oak millwork and murals by the artist Jason Middlebrook."
1952,"But in the end it’s the view that’s the big draw — which is a double-edged sword because the Durst plan calls for two other projects to be built just west of 10 Halletts Point, closer to the water’s edge. The buildings along the shore will be 26 and 32 stories and thus will block west-facing views from many apartments in 10 Halletts Point."
1953,"Bye-bye, Gracie Mansion."
1954,"The units that are hitting the market this month — studios will start at $1,895, one-bedrooms at $2,525 and two-bedrooms at $3,595 — are on floors three to six. Move-ins will begin in March."
1955,"Mr. Durst said construction on the buildings closer to the shore might commence “this fall,” but, given this development’s history, it might not."

1958,"To get to the front desk of the 50-room Ramble Hotel, which opened in Denver’s River North Art District (RiNo) last May, guests walk through what amounts to a cocktail jamboree: the first outpost of the bar Death & Co beyond New York City’s East Village. The hotel, owned by Ryan Diggins, 34, a local developer, was generally inspired by the salons of 17th-century France, and, specifically, by Catherine de Vivonne, Marquise de Rambouillet, whose own salon was known as an egalitarian gathering. “I loved what the French salon stood for, as really it was a place for everyone, as long as you had an opinion,” Mr. Diggins said. “Ramble is our shortened version of her name, and also means to wander or explore without a definitive destination.” In hopes of fostering the Marquise’s ideal of interaction and engagement, the hotel stocked the airy, ground-floor lobby with myriad seating areas for lingering, and also holds occasional art programs in its adjacent event space. "
1959,"The hotel is close to RiNo’s inventive restaurants (Comal Heritage Food Incubator, where Syrian refugees make the best hummus I’ve tasted, based on their own recipes), shops (like Modern Nomad, a housewares store in a former auto body shop) and food halls (including Zeppelin Station, which opened last March). Our room faced Larimer Street, which was once a hangout for the Beat muse Neal Cassady, and can be rowdy; we listened to bachelorette parties swish by like whirligigs on 16-passenger bike bar tours. The Denver Rescue Mission nearby means revelers may be sobered by denizens down on their luck."
1960,"Decorated by Avenue Interior Design of Los Angeles, our 300-square-foot standard king guest room — overlooking Denver’s circa 1933 Benjamin Moore factory neon sign — was a victim of latter day design clichés: a sliding barn door to the bathroom, a button-tufted ottoman, a treacly framed compass. The minibar was a bit of a misnomer, as it held 375 milliliter bottles — nearly a pint — of liquor, which seemed excessive for the average traveler and not carry-on approved by the T.S.A.; options included Tito’s vodka ($20) and Basil Hayden’s bourbon ($28). Still, I loved the soft antique Persian rug on the hickory flooring, the Prussian blue walls, the scroll arm chairs in the window-front sitting area, and the Victrola Bluetooth gramophone speaker. There was a French press with fresh grounds from the Denver roaster Middle State Coffee."
1961,"My inner Dolly Parton appreciated that the 64-square-foot bathroom included a glam station: a Hollywood vanity mirror surrounded by 15 frosted light bulbs. But as someone who is also a nonagenarian on the inside, I must point out that the sleek glass shower enclosure, with brass Waterworks fixtures, left a puddle of water on the porcelain tile floor. There was no bathtub, which I wasn’t missing in this often drought-parched state. The rosemary mint toiletries, custom blended for the hotel, smelled absolutely delicious."
1962,"Beyond valet parking and a 200-square-foot cardio room fitted with a Precor elliptical, free weights and two treadmills, there were very few extracurricular amenities at the Ramble. I can only assume that some guests were there to carouse. Wi-Fi is free and fast, and you can stream your Netflix and other accounts to the TV. The hotel recently installed iPads in every room for communicating with staff, which was wise — the rooms don’t have phones, and my own iPhone had no service in the room."
1963,"After I booked the room, a confirmation email from the hotel urged me to make a reservation at Death & Co posthaste. The scene-y herringbone-floored, chandelier-lit lobby bar warranted the precaution. I ordered the Mondrian cocktail — with blanco tequila, raspberry, aperitivo, egg white and sparkling wine — which tasted like a melted Popsicle, and, given the late afternoon hour and my near heat exhaustion, I actually liked. We had dinner at Super Mega Bien, the on-site Latin American dim sum restaurant by Dana Rodriguez, a James Beard Award-nominated chef. Exquisite dishes included chipotle honey-roasted duck served with stout housemade flour gorditas and goat cheese stuffed fried squash blossoms. "
1964,"Although families with children might want to book elsewhere, the Ramble Hotel is a perfect den for those hoping to experience a sliver of Denver’s 19th-century reputation as the party-opolis of the Wild West."

1967,"A 6-year-old boy was playing on a farm when he cut his forehead, a laceration that was simple enough to tend to at home."
1968,"But six days later, his parents realized something was seriously wrong: He was clenching his jaw, having trouble breathing and experiencing involuntary muscle spasms."
1969,"The boy, who had not received vaccinations, was taken to Oregon Health & Science University and was found to have tetanus, the state’s first documented pediatric case of the disease in more than 30 years, according to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
1970,"The case, from 2017, was chronicled this week in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. It quickly leapt to the top of the report’s list of most-viewed articles and generated much discussion online."
1971,"The article described a harrowing recovery and offered a warning of the dangers associated with the preventable disease: The boy spent 57 days in the hospital and racked up medical bills of more than $800,000."
1972,"“I honestly never thought I would see this disease in the United States,” said Dr. Judith A. Guzman-Cottrill, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Oregon Health & Science University, who helped care for the boy and was the lead author of the article."
1973,"She said she never wanted to see it again. “It was difficult — for many of us — to see him suffer,” she said on Saturday."
1974,"The article came amid continuing tensions over vaccinations in the United States, which is experiencing a measles outbreak, with a concentration in the Pacific Northwest. Oregon has one of the highest rates of unvaccinated residents in the country, with 7.5 percent of kindergarten-age children unvaccinated for nonmedical reasons, according to the C.D.C."
1975,"This month, a teenager who defied his mother’s antivaccine beliefs and started getting shots when he turned 18 testified before Congress about the importance of countering fraudulent claims about vaccines. This week, Facebook announced its first policy to combat misinformation about vaccines, following in the footsteps of Pinterest and YouTube."
1976,"Parents who do not vaccinate their children have expressed worries about side effects, concerns over cost, moral or religious objections, and fears that vaccines lead to autism — an idea that has been widely debunked."
1977,But health experts say a resistance or refusal to vaccinate can raise the chances of an outbreak by putting at risk people who cannot be immunized for medical reasons. The World Health Organization identified “vaccine hesitancy” as one of this year’s 10 notable threats to global health.
1978,"Tetanus, a life-threatening disease that is transmitted through open wounds and causes painful muscle spasms, declined drastically in the United States after the introduction of a vaccine in the 1940s. A series of shots are recommended in infancy and childhood, as well as at certain other times throughout life."
1979,"Today, the disease occurs “almost exclusively” in people who have not been vaccinated or who have been undervaccinated, another article in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report said last year."
1980,"In Oregon, the boy, who was not identified, had not received any immunizations, Dr. Guzman-Cottrill said."
1981,"When he arrived at the hospital, he was alert and asked for water, but could not open his mouth. Doctors gave him medicine, including an initial vaccine for tetanus, known as DTaP, according to the article. But his condition was perilous. He spent more than a month on a ventilator, the article said."
1982,"He also stayed in a darkened room for weeks, where he wore earplugs and was exposed to little stimulation to avoid making his spasms worse, Dr. Guzman-Cottrill said. His pain was so bad, she said, that doctors took care not to trigger him even with their voices. “We had to whisper,” she said."
1983,"After his hospitalization, he was moved to a rehabilitation center, where he stayed for 17 days. Finally, a month after his inpatient rehabilitation, he was well enough to return to normal activities, including running and biking."
1984,"The pain that he experienced was difficult for Dr. Guzman-Cottrill to forget. She said doctors worked with the C.D.C. to publish the case report to raise awareness, with the hope that a similar case will not happen again."
1985,"“When you see someone suffer from this disease, you completely understand why we immunize,” she said, adding, “This should never happen in our country.”"
1986,"Still, the experience did not change the position of the boy’s parents."
1987,"When the time came for his second round of DTaP, doctors talked with the family about the need for vaccinations. Surviving tetanus, unlike some other diseases, does not offer immunity in the future."
1988,"But despite an “extensive review” of the risks, and the benefits of vaccination, the article said, the family declined the second vaccination — or any other recommended immunization."
1989,"Gillian Freeman, a British writer whose claims to fame included a 1961 novel about a marriage threatened by a homosexual attraction and a fictional diary of a woman in Nazi Germany, died on Feb. 23 in London. She was 89."
1990,Her daughter Harriet Thorpe said the cause was complications of dementia.
1991,"Ms. Freeman, who also wrote screenplays and scenarios for ballets including Kenneth MacMillan’s “Mayerling,” published her first novel, “The Liberty Man,” in 1955. Like many of her subsequent books, it dealt with social and sexual distress, in this case a relationship between a middle-class teacher and a sailor of nebulous sexuality."
1992,"Homosexuality came into play more directly in “The Leather Boys,” her 1961 story of a heterosexual couple who marry too young and soon find their relationship in jeopardy, in part because the husband develops a close bond with a male biker."
1993,"The novel was published under the cheeky pen name Eliot George, but three years later, when Ms. Freeman wrote the screenplay for a film of the same title, she used her real name. (The opening credits said Ms. Freeman’s screenplay was based on the novel by Eliot George.)"
1994,"Assessing the book and film in 2015 for The Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Richard Canning wrote, “ ‘The Leather Boys’ was and remains groundbreaking.”"
1995,"The book and, more so, the movie, he said, “made a pitch for the normality of male homosexuality, offering one of the first portrayals of it between working-class characters.”"
1996,"In 1978 Ms. Freeman and her publisher, Anthony Blond, came up with “Nazi Lady: The Diaries of Elisabeth von Stahlenberg, 1933-1948,” which purported to be the daily accounts of a woman trying to climb the social ladder in Nazi Germany. The book, as Mr. Blond recounted the tale in his 2004 memoir, “Jew Made in England,” was at first published with a generic-looking vintage photograph on the cover and no sign of Ms. Freeman’s name. Some people, he wrote, took it for a real diary."
1997,"“A nice buzz was beginning to generate,” he wrote, “the book started to sell — then pop! — The Evening Standard revealed that Elisabeth only existed in the agile mind of Gillian Freeman.”"
1998,"He added, “Though we never stated that Elisabeth von Stahlenberg was ever real — people just wanted her to be — the book was damned a hoax.”"
1999,It was still fooling at least some people a quarter-century later.
2000,"“Red faces at Canongate, which has just published a handsome anthology of war diarists, ‘The Secret Annexe,’ edited by Irene and Alan Taylor,” the British magazine The Bookseller reported in 2004. “The book includes an extract from ‘Nazi Lady: The Diaries of Elisabeth von Stahlenberg, published in 1978 (Blond & Briggs). Nothing unusual there, until we remember that the book was a work of fiction.”"
2001,"Gillian Freeman was born on Dec. 5, 1929, in London. Her father, Jack, was a doctor, and her mother, Freda (Davids) Freeman, was a homemaker."
2002,"Ms. Freeman graduated from the University of Reading in 1951 and had various jobs, including copywriter and schoolteacher, before Mr. Blond, trying to build a career as a literary agent, secured publication of “The Liberty Man.” That book was followed by “Fall of Innocence” in 1956 and “Jack Would Be a Gentleman” in 1959."
2003,"“I have always been concerned with the problems of the individual seen in relation to society and the personal pressures brought to bear because of moral, political or social conditions and the inability to conform,” Ms. Freeman wrote in an autobiographical essay. “This is reflected in all my work to date, although I have never set out to propound themes, only to tell stories.”"
2004,"After “The Leather Boys” came “The Leader” (1965), a fictional tale of neo-Nazism in England, and “The Alabaster Egg” (1970), a historical novel, among other books."
2005,"“Nazi Lady,” the 1978 diary, was quickly republished as “The Confessions of Elisabeth von S.,” with Ms. Freeman’s name on the cover as author. Once it was clearly labeled a work of fiction, it drew mixed reaction."
2006,"“I was irresistibly reminded of the line in the loopy Mel Brooks-Zero Mostel movie, ‘The Producers,’ in which the crazed author of the musical comedy ‘Springtime for Hitler’ says, with earnest dignity, ‘It is not generally known, but the Führer was a marvelous dancer,’ ” Penny Pinkham wrote in a review in The Boston Globe in October 1978. “Freeman, though, is not as reliably in control of her comic effects as Brooks is of his.”"
2007,"That same year, Ms. Freeman collaborated with Mr. MacMillan on “Mayerling,” a ballet based on a historical incident involving the crown prince of Austria. She worked with Mr. MacMillan again in 1981 on his ballet “Isadora,” about Isadora Duncan."
2008,"Ms. Freeman also wrote several screenplays in addition to the one for “The Leather Boys,” including “That Cold Day in the Park” (1969), an early Robert Altman film, for which she adapted a novel by Peter Miles."
2009,"In addition to her daughter Harriet, an actress, she is survived by her husband, Edward Thorpe; another daughter, Matilda Thorpe, also an actress; and five grandchildren."

2055,Dear Diary:
2056,There is a lonely ginkgo tree on Fifth Avenue between 38th and 39th Streets. Its branches catch the sun on the east side of the street facing Lord & Taylor’s well-worn facade.
2057,"Set at the edge of the hard-packed soil at the base of the tree is a golden plaque honoring Dorothy Shaver, the first female president of a major American department store. As a native New Yorker, I have a strong sentimental attachment to that store, and to that plaque."
2058,Lord & Taylor was the eastern anchor of what was once a thriving garment center. The blossoming of its gracious windows every Wednesday was treated like a Broadway opening.
2059,It was also the first store to pluck American designers from obscurity. I know this because I was one of those designers.
2060,"Over the years Lord & Taylor has lost much of its well-earned luster. But for me, it has remained a comforting friend. I walk past it every day on my way to my office, watching as it slips slowly into obscurity."
2061,"Now, that great institution is closing its doors. Those glorious windows will be shuttered and that lonely ginkgo tree will face the challenge of a new era."
2062,"Most of all, the shiny plaque honoring that forgotten woman will be on its own. Not totally though. As long as I am around, it will be pampered and polished."

2066,"Robin Arzón is a fitness instructor, but that label undersells her star power. She works at Peloton, a New York start-up that sells $2,245 bikes and $4,295 treadmills and streams live exercise classes to their internet-connected screens. Peloton prefers to call instructors like Ms. Arzón “talent” — because they are. From personal experience struggling through her classes, I can attest that Ms. Arzón is more like a cult leader than a coach; having weighed the options, I would rather die from cycling too fast than disappoint her. The company, which has sold 450,000 pieces of exercise equipment and may go public this year, last raised capital at a valuation of $4 billion. Some inestimable chunk of that is tied to Ms. Arzón."
2067,"Part of her draw is a slate of catchphrases. “What’s six intervals” — of horrifically fast pedaling up the equivalent of a mountain — “to a queen?” she yells during class. “That little bit of panic that sets in,” she chirps, “that just means you care!” Her Instagram following tops 200,000, and the company says each of her workout sessions is taken 15,000 times."
2068,"When Ms. Arzón, 37, whose official title is vice president of fitness programming, is not teaching or vigorously hydrating, she is also an Adidas brand ambassador and an author. Her book, a New York Times best seller, is “Shut Up and Run.” This month, I spent a week trying to keep up with her via text message."
2069,"6:05 a.m. Make and guzzle H2O cocktail: room-temperature filtered water, dash of sea salt, quarter lemon, splash of apple cider vinegar. I don’t drink coffee, ever. I immediately feel replenished and energized. "
2070,"6:30 a.m. Twenty-minute Vedic meditation. The second bedroom in my apartment is a Zen den with a plant wall, a small desk, books and cushions for meditation. "
2071,"7 a.m. Cup of Onnit King Tea (Kenyan purple blend). I drink three or four cups of tea a day, ranging from matcha to herbal varieties. I spend the next 90 minutes on emails, reviewing my schedule, and get the most important messages out of the way. I really try to “eat the frog” with my most difficult task during this time so I can feel freer later in the day."
2072,"I’m also multitasking by researching new music to play in class. I have over 1,000 Spotify playlists saved, organized by themes such as beat, mood, genre, running, spinning, lifting. "
2073,"8 a.m. My husband and I have a 17-ingredient smoothie for breakfast. He created this monster smoothie, which is a staple of my day. Ingredients: vegan protein powder, magnesium, Athletic Greens, aloe vera, chlorophyll, glutamine, B.C.A.A.s, fresh kale/spinach, matcha powder, baobab, maca, nut butter, cacao nibs, chia seeds, moringa, water, ice. I have no idea how many calories are in this, and I don’t care. "
2074,"8:50 a.m. Pick my looks. Between multiple workouts and being in front of the camera a few times during the day, I often have to style and pack two to five looks a day. Today I pack three outfits, including body wipes and on-the-go products to efficiently change in between meetings and workouts. "
2075,"9 a.m. Pack all the snacks and all the food. I’m vegan, and I consume a lot of food to get me through the day. Today I’m bringing almonds, a Vega bar, an Athletic Greens packet (which I throw into a water bottle), Nuun tablets and a banana. I’ll probably eat all of that before lunch."
2076,"9:30 a.m. Do my own workout at a private training facility. I dedicate five to seven hours a week to strength, conditioning and running on my own. Nothing keeps you raw like picking up heavy things."
2077,"10:27 a.m. Lungs are burning so badly from my workout, it feels like I ingested fire. Quick shower and outfit change: I’m the master of being ready in under seven minutes. My hair is currently in braids, which marries style and efficiency."
2078,"10:42 a.m. Uber to Tread studio listening to “Nice for What,” by Drake."
2079,11 a.m. Weekly senior staff meeting with Peloton’s chief content officer. I am snacking and hydrating. I drink more than a gallon of water a day.
2080,1:40 p.m. Uber home while listening to music and making my playlist for my ’90s Pop Run tonight.
2081,"2 p.m. Continue researching music, making playlist for tonight, writing detailed class notes and creating the class plan. Each class playlist and class plan takes up to two hours of preparation. Peloton instructors are part D.J., part coach, part training partner. The class notes detail the workout, the songs, the exact timing of every part of the workout from warm-up to cool-down. There’s an art to it, just like a composer at an orchestra."
2082,"5 p.m. Check my blood sugar. I’m a Type 1 diabetic, so I’ve been checking it once an hour all day. I also adjust my insulin depending on how I’m moving and what I’m consuming throughout the day."
2083,"5:30 p.m. Showtime: 45 minutes of ’90s jams fuel the run on the Peloton Tread. After class, take photos with Peloton members and answer some of the 300 comments on my Facebook and Instagram posts today."
2084,"7 p.m. Quick second shower, and then eat all the food. I’m hangry by this point. I cook most of my meals, but tonight it’s a veggie tofu curry with brown rice that’s left over from Sunday dinner."
2085,"8 p.m. Watch “The Bachelor,” unapologetically. The physical energy expenditure from coaching while working out is obvious, but the psychic drain is very real. I need something at this point that demands absolutely nothing. "
2086,"10 p.m. Bed. I’m in bed by this time every night, even on the weekend. Maybe 10 minutes of reading before I pass out. I just started “Brave, Not Perfect,” by Reshma Saujani. We are both former lawyers, and I love a good reinvention story."
2087,"7 a.m. Wake up. I aim for nine hours a night religiously, and it’s the reason I have no social life."
2088,8 a.m. Do my own workout. Don’t bother showering because I’m running again in an hour and a half. I just use a baby wipe and keep it moving.
2089,10:30 a.m. Record Pop Fun Run and a marathon race prep class for 90 minutes.
2090,"Noon My hair stylist, Tiffanie, is meeting me now to do my braids. I get my hair done once or twice a week."
2091,"12:20 p.m. Review offers for branded sponsorships that came in to my agent, William Morris Entertainment. “Robinnyc” (my Instagram and Twitter name) is a brand within itself, so I’m always aware of that."
2092,"3 p.m. Physical therapy session. I get P.T. or acupuncture every week. I really train, fuel and recover like a high-level athlete."
2093,5:30 p.m. Peloton cycling class for 45 minutes. My ride tonight was bought out by PwC.
2094,"6:55 p.m. Stuck in traffic with a chatty Uber driver. I need to eat right now before I jump out of this vehicle. There’s no desire for small talk after performing in front of people all day. I’m an introvert by nature, actually. I once heard Amy Schumer describe her “outgoing persona” vs. an “introverted energy system” on “Oprah” and thought, “Aah, that’s me.”"
2095,"It’s an interesting job, to work out in front of a camera. There’s no room for an off day when you’re the source of energy, instruction and entertainment."
2096,"6:47 a.m. Pack for a Denver speaking engagement with the Integer Group, a marketing agency."
2097,"8 a.m. Work out. Pro athletes don’t only work out during a game. I train like a pro to be able to teach. It requires being able to host a show, coach and work out."
2098,"12:30 p.m. Two-hour meeting with all treadmill instructors. We are workshopping ways to keep content fresh. We discuss everything from social media activations, music themes, combo movements, loading variations, tempo and proprioception."
2099,4:30 p.m. Teach two cycling classes for a total of 40 minutes. Powerful energy in those riders.
2100,"7:16 p.m. Board a plane to Denver. I love flying. I almost never do work on flights and consider it a mini-vacation to read and listen to podcasts. I listen to Joe Rogan, Tim Ferris, “Modern Love,” “Stuff You Should Know,” Oprah and “GaryVee.”"
2101,"6 a.m. Gym for an hour. My days “off” are Thursday and Sunday, but I always have shoots and speaking engagements on Thursdays because they won’t disrupt my teaching schedule."
2102,"7:50 a.m. Avocado toast for breakfast. Half my carry-on is food (salad, noodles, trail mix, bars). If I’m in a pinch and there’s nothing healthy, I eat oatmeal, which most hotels have. I also travel with Greens powder, a great nutrient boost. I refuse to eat like crap or I will have no energy."
2103,10 a.m. Give my speech.
2104,11:08 a.m. Off to the airport while working on social media for Adidas’s “She Breaks Barriers” campaign.
2105,"12:30 p.m. In the airport, I am stopped by five different Peloton members. I love those interactions. People are so excited, and it’s palpable to feel the impact we have being in their homes. One time, someone took a photo of my shopping cart at Whole Foods, and that was odd, but it’s been mostly positive encounters. Even dogs and babies know and respond to our voices."
2106,"4:25 p.m. On the plane, reviewing the weekly report that distills all of our workout data. Similar to a TV network, we look at the numbers and see what’s trending: What do our members want more or less of, exhibited by workouts taken daily/monthly/yearly."
2107,"5:31 p.m. Just found out Shonda Rhimes is following me on Instagram. I very much love her work (ethic), so that’s a nice surprise."
2108,"8:47 p.m. Back home in Manhattan. Soup, salad and bed. I’m totally drained!"
2109,"7 a.m. Make a full breakfast of tofu scramble and avocado toast while I look over instructor audition videos. It’s a small bull’s-eye that we are looking for. Peloton instructors need to be fitness experts but also be able to essentially host a live TV show while working out. It’s definitely not an open casting call, and never will be."
2110,"1:30 p.m. Teach a women’s history cycling ride. People flew in from Kansas, Hawaii and Alaska to take it in person. One woman told me the bike saved her marriage because she and her partner now have a common hobby."
2111,"4:30 p.m. Meet with my producer. Every instructor has a producer to watch, review and plan his or her content, marketing and social media for Peloton."
2112,7:30 p.m. Make jackfruit taco bowls for dinner. Friday night ritual is a movie with husband. Tonight it’s “Free Solo.” I’m a sucker for athletic feats — shocker.
2113,Interviews are condensed and edited.
2114,To the Editor:
2115,"Re “The Joy of Being a Woman in Her 70s,” by Mary Pipher (Sunday Review, Jan. 13):"
2116,"Kudos to Ms. Pipher for writing about women in their 70s. However, I was disappointed that she did not mention the sadness that women feel when the mirror no longer recognizes the pretty young woman who used to stare back; the frustration of being afraid to drive in the dark any longer; the fear of going out in the snow when we used to ski down mountains; and so much more."
2117,These are not discussed daily but perhaps shared from time to time with contemporaries. How do I know this? I am 76 years old and happily married with children and grandchildren. I have friends who have become family; I have a laugh every day and have wonderful conversations with my husband. Life is good.
2118,But I miss the woman I used to be.
2119,"Leanna McEvoyFort Lee, N.J. "
2120,To the Editor:
2121,"Thanks for this great article. I went on a bicycle ride cross-country with WomanTours to celebrate my 75th year, and there were eight of us ladies over 70 on the ride. We all finished biking in the rain to dip our front wheels into the Atlantic. Our back wheels had been baptized in the Pacific three months earlier. "
2122,"You need to accept change to grow older happily. Yes, I have wrinkles and my silhouette is definitely larger than it was. But I can still walk and talk and laugh, and enjoy children and grandchildren as people who have minds and lives of their own."
2123,"I’ve told them that when I can’t go out and enjoy a drink and laugh, my time will have come. "
2124,Evelyn KayeSan Diego
2125,To the Editor:
2126,"I’m fortunate to be one of the women Mary Pipher writes about, surrounded by friends who also fit her description. We are happy, vibrant and resilient, having withstood emotional and physical challenges and personal loss. "
2127,"What we also have in common is that we are educated and reaped benefits from our inheritances and/or careers. Some of us grew up poor, but we enjoy more comforts in life than our childhood offered or that our parents ever had, and we are grateful."
2128,"But what of our sisters who grew up poor, or who became poor later, because of racism, sexism, ageism and other inequities? They are resilient women who may suffer from poor health, lack of employment and affordable housing, social isolation, and the rising cost of living."
2129,What is our society doing to address these inequities to enable all to be vital and kicking as we age into our 70s and beyond?
2130,"Isabelle SchoenfeldBethesda, Md.The writer is former chairwoman of the Commission on Aging in Montgomery County."
2131,To the Editor:
2132,Mary Pipher writes insightfully about the upside of being a woman in her 70s. I would add that the challenges increase as the decade passes. My peers and I are finding joy more elusive in our early 80s.
2133,"Judy KugelCambridge, Mass.The writer is the author of “70-Something: Life, Love and Limits in the Bonus Years.”"
2134,To the Editor:
2135,"I just turned 73 and was drawn to Mary Pipher’s article. As I read each compelling paragraph, I began to realize that there really is so little difference in being a man or woman as we travel through the vicissitudes of life. If the gender in her article were changed to “men” as opposed to “women,” practically all the descriptions would still apply."
2136,"Older men can be considered useless, be resilient, have empathy, suffer, grow, appreciate humor, love and beauty, and be grateful. We can choose, experience bliss, enjoy activities with friends and be kind to ourselves when we once were less likely to do so."
2137,We are capable of knowing the joy of long marriages and friendships and of maybe finally knowing who we are.

2140,"A decade ago, Matt and Mary Vetro moved from Long Beach, N.Y., to Massapequa Park, on the South Shore of Long Island, where they paid $390,000 for a 1,500-square-foot Cape Cod-style house, with four bedrooms and two bathrooms, on a 60-by-100-foot lot. "
2141,"“It was a perfect starter house for us,” said Mr. Vetro, now 39, who works in information technology sales. He and Ms. Vetro, 40, a high school teacher, both grew up in Merrick, N.Y., about five miles west, and they were determined to stay on the South Shore. They looked at homes from Merrick to Massapequa. Ultimately, lower taxes in Massapequa Park, a village of 17,000 in the town of Oyster Bay, clinched the deal."

2181,"Since then, they have had three children — now 9, 6 and 2 — and finished the basement. Recently, however, they decided they needed “a bigger house to spread out a little,” but they wanted to stay in the village."
2182,"“Quite honestly, we love it here,” Mr. Vetro said. The neighborhood and McKenna Elementary School, which two of their children attend, “made it hard to leave.”"
2183,"In December, the Vetros went into contract on a fully renovated, 3,000-square-foot colonial house, with five bedrooms and three bathrooms, less than half a mile away, for about $800,000. Then they listed their Cape Cod for $489,000, and were in contract for $479,000 within three weeks."
2184,"“The town is perfect, a great socioeconomic community for my socioeconomic status,” Mr. Vetro said, though he lamented the lack of diversity. “There are a ton of parks, which make it very appealing.”"
2185,"The Vetros’ new house is a block from the Massapequa Preserve, a 432-acre park with walking, running and biking trails, and Mansfield Park, where there are trails, soccer fields and baseball diamonds. In Massapequa Park, Mr. Vetro said, sports — from Little League to the Police Activity League and Massapequa Mustangs youth football — are taken “very seriously.”"
2186,"Add to that a downtown with a burgeoning restaurant and bar scene that appeals to a younger crowd that lives within walking distance, and there is much to recommend this amenity-rich, homey village in the midst of suburban sprawl."
2187,"“There really is a ‘village’ feel, a real community,” said Dina Santorelli, a 20-year resident, who raised three children in Massapequa Park with her husband, Thomas Rhein, a former captain with Rescue Company 3 of the Massapequa Fire District. “From the Turkey Trot around Thanksgiving to the Christmas tree lighting to the annual fireworks at Walker Park every Fourth of July, there really is that old-time, best-of-Long-Island-days-gone-by sense here. Friendly people, good neighbors.”"
2188,"Driving around the village, “it’s not uncommon to see people renovating their homes, putting on extensions, new roofs, new siding and new fences,” said Ms. Santorelli, 50, a novelist whose “Baby Grand” trilogy includes a scene in Brady Park, which has a tournament-grade Little League field, a trio of picnic areas overlooking a trout-stocked lake and a community center."
2189,"Patricia Birney, 61, downsized from a five-bedroom house in neighboring Massapequa, which she sold for $565,000, to a three-bedroom home in the village that she bought for $505,000 last summer. The upkeep is less expensive and the taxes are lower, but also, “in this neighborhood there are kids playing all the time,” said Ms. Birney, whose children are grown and out of the house. “It’s like a small town. It was a good move.”"
2190,"The village of Massapequa Park is 2.2 square miles, on the southeastern edge of Nassau County. Bordered by the Southern State Parkway to the north and South Oyster Bay to the south, the village cuts a rectangular swath through the unincorporated areas of the Massapequas."
2191,"Sunrise Highway plows a four-lane, east-west path through the village, bracketed on the north by the elevated Long Island Rail Road tracks and commercial ventures to the south."
2192,"The village center runs north from the train station along Park Boulevard, with a pocket-size village square and a stretch of blocks lined with shops and restaurants. Village Hall is around the corner on Front Street."
2193,"Merrick Road, the other main east-west artery, is home to Massapequa High School’s main campus, the Southgate shopping center, churches, stores, restaurants and the 52-acre John J. Burns Park, with its tennis courts, playing fields and summer concert series."
2194,"A branch of the Massapequa library is at the corner of Harbor Lane. Across the road are the Southgate condominiums, one of the village’s few condo complexes."
2195,"Homes between the two thoroughfares include Cape Cods, ranch houses, English Tudors, colonials and craftsman-style dwellings with porches, most on 60-by-100-foot lots. There are also “dozens of knockdowns,” said Elaine Patterson, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate, many of them replaced by two-story houses in the last six years. Builders have targeted the area because homes there aren’t subject to the restrictions that were placed on property below Merrick Road after Hurricane Sandy, Ms. Patterson said."
2196,"South of Merrick Road, in Bar Harbor, waterfront homes sit high on quarter-acre lots with direct views of South Oyster Bay. Some have docks; others have canals with bulkheads running along the edge of their backyards, where boats are kept."
2197,"At the end of Whitewood Drive, Colleran Park, a quiet green space with a playground, also overlooks the bay."
2198,"As of Jan. 24, there were 52 houses on the market, from a three-bedroom, two-bathroom 1961 ranch house for $339,900 to a renovated 2004 house with five bedrooms, four full and two half bathrooms, and a dock on South Oyster Bay, for $2.499 million."
2199,"Starter homes — expanded Capes priced from $450,000 to $600,000 — “fly off the shelf,” Ms. Patterson said, with multiple bids on homes up to $700,000. North of Merrick Road, new homes replacing knockdowns can fetch over $800,000."
2200,"About a quarter of buyers are downsizing; the rest are first-time homeowners or locals who want larger homes or to be on the water, she said."
2201,"Last year, 185 properties sold, at an average price of $534,517; the average time on the market was 59 days. Sales prices increased 21 percent from 2017 to 2018, said John Succoso, manager of the Douglas Elliman office in Massapequa."
2202,"Jeffrey Bigay, an associate broker at Signature Premier Properties, said buyers have a wide range of options, from pricey waterfront homes in the Bar Harbor enclave to more moderately priced Cameo townhouses near the Southern State Parkway. “If someone is not looking to spend $830,000, they can spend $450,00 to $500,000,” Mr. Bigay said, adding that there is a “nice diversity” among the residents. “They could be police officers, they could work on Wall Street.”"
2203,"Along Park Boulevard, in the heart of the village, residents can visit the dry cleaners, the post office, the hardware store, nail salons, the Bestever Bakery and doctors in the medical building, stopping for lunch at the Good Life, an English-style pub, or Umberto’s pizza."
2204,"“We are seeing more and more restaurants coming in,” said Jamie E. Bogenshutz, president of the Massapequa Chamber of Commerce. “For a downtown kind of feeling, that is the place to go.”"
2205,"On weekdays, locals savor cinnamon-bun French toast for breakfast at Jam; Brie blueberry thyme pancakes and champagne also entice weekend brunchers. For dinner, they walk to Bacaro for Italian fare, and the Tap Room or Johnny McGorey’s Pub for food and musical entertainment."
2206,"“They really revitalized that area,” said Rebecca Berna, a 15-year resident. “You can hang out at night. You don’t need to leave Massapequa if you don’t want to.”"
2207,"Around the corner on Front Street, near the train station, Massapequa Perk is a popular coffee spot. Come warmer weather, the line for Ralph’s Italian Ices stretches out the door, with children perched on benches or their bikes."
2208,"About 7,400 students are enrolled in the Massapequa Union Free School District. Six elementary schools — Unqua, McKenna, Lockhart, Fairfield, East Lake and Birch Lane — serve students in kindergarten through fifth grade. McKenna serves students in sixth grade as well. "
2209,"Berner Middle School covers sixth, seventh and eighth grades. Massapequa High School’s main campus has about 1,700 students in grades 10 through 12. About 575 ninth graders study at Massapequa High School’s Ames campus."
2210,Mean SAT scores for the class of 2018 were 567 in reading and writing and 571 in math; statewide equivalents were 534 and 534.
2211,Some students who live in the northern part of Massapequa Park attend schools in the neighboring Farmingdale district.
2212,"Rush-hour trains from the Massapequa Park station on the Babylon Branch of the Long Island Rail Road take 54 to 59 minutes, some requiring a transfer at Jamaica. A monthly pass is $297."
2213,"The drive along the Southern State Parkway and the Long Island Expressway to Midtown Manhattan takes about an hour and 10 minutes, depending on traffic."
2214,"In the 1920s, real estate developers Michael J. Brady, Peter F. Colleran and Frank Cryan bought land in Massapequa, expecting Robert Moses to build a road to a beach on a barrier island off Long Island. When the stock-market crash nixed those plans, they began to build, using Sears kit houses, said William Colfer, first vice president of the Historical Society of the Massapequas. “For the most part, they advertised English Tudor homes,” he said, but they also built colonials, Capes and ranches."
2215,"In 1931, to keep local control of building lots and zoning laws, the village of Massapequa Park was incorporated. Mr. Colleran became the first mayor; Mr. Cryan and Mr. Brady were the first two judges. "

2217,"Danes see potential in unlikely places. In Copenhagen, a city that cultivated a worldwide gastronomic movement from the ostensibly meager bounty of the Nordic landscape, the latest local hot spot is a decaying former shipyard."
2218,"Refshaleoen, in the city’s northeastern docklands, is a heavily industrial area that once housed one of Europe’s largest shipbuilding operations. When the shipyards closed decades ago, many of the hulking warehouses and factory buildings were left deserted."
2219,"“So many of my colleagues in the city, when I told them that we were going to open up out here, they said to me, ‘You’re crazy. It’s so far away, it’s so far away. No one’s going to go,’” said Matt Orlando, the former head chef at Noma who left to open his own outstanding restaurant, Amass, in Refshaleoen in 2013. (In 2018, Noma itself opened its much-anticipated new location minutes away.)"
2220,"“Five years ago, it was a place where, at night, really weird things would go on,” Mr. Orlando recalled of the early days, when the restaurant’s large dining room windows offered guests views of both the adjacent garden and occasional illicit drug use."
2221,"“It was kind of this forgotten-about corner of Copenhagen,” he said. “This untapped, raw piece of Copenhagen that still exists in the central part of the city.”"
2222,"“It’s dramatically different now. There’s so many people out here,” he continued, mentioning the artisanal bakery Lille, which opened last May, and La Banchina, a waterside cafe and restaurant with a private sauna and an idyllic pier where locals sip natural wine on sunny days. And in January, in a soaring industrial space near Amass, Mr. Orlando opened Broaden & Build, a craft brewery and casual restaurant with picnic tables, color-splashed walls and seasonal dishes."
2223,"“It’s still really raw and rough,” he said, comparing the area to Brooklyn’s Red Hook neighborhood, with its faded shipyard grandeur. “The way it’s changed mostly is that all of the buildings out here, all these warehouses and small little nooks and crannies are now occupied by people with businesses.”"
2224,"One of the most ambitious new residents is Reffen, a roughly 50,000-square-foot, outdoor food market (formerly called Copenhagen Street Food) with more than 40 vendors that relocated to Refshaleoen last summer after a successful stint on Papiroen, an inner-city island now being redeveloped. The market will reopen for the season on March 29."
2225,"“It has without a doubt brought a whole new burst of energy to the island, and exposed what is out here to the general public,” Mr. Orlando said of Reffen, which was constructed from old shipping containers on a dusty harborside lot surrounded by dilapidated warehouses."
2226,"Another new tenant (and fellow Papiroen transplant) is Copenhagen Contemporary, an exciting art center that opened last June and exhibits the work of international contemporary artists, including Doug Aitken and the Danish trio Superflex."
2227,"“It’s 15 minutes on a bike from central Copenhagen,” said the director, Marie Nipper, who previously worked at the Tate Liverpool. “The distances in Copenhagen are so small, but in a Danish context it’s kind of far outside of the city because it hasn’t been part of that daily routine before.”"
2228,"“The space that we’re in is the old welding hall where they used to weld some of the larger parts of the ship,” she said, noting that the monumental size of the building is ideal for large-scale installations, such as a collapsing forest by the Swiss artist Claudia Comte (through Sept. 1). “It was really the perfect location for us.”"

2249,"Another major draw is Mikkeller Baghaven, a barrel-aging operation, beer garden and tasting room in a former workshop next to Reffen."
2250,"“Everything that we make here incorporates wild yeasts and bacteria that we’ve isolated from this area, Refshaleoen, or Denmark, in general,” Ehren Schmidt, the master blender and brewer, said. This means Baghaven uses, for example, strains from wild blackberries and apples off a nearby tree to produce its spontaneously fermented beers, saisons and wild ales, many in limited-edition batches, which are often available only on site."
2251,"“If you’re coming out here, you’re coming because you want a different experience,” he said. “It’s this kind of industrial, kind of post-apocalyptic vibe out here. Everything’s in containers, it’s kind of anything goes, so to speak.”"
2252,"On his first visit to the waterside site two years ago, Mr. Schmidt said, “I remember at the time thinking, ‘Wow, it’s kind of like the wild West out here.’ It’s definitely evolved since then.”"
2253,"“Now the island is a destination for Copenhageners as a cool place to hang out,” Mr. Orlando said, particularly as spring approaches and sun-starved Scandinavians eagerly venture outdoors again. “The more people out here, the better.”"

2255,"Good Sunday morning, and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing, where we’ll take a deep dive into Lyft’s upcoming public offering. It’s the first of many decacorns about to go public. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)"
2256,Lyft plans to make its public market debut in the coming week. The car sharing company’s I.P.O. will be the first of many highly valued tech companies that are expected to hit American stock exchanges this year.
2257,"Uber, Slack, Postmates and Pinterest have all filed documents with the S.E.C. to list shares. Palantir, Peloton and possibly Airbnb are expected to follow later this year."
2258,America’s most successful start-ups have remained off-limits to most investors for years:
2259,• Venture capital cash allowed America’s current wave of unicorns to eschew the public markets — and the spotlight that comes with them.
2260,• That means a large portion of investors have been unable to buy a slice of the fastest-growing start-ups.
2261,"With Lyft’s I.P.O., that’s about to change, which explains much of the excitement it is generating. Here’s your cheat sheet for the offering."
2262,____________________________
2263,Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in New York and edited by Jamie Condliffe in London.
2264,____________________________
2265,"Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. In 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer renamed the company Lyft and shifted the business toward providing short trips, mimicking taxi rides."
2266,Here’s how it sizes up today:
2267,"• Lyft gave 18.6 million people at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016."
2268,"• It has a 39 percent share of the United States ride-sharing market,  based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft. That is up from 22 percent in 2016. But Lyft has been offering discounts to riders ahead of its offering, and the company warned: “We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives.”"
2269,"• Lyft only operates in the U.S. and Canada, unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe."
2270,"• But it has matched its rival’s innovation, by developing self-driving car technology and expanding into short-term bike and scooter rentals."
2271,"Lyft will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of, er, “LYFT.”"
2272,"The company expects to be valued at as much as $23 billion. It plans to sell about 35.4 million shares, including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters, at between $62 to $68 a piece. At the high-end of that range, it will raise $2.4 billion."
2273,That’s well above the $15.1 billion that private investors valued it at during a financing round in June.
2274,"And it would make it one of the largest I.P.O.s in the past 10 years. At a $23 billion valuation, Lyft’s offering would rank as the fifth largest since the financial crisis, and among the largest ever for American technology start-ups — only Facebook’s I.P.O. in 2012 would be larger."
2275," JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies are the lead underwriters of the I.P.O. for Lyft. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the top underwriters of tech I.P.O.s recently, are both working on Uber’s offering."
2276,"In all, Lyft will have 29 underwriters for its I.P.O., 13 (or 45 percent) of which are firms owned or led by women, minorities and military veterans. By comparison, such firms accounted for 30 percent of the underwriters Facebook selected for its I.P.O. and 14 percent for Snap’s."
2277,"After going public, the company will have two classes of stock: class A shares, which carry one vote each, and class B shares, which carry 20 votes. Lyft plans to sell only class A shares in the offering."
2278,"Lyft’s two founders will hold the Class B shares. That means that Mr. Green, the C.E.O., and Mr. Zimmer, the president, will own roughly 5 percent of the company’s outstanding stock but control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares."
2279,This is quite normal in Silicon Valley. Facebook and Google went public with a dual-class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. Snap went further: It issued only nonvoting shares during its 2017 I.P.O.
2280,"But the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts. Kenneth Bertsch, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said in a letter to Lyft’s outside board members: “The principle of one-share, one-vote is a foundation of good corporate governance and equitable treatment of investors.”"
2281,"Companies with dual-class stock structures outperformed those with a single stock structure in recent years, according to some studies. But prior to 2010, studies show, such companies didn’t perform as well."
2282,Lyft is growing quickly. Its revenue more than doubled to $2.16 billion last year from 2017.
2283,"Its losses are also increasing, though not nearly as quickly. The company reported a loss of $911 million last year, up from $688 million in 2017. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017."
2284," Uber’s losses are smaller in percentage terms. Lyft’s rival, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $1.8 billion in 2018 on net revenue of $11.3 billion."
2285,"Bookings, which represent fares less taxes, tolls and tips, surpassed $8 billion last year for Lyft, 76 percent more than in 2017. (In 2018, Uber increased its bookings to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017.)"
2286,"Lyft plans to funnel some future profits into ethical investing. In its pitch to investors, it says it expects “to invest the greater of 1% of our profits or $50 million annually toward our social impact efforts.”"
2287,"The risk factor section of any I.P.O. prospectus acts as a warning label for investors. Lyft’s is no different, but it offers a discussion of regulatory and data security issues that could become a recurring theme in this year’s I.P.O.s."
2288,"Rivals: The company faces a long list of competitors on several fronts. Uber, Gett (along with its acquisition Juno) and Via are its main ride-sharing rivals, along with regular taxi companies and automotive manufacturers, such as BMW, that are looking to enter the sector. Its bike and scooter sharing business faces competition from Lime, Bird and Uber’s acquisition Jump. And Waymo, Apple, Baidu, Uber and a number of other tech and auto companies compete with it on autonomous vehicles."
2289,"Regulation: Lyft says its industry is “rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated.” It warns investors that it has “been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ride sharing.”"
2290,"Labor: Lyft’s million-plus drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Legal actions that classify them as employees “could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,” the company says."
2291,"Autonomous driving: Among the biggest risks involved in the push to driverless cars is getting beaten in the race. The first companies to offer autonomous ride sharing “are expected to have long-term advantages compared with traditional non-autonomous ride sharing offerings,” Lyft says."
2292,"For Lyft’s current shareholders and employees, the I.P.O. could provide a windfall. Here’s a rundown of who stands to gain."
2293,"• Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer will hold stakes in the company that are set to be worth $570 million and $390 million, respectively."
2294,"• The Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten is Lyft’s biggest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake. At $68 a share, its holdings would be valued at $2.1 billion. It will own 11.6 percent of Lyft’s stock after the I.P.O."
2295,• General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft in 2016. That stake could be worth as much as $1.27 billion at the time of the I.P.O.
2296,• The fund giant Fidelity is Lyft’s third largest shareholder. Its stake could be worth as much as $1.26 billion.
2297,"• Alphabet owns 12,828,964 shares, most of them purchased by its venture capital arm, CapitalG. That stake is worth $870 million at the high end of the range."
2298,"• The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was among the earliest investors in Lyft. At $68 a share, the firm’s stake will be valued at just over $1 billion."
2299,"Governments and money managers have made a push to improve gender diversity on corporate boards. Last fall, California, where Lyft is headquartered, became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards."
2300,Lyft will have three women on its board:
2301,• Valerie Jarrett. The former senior adviser to President Barack Obama has been on Lyft’s board since July 2017.
2302,• Maggie Wilderotter. The former chief executive of the telecom company Frontier Communications joined Lyft’s board in May 2018.
2303,"• Ann Miura-Ko. The co-founder of Floodgate Fund, a venture capital firm, has served on the board since June 2016."
2304,"Rounding out the board of directors are: its chairman, Sean Aggarwal, of Soar Capital; Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz; David Lawee of CapitalG; and Hiroshi Mikitani of Rakuten."
2305,"Lyft and Uber are unlike any other businesses, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. That “makes it difficult for potential investors to feel confident that they’re paying the right price given the potential reward and the potential risk that the on-demand ride business isn’t financially viable or as large as optimists believe.”"
2306,"Lyft’s investors “will need to strap themselves in for what may be long periods of rather ugly numbers,” according to Heard on the Street’s Dan Gallagher. That’s because “decacorns tend to share two characteristics: plenty of money and a propensity to spend it in a race to build up share.”"
2307,"“Investors may still want to decide between” Lyft and Uber, argues Richard Beales of Breakingviews. “If their fear of missing out allows them to look past the absence of foreseeable profit at either company, though, it’s hard to see any sensible course other than to put money on both.”"
2308,"“The last time a fast-growing, lossmaking tech company tried this hard to persuade Wall Street to judge it by its own measure of profits, things didn’t end well,” the FT’s Richard Waters writes. He is referring to Groupon."
2309,"An I.P.O. prospectus often features an idealistic, sometimes corny, letter from the company’s founders about their vision for the firm. Here are a couple of choice cuts from Lyft’s letter:"
2310,"“The Y in Lyft. The why in what Lyft is doing is most important to us, as well as the cities and communities we serve, and it will always be our company’s North Star. Lyft’s mission is to: improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.”"
2311,"“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car. We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”"

2315,"SAN FRANCISCO — Technology companies rarely make money before they go public. Twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market. So were Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey."
2316,"For Uber, the question as the ride-hailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money. That’s because the company, the most prominent tech start-up of its generation, will set the bar for other well-known tech companies like Slack and Lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this year."
2317,"So far, Uber is not doing itself any favors on profits."
2318,"The company reported on Friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier. But excluding certain one-time items, including the sale of some of its businesses, Uber’s losses for the quarter rose 88 percent from the previous year, to $842 million."
2319,"The losses were a result of Uber’s increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors, many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers. Uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like DoorDash, Lyft and other ride-hailing and food-delivery services."
2320,"Uber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company. A transportation colossus, Uber was privately valued at more than $70 billion last year, and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as $120 billion after going public. The share sale will create enormous windfalls for Uber’s many investors, and for its founders and early employees."
2321,"As a private company, Uber is not required to disclose financial results. But it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business, and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as a surprise later."
2322,"The latest set of figures, probably Uber’s last as a private company, will be closely scrutinized. Many investors initially give young and fast-growing tech start-ups a pass for losing money, but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them. Investors criticized Twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year, and they have pushed down Snap’s share price since its public offering, partly because the company is still deeply unprofitable."
2323,"In a statement, Uber’s chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, did not address the company’s losses. He said Uber had “maintained category leadership” in its ride-hailing business, and he noted other bright spots, including the company’s freight-management business and nascent e-bike and scooter program."
2324,"Uber has a long history of spending large sums of money. Ride-hailing is inherently an expensive business that requires companies to expand into new markets for growth, pay to recruit drivers and lower prices to grab business away from competitors."
2325,"Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has been under pressure to pare its losses, and the company has pulled out of money-losing markets like Russia and Southeast Asia."
2326,"Some of the company’s losses have been overshadowed by its explosive growth. In 2018, Uber increased its total bookings — what it charges customers for rides and food delivery — to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017. Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a 43 percent increase."
2327,"The company’s net revenue for last year’s fourth quarter was $3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, and its gross bookings jumped 37 percent, to $14.2 billion. The company has $6.4 billion in cash, and its net loss was $865 million."
2328,"But Uber’s profit margins have declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its food-delivery business, Uber Eats. The margins are also smaller on Uber Eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery drivers."
2329,"Uber’s self-driving car program, which will probably not yield revenue for years, continues to burn cash. The company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads in December after a 10-month hiatus, which was prompted when one of its vehicles  fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona."
2330,"His name is Isadore Greenbaum. He’s a Jew, a plumber’s helper from Brooklyn. He rushes onto the stage, beneath a portrait of George Washington flanked by swastikas. He tries to accost the Nazi who is denouncing the “Jewish-controlled press” and calling for a “white gentile-ruled” United States. Uniformed storm troopers beat him. Police officers drag him from the stage, pants ripped, arms raised in desperate entreaty. The mob howls in delight."
2331,"It’s Feb. 20, 1939. More than 20,000 Nazi sympathizers are packed into Madison Square Garden as Greenbaum attempts to silence Fritz Kuhn, Bundesführer (so-called) of the German American Bund. Greenbaum has been enraged by Kuhn’s demand that the country be delivered from Jewish clutches and “returned to the American people who founded it.”"
2332,"The 26-year-old Jew is brought before a magistrate who, according to an account in this newspaper, tells him that “innocent people might have been killed.” To which Greenbaum retorts, “Do you realize that plenty of Jewish people might be killed with their persecution up there?”"
2333,"“Plenty” is an inadequate word for six million, but that was 1939 and human beings tend not to imagine the unimaginable. The pale, dismayed face of the young Jewish boy, arms raised, being rounded up in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 is well known. Greenbaum’s expression of terrorized anguish in New York City presages it."
2334,"All this is caught in Marshall Curry’s remarkable Oscar-nominated documentary short, “A Night at the Garden,” composed of footage from the time. Attacks on the press; the take-back-our-country cry; hymns to the true American (or German): There’s not much new, as Curry notes, about fascism."
2335,"The movie brings to mind a phrase of Hannah Arendt’s that has haunted me about how most people will comply under conditions of terror but some will not: “No more is required,” she wrote, “and no more can reasonably be asked, for this planet to remain a place fit for human habitation.”"
2336,"Think the “Tank Man” of Tiananmen Square. Think Anton Schmid, the sergeant in Hitler’s army who helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto and was executed in 1942. Think Ron Ridenhour, the helicopter gunner in Vietnam spurred by conscience to gather information that led to the official investigation into the My Lai massacre. Think Isadore Greenbaum. It is of the essence of such gestures that they appear futile, yet have the power to redeem humanity."
2337,"Our age, too, is one of demagogues. What are we to make of our “ivory-gold colossus” — James Lasdun’s phrase in his brilliant new novel of the #MeToo era, “Afternoon of a Faun”? This colossus “at once menacing and cosmically aggrieved” who for two hours perorates before the Conservative Political Action Conference (only would-be or actual dictators afflicted with narcissistic disorders talk for that long) and declares: “I’m in love, and you’re in love. We’re all in love together.”"
2338,"Who, for President Trump, are his people in love? They are “our people.” Now, “our people” are not synonymous with the American people. This president, unlike his predecessors, has never seen himself as the president of all Americans."
2339,"No, they are the CPAC crowd, his fans. They are the “tough people,” the people who could make things “very bad” if necessary — police and military and bikers who, the president claimed in an interview with Breitbart News this month, support him. He needs people in his thrall, like that Madison Square Garden crowd. As Lasdun wrote, “Nothing short of dominion over the entire universe could compensate for the wrongs done to him.”"
2340,"The wrongs, that is, of journalists, judges and Hollywood directors — anyone who thinks the president might just be a dangerous white nationalist charlatan. Why think that? Because Trump, from Day 1, has maligned brown people and Muslims; and, as president, he saw “very fine people on both sides” at the 2017 Charlottesville rally where white nationalists chanted “Jews will not replace us” and a woman who protested, Heather Heyer, was killed."
2341,I am not suggesting Trump resembles Hitler. That should be obvious — but not so obvious that I will refrain from writing this column. The white nationalist mass murderer of Muslims in New Zealand was not out of his mind in seeing Trump as a symbol of “renewed white identity and common purpose.” Trump’s love affair is with revanchist white people who don’t like the demographic look of the 21st century.
2342,"Throughout the world today, from Saudi Arabia to the Philippines, from Guatemala to North Korea, bad things happen because the Trump administration winks at them. The United States as moral guardian, however flawed, has vanished."
2343,"It’s not that Trump could be dangerous. He is dangerous. People die because the worst leaders know they enjoy the American president’s connivance. The debate on whether Trump is harmless, whether we should laugh away his grotesquerie, is misplaced. I have no doubt that the worst is yet to come. In his own mind, whatever the Mueller report contains, Trump cannot lose."
2344,"Greenbaum and his wife moved to Southern California. A fisherman at Newport Pier, Greenbaum died in 1997. There was, as Philip Bump observed in The Washington Post, “a brief mention of his passing in the local news.”"
2345,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
2346,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
2347,"GRAFTON, Australia — Grafton is a peaceful and quiet eastern Australian town along the Clarence River, surrounded by farms and filled with families and retirees, a place where people leave their homes unlocked and everyone knows someone."
2348,"The biggest event is the annual Jacaranda Festival, named for the blossoms of its indigo-flowered trees. The biggest construction projects are the new jail and the new bridge."
2349,"So it was a stunner on Saturday for Grafton’s 18,000 people when they were involuntarily vaulted into the center of notoriety, as the world learned that one of their own was the suspect in New Zealand’s worst mass killing."
2350,"Members of the international news media poured into Grafton, 380 miles north of Sydney, rushing to find anyone who knew or remembered the suspect, Brenton Harrison Tarrant, 28, a former bodybuilder accused of slaughtering 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, broadcasting the attacks live on Facebook and disseminating a racist online screed."
2351,"As Mr. Tarrant was charged in a Christchurch courtroom, many Grafton townspeople were stupefied."
2352,"“The town has gone into silence,” said Ola Williamson, the owner of a restaurant in Grafton. People had lined up to buy newspapers that morning looking at one another with shock. “I hope we don’t get tarred with the same brush,” he said."
2353,"Some residents said they felt sorrow and horror for Christchurch’s Muslim community, along with confusion. “I don’t understand why someone from Grafton would be so racially motivated to do such a thing,” said Willow Walker, a resident. “That’s what shocks me the most.”"
2354,"As details about Mr. Tarrant’s life emerged, residents of the town, unaccustomed to such intense attention from reporters walking their streets, also expressed anger and worry about the reputation of Grafton."
2355,"[Sign up for the Australia Letter to get news, conversation starters and local recommendations in your inbox each week.]"
2356,"“All the reporters are stating that this is a bad town — we breed terrorists,” said Trudy Schultz, 52, a resident. “We don’t agree with that at all.”"
2357,"Many streets in the town center were nearly deserted, broken up by occasional groups of teenagers biking and families walking."
2358,"Mr. Tarrant grew up on a grassy, suburban street. A woman who answered the door of a home where he was believed to have been raised declined to comment. Neighbors who remembered the family said that he had played in the street as a child and that the family had moved away about eight years ago."
2359,"In the online manifesto Mr. Tarrant distributed before the attacks, he described himself as “just a ordinary White man” from “a working class, low income family,” adding: “I had a regular childhood, without any great issues. I had little interest in education during my schooling, barely achieving a passing grade.”"
2360,"According to the 2010 obituary for his father, Rodney, in the local newspaper The Daily Examiner, Mr. Tarrant’s parents divorced early in his childhood. Former classmates at Grafton High School said that he had lived with his father, a trash collector who competed in triathlon events, and that his mother had been a schoolteacher."
2361,"They remembered him as a disruptive, cocky student."
2362,"“He was sort of like your class clown,” said Kara Hickson, 28, who graduated in the same year as Mr. Tarrant. “Always trying to make people laugh and always being silly.”"
2363,"But they also described him as a teenager who was bullied, even by friends, and at one point was a heavy-metal fan."
2364,"After they graduated in 2008, former classmates said, he turned his focus to personal training. “He lost a heap of weight,” Ms. Hickson said."
2365,"And after the death of his father, he used profits from cryptocurrency investments to travel the world, they said. “We never really heard from him after traveling,” Ms. Hickson said."
2366,"“He never showed any extremes or extremist views or any crazy behavior,” Tracey Gray, a former employer, said in an interview with the broadcaster 9 News. “It was my understanding he was open to see the world, to see as many places as possible. He just wanted to experience different experiences,” she said of his decision to leave town."
2367,"By Saturday afternoon, residents of the street where Mr. Tarrant grew up said, several reporters had already knocked on their doors. Cameramen waited outside his former home and the Big River Squash and Fitness Center, a gym where he had worked as a personal trainer."
2368,"“It’s a shock for the community to get the global attention like this for something that you don’t want the attention for,” said Bill North, the editor of The Daily Examiner."
2369,"Some townspeople, protective of the remaining Tarrants in the area, have harbored animosity toward the news media for what they see as infringing upon the family’s privacy, he said."
2370,"“At the end of the day, we have to live here,” Mr. North said."
2371,"The town’s demography is largely white, with a prominent Indigenous community but few immigrants. Some residents said that although life in Grafton was pleasant, it was not without moments of tension."
2372,"“There is still a lot of racism around the place. It’s usually sort of hidden a little bit,” said Teena Colgrave, though she added that it was the same all over Australia."
2373,"Still, a vigil was held in a Grafton church for the victims of the shooting."
2374,"“It’s just one of those things you just don’t expect someone from here,” said Jeff Smith, the owner of an ice cream store in the town’s center."
2375,“It’s frustrating when some of the media says this is Grafton’s own — we don’t want anything to do with that sort of mentality.”
2376,"John McMahon is one of those rare writers who seem to have sprung out of nowhere. His first novel, THE GOOD DETECTIVE (Putnam, $27), which is pretty much perfect, features a decent if flawed hero battling personal troubles while occupied with a murder case of great consequence to his community."
2377,"The community in question is Mason Falls, a patch of “old Georgia dirt” deep in tobacco country where race relations are stable but could easily be upended by some headline-making atrocity — an act of barbarism like the torture, lynching and murder of a 15-year-old African-American named Kendrick Webster."
2378,"Paul Thomas Marsh, who goes by P.T. and narrates his story in cleareyed, cool fashion, is a cop who has lost his wife and only child in a horrific car accident. “Someone came along and took my responsibilities away. Took away my family. And all they left me with was absolute justice” — which he enforces without much regard for the rules. But P.T. is so close to being out of control that when he’s roughing up Virgil Rowe, a “neo-Nazi who beats up strippers,” he almost kills the guy."
2379,"Not a good move, since Virgil turns out to be the main suspect in Kendrick’s murder. And a really bad move when Virgil is found dead and P.T.’s fingerprints are all over the place. Surely Virgil was alive when P.T. stormed out. Or was he?"
2380,"Once in a while that fabled Southern lyricism surfaces (when, say, McMahon offers a glimpse of Spanish moss “that swayed in the morning light like a family of ghosts”), but for the most part his writing is painfully, almost unbearably, matter-of-fact, especially in the interior monologue when Kendrick narrates his own murder. (“He saw the moon. He’d just learned about waxing and waning moons in science, and this was a waxing gibbous. A few days before a full moon.”) And when P.T. finally shakes himself out of his funk and starts policing the region for evidence of a grass-roots militia stirring up racial unrest, the nasty sounds coming out of strip clubs and biker bars are nothing like the sweet, syrupy voices of the Old South."

2382,"People everywhere think their next-door neighbor might be a serial killer. What? You say they don’t? Well, it’s a good thing nosy Henrietta Mazur believes the worst of Matthew Dolamore, because her unneighborly hunch galvanizes BEFORE SHE KNEW HIM (Morrow/HarperCollins, $26.99). Peter Swanson’s neatly knotted suspense story is set in a pleasant Boston suburb where Henrietta and Matthew live side by side with their spouses, the only childless couples on the block."
2383,"Not that Hen feels deprived; she loves her work creating “grotesque, surreal tableaus” to illustrate children’s books. (“Hen had always had a morbid streak.”) Matthew is even busier, holding down a day job teaching history while murdering people on the side."
2384,"Hen knows that Matthew is a killer, and Matthew knows she knows. (“They had a secret, the two of them.”) But suffering as she does from a sporadically debilitating bipolar disorder, she might become a modern Cassandra, dismissed as an unreliable witness. This can’t end well."

2386,"A lot goes on in Washington, D.C., outside the precincts of the White House and Capitol Hill. And that’s what David Swinson writes about in his streetwise private-eye novels featuring Frank Marr, a forcibly retired cop and mostly reformed cocaine addict. TRIGGER (Mulholland, $27) finds Marr on another thankless case, trying to clear a close friend on the D.C. police force who’s been accused of shooting an unarmed teenager."
2387,"This is the kind of investigation that takes Marr away from tourist spots and into tough neighborhoods where he mingles with foulmouthed punks who are a lot more interesting to read about than politicians. “I’ve been known to go rogue,” Marr admits, an understatement from someone who works well outside the law. This is a guy who lies, steals, bullies people and has tossed his share of mistakes into the Potomac. “I have to admit, only to myself, that I love when something like that happens,” he acknowledges. “It gives me an adrenaline boost, a bit like coke.”"
2388,♦
2389,"As scenic murders go, it’s hard to beat the dead man floating in the swimming pool of Le Chant d’Eau, a stone farmhouse hilltop-high in DEATH IN PROVENCE (Harper, $26.99). Plot and characters pale beside the setting of this first mystery by Serena Kent, the nom de plume of the husband-and-wife team of Robert Rees and Deborah Lawrenson."
2390,"Newly divorced and determined to dodge grandmother duties back home in England, Penelope Kite impulsively buys a rundown property overlooking the Luberon Valley, thus providing steady work for every craftsman in the region."
2391,"Penelope faithfully performs the duties of all such conventional heroines, meeting her colorful neighbors, visiting the markets, sampling the cuisine, exploring the historical attractions and proving herself a better detective than the local gendarmerie. Formulaic? You bet. But who could resist a vacation in Provence?"
2392,"SHANGHAI — Alibaba became one of the world’s biggest internet companies thanks to the growing wealth and online shopping habits of Chinese consumers. Now, as China’s economy slows, it has become a symbol of their new sense of caution."
2393,"The company, China’s largest e-commerce business, said on Wednesday that its earnings growth fell last quarter. Its revenue was slightly below analysts’ expectations, growing 41 percent, its slowest pace since early 2016, reflecting both the sheer size of the company and widening troubles in the Chinese economy, the world’s second largest."
2394,"Alibaba’s shares rose in premarket trading, however, because it beat analysts’ estimates on adjusted earnings per share, posting growth of 15 percent."
2395,"Last week, China posted its slowest quarterly growth reading in a decade. Retail sales growth has similarly slowed, though it picked up a bit in December, and private-sector wage growth is down to global financial crisis levels. Middle-class Chinese people are increasingly cutting back."
2396,"Purchases of big-ticket items like cars and smartphones have fallen off especially quickly. Apple said on Tuesday that profits were flat and revenues were down in its most recent quarter, in part because of weakness in sales in China. Data from the research firm Canalys showed that smartphone sales in China had fallen 14 percent in 2018, to their lowest levels since 2013."
2397,"During an earnings call, Alibaba executives sought to play down concerns about the Chinese economy and the smoldering trade war between Beijing and Washington. Joseph C. Tsai, the company’s executive vice chairman, said Alibaba’s exposure to the trade war was low, and he emphasized that e-commerce had generally grown much faster than China’s economy."
2398,"“The slowdown of macro might cause concerns in the market; however, what we see from Alibaba’s platforms is Chinese consumption growth is still strong,” Alibaba’s chief executive, Daniel Zhang, said. He added that although there had been weakness in sales of goods like appliances and smartphones, other sectors, like apparel and home furnishing, had had fast growth."
2399,"Alibaba has suffered, however. Its shares have fallen about 16 percent in the past six months. It has also cut its estimate of revenue growth for the current fiscal year, which ends in March, by about 5 percent. On its blowout Singles Day sale in November, Alibaba sales grew from a year earlier, but also at a much slower rate. A bike-sharing company it backed, Ofo, has also fallen into trouble, and millions of users are demanding deposits back."
2400,"“We expect a tougher macroeconomic outlook for China to weigh on Alibaba’s commissions and advertising revenue for the next few quarters,” said Shelleen Shum, an analyst with the research firm eMarketer, in a report."
2401,"With hundreds of millions of customers regularly using its online shopping websites, Alibaba is a good barometer of consumer sentiment. But just as important, the bulk of the company’s earnings come from advertisements bought by the many vendors and companies that sell on its websites, making it also a good proxy for business confidence."
2402,"Many sellers have remained cautious, in part because of economic uncertainties, leading to a buildup in Alibaba’s ad inventories, according to a report by Credit Suisse."
2403,"To push back, Alibaba has looked to recruit new users, often from China’s rural areas, who are less well served by e-commerce. Efforts to attract users via digital media like online videos and domestic social media sites dragged on the company’s profitability, analysts said."
2404,"The company has continued to add consumers. It said its monthly active users on mobile devices had risen to 699 million, an addition of more than 30 million from the previous quarter. Analysts have said such user growth shows Alibaba still has room to grow by spreading out further into China’s countryside."
2405,"At the World Economic Forum meeting this month in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Tsai, Alibaba’s executive vice chairman, also warned about the long-term economic impact of the trade war between the United States and China. Still, he said the trade deficit between China and the United States would naturally fall as Chinese consumers spent more on overseas goods."
2406,"One night in February 1993, Frankie Caruso and another white Baton Rouge detective darkened their faces to impersonate black drug dealers, as part of what was then characterized as a successful sting operation."
2407,"Twenty-six years later, a photo of the two officers has emerged from an old police yearbook, with the caption “Soul brothers.” The blackface operation, which current officials said had been approved by the Police Department, drew swift condemnation this week from the city’s mayor and its police chief."
2408,"“Blackface photographs are inappropriate and offensive,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul Jr. said in a statement on Monday. “They were inappropriate then and are inappropriate today. The Baton Rouge Police Department would like to apologize to our citizens and to anyone who may have been offended by the photographs.”"
2409,"Reached by phone, Mr. Caruso, who retired in 2015 after more than 33 years with the department, however, was unapologetic. He said that while he understood racism better today — and that in 1993 he did not know the term or history of blackface — he did not think the disguise was inappropriate."
2410,"“We did nothing wrong,” Mr. Caruso said. “We did a good operation. We made a lot of arrests in a neighborhood that was needing attention. That’s all there is to it.”"
2411,"A national debate about the practice of blackface has erupted in recent weeks after a racist photograph surfaced on a medical school yearbook page belonging to Ralph Northam, now the governor of Virginia. Mr. Northam denied appearing in that photo, but admitted to darkening his face another time."
2412,"With roots in demeaning minstrel-show traditions that date to the 1830s, blackface has a long history  in American society."
2413,"At least one other report exists of a Police Department approving a law enforcement operation in blackface. United Press International reported in 1990 that white police officers in Naples, Fla., used blackface to pretend to be black crack cocaine dealers."
2414,"Robert J. Louden, a professor emeritus of criminal justice and homeland security at Georgian Court University in New Jersey, said that he did not believe the practice is or was widespread. That’s in part because blackface could put undercover officers in danger if a potential drug buyer notices the disguise."
2415,"“It’s foolish and it’s dangerous,” he said."
2416,"Jeannette Eileen Jones, a professor of history and ethnic studies at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, said it was a symptom of a failure to recruit more black officers. Baton Rouge, Louisiana’s capital, is among the last cities in the state to remain under a federal decree intended to decrease discrimination against women and black applicants for the police and fire departments, The Advocate newspaper reported last year."
2417,"“You’re claiming to take on someone else’s racial traits, and given the history of blackface in the United States and its origins, I can’t understand why anyone thinks that’s O.K.,” Ms. Jones said. “It is simply about mocking and exaggerating and stereotyping an entire group of people.”"
2418,"On Monday evening, Sharon Weston Broome, the mayor-president of Baton Rouge, said in a statement that blackface “is more than just a costume” and that it “invokes a painful history in this country and it is not appropriate in any situation.”"
2419,"“While this may have been department-approved 25 years ago, that does not make it right,” she said."
2420,"The plan on the night in question in February 1993 was to have two white detectives, including Mr. Caruso, pretend to deal crack cocaine in a predominantly black neighborhood in Baton Rouge that had a high rate of street-level drug crime. Mr. Caruso said the narcotics team did have two black detectives, but their faces were known in the neighborhood."
2421,The sting operation was also detailed in a 1993 article in The Advocate.
2422,"Mr. Caruso likened using the disguise to preparing for other undercover assignments, like dressing as a biker or a prostitute."
2423,"Asked if he thought he was stereotyping black people, he said that he did not think he was, and that he was not intending to hurt anyone."
2424,"“We dressed up for the assignment that we were working,” he said."
2425,"In 2007, a photo of the two detectives was published in a police yearbook, according to a police spokesman."
2426,Chief Paul said he found out about the photograph this week after it started circulating on social media.
2427,"“Today, we would not allow our officers to wear blackface in an official capacity under any circumstances,” Chief Paul said in the statement."
2428,"He said the “department is bound by the Louisiana Law Enforcement Bill of Rights, which places a timeline on administrative investigations related to officer conduct.”"
2429,"One of the two officers is still with the department, the police spokesman said. He said the Baton Rouge police did not plan to further investigate the photograph or discipline the officer."
2430,"Mr. Caruso said that “in today’s times, people are trying to look at anything that they can to make a race issue out of something.”"
2431,"So, would he use blackface in a drug operation today?"
2432,"“Because of the way everything in the world today is with race, and everybody talking about race relations and blackface, and all these things that they’re talking about right now,’’ he said, “I probably would not do it today.”"
2433,"Michael S. Meldman, 60, wasn’t a golfer when he founded Discovery Land Company in 1994, a real estate business based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that has developed 25 private high-end golf communities in North America and the Caribbean."
2434,"“Master-planned communities and golf were hugely popular and the premium drivers in real estate,’’ he said, “and I saw an opportunity, even though I hadn’t ever really played golf. In fact, I only started playing seriously five years ago.”"
2435,"Today, Mr. Meldman’s luxurious communities with members-only golf clubs — Baker’s Bay in the Bahamas, Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., and Silo Ridge in Amenia, N.Y., among them — range from 450 acres to 14,000 acres, or about 180 hectares to 5,700 hectares, and have homes that command prices from $3 million to $80 million."
2436,"The communities stand out for amenities that rival five-star destination resorts, with golf courses designed by Tom Fazio and Jack Nicklaus, restaurants with top-quality farm-to-table cuisine and an extensive range of wellness-themed activities. And let’s not forget the Casamigos Tequila bar at each resort. (Mr. Meldman founded the brand with the entrepreneur Rande Gerber and the actor George Clooney.)"
2437,Below are excerpts from a recent interview with Mr. Meldman.
2438,Tell me about your vision for Discovery Land Company.
2439,"People were very interested in golf and master-planned communities, and my idea was to create a luxury concept that combined both. I wanted to find great pieces of land and build around the natural landscapes so that the communities looked like they belonged there, not like standard developments. They are all built to be sprawling with plenty of space between the homes and have lots of green space. And they all incorporate a lot of natural stone."
2440,"Although the communities are in different locations, what characteristics do they share?"
2441,"They all have golf, of course. They’re all gated and have guards, clubhouses with great gyms and spas and fantastic restaurants. They’re also very family-friendly and casual. I think that a lot of golf clubs can be intimidating, but at ours, you can play barefoot in board shorts. And, we have two to three comfort stations on all the golf courses, which are basically mini-restaurants that serve everything from candy bars to foie gras to warm pretzels."
2442,"In each resort, we hire locals to teach residents about the outdoor activities in the area. At Iron Horse in Whitefish, Mont., for example, you can go fly fishing. At Makena, in Maui, you can go deep sea fishing, scuba diving and snorkeling. And in most of our oceanside locations, kids can release baby turtles into the ocean. My idea is that the people who live in my communities should embrace the areas that they’re in."
2443,How do you choose your locations?
2444,"I seek out places where there is a good amount of land and where zoning allows us to build homes and a golf course. Also, there has to be enough to do in the area besides golf. In Silo Ridge, for example, in the Hudson Valley, which is the newest community, the horseback riding, hunting, mountain biking and hiking are all excellent."
2445,If you had to give one piece of advice for someone looking to buy a home in a golf community what would it be?
2446,Make sure that the developer has a track record of success and is going to commit to the vision of what they initially present.
2447,What are the most important features to get right when designing golf community homes?
2448,"These days, I think they should have a more contemporary aesthetic as opposed to traditional, which was the norm when I started Discovery. They should have big windows that take advantage of the views, ideally of the golf course, and have spacious indoor and outdoor areas where families and friends can gather and spend time together like a nice-sized patio, a family room with comfortable, oversized couches and a dining room with a table that accommodates large groups. It’s also great to have an open-plan home where the kitchen and family room are one big room, since these are the two areas where everyone tends to spend the most time. And the homes shouldn’t be too close to each other so that everyone has enough privacy."
2449,"In your opinion, how have golf communities changed over the last decade?"
2450,"They’ve gone from golf being the only consideration to being simply one of many drivers. There is now a greater emphasis on cuisine, the nongolf outdoor pursuits and activities, the family-friendliness and the safety concerns addressed by being in a gated community."
2451,"In a great golf community, there has to be something that’s appealing to each family member. We have a lot of people living in our communities who don’t golf. They’re attracted to the other things Discovery clubs offer."
2452,"Also, the demographic skews much younger. In the past, golf clubs attracted a lot of retirees, but now, there are a lot of people in their mid-30s to mid-40s enjoying them with their families that include young children."
2453,Are golf community residents different than your usual homeowner?
2454,"I think that they’re inherently more social. They’re looking to connect with other people on a regular basis and love the idea of a sense of community. I’m not saying other homeowners are antisocial, but they may not care as much about the social offerings and accessibility to the lineup of activities."
2455,"Remember the polar vortex and those subzero temperatures that plagued vast swaths of the United States last week? While much of the country was hibernating with hot cocoa, 146 athletes were competing in a 135-mile race in northern Minnesota."
2456,"The temperature at the start line, in International Falls, Minn., was minus 15 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chills reaching 55 below."
2457,"The athletes, who could run, bike or ski the Arrowhead 135, wouldn’t have it any other way."
2458,"“People want a hard race,” Ken Krueger, the Arrowhead 135 race director, said. “If we have an easy year, they feel cheated. They want to come here for the bragging rights. But I don’t honestly know if this was our coldest Arrowhead race. I think temperatures were colder in 2007.”"
2459,"The finish rate has been as low as 20 percent and as high as 82 percent, he said. This year, 36 percent of the starters, or 52 people, finished the race by the 60-hour cutoff time."
2460,"Athletes must apply to compete in the grueling race, which proudly calls itself one of the 50 toughest races in the world. They also must carry all of their own gear from a list of required items, including a stove and a tent."
2461,"Selected athletes travel from all parts of the world to compete, including a group of Brazilians who said they trained for the Minnesota conditions in commercial freezers."
2462,"The New York Times spoke with John Storkamp, who finished fourth this year after winning last year’s race. Why him? In a word — experience. It was his 14th Arrowhead 135."
2463,Let’s start with the obvious: Why?
2464,"A good friend of mine created the race in 2005 and convinced me to do it in 2006. It’s a winter tradition to keep me running through the winter so I’m in shape to go out and do something like this. But you are surrounded by people that understand it, so you spend very little time making the case why you would do it. Maybe that’s kind of the beauty of it. It becomes a new norm and it becomes relatively normal for people to show up year in and year out to do this. I guess the easiest explanation is everyone has their kind of mountain to climb."
2465,Did this year’s polar vortex change your outlook or strategy in the race?
2466,"Looking at the forecast doesn’t change much in terms of whether I’m going to do the race. But the more challenging the conditions, the more I focus on taking the best care of myself as possible. I won the race last year, but just threw the competitive element out the window this year and focused on doing things early in the race to set myself up for success to finish safely."
2467,"No matter what the conditions, there are always times during an event like this where you think that you would like to be inside and warm and done and no longer doing this, and that’s just one of the challenges."
2468,What does an “unsupported” race mean in these conditions?
2469,"The fact that it’s self-supported is a big ethos of the race. There are snowmobilers checking in with people giving them the opportunity to bail out of the race. But the goal is getting yourself to help if you need it. You have to have all the supplies with you, so that if you are no longer mobile, if you are too tired or dehydrated, you can take reprieve from the elements."
2470,"How much, and how often, are you eating?"
2471,"You can’t stop moving in these temperatures, so the most important thing is to really focus on your nutrition. You are eating and drinking pretty much continuously through the event. If 15 minutes go by and you haven’t eaten, it’s probably time to start eating again. You are trying to eat 6,000 to 7,000 calories every 24 hours, the most calorie dense food with lowest water content with high fat content. The best foods are candy, chocolate, things with peanut butter, coconut — really anything that is really high in calories and fat that doesn’t freeze."
2472,What kinds of athletes attempt this race?
2473,"In the first couple of years, very few people had the interest or the ability to do it. It takes years of experience to approach something like this. It’s what you would call a graduate level ultrarace. People who apply to run the race would ideally have a lot of experience, including some ultradistance races of 100 miles, under their belt. Experience with winter camping and mountaineering is just as important, if not more important. Over time and as the event has gone on, I think people have picked up tricks and trips for how they could prepare for doing something like this. Now people will make plans three, four, five years out to acquire the necessary gear and requisite training."
2474,What’s the first thing you did after you finished?
2475,I ate a lot of soup and I had a hot shower and got into bed. Finally getting to sleep is great.
2476,This interview was edited and condensed for clarity.
2477,"Breast size can affect how women exercise and whether they decide to work out at all, according to a large-scale new study of the exercise habits of women of all ages. The study suggests that physical concerns, including breast size and bra fit, should be openly and frankly discussed during considerations of what keeps people from being active."
2478,"Nobody doubts at this point that exercise can improve our health, happiness and longevity. But a hefty percentage of adults across the globe rarely if ever move."
2479,"The reasons so many people remain so sedentary are numerous and complex, studies show, ranging from jammed schedules to unwalkable neighborhoods. But another common obstacle, according to survey responses, is discomfort during exercise."
2480,"For many women, that discomfort involves their chests. Female breast tissue is heavy and unsupported, containing little stabilizing, connective tissue. So, breasts move when women exercise, even if they wear a bra."
2481,"Past biomechanical studies show that when women run braless, their breasts joggle up and down by seven inches or more and also oscillate side to side. Sports bras may attenuate this jostling but rarely eliminate it, even in women with small breasts."
2482,"As a result, breasts often become painful during and after workouts. A 2013 questionnaire provided to women running the London Marathon found that more than a third of them, including runners with small breasts, told the researchers that their breasts often felt sore. "
2483,But little past research has explored whether breast size and potential soreness affect women’s decisions to participate in exercise or if they influence the kinds of exercise that women might — or might not — pursue.
2484,"So, for the new study, which was published this month in the Journal of Science and Medicine in Sports, researchers from the Biomechanics Research Laboratory at the University of Wollongong in Australia advertised for women willing to have their breasts measured and discussed. The researchers recruited only women because, obviously, women possess female breasts."
2485,"(Men have their own morphological challenges related to exercise, with male genitalia vulnerable to numbing bicycle seats and errant soccer balls. But those issues are not known to limit men’s willingness to be active.)"
2486,"Eventually, the researchers wound up with a group of 355 generally healthy women ranging in age from 18 to 75. Their body mass ranged from normal through obese."
2487,"They asked these volunteers to complete several questionnaires, one of which asked the women to recall whether and how they had exercised in the past week. Had they, for instance, gone for a walk, for how long and at what intensity? Had their breathing sped up? Had they broken a sweat? Similarly, had they jogged, swum, biked, completed yard work, attended dance classes or engaged in other activities?"
2488,A separate questionnaire asked whether the women felt that their breast size had influenced how they exercised.
2489,"The researchers then used three-dimensional scanning to precisely measure the volume of each woman’s breasts and categorize them as small, medium, large or very large. (The scientists did not rely on bra size, because it is notoriously inconsistent.)"
2490,Then they compared exercise habits among the groups.
2491,"The results were consistent and rather worrying. As women’s breast sizes grew, their participation in physical activity declined, particularly if that exercise was vigorous. Few very-large-breasted women jogged, for example."
2492,"Many of the larger-breasted women also reported that they believed that their breast size prevented them from exercising easily, even in low-impact activities like walking or swimming."
2493,"These results remained the same when the researchers considered age, which affects exercise participation, and body mass index, which likewise affects how often we exercise. Over all, slimmer women tended to have smaller breasts and vice versa. But even among overweight women with small breasts and normal-weight women with large bosoms, the relationship to exercise was unchanged."
2494,"Women with larger breasts, whatever their B.M.I., exercised less on average than those with smaller ones and were more likely to feel that their breast size interfered with moving."
2495,"The upshot is that women should be encouraged to learn how to find and fit a high-quality sports bra or swimsuit with adequate breast support, says Celeste Coltman, now an assistant professor at the University of Canberra in Australia, who led the study as part of her doctoral dissertation. (Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has a guide to supportive sports bras to fit a wide range of sizes.)"
2496,"Dr. Coltman and her collaborators, Julie Steele and Deirdre McGhee, professors at the University of Wollongong who also lead Breast Research Australia (BRA), a research initiative at the university that looks at how breast size affects lifestyle, have developed a free app to help active women assess their breast size and bra needs. (The bra sizing is Australian but the sizing tips are universal.)"
2497,"Some large-breasted women may need to wear two bras simultaneously to gain enough support for comfortable running and high-impact activities, Dr. Coltman and her collaborators say."
2498,"Dr. Coltman also suggests that large-breasted women who have not been exercising consider trying low-impact activities like walking and, perhaps even better, swimming, if they can find a comfortable swimsuit with a built-in bra."
2499,"“Swimming and other water-based activities like aqua aerobics can be ideal,” she says, “because the buoyant forces of the water slow the downward movement of breasts” and dampen any breast-related discomfort."
2500,"First came workout boot camps. Then off-the-grid yoga retreats. Next, hotel chains touting celebrity-orchestrated fitness programs. Now, there is another way to travel without leaving your workout behind. Fitness pop-ups in vacation destinations like Capri, Sri Lanka, Goa and Vietnam all offer relaxing getaways combined with exercise options, sightseeing and meals prepared by a professional chef. Often, these groups stay in private, rented villas. These four companies have created custom itineraries with workouts and wellness in mind."
2501,"Designed for solo travelers to experience off-the-beaten-track destinations through fitness and wellness, Escape to Shape’s itineraries include destinations like Marrakesh, Jaipur, Siem Reap, Bhutan, Botswana and Cape Town. The packages are ideal for goal-oriented, luxury lovers who want a fitness-based trip in an exotic destination without skimping on the indulgences of a high-end getaway. "
2502,"Erica Gragg, founder of the firm and a former event planner, hosts every trip personally and has a winning formula: workouts inspired by bucket list settings (Khmer boxing in Cambodia, circuit Training on the ancient rampart in Cartagena, beach boot camp in Vietnam, yoga in the underground cisterns of Istanbul), wellness elements (journal writing, meditation, yoga, massage) and thoughtful excursions (market visits, group hammam visits, a water blessing with a Buddhist monk, wine tastings) intended to deliver a culturally authentic taste of the destination. Guests stay at five-star hotels or villas and enjoy healthful meals prepared by an on-site chef."
2503,"Rates from $4,500 to $14,000 per person, depending on location, room type and length of trip. International airfare and alcohol excluded."
2504,"In 2012, Zanna Conlan, a former Australian football coach and surf instructor, started Active Escapes as a way for fitness aficionados to have a sweat-laced, tropical getaway — think twice daily high-intensity interval training, surfing and evening yoga — with like-minded vacationers. "
2505,"What began in Bali for the company has evolved into trips to seven destinations, including Australia, Hawaii, Dubai, Barbados, the Maldives and India, some featuring a marquee trainer like the American bodybuilder Steve Cook. When guests aren’t swinging kettlebells on the beach, they go snorkeling, surfing, biking or practice sunset yoga. Lodgings are private villas or boutique hotels, and last year the company added a trip aboard a 123-foot yacht in the Maldives featuring beach workouts on different islands."
2506,"Rates from $1,500 to $8,250 per person, depending on location, room type and length of trip. Airfare and alcohol excluded."
2507,"As the company’s mantra “no goals, all vibes” indicates, four-year-old Surf Yoga Beer represents a version of this trend that’s focused a little more on fun than fitness. Billed as “sleepaway camp for adults” (participants share rooms, often with bunk beds, in a large house or small hotels), the company’s fitness adventures to Ibiza, Havana, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Miami are about bonding over intense exercise and partying (unlimited beer is included in the price of the trip)."
2508,"Mantas Zvinas, the company’s founder, a happy-go-lucky surf coach and Soul Cycle instructor, leads the itineraries personally along with a number of marquee trainers including Jaws Nelson and Julian Devine of NYC’s Rumble Boxing, and Hunter McIntyre, the professional obstacle course racer. The trips are packed with beach boot-camp workouts, surf sessions, yoga, hiking, stand-up paddle boarding and, in some locations, sightseeing. The traveling chef-in-residence, Eddie Larios, extends the communal ambience with an open-for-visits kitchen, impromptu cooking classes and visits to local markets. "
2509,"Rates range from $999 to $3,600 per person, depending on location, room type and length of trip. Airfare and alcohol, outside of beer and the group happy hour, are excluded."
2510,"Sometimes women just want to relax, and work out, with other women. That’s why Rebecca Garland’s women-only Fit & Fly Girl retreats have taken off. The trips are for women who enjoy a balance of fitness and activity-based sightseeing in locations like Cote d’Azur, Buenos Aires, Costa Rica, Ibiza and Morocco. "
2511,"Excursions include perfume-making in Provence, sunset kayaking in Ibiza, watching polo matches in Buenos Aires, visiting Yves Saint Laurent’s garden, Jardin Majorelle, in Marrakesh. Those adventures are book-ended between fitness classes that range from cardio dance and circuit training to Pilates and foam rolling, and elegant meals are served communally by a local chef at the group’s private villas. For 2019, the company has added trips to Mykonos and Palm Springs. "
2512,"Rates from $3,200 to $5,600 per person, depending on location, room type and length of trip. Airfare and alcohol excluded."
2513,"On a recent Sunday morning, Kate Silvester ran a 5K. She didn’t have to worry about where to park to get to the starting line in time: She just headed out to a biking and running path behind her house and onto a back road."
2514,"Her race was a virtual 5K associated with the NYC Half, which was run in New York the same day."
2515,"Virtual challenges and runs are part of a growing trend in recreational running: doing a race whenever you can, wherever you can, and still feeling as if you’re part of the crowd, even if you’re running alone."
2516,"Bob Bickel, founder of the race registration platform Run Sign Up, said the organization saw virtual races pop up “in earnest” about five years ago. One of the first popular virtual runs, he said, was that of Jeff Galloway, a running coach who trains runners using a run-walk-run method. In 2018, 1,050 people finished Mr. Galloway’s virtual events, which included a 5K and half marathon."
2517,"“People are used to running with their apps, and I think more and more people are comfortable with connecting virtually,” Mr. Bickel said, “whether it’s on Facebook or Instagram or Snapchat, people can actually have friendships even though they don’t see each other.”"
2518,"Ms. Silvester, 44, of Plainsboro, N.J., said her first virtual run came through the tracking app Run Keeper. In 2017, she was new to the sport, and she’d been using the app to track her progress. She saw that she could participate in a “challenge” event, where runners who donated $35 to Beat Nb, a nonprofit that funds research for the childhood cancer neuroblastoma, got a T-shirt for completing the run."
2519,"She’d done traditional races before, but as a single mother of two who works full time, she liked the flexibility of something virtual."
2520,Virtual runs are structured in various ways.
2521,"Disney’s Virtual Run 5K series started in 2016 and uses the honor system. Runners can download bibs to wear to do the virtual runs. When they finish one — or all — of the three 5Ks in the series, they can download a finisher’s bib and are mailed a medal."
2522,"“It was an interesting opportunity for us to really keep people involved with runDisney year round,” said Faron Kelley, vice president of Disney Sports. Most on-site runDisney events are held in cooler months, so the Virtual Run 5K series is held in the summer. Last year’s series, which was themed to “The Incredibles,” had about 18,000 participants. This year’s series, with registration opening on May 7, is Marvel themed, with each 5K costing $40; doing all three, which includes a fourth medal for completing them all, costs $145. RunDisney also puts on a virtual Star Wars Half Marathon in the winter and early spring — for 2019, it costs $59 (and is open through March 31)."
2523,"The Great Pumpkin Run virtual race series also uses the honor system. For $35, runners are mailed a race hoodie and a bib. Previously, the race sent race medals after runners submitted their times, but this year, Courtney Young, co-founder of the race, said medals will be mailed along with the hoodie and bib. “People want that instant gratification,” she said. Ms. Young said the race has also worked with Strava, an exercise tracking app, but it’s not a requirement; they trust that runners aren’t lying."
2524,"The Great Pumpkin Run started as a traditional race series in 2012, but the virtual option has taken off since it was introduced in 2016. The first year, 300 runners did the virtual option; last year there were close to 14,000. “I think it’s helping people get into the sport,” Ms. Young said. It appeals to runners who may not be able to show up to a race on a certain time and day, or who are intimidated by running with other people in their first race."
2525,"The New York Road Runners added virtual runs to its race roster in 2018, and this year it has 12, most themed to a holiday or event, like the Resolution Run 5K or the Valentine’s Duo 5K. It also had a virtual half marathon and 5K connected to last weekend’s NYC Half, the one Ms. Silvester ran."
2526,"The New York Road Runners’ virtual races are free, unless runners are using them as a way to get into a sellout race. In 2018, the organization opened 500 spots for runners to run a virtual marathon, which, if they completed it, would get them a race medal and guaranteed entry into the New York City Marathon this year (it cost $150, compared to $295 to run in the actual marathon; they also got a finisher medal but no finisher shirt). For guaranteed entry into the 2020 Brooklyn Half Marathon, runners can sign up for and complete each of six virtual races, at $20 per race. They also get access to a virtual trainer as part of their fee."
2527,"While runners can use whatever GPS watch or app they want to track their run, they must upload it into the Strava app in order for it to count."
2528,The virtual runs started with the question of “how can we continue to engage and extend our impact across the global running community and provide ways in which people can run with us without being here in New York City?” said New York Road Runners president and chief executive Michael Capiraso.
2529,"For Ms. Silvester, Sunday’s virtual run was part of her recovery from an injury. “It was only my third run since getting back from injuring my hip flexor, so I took it pretty slow and included walk breaks, but I did it,” she said."
2530,"She’s hoping to do the Brooklyn Half next year, which would be her first half marathon. “It’s hard to picture myself getting to a half marathon in the next year or so, but it was good to get back into running after a long break,” she said."
2531,"PARIS — Deep in the concrete bowels of the Palais de Tokyo, the modern art museum of Paris, down a plunging staircase with walls covered in angry graffiti, amid racks of clothes and roaming models (some of whom were sporting little horns jutting from their foreheads, or with flattened noses), the designer Rick Owens pshawed about current events and the state of the world."
2532,"“I’m tired of thinking about doom and decline,” he said."
2533,"At the end of a week in which the denuclearization of North Korea did not happen and a soap opera of testimony in Washington, D.C. did, you kind of know what he’s talking about. In any case, he was thinking about something else: glamour, the kind you earn, not the kind that comes with entitlement. It appears to be making something of a comeback."
2534,"And that got him thinking about Cecil B. DeMille in the 1930s and Larry LeGaspi, the man who created the style of Kiss in the 1970s — and whose work deeply influenced Mr. Owens (he has a book on the designer coming out later this year). Also Charles James, the couturier, and the lush fabrics and prints of Mariano Fortuny."
2535,So he decided to tell an epic story of his own.
2536,"He did it in sharp, tailored coats over layers of snap-crotch maillots — “sex where the woman is in control,” he said — and jackets with curving, raised-seam shoulders in silver cowhide or shearling, like folded angel wings. In jersey dresses draped in increasingly complex twists and peekaboo turns around the body, trailing like the traces of ball gowns past onto the floor, and columns of red and fuchsia. He did it with body modification as a reminder of the right to self-definition, and with a supple dignity."
2537,"There’s been a lot of protective clothing around this season, a lot of battering-ram shoulders and storm trooper boots and swaddling duvets for when you just can’t take it any more."
2538,"At Balmain, Olivier Rousteing added spikes to Easter egg bouclés and stiff princess skirts (hug, and you risk impalement), crunched biker patent leather into thigh-high nail-spiked boots and flowing capes, and otherwise decorated dangerously in a 1980s remix of plastic-covered denim and sheer Swiss-dot blouson jumpsuits and extreme encrustation. He has no fear of the overblown."
2539,"But the most evocative clothes are waging a battle of a different kind: one for the values of the silver screen over reality television; for the work of history over the blink-and-you’ll-miss-it reaction to whatever just arrived in your feed; for temptation that comes with a moral center. In the melee, streetwear, the flavor of the most recent moment, is falling by the wayside."
2540,Mr. Owens is not the only one who believes it is time to move on.
2541,"At Paco Rabanne, Julien Dossena broke the bonds of 1960s futurism in a terrific Jean Harlow-meets-Jimi Hendrix hybrid of duchess satin-swagged cocktail dresses, silver chain mail bias slips; Art Deco peacock-print rock star suiting and leopard spots. Backstage, his face lit up as he described watching old Audrey Hepburn movies and Marilyn Monroe in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,” and buying his own first real piece of fashion (a pair of Raf Simons trousers) and how with that, confidence came."
2542,"At Y/Project, Glenn Martens laid thin strips of vinyl over sheaths to create slithers of shine, looped faux fur-lined military skirts up and around, and raised the panniers of Versailles from hips to shoulders, so silk gowns became tents swaying around the body."
2543,"And at Loewe, Jonathan Anderson offered an elegantly pointed meditation on the selfie and 16th- and 17th-century cameos (the connection between the two), juxtaposing the now-and-then by setting the cool of a black riding coat against the frippery of handkerchief-hem skirts trimmed in Elizabethan lace; needle punching ribbed cream knits into organdy petticoats; and flopping a cravat and balloon sleeves out from under a basic black knit tank. The details mattered."
2544,"Tweed capes were trimmed in falls of feathers, and a jacket was nipped in at the waist and pinched in back — almost as if grabbed by a hand, to flare over the hips. A pearl-encrusted sweater was paired with a giant jeans (big pants are a trend). There were some bouncing, big yarn pompoms and winged skull caps with a beanie top, drawing a thin line from the court of Mary, Queen of Scots to the court of the influencer. The current convulsive instant may pass but not so much the human condition."
2545,"There is a depth and emotional connection in these clothes that just doesn’t exist in Virgil Abloh’s Off-White, though even Mr. Abloh — he of the ironic quotes and collaborator cool — was toying with the old razzle-dazzle: showing a sleeping-bag-size silver puffer over a Lurex silver union suit, followed by a silver satin jacket and shorts, followed by a silver satin evening coat."
2546,"They stood out amid the racecar checks and leather sweats, the oversize faded denim painter’s pants and utilitarian body-con knits dangling — well, it wasn’t clear what they were; straps? But Mr. Abloh’s reference points seem to have more to do with his peer group than any larger idea. At the end, a troika of billowing, beachy ball gowns appeared, slit to the thigh and worn over micro shorts."
2547,"Maybe they were supposed to lighten things up. Begone, ye political and ecological angst! The problem is that they looked, like the material they were made from and the whole collection itself, awfully unconvincing."
2548,"In Dalston, a dynamic pocket of East London, an edgy arts scene blooms amid repurposed factories, side streets sprinkled with tiny shops, tucked-away public gardens and colorful outdoor markets catering to longtime Afro-Caribbean and Turkish communities. Cool kids and chess-playing old-timers commune over thick Ethiopian espresso at Kaffa Coffee, a neighborhood institution. Fashion statements abound: Men in cropped shirts and voluminous trousers. Women tattooed and accessorized to the nines. And inventively clad millennials, more than a few affiliated with the designer ateliers headquartered here. Indie artists are a buzzy fixture in Dalston, flowing in and out of a D.J. booth run by NTS, the influential internet radio station on lively Gillett Square."
2549,"This 10-year-old gallery’s calling card is provocative artwork by the likes of Oddly Head, Nina Saunders, David Shrigley, Harland Miller and Banksy. (There is a dedicated downstairs “bunker” devoted to the elusive street artist.) In the evenings, compelling events have involved the unveiling of hip-hop icon Run-DMC’s Darryl McDaniels’s comic art (along with an intimate performance) and a collaboration between The Connor Brothers and Nadya Tolokonnikova of feminist punk rock group Pussy Riot in support of refugees."

2551,"Down an unmarked stairwell off the main drag of Stoke Newington Road, you’ll find LN-CC (which stands for Late Night Chameleon Café, even though it’s not a cafe). The eight-year-old spot is a high-concept, subterranean boutique with six “lifestyle” rooms interconnected by a glowing, 40-foot-long cylindric wooden tunnel. Recognizable brands (Gucci, Rick Owens, Raf Simons) are mixed with niche ones: Veja sneakers, Venczel handbags and GmbH, a clubby men’s wear brand. The library room is stocked with esoteric books and vinyl, while a back bar and club space is used for fashion events, yoga classes and frequent “music listening” parties in a neighborhood that is home to many record labels."

2553,"On the ground floor of a warehouse turned creative work space, this airy cafe offers playful takes on brunch dishes — chili-poached eggs, cauliflower toast drizzled with toasted sunflower tahini, smashed avocado garnished with edible flowers, lattes with housemade nut milks. The industrial particleboard walls, table legs fashioned of rebar and plants suspended by commercial steel cable (plus repurposed Victorian pub lighting) lends to the D.I.Y. charm of this three-year-old spot.

2557,"In this resale shop, which opened nine years ago, the owners, Ochuko Ojiri and Juliet Da Silva source eye-catching (and reasonably priced) vintage clothing and decorative objects. Gucci and Versace print tops, Moschino biker jackets and retro dresses from lesser-known Italian brands line the perimeter of the room. In the main space, you’ll find midcentury furniture and bric-a-brac — namely, Victorian cloche jars, African feathered headdresses and ‘60s-inspired ceramics. Head upstairs for pieces from obscure labels: leather-fringed tops, straw hats, scarves, jeans, swimsuits and other accouterments for the budget-conscious."

2560,"Situated on the coast of central Vietnam, the former commercial port of Hoi An offers endless wonders, from fishermen launching bamboo basket boats along palm-fringed beaches, to farmers in conical hats harvesting rice in swathes of green paddies. But the marquee attraction is the well-preserved ancient town, brushed mustard yellow and festooned with colorful silk lanterns. Many of the wooden merchant houses and ornate temples and assembly halls — a fusion of styles from China, Europe and Japan — date back to Hoi An’s prime in the 1700s. By the early 1800s, though, the river port was supplanted by Danang to the north, and largely forgotten. Unesco World Heritage site status in 1999 boosted a revival, and in recent years mass tourism has landed hard, with multitudes of tour buses and resorts. Still, Hoi An holds plenty of charm, with budget-friendly prices and a vibrant gastronomic scene."
2561,"Many of the narrow, two-story shophouses have been repurposed with restaurants, cafes and a glut of tailor and leather shops. But several have been frozen in time and opened to tourists, like the two-century-old Tan Ky house. Start your old town tour here (120,000 dong, or about $5.15, for entry to five of the more than 20 historic sites), and roam its 100-foot length, past intricately carved columns and beams, through the open-roof courtyard, to a wall in the back, marked with the height of fall floods. Next up is Phuc Kien, one of five assembly halls built by Chinese merchants to plot trade deals and honor ancestors. Its sea goddess temple holds an unforgettable life-size statue of an aquamarine-skinned immortal with protruding ribs and bulging white eyes. End up at the Japanese covered bridge, an arched pagoda built in 1593 and later reconstructed by the Chinese and Vietnamese. Its roof is adorned with the town’s ubiquitous alternating rows of yin yang tiles."
2562,2) 3 p.m. Silk row
2563,"Spinning and selling silk to foreign traders was a thriving business in Hoi An centuries ago. Now the transactions occur inside more than 600 tailor shops. The quality and fit can be hit or miss. (Bring a favorite garment to be copied and allow time for alterations; turnaround is within 24 hours. My wife was thrilled with silk pants, 940,000 dong each, from Le Le Cloth Shop.) If you’re more interested in the silk-making process, stop by Thang Loi for a tour and watch how silkworms munch on mulberry leaves and create cocoons that yield nearly 1,000 yards of thread, woven on a clacking loom."
2564,"Since he first traveled to Vietnam 27 years ago, Didier Corlou has been on a mission to promote its cuisine through his cookbooks and restaurants in Hanoi. Now the renowned French chef is serving up his passion in Hoi An at Co Mai. Opened last year with his co-chef wife, Hoang Phuong Mai, the restaurant fittingly occupies a former spice house. The tasting menu (395,000 dong) is your best bet for a bounty of “Hoi An on the plate,” as Mr. Corlou puts it. Recently, the fresh and flavorful mains of braised pork, Saigon Marseille curry and barracuda in banana leaf followed starters like banana flower salad with chicken, and fried rolls with mackerel and pork and mushroom. Save room for the dessert tray that includes mango sorbet and banana cake with caramelized cream."
2565,"The town starts to shut down around 9 p.m., but a few bars stay open late. Watch boat owners coax tourists onto the river from the curbside tables at Shamrock Irish Pub, which features a craft stout from Saigon’s Heart of Darkness brewery, or shoot pool to classic rock at the Dive Bar on Nguyen Thai Hoc street. The closest thing to a speakeasy is Tadioto, a new whisky bar in the French Quarter. It’s hidden behind An Store clothing boutique, which leads to Tadioto’s sushi counter in the stone courtyard and then to the elegant bar in the back.  Sip Tadioto’s namesake scotch (180,000 dong) or Suntory’s Hibiki (250,000 dong). Open till midnight. (Nguyen Qui Duc, the owner, is set to open a Japanese grill and beer garden next door in the spring.)"
2566,"Most hotels and home-stays include bikes, so cycle out to the rice paddies between the town and the beach and marvel at acres of green patched with shrimp and fish ponds. Ride along sandy paths under canopies of coconut trees, past lolling water buffalos and farmers ushering flocks of ducks into narrow canals. Pull into the Tra Que Vegetable Village, organic gardens where you can take an 8 a.m. tour and learn how to till the sandy soil and plant red leaf lettuce before sampling just-picked greens at breakfast in the shade of the outdoor cooking school and cafe. The waiters will show you how to assemble a roll of rice-flour-and-egg pancake with mint, lemon basil and lettuce. Tour and breakfast 280,000 dong."
2567,A starter kit for escaping into the world.
2568,"Coffee in Vietnam is a sit-down affair, often on a sidewalk at child-size plastic chairs and tables. For a delightful twist on the traditional condensed milk iced coffee, take a seat riverside at Cong Caphe, with its Communist army décor, for a coconut-milk-and-cream coffee smoothie (45,000 dong). For a more refined coffee break with larger chairs, try Mia Coffee amid a low-slung row of French colonials on Phan Boi Chau street. Le Quang Huy, the owner, sources beans from the mountains of Dalat, roasts them on site and compresses cappuccinos (37,000 dong) and traditional Vietnamese brews (30,000 dong) with a machine from Seattle."
2569,"Hoi An is known for several local dishes like white rose dumplings and chicken rice. Most emblematic of its multicultural past is Cao Lau — with the flavors of Japan in the thick rice noodles, China in the soy pork and France in the rice flour croutons. Try it at Hoi An Market. Barnlike, it stretches from the river, where a riot of tables loaded with papaya and dragon fruit lead to the raw meat counters inside, then to stalls loaded with incense and spices, and women napping on benches (it opens at 6 a.m.) The main hall is filled with about 60 brightly lit glass hutches stocked with spring rolls and plates of orange shrimp. Perch at the metal counter at No. 50 and plop fresh greens into a bowl of cao lau spiced with red chili paste. Lunch for two 150,000 dong."
2570,"Take a truncated tour of Vietnam’s ethnic communities at the Precious Heritage Museum, opened in 2017 by the French photographer Réhahn. He spent eight years traveling to 53 of the country’s 54 ethnic groups, photographing villagers and collecting costumes, including a tree bark jacket on display upstairs. The free museum in the French Quarter is also a gallery of Réhahn’s portraits, on sale as postcards for 30,000 dong, up to large, metallic paper prints for tens of thousands of dollars. If he’s there, he’ll share the backstory of his most famous shot, “Hidden Smile,” a close-up of a puckish woman in a conical hat covering her forehead and mouth with her hands. The portrait was presented to President Emmanuel Macron of France by Communist officials last year. On most mornings the subject, 80-year-old Bui Thi Xong, is on the river in Hoi An (near Cargo restaurant) offering rides in her row boat."
2571,"Even if you didn’t mean to, you may find yourself in one of Trinh Diem Vy’s eight restaurants in and around the old city. Definitely make it to Vy’s Market. Its food-court-meets-street-cart setup has 200-plus traditional dishes, from steamed pig brains to monk fish curry. Try the beef rolled in betel leaves (105,000 dong) and the pumpkin curry served in the gourd (85,000 dong). As tasty as those are, do not miss the squid stuffed with pork (175,000 dong). The meat is minced with mushrooms and spring onions and peppered with spices, and the pan is caramelized by the fried squid skin."
2572,"After dinner, step into the side street and Hoi An’s main night market. Zigzag through the banana pancake carts and shuffling tour groups, to a row of stalls alight with silk lanterns. Make your way across the footbridge (mind the bikers pedaling through the throngs) to a small square with elevated bamboo huts where locals gather for a sort of singing bingo. On certain nights, you’ll find families curbside at metal drums burning fake money and other offerings for ancestors. Every night, you’ll find touts offering river rides. For 120,000 dong for 15 minutes, step into a little wooden boat, join the flotilla and watch an oil painting come to life, the profusion of lanterns on the boats and river bank reflecting on the dark, crinkled water."
2573,"Within a half-hour drive of the ancient town, you can ride a basket boat through river channels thick with water coconut trees or climb the steps of the Marble Mountain into caves with towering Buddhas. This being a beach town, why not just relax at Tan Thanh Beach? Not as busy as An Bang Beach to the north, this stretch of sea and sand is mesmerizing with a moderate surf, and view of the Cham Islands on the horizon. You can’t go wrong with a coffee or a smoothie at Salt Pub or Sound of Silence, where you can use the lounges and thatched gazebos and on a clear day see the skyscrapers of Danang in miniature up the coast."
2574,"Some of the best discoveries are along the narrow walkways off the ancient town. That’s where you’ll find Nu Eatery, just west of the Japanese bridge, in a distressed looking former house with three small rooms and a balcony for dining. Phuc Ngo honed his craft at restaurants in New York City before returning to Vietnam in 2014 to open Nu. He calls it modern Vietnamese, which like American food, is “a mix of everything,” he said. That produces delectable dishes like avocado salad with sweet potato, fried egg and lima beans; vegetarian rice with charred eggplant, mustard greens and mushrooms, and steamed buns with pork belly, pickles and spicy mayo. Lunch for two, 270,000 dong."
2575,"Through Airbnb you can find a charming room in one of Vietnam’s ubiquitous homestays, where local families open several rooms in their homes for visitors. You can book one with a balcony and en suite bathroom for $20 to $30 a night. Escape the Ancient Town crowds on the edge of farmland north of the town off Hai Ba Trung or along a tributary of the Thu Bon River east of town. Near the sea, where prices are a bit higher, you can’t go wrong at Tan Thanh Beach. "
2576,"Steps away from the historic core, Ha An Hotel mimics the heritage streetscape with double doors, arches and balustrades fronting handsome and cozy rooms decorated with local pottery and prints. Open since 2003, with 24 rooms, doubles start at $65."
2577,"In a shophouse 200 years old, Vinh Hung 1 Heritage hotel is perhaps the only place where tourists can stay in the ancient town core. But its six spacious, wood-plank rooms will likely be booked months in advance. Doubles cost about $100."
2578,"For some tropical bliss with stunning views, book a seafront room at the Victoria Hoi An Resort. Built in 2000 between the river and the sea, its breezy main building and 109 ample rooms blend French colonial and Asian architectural styles, with pitched, beamed ceilings and dark wood floors. Doubles start at $140."

2580,I will die before I buy another car.
2581,"I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend."
2582,"Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?"
2583,Finished. 
2584,[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]
2585,"This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think."
2586,"Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. "
2587,"But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. "
2588,"That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought."
2589,"I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”"
2590,"But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank."
2591,"Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?"
2592,Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.
2593,"But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. "
2594,"Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon."
2595,"Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized."
2596,"That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all."
2597,"It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)"
2598,"It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. "
2599,"Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. "
2600,"But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not."
2601,"Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all. Anyone interested in a car with a loose clutch?"

2604,"Last week, at the tail end of New York Fashion Week, in a private suite at the Soho Grand Hotel, models with Day-Glo yellow eyelashes and matching parkas dotted the room. They held handbags with the initials LBV molded in gold, and a few carried yellow ice axes. "
2605,"Some looked ready to climb — gilded carabiners sparkled here and there, and the models wore chunky Lowa climbing boots — though others wore see-through lace skirts over their bodysuits. “Designer’s own,” said the designer, Joss Sackler, looking down at a model’s boots and at her own. She was wearing them with a neon-yellow hoodie and her own pair of neon-yellow eyelashes. "
2606,"Mrs. Sackler, 34, is the proprietress of LBV, a private social club, from where this collection, LBV Care of Joss Sackler, grew. Mrs. Sackler is an avid climber, so she tailored the clothes to suit her lifestyle: hazard yellow for boulder safety, still a cute look for driving home from the Gunks and going straight to dinner; or a white shirt to throw on over bike shorts after the gym for the school run. "
2607,"“Everything has to transition,” she said. “I have three kids. It has to be easy.”"
2608,"LBV grew out of a separate interest, in wine. Wanting to share the appreciation of wine with more women than were in the prestigious wine fraternities Mrs. Sackler belonged to, like the Confrérie des Chevaliers du Tastevin, the Commanderie des Costes du Rhône and the Commanderie de Bordeaux, she founded one of her own. "
2609,"LBV, she was somewhat hesitant to admit, stood for Les Bouledogues Vigneronnes: the winemaking bulldogs. (“We have a French bulldog,” she said.)"
2610,"The women — and now a few men — who are dues-paying members of LBV are a multifaceted lot, with varied interests, and Mrs. Sackler expanded the society beyond wine to be a social club, with classes and lectures, visits to fashion designers’ studios, workout classes and dinners honoring contemporary artists. (There is still plenty of wine.) "
2611,"Membership fees begin at $500 annually and go up to $2,500, and Mrs. Sackler estimated that membership hovers at around 50 people. "
2612,"Though some stores attended the fashion presentation or made appointments to see the collection, the primary mode of sale will be through LBV’s website, and members will get preferential pricing. Some, Mrs. Sackler said, were sprinkled around the room: one of the models in the presentation and a stylist who had helped shape it."
2613,"“Most importantly, LBV is a collective,” Mrs. Sackler said. “Everybody wants everyone to do well. We’re all rooting for each other, and we have an awesome team of supportive people.” Mrs. Sackler does not have design training, though she is working on the collection with a designer who worked in French couture. "
2614,"“When you’re, like, ‘Did you work with anyone?’” she went on, “Yeah, I worked with my friends. And my friends are LBV.” "
2615,"If Mrs. Sackler’s name sounds familiar, it is probably not for the reasons she would like. "
2616,"Mrs. Sackler is married to David Sackler, whose family owns Purdue Pharma, the makers of the prescription painkiller OxyContin. Purdue and the members of the Sackler family behind it have been accused of fomenting, and profiting from, the American opioid epidemic. "
2617,"Last June, the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, filed suit against Purdue Pharma, eight members of the Sackler family (including David Sackler) and several others, alleging that they had misled doctors and patients about the risks of the drug. "
2618,"“Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit,” the complaint states. An amended filing in January included further allegations about the roles played by the Sackler family specifically. David Sackler, a board member from 2012 to 2018, is cited as one of “eight people in a single family” who “made the choices that caused much of the opioid epidemic.” "
2619,"In a statement, Purdue Pharma said that the complaint was “part of a continuing effort to single out Purdue” and that the company and the individual former directors mentioned in the suit “vigorously denies the allegations in the complaint and will continue to defend themselves against these misleading and deliberately inflammatory allegations.”"
2620,"The Sackler family is one of the richest in America, and has given generously and philanthropically over the years to a large number of institutions, many of which have named schools, research centers, wings, libraries, courtyards, halls and even escalators for them. "
2621,"There is a Serpentine Sackler Gallery in London; a Sackler Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; and a Sackler Center for Arts Education at the Guggenheim, where days before the LBV presentation, protesters rained down white slips of paper meant to suggest OxyContin prescriptions. "
2622,"It was part of a demonstration by Prescription Addiction Intervention Now, a group whose founders include the artist Nan Goldin, a recovering opioid addict. The group had previously staged a protest at the Met. "
2623,"Given the fury that surrounds the Sackler family, it may stand to reason that Mrs. Sackler’s name would be a liability. When the question was put to her, Mrs. Sackler fell silent and looked away."
2624,"“Not at all,” said Elizabeth Tuke, the publicist for the label. “Everyone here who’s been a part of this society knows Joss’s family. They all are big supporters of Joss.” LBV, she added, is “its own entity completely separate from that — aside from that Joss’s last name is Sackler.” "
2625,Mrs. Sackler looked up.
2626,"“It’s been positive,” she said. “All around positive.”"
2627,The authorities charged a man on Monday in connection with nearly a dozen shootings in and around a Southern California state park that left a father dead as he camped with his two young daughters and terrorized two affluent communities for almost two years.
2628,"The suspect, Anthony Rauda, 42, was charged with murder in the June 2018 killing of Tristan Beaudette, 35, a scientist shot while he was inside a tent with his children at Malibu Creek State Park in the Santa Monica Mountains outside Los Angeles. His children were not hurt in the attack."
2629,"Mr. Rauda, a felon who was on parole at the time of the attacks, was also charged with 10 counts of attempted murder in the shootings beginning in November 2016 in and around the park, which abuts the upscale communities of Calabasas and Malibu."
2630,"He was arrested in October after sheriff’s deputies saw him on a ridge dressed in black with a rifle sticking out of his backpack, according to The Associated Press. They were searching the area for an armed burglar who stole food from nearby homes and businesses."
2631,"Mr. Rauda was sentenced in November to 160 days in county jail for violating the terms of his post-release community supervision, said Shiara Davila-Morales, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor’s office. In December, he was sentenced to 180 days in jail for gun and ammunition violations, she said."
2632,"“There is a huge sense of relief that the suspect has been apprehended and charged with these crimes,” said Alicia Weintraub, the mayor pro tem of Calabasas, which had offered a $5,000 reward for information related to the killing. “It was a very scary time. The fact something like that could happen here was very traumatic and the manner in which it happened was very upsetting.”"
2633,"Fred Gaines, a member of the Calabasas City Council, said the community had “a very, very low crime rate and an extremely low violent crime rate.”"
2634,"“To have an incident where someone is shot and killed is extremely rare,” Mr. Gaines said. “To have an unknown shooter in the community was of significant concern and for some people it was very frightening.”"
2635,"The area has been repeatedly shaken in recent months, first by the killing of Mr. Beaudette and then by the Woolsey Fire, which burned parts of both towns and tore through the verdant canyon park in November. That same month, 12 people were killed in a mass shooting at a country music bar in the nearby town of Thousand Oaks."
2636,"“Following the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the fire that devastated our area, I am really grateful for the hard work of law enforcement who put this to rest,” said Skylar Peak, a member of the Malibu City Council."
2637,"In a statement, prosecutors said the attacks began in November 2016 when the gunman shot James Rogers, who was sleeping in a hammock in the park. The gunman fired into the sleeping area of a parked vehicle less than a week later, they said, and then shot at vehicles in or near the park three times in 2017. No one was injured in those attacks."
2638,"Prosecutors said the attacker again shot at a car last June as it drove down Las Virgenes Road, a major thoroughfare that forms part of the park’s eastern border, but no one was injured. The gunman encountered Mr. Beaudette in a tent with his children four days later, on June 22."
2639,"A camper elsewhere in the park reported hearing gunfire at around 4:45 a.m. on the day Mr. Beaudette was killed, the authorities said in June. When deputies arrived at the camp site, which Mr. Gaines said is plainly visible from Las Virgenes Road, they found Mr. Beaudette with at least one gunshot wound in his upper torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said."
2640,"“The grief and trauma this loss has caused our close-knit family is indescribable,” Mr. Beaudette’s family said in a statement released at the time of his death. “A scientist who loved cooking and microbrews, Tristan was happiest out in nature and spent every chance he could hiking, biking, snowboarding and camping with his family.”"
2641,The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office said Mr. Rauda was also charged in five burglaries that occurred in the Calabasas area last year.
2642,"A spokeswoman for the prosecutor declined to say how law enforcement had connected Mr. Rauda to all of the shootings and burglaries, and a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department did not respond to a request for comment on Monday."
2643,"The Los Angeles County Public Defender’s Office said it would represent him, although a lawyer had not been assigned to his case by Monday."
2644,"Is Nancy Pelosi a climate skeptic? Of course not — and I would know. But you might be excused for thinking so, given the curt wave-off the House speaker delivered to the liberally ballyhooed, legislatively stillborn Green New Deal."
2645,"“The green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it, right?” That was Pelosi talking about the deal as if it were a grandchild’s latest video game obsession. The San Francisco Democrat is nothing if not a political realist, and that kind of realism means that no Congress is going to mobilize the country to fight climate change as if it were an alien invasion, as my colleague Farhad Manjoo recently suggested."
2646,"Higher mileage standards, more subsidies for wind and solar, signing the Paris climate deal? Those are the sorts of policies Nancy Pelosi believes in, and would happily endorse if stars align under a future Democratic president."
2647,"But obtaining 100 percent of America’s power needs through renewable energy, “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to meet “maximal” efficiency standards, and dealing with the issue of cow flatulence by reducing meat consumption, as the Green New Deal proposes? Fuhgeddaboudit."
2648,"Then again, if climate change is a potentially humanity-wrecking event, why shouldn’t we treat it as an alien-invasion equivalent? Let’s assume the most dire predictions are right and we don’t have a moment to lose in substantially decarbonizing the global economy, no matter what the financial cost or political pain. In that case, isn’t Pelosi’s incrementalist approach to climate absurdly inadequate?"
2649,"Isn’t it, in fact, like trying to put out a forest fire with a plant mister?"
2650,Marxists of old liked to talk about the fundamental contradictions of capitalism. Today we should also reckon with the contradictions of climate policy. Are we dealing with a problem so severe that it requires the political and economic equivalent of war socialism? Or should we think of climate change roughly the same way we think about global poverty — a serious problem we can work patiently to solve without resort to extreme measures like ending capitalism or depriving equally serious priorities of the attention they deserve?
2651,"If it’s the former, then another windmill subsidy or carbon-trading scheme won’t do. We need to take extreme measures: to declare a national emergency, strictly ration every citizen’s carbon footprint, raise taxes on the rich and middle class alike to fund trillions of dollars in green infrastructure projects worldwide, and even impose economic sanctions on China and India if they don’t stop building new coal plants. "
2652,"If the latter, however, then can we at least end the apocalyptic talk, especially since we aren’t prepared to take more than piecemeal steps?"
2653,"So far, activists have been able to elide this contradiction, claiming both that climate change is a World War III-level challenge, and that we can deal with it relatively easily. That may do wonders for public awareness — do your part and bike to work! — but it is self-deceiving, if not dishonest. Whatever else might be said of it, the Green New Deal blows the lid off that delusion. It’s a remarkably honest attempt to offer a massive answer to what its authors see as an epochal problem."
2654,"Yet its virtue is also its undoing. The Green New Dealers may want to spend trillions on a climate moonshot (and trillions more on their other policy hobbyhorses). Most people don’t even want to spend pennies, at least if it’s their own money. In November, voters in Washington rejected a carbon fee by a margin of 12 percentage points. That’s a blue state. Endorsements of the Green New Deal may have rolled in from Democratic presidential hopefuls, but the chances of them enacting any of it if they take office are about as great as Scott Pruitt being elected to the board of the Sierra Club. Even Barack Obama didn’t endorse a gas tax when he had a chance to do so in 2009."
2655,"All of this means that climate activists should get wise to a central fact: If Pelosi is skeptical of their policies, where do they imagine the rest the country is? Those who believe climate change will become irreversible, uncontrollable and catastrophic in a few years should get to work on their fallout shelters. The E.P.A. won’t be coming to the rescue."
2656,"By contrast, those who think climate change is a real but manageable problem would do well to say as much, too. Climate change means change, not doom. It shouldn’t be hard to make the case, even to conservatives, for large-scale investments in climate resilience, such as better coastal defenses. It shouldn’t be hard, either, to make the case even to liberals that dynamic market economies are essential for creating the kind of wealth that makes environmental protections affordable, along with the innovations that make environmental fixes possible."
2657,"Pelosi’s seal clap sealed the fate of the Green New Deal. Now it’s time to move climate policy beyond impractical radicalism and feckless virtue-signaling to something that can achieve a plausible, positive and bipartisan result."

2660,"WASHINGTON — When Amazon canceled its plans to build an expansive corporate campus in New York City this week, officials more than 200 miles away in Northern Virginia decided to make a statement."
2661,"Their message: Their region has its act together, they have been far more prepared, and they were free of drama."
2662,"The comments came from those in the area that has branded itself National Landing, an amalgamation of Arlington and Alexandria neighborhoods that was the other winner in Amazon’s sweepstakes last year to award massive new campuses."
2663,"But after landing Amazon, National Landing faded from the spotlight as attention focused on New York City. In New York, lawmakers, progressive activists and union leaders began contending that Amazon, one of the world’s biggest tech companies, did not deserve nearly $3 billion in government incentives to open a campus there."
2664,The politicking grew heated. Then came Amazon’s very public breakup with New York on Thursday.
2665,"“A number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward,” Amazon said about New York in a statement."
2666,"In Northern Virginia, officials wasted little time. Within hours, Christian Dorsey, the chairman of the Arlington County Board, held a call with reporters."
2667,"“I can’t speculate what went wrong” in New York, Mr. Dorsey said, “and I don’t really care to think about it much.” But he discussed how his area had done a better job of planning for Amazon, persuading the company to come and then rolling out an infrastructure and development plan to make its arrival possible."
2668,"“It highlighted a particular community dynamic in a region that has its act together,” Mr. Dorsey said. He added that Amazon hadn’t changed its plans to bring 25,000 jobs to National Landing by 2030, with the potential to increase that to 38,000 employees later."
2669,"Monica Backmon, the executive director of the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority, was even more direct."
2670,"“Oh, yes, we are pleased,” she said. “It speaks to certainty that we know what we are doing and put a lot of planning and effort early on into it.”"
2671,"From the beginning, Virginia officials said, their preparations differed sharply from those of other cities that applied to Amazon. Residents and others were generally welcoming, in contrast to the steady drumbeat of protests in New York."
2672,"For years, the region had planned and made improvements to roads, subways, trains and bike lanes to accommodate a major corporation like Amazon, Ms. Backmon said."
2673,"A bipartisan state board of legislative leaders that reviews major incentive deals had many hours of discussions on Amazon before an agreement was reached for the new campus, said Stephen Moret, who runs the Virginia Economic Development Partnership."
2674,"“The fact that that group exists and was so heavily engaged periodically throughout the 14 months was a major contributor for how well things have rolled out at the state level,” Mr. Moret said in a recent interview. He said Arlington and Alexandria officials had been briefed about Amazon in closed sessions multiple times as well."
2675,"Late last month, the Virginia legislature overwhelmingly passed a $750 million incentive package for Amazon, which the governor signed into law. It provides Amazon with $550 million in grants for the first 25,000 jobs it creates, and $200 million more for creating 12,850 additional jobs in subsequent years."
2676,"Officials in Nashville, which landed a smaller development project from Amazon, with about 5,000 jobs, also drew distinctions between their approach and New York’s. The city and Tennessee offered a combined $102 million in tax incentives, significantly less per job than New York’s multibillion-dollar promise. And Nashville’s offer didn’t come with some of the attention-grabbing perks that New York’s did."
2677,"“We don’t have a helipad,” said Thomas Mulgrew, press secretary for Mayor David Briley, referring to New York’s promise to help Amazon secure access to a helicopter-landing facility near its planned Queens campus. “I read that and thought, ‘Oof, that’s going to be a tough one.’”"
2678,Critics of Amazon and its expansion strategy celebrated the company’s withdrawal from New York as a victory and said they were emboldened to turn their sights on Northern Virginia and Nashville.
2679,"“Do not come to our cities expecting to ignore the democratic process and hoard the resources that our communities desperately need,” Local Progress, an organization of local officials, said in a statement."
2680,"Stand Up Nashville, an activist group that has criticized the Amazon project, and other groups have been working for months to rally opposition to the deal and to push for more community involvement in the process. The news from New York this week injected new energy into the movement — and is likely to increase attendance at a public forum the groups were already planning for Friday evening."
2681,"“Since the announcement yesterday, the event has just exploded,” said Anne Barnett, a Stand Up Nashville co-chairwoman. “There’s more interest now than ever.”"
2682,Northern Virginia officials said they recognized that there could be similar protests in their area. But they said their relationship with Amazon was strong.
2683,"“They have been a completely honest broker,” said Mr. Dorsey of the Arlington County Board. “We feel good about their relations thus far.”"
2684,Amazon did not immediately return a call for comment.
2685,"Everyone wants to read more, and over the last few months I’ve finally figured out how to fit more reading into a busy schedule. It’s surprisingly simple: Instead of trawling through Twitter or hitting up Instagram whenever I’ve had a few minutes to spare waiting for a train, I’ve been opening the Kindle app and sticking my nose in a book. Here’s the catch though: What got me started are what I call “bite-sized books”: books made up of loads of small chunks that are easy to dip in and out of, whether you have two minutes free standing in line or an hour to kill on a short-haul flight."
2686,"“Reading more” is one of the most common New Year’s resolutions — and a general be-a-better-human pledge but, like most resolutions, most people fail."
2687,"In last year’s Goodreads Reading Challenge, more than 4.2 million people pledged to read a combined 260 million books — that’s an average of 61 books per person. Of the participants, only 16% — roughly 700,000 of them — finished their challenge. The rest flunked it."
2688,"I suspect a big part of the problem is that books feel like a huge commitment. It’s much harder to motivate yourself to crack open a weighty tome crammed with characters and subplots than to just scroll through Twitter’s ephemera. You’re tired, you only have a few moments and the book probably isn’t as good as everyone says anyway. Instagram is addictive for a reason: it’s there, it’s easy and it hits your dopamine receptors harder than a Dan Brown novel."
2689,"Not all books, however, are big commitments. That’s why bite-sized books are a great way to kick-start your reading. One great example of a bite-sized book is Tim Ferriss’ “Tribe of Mentors.” In the book, Mr. Ferriss interviews over 130 of the “world’s top performers,” from people like Arianna Huffington, founder of The Huffington Post, to Strauss Zelnick, chief executive of video game publisher Take-Two Interactive. The hook is that he asks every interviewee the same set of ten questions. Each interview is only a few pages long so they take minutes to read."
2690,"Over my first few days of reading “Tribe of Mentors,” I found that instead of opening Twitter, Instagram or Facebook when I had time to waste, I opened the Kindle app on my iPhone instead and read an interview. If I just had two minutes, I might only get through three or four questions, but because each one was a complete answer, it didn’t feel like I was constantly being pulled away from some important bit of action."
2691,"For the first time in a long time, reading a book on my phone was just as convenient — and far more interesting — than social media."
2692,Not all books work when they’re read in small snippets. “A Game of Thrones” just won’t make a lot of sense if you dip in and out too much — not that it makes a huge amount of sense without a reference encyclopedia anyway.
2693,"Certain genres of books, on the other hand, work really well. I’ve found essay collections, travel guides and short stories to be the best for me."
2694,"Collections of essays or, even better, columns are a great place to start. Essays tend to be short and totally independent of each other — at most they’re linked by a common theme. While there are often one or two essays in a collection that take an hour or so to read, you can save it for when you’ve got a little more time to kill and just chip away at the shorter ones when you’re at the bus stop."
2695,"If you already have a favorite columnist, see if they’ve published a collection — many prolific ones do. Otherwise, I can wholeheartedly recommend Tim Kreider’s two collections, “We Learn Nothing” and “I Wrote This Book Because I Love You;” “Consider the Lobster and Other Essays” by David Foster Wallace; “How Did You Get This Number” by Sloane Crosley; “Arguably” by Christopher Hitchens; and “A Slip of the Keyboard” by Terry Pratchett (and dozens more if you reach out to me on Twitter!)"
2696,"Good travel guides are also perfect bite-sized books. I’m a big fan of Lonely Planet’s trip guides like “Epic Drives of the World,” “Epic Hikes of the World” and “Epic Bike Rides of the World.” Each one is packed with awesome adventure ideas — a perfect distraction on your morning commute. Or, if you already have a vacation planned, grab a good guidebook for your destination and work your way through it. Not only will you be reading more, but your trip will be even better thanks to all the preparation."
2697,"If your tastes skew more toward fiction, consider short stories. While there aren’t many modern writers who do more than dabble with the form, lots of the greats of the last century wrote a ridiculous number. For example, Ernest Hemingway wrote about 60 while Arthur C. Clarke published more than 100. “The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemingway” and “The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke” collect most of each author’s work in one affordable — if hard to carry — book."
2698,"Even some thrillers can work. There are writers like Dan Brown — “The Da Vinci Code” — and Matthew Reilly — “Ice Station” — who seem incapable of writing more than a thousand words in one go without needing to break it into a new chapter. It gives their books serious pace, but it also means that you get a natural stopping point every few minutes — if you can bear to tear yourself away."
2699,"Really, bite-sized books are what you make of them. I started out with a collection of interviews, gradually moved on to essays and short stories and finally, once I was in the habit of reading any time I had a few minutes to spare, straight-up fiction. Since I use the Kindle app on my phone, I don’t even have to think about carrying a book with me."
2700,"You, however, should do whatever you think will work well for you. Pick a book you reckon you’ll be able to read in a few snatched moments every day, grab a cheap paperback or a copy of the ebook and get stuck in. Before you know it, you’ll have a few titles under your belt, and you’ll have conquered that “read more” challenge you set for yourself at the beginning of the year."
2701,"The 90-minute drive from Tucson to Rancho de la Osa, a recently reopened dude ranch on the border with Mexico, is a lonely one. Turning onto Highway 286, your car may be the only southbound vehicle for 44 miles while the occasional U.S. Border Patrol van trolls north. The road runs directly to the border fence, here made up of eerie metal posts spaced less than a foot apart, at the town of Sasabe. Minutes before reaching it, a right turn onto a dirt road delivers you to the historic adobe ranch, painted a warm terra cotta, with a porch lined with turquoise Adirondack chairs."
2702,"“You got the right place, and we got the right horse,” said a cowboy in the driveway, when I pulled in last winter, fully living up to wrangler stereotype with a handlebar mustache and weathered 10-gallon hat."
2703,"Once, the border fence was such a strong deterrent to visitors that it helped drive the 1920s dude ranch out of business. But, if anything, President Trump’s campaign for a border wall has helped revive interest in a region that already has a barrier at the border."
2704,"“Like Trump or hate Trump, now the border is an attraction,” said Russell True, who with partners, bought Rancho de la Osa at auction complete with its vintage western furnishings and period art in late 2016. They don’t publicize the ranch’s proximity to the border fence and had hoped the border would be a neutral feature of the ranch. Instead, Mr. True said it has piqued the interest of guests. "
2705,"“The first thing they want to do is see the wall,” he said. “We could not have planned for the political shift and that it would become interesting.”"
2706,"Originally opened in the 1920s, Rancho de la Osa drew many celebrated guests, including Joan Crawford, Cesar Romero and John Wayne, for whom three of the 18 bedrooms are named (double room rates from $235 a person, all inclusive). The cowboy actor of the silent film era, Tom Mix, made one of his many films here. Authors checked in too, including the western novelist Zane Grey and Margaret Mitchell. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson led the political A-list along with William Clayton, who drafted the Marshall Plan to aid European countries after World War II in a two-bedroom house on the property."
2707,"More current events also helped drive the ranch out of business, according to Mr. True, who also co-owns White Stallion Ranch near Tucson. In 2010, Jan Brewer then the governor of Arizona, decried beheadings in the desert she said were linked to illegal immigration and drug trafficking, allegations that were never corroborated and that she later called an error on her part. "
2708,"“We just had an absolute, possibly even slightly irrational need to save it,” Mr. True told me as we sat in the main lodge, where the adobe walls are washed in orange, red and yellow hues and an antique leather sofa is embossed with an image of a saddle. “Somebody else would have bought it, but nobody else was going to run it as a dude ranch.”"
2709,"As a dude ranch, the 590-acre Rancho de la Osa, restored and reopened in 2017, offers more than vintage charm. Beyond the central compound, which includes an outdoor swimming pool and a bar in a building dating back to 1720, lies some of the lushest areas of the Sonoran Desert, at about a 3,500-foot elevation, and the distinctive Baboquivari Peak, which is considered sacred to the indigenous Tohono O’odham people."
2710,"Horseback riding is the main activity here but the new owners have expanded activities to include fat-tire electric mountain biking, off-road vehicle tours, clay-pigeon shooting and bird-watching trips to the neighboring Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, a 117,500-acre preserve with grasslands that resemble the savannas of Africa."

2728,"In addition to exploring the desert, morning and afternoon rides introduce guests to the ranch’s veteran wranglers Ross and Lynne Knox. The couple’s stories, including his close brushes with death running pack-mule trains in the Grand Canyon, conjured a western past that doesn’t seem so distant here in some of the more desolate parts of the southern border."
2729,"“If you’re not living on the edge,” he said with a chuckle about his daring cowboy lifestyle, “then you’re taking up too much space.”"
2730,"Of course, the degree to which the desert is deserted is up for debate, and on my first ride I spotted the well-patrolled fence -— mostly out of sight from the ranch dwellings — that undulates east with the hills as far as the eye can see."
2731,"It abruptly stops at the nearby territory of the Tohono O’odham people who have prevented the fence, erected in 2007, from crossing tribal land. When the Knoxes drove me and four fellow guests in an off-road cart to see it, we took turns walking around to the Mexican side of the border and posing for photos. A few foot paths snaked into the hills on the American side staked with spiky ocotillo cactus."
2732,"Still, it was easy to forget about politics in a place where a juvenile great horned owl, flying low at dusk, roosted in a tree just 10 feet from my patio seat, and where cozy rooms with original fireplaces came stocked with mesquite wood. Mr. Knox, a celebrated cowboy poet, recited some of his work after dinner, concluding “when the memories come calling, you still can’t help but pray/Lord, please make me a cowboy again for a day.”"

2734,"Miche Griffin grew up on a farm near Nashville, dreaming of a more exciting life. “As a kid, I was drawing pictures of my loft in New York City,” she said. “Somewhere deep inside, I knew I needed the distraction and the busyness that the city offered.”"
2735,"She arrived in the East Village nearly 30 years ago, feeling like a pioneer and a risk-taker. “That was when Tompkins Square Park was full of tents, and one guy had cooked his girlfriend and fed her to the homeless people,” she said. “That was what I moved to.”"
2736,"Ms. Griffin eventually settled with her partner in a two-bedroom rental in a walk-up building, above a restaurant on a busy East Village block, and their daughter was born not long after. Her partner died about a decade later. "
2737,"Three and a half years ago, their daughter left for college in New England. She was never a city girl at heart, Ms. Griffin said. Even as a child, she agonized about homeless people, and complained that the playground was too loud and disorienting. When she moved away, “She said, ‘I don’t think I’ll live in New York City again.’”"
2738,"With her nest empty, Ms. Griffin, now 51, was ready to upgrade, downsize and escape a block that was increasingly noisy and crowded. “What used to be professionals or bohemians was turning into a party neighborhood,” she said. “It was like a fraternity party, and it is not conducive to daily living.”"
2739,"And the apartment was no longer much of a gathering place. “Ours was the apartment that all the kids came to, and when my daughter went to university it was like I lost five kids and not one,” she said. “I thought it would be healthy for me to have a clean slate.”"
2740,"Ms. Griffin, who works in the field of corporate relocation for international clients, went on the hunt for a one-bedroom with a monthly rent of up to $4,000 for herself and her German shorthaired pointer, Sacha."
2741,"She was willing to live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which had a similar vibe to her beloved East Village, and where she figured she could get a nicer apartment on a better block for a similar rent. She didn’t feel too old for the neighborhood. “My personality totally fits,” she said."
2742,"She had been eyeing the Lewis Steel Building, a converted steel factory with exposed brick and industrial style on North Fourth Street. Most one-bedrooms there were in the low $3,000s."
2743,"At that point, Williamsburg was preparing for the L train to close for repairs. Ms. Griffin works from home, so she thought she could function day to day without the train. But then she reconsidered, fearing she might feel disconnected or spend too much on cabs. "
2744,"“The apartment was right, but the location wasn’t,” she said. “The East Village was the one place I belonged.”"
2745,"She liked the central location of the glassy Avalon Bowery Place, completed more than a decade ago, near the corner of Houston Street. It was across from a Whole Foods Market, with convenient subway access. But her budget would get her only a studio there. “I need to be able to separate my bedroom from my live-work area,” she said."
2746,"A friend from the Tompkins Square Dog Run mentioned the Niko, a brand-new rental building about as far east as possible, at the corner of Avenue D. The size was appealing — a not-overwhelming 12 stories — with a panoramic view from the roof deck."
2747,"Ms. Griffin found herself liking the area, which was more residential and less crowded than she was used to. It felt like the East Village she had known three decades earlier."
2748,"She considered her daily routine. “Rite Aid is right downstairs, and the grocery stores are less expensive,” she said. A Citi Bike station was across the street, and the M14D bus stop was a block away. Both East River Park and Tompkins Square Park were quick trips, for walking Sacha. "
2749,"“She was ready to move to a nice place that was new, where she is not going to have any issues,” said the leasing agent, Adrienn Feher of MNS Real Estate."
2750,"Ms. Feher showed Ms. Griffin a one-bedroom with a terrace, thinking she might like it for the dog, but it was on a low floor with less light than she wanted. Besides, Ms. Griffin knew she would walk Sacha more often if she didn’t have her own outdoor space. She picked a sunny one-bedroom on a higher floor, with windows facing Avenue D. "
2751,"She arrived last fall. “It’s the first time I’ve lived somewhere where everything works,” she said."
2752,"Her rent is $3,475 a month (the building is currently offering two months free on new leases, so her monthly payment came to $3,089 over the lease term). Amenities, slated to be $100 a month, are currently free."
2753,"Ms. Griffin easily fit her Indian teak table in the large living-dining area. “I cook a ton — it’s a passion,” she said. “That is my social life. I am not out at bars.”"
2754,"And she found an unexpected advantage to living so far east: “I get to places quicker because I am right beside the F.D.R. When I was more central, I would get stuck in traffic.”"
2755,"In her new, calmer spot in the East Village, Ms. Griffin has met many neighbors. The building staff — including her first-ever doorman — is friendly, “which was very appealing to me, being an empty nester,” she said. People greet one another on the street. If she is short of change at the deli, she pays the next time. "

2759,"Early in my first go at being a father, I was hijacked by ancient impulses. Our family lived in a rowhouse neighborhood in Philadelphia, and right down the street was a small playground where gangs of boys gathered for games of stickball and basketball. My son loved playing sports. But he was unprepared for what developed as his friends grew older."
2760,"After years together laughing and riding their tricycles and then bikes up and down the block, several of the boys grew angry and mean. Ultimately, they turned on my son, taunting him, leaving him out of their games. He began to trudge home, tail between his legs. And I felt called to action. "
2761,"At first, I tried to bolster his confidence so he would give the playground another go. But one Saturday morning I met him at the front steps and told him he could not come into the house. “You have to figure this out,” I said. “I’ll stay with you as long as you need, but I cannot let you just give up.” "
2762,"He tried to push past me, his humiliation becoming frantic. He melted down, screaming and crying. I kept saying: “You can do it. You don’t have to give up.” A neighbor poked her head out, concerned about what must have sounded like child abuse."
2763,"Did I do the right thing? Even now I’m not sure. He did go back to the playground, and eventually managed some kind of truce with the other kids. He grew up into a fine man, a teacher, and understands I was trying to help, in my clumsy way. But while teaching him to stand up for himself, was I also passing along the prejudice that a boy should override his pain and never back down from a fight? "
2764,"What happened in my son’s peer group was perfectly predictable. Boyhood immerses boys in violence and the bullying that leads to it. High school boys are more likely than girls to have been in a physical fight in the past year and male children are more likely to have been victims of violence. Three types of male violence — violence against women, violence against other men and violence against themselves — are deeply interwoven. "
2765,"Violence springs from what boys learn about what it means to be a man. One researcher observed a small group of preschool boys and noticed how, over two years, they adapted to cultural cues. The ways they dressed, played and related to one another and to their parents changed significantly. They even formed a “Mean Team” to harass girls in their classroom. Another researcher interviewed elementary-school boys and captured their brutally frank stories of punishing other boys who failed to conform. "
2766,"Boys take their experiences to heart, feeling weak and ashamed when they need comfort. Plan International USA, a nonprofit group focused on children’s rights, commissioned a study among 10- to 19-year-olds that found nearly three-quarters of boys said they felt pressure to be physically strong and nearly half of the 14- to 19 year-old male respondents felt pressure to be “willing to punch someone if provoked.” "
2767,"The link between masculine norms and misconduct has been clearly established. A 2017 study of 18- to 30-year-old men from the United States, Britain and Mexico found that the young men who subscribe most to traditional gender identities were unhappier and more prone to bullying and sexual harassment. Nearly 60 percent of the American respondents said their parents were the primary source of these restrictive cues. "
2768,"Boys don’t come into the world with some inborn tendency toward domination or violence. As the Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura explained: “People are not born with preformed repertoires of aggressive behavior. They must learn them.” The problem is rooted in boys’ socialization, which is characterized by physical discipline, control and disdain for weakness. "
2769,"With this template for relating to themselves and to the world, it is not surprising that, compared with girls, adolescent boys and young men abuse tobacco at higher rates, drive more recklessly and engage in riskier sex. In the United States, 75 percent of deaths among 15- to 24-year-olds are of boys and young men. Males are more likely than females to die from injuries sustained in car accidents or falls, and from homicides. Especially when the risks of masculinity are compounded by racism and poverty, too many boys do not survive into manhood. "
2770,"When I was young I went to an urban, all-boys’ high school where the bigger and more violent guys ruled. One spring, after a school dance, the electric charge of a fight surged and a crowd rushed to one of the gym exits. I could make out some of the guys from my lunch table. One of them, an older boy others said was “crazy,” was hauling off and kicking another boy, who died that night from head trauma. "
2771,"I have never forgotten that scene. As a psychologist, I have spoken with many young men who have had similarly harrowing experiences, and I have heard from many parents about the effects on their sons. In the grip of stressful experiences like these, boys often pull away from their families. They become accountable not to those who love them but to a brotherhood they seek to impress. "
2772,"The parents, understandably, feel anxious. Their sons behave a certain way — lackadaisical in school, unkind toward their siblings, anxious or angry or shy — and parents intervene, with concern, irritation, with a hand heavy. They try to give advice and become even more frustrated or alarmed when their sons cannot hear them. "
2773,"Fathers, especially, may feel that times have changed so much since they were boys that their counsel amounts to outdated clichés. And it’s true that this generation of boys is in a much better position than we are to assess the future. But it’s not true that we are not needed — far from it. "
2774,"What parents can do, must do, for their sons is never underestimate the power of listening to them, knowing them, and standing by while they navigate the rough waters of boyhood. Behind every boy who avoids being swept away in the current is someone who holds him — and believes in his ability to hold his own."

2779,"Lyft’s shares rose 8.7 percent in its first day of trading after opening at $87.24, far above the public offering price of $72. By the end of the day, the ride-hailing firm’s market value stood at $26.4 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade. At that level, it was more than 23 times the valuation of the parent company of Hertz, the rental car provider, and bigger than the parent of United Airlines."
2780,"Lyft’s public market debut formalized the rise of the sharing economy, even though persistent questions remain about the effect of gig-type work on people’s quality of life and their wages. When ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber began growing this decade, they hawked their kind of work — where drivers are freelancers who drive only when they want to — as providing flexibility. But with drivers ineligible to receive employee benefits like health care, the businesses have since prompted lawsuits and labor protests."
2781,"Gig economy companies also have not proved a business fundamental: that they can make money. While Lyft and Uber have been expanding rapidly, they have lost close to or more than $1 billion a year. And the companies are spending heavily on new initiatives like food delivery, electric bikes and self-driving vehicles, making profits a distant prospect."
2782,"[Unicorns are riding into the public markets, and their elite early investors will be the biggest winners.]"
2783,"Even so, Lyft’s offering means that people will now own shares of the company in their mutual funds and stock portfolios, giving them more of a vested interest in the financial outcomes of gig economy firms. That will be compounded when Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing operator, goes public in the next few months in what is expected to be the largest initial public offering of the past five years. Uber will almost certainly become part of index funds, which underlie the retirement portfolios of millions of Americans."
2784,"“Their business model is completely reliant on an unsettled issue, which is the status of their drivers,” Veena Dubal, an employment and labor law professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, said of ride-hailing companies. “They’ve been trying to shift risk onto workers, and now they are shifting risk onto investors as well.”"
2785,"Those risks sent jitters through some investors on Friday, with Lyft’s shares falling after opening up strongly. The stock dipped to roughly $80 before declining further near the end of trading to finish the day at $78.29."
2786,"But others turned a blind eye to the steep losses and heavy spending, which bodes well for the herd of other coming tech offerings. Apart from Uber, those set to join the I.P.O. bonanza are Pinterest, the digital pin board; the messaging company Slack; the delivery company Postmates; and the home-fitness company Peloton."
2787,"Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors."
2788,"Interest in buying Lyft’s stock was so high that demand outstripped supply within the first two days of the company’s road show to pitch prospective investors this month. By the end, the I.P.O. was 20 times oversubscribed, Lyft told investors on Friday."
2789,"Lyft’s high listing price and performance are a “reflection of the appetite” from investors, said Tom White, a senior vice president at D. A. Davidson, a wealth and asset management firm. “Right now, I think investors generally are focused on growth.”"
2790,"With its initial offering, Lyft leapt ahead of Uber to become the first publicly traded ride-hailing firm. Logan Green and John Zimmer, Lyft’s founders, celebrated the event on Friday in Los Angeles, where pink confetti rained down them as they marked the occasion. The pair had founded Zimride, a long-distance car-pooling service for college students, in 2007. Zimride evolved into Lyft, which initially used the gimmick of fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches to distinguish its service."
2791,"Mr. Green, 35, who grew up in Santa Monica, and has cited heavy traffic in the area as an inspiration for Lyft, and Mr. Zimmer, 34, used the I.P.O. to announce a program called Lyft City Works. The program will donate $50 million to transportation initiatives in cities where it operates."
2792,"Mr. Green said he planned to further expand Lyft into other modes of transportation, including public transit."
2793,"“We want Lyft to be the first app that you open up,” he said. “The biggest investments we’re making today are broadening the portfolio of products that you can access within Lyft.”"
2794,"The offering increased Mr. Green’s and Mr. Zimmer’s wealth, while allowing them to maintain tight control over their company. The pair hold a special class of shares that give them extra voting power, a practice common among tech founders but criticized by investor advocates."
2795,"During the nearly two-week road show, Lyft pitched itself to institutional investors as a mission-driven company focused on reshaping the transportation industry. It emphasized its do-gooder stance on encouraging car-pooling and reducing the environmental impacts of individual car ownership."
2796,"Investors’ most frequent question during the road show was what the company would look like in five years, Mr. Zimmer said. “Investors realized that ride-sharing is the tip of the iceberg,” he said."
2797,"Using independent contractors to provide services has indubitably become the keystone of a generation of tech companies, from ride-hailing apps to food delivery services like DoorDash to hair and makeup services like Glamsquad. Some researchers said contingent work could account for 43 percent of the American work force by next year, though the Department of Labor has reported that the number of workers in gig roles has remained mostly flat since 2005."
2798,"“I think it’s quite clear that this is part of a larger trend in the economy,” said Sean Aggarwal, Lyft’s chairman. “That makes it an exciting story for the long-term investor. It gives them an opportunity to participate not just in this gig economy transformation but also in this larger trend of transportation as a service.”"
2799,Mr. White of D. A. Davidson said the good will toward Lyft would eventually evaporate if it ultimately couldn’t make money.
2800,"“As we get closer to 2020, there will be an expectation that we see them narrow the losses,” he said."
