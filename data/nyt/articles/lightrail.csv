1,"Given the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s difficulty running a functional subway system, it might be unrealistic to expect subway stations to have decent bathrooms. It’s not the Metropolitan Restroom Authority."
2,"But subway bathrooms have long occupied an inner ring of the city’s underworld, each grim, battered door a portal to a multisensory nightmare."
3,"Or so we had heard. In 25 combined years in the city, these two reporters had never summoned the courage to enter one."
4,"Recently, though, your correspondents took a whirlwind tour (as others have done) to see if subway restrooms lived up to the horrific hype. Mostly, they did."
5,"The most scandalous thing about New York’s subway bathrooms may be not how gross they are, but how few. By the M.T.A.’s official count, there are operative restrooms — at least one per gender — in 51 of the 472 stations. In a system with an average 5.6 million riders each weekday, that’s about one bathroom for every 53,000 riders. "
6,"The M.T.A. is working on this. The agency fixed up 12 bathrooms last year. It plans to refurbish an additional 25 this year. “Our customers and employees can all use more open, clean bathrooms,” said Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman."
7,"To be fair, the bathrooms at the handful of new multibillion-dollar stations on Second Avenue and the West Side are practically pristine. But here’s what you may encounter in the rest of the system."
8,"Touch of class: A guard sits in a booth and buzzes you in to one of four single-occupancy restrooms, where you have a five-minute time limit."
9,"The stainless-steel sink and toilet gave off a penitentiary vibe, but were reasonably clean. It was the only station on our tour that supplied all the basics of personal hygiene (though none of the stations had tampons or pads)."
10,"Maximum-security steampunk: In the men’s room, toilet paper rolls hung from the wall by a heavy chain and padlock. A sticker on the stall door advertised the services of Rikersgoods.com, which delivers packages to inmates of the city jail."
11,A prospective user walked in but exited immediately.
12,"“It’s not looking pleasant to me right now,” said the man, a 30-year-old welder who gave his name only as Michael. The missing soap dispenser was the deal breaker. “That should be illegal,” he said."
13,"The women’s room floor featured two piles of toilet paper. One was dry, the other was a blob atop a yellowing spread of wet newspaper."
14,"There was no coat hook on the stall door, leaving a reporter to choose between putting her handbag on the floor or clenching the strap in her teeth. A fellow customer left without flushing, glancing at the sink on her way out."
15,"Beside the empty paper-towel dispenser, a hand dryer emitted a feeble puff."
16,The urine smell in the women’s room was more subtle than in the men’s. It was still staggering.
17,"The cracked concrete floor of the men’s room looked like it had not been mopped in years. But on the plus side, on the frigid day of our visit, the room was toasty hot."
18,"So hot that someone had wedged takeout Chinese food between the scalding radiator and the wall, possibly to keep it warm — a full container of shrimp-fried rice and brown-breaded nuggets."
19,"“That’s no good,” said the station supervisor, S. Hope, when we brought it to his attention. “That will melt and catch fire.” He threw it out. "
20,"In the women’s room, fire safety has apparently been learned the hard way. “No storage within three (3) feet,” read a sign on the floor beside a radiator covered in burn marks. The radiator was working fine, though. The environment was reminiscent of the tropical monkey habitat at the Central Park Zoo."
21,(Mr. Hope said the bathrooms are cleaned three times a day.)
22,"The main door to the women’s room has a peephole to let you see who’s in the hall. But it does not lock. “People hert people,” reads graffiti on the door."
23,"The women’s room offered another unexpected sight: a man, standing at the toilet. He apologized on his way out, but offered no explanation. Nor did he flush."
24,"Evidently a good place to kick back and relax: A 25-ounce can of malt liquor rested on the toilet in the men’s room, and generously proportioned hermaphroditic portraits graced two walls of the stall."
25,"But the only toilet paper in the room was stuck around the rim of the toilet, perhaps by someone who did not want to sit on the spattered seat. "
26,The women’s room was wreathed in cigarette smoke. There was no toilet paper at all.
27,The luxury liner of dilapidated subway restrooms. The soap dispenser in the women’s room was half full. Toilet paper flowed freely. The trash can was being used for trash.
28,"In the men’s room, where a pleasantly crenulated green-and-white tile motif adorns the walls, traffic was brisk and the hand dryer roared like a happy lion. The door latch was too bent to slide, but bent so that it kept the door from swinging open. Good work, M.T.A."

30,"Subway officials in New York City held a news conference recently to celebrate the system’s progress. The on-time rate for trains hit 76 percent, they boasted, signaling a “renaissance” for the floundering system."
31,But that figure masks a surprising disparity.
32,"While the numbered lines have seen a notable boost in reliability, many of the lettered lines are still delivering poor service. The F train has a miserable on-time rate of about 50 percent — the lowest in the system."
33,"“It seems like there’s always something, from a sick passenger to signal problems,” said Paul Galloway, an F train rider who lives in Brooklyn and works at the Museum of Modern Art. “It just seems like a cursed line to me.”"
34,"It is clear that the subway is improving after hitting rock bottom in the summer of 2017, when a train derailed in Harlem and the on-time rate dipped below 65 percent — the worst of any major transit system in the world. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has won accolades for making the system more reliable."
35,But the diverging fates of the lines represented by letters and numbers can feel like A Tale of Two Subways — a system where some riders see signs of hope while others continue to endure constant pain.
36,"Subway leaders say there are several reasons for the gulf: schedule changes on the numbered lines that boosted the on-time rate; a computer system on the numbered lines that allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains; the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which eased crowding on several numbered lines; and signal upgrades that improved service on another numbered line."
37,The trend has left some riders wondering how to game the system to get where they are going on time.
38,"“The numbered lines have more stops, but they arrive more regularly and are less prone to problems,” said Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and lives near several lines in Brooklyn. “Do you roll the dice and take the ideally faster way, or do you take the way you know is going to work?”"

61,"The seven numbered subway lines are on time about 79 percent of the time, compared to about 68 percent for the fifteen lettered lines. Trains are considered on time if they reach the final stop within five minutes of the schedule."
62,"One reason the lettered lines are lagging is that they have older equipment. Some lettered lines are slated to  get modern signals, which should improve reliability. But Mr. Byford’s plan to modernize the entire subway will cost billions of dollars, and it is not clear whether state leaders will approve new funding streams for the transit system this year."
63,"Still, every line has improved as part of a broader effort to make trains run faster, said Sally Librera, the head of the subways department. Workers are increasing speed limits on parts of the system and replacing faulty signals that slowed trains."
64,"Transit officials point to other statistics that show subway service is improving, including fewer major incidents that delay 50 or more trains."
65,"“We recognize that we have more to do,” Ms. Librera said. “But we’re encouraged by the progress that we’re seeing.”"
66,"The subway now has its best on-time rate in four years — a figure that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is highlighting as he presses state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, is also pushing for reforms at the transit agency, though the State Senate issued a separate reform proposal."
67,"Critics have raised concerns over the schedule changes in late 2017 that made it easier to ensure that certain numbered trains are on time. On the No. 6 line, five trains were eliminated at Grand Central Station in Manhattan during the morning rush from 7 to 9 a.m., according to documents obtained by The New York Times."
68,"There were 68 trains scheduled on the 6 line during the morning rush in June 2017. The number fell to 63 last year. The on-time rate for the 6 train jumped to 72 percent in January, up from 52 percent in September 2017."
69,"“I’m inherently skeptical when they say we changed the schedule, and now everything is running on time,” Mr. Kabak said. “You’re running the risk of padding the schedule.”"
70,[Read more on how NYC tackled subway crime and how it may be coming back.]
71,Subway officials denied padding the schedule and said the changes were needed to accurately reflect how long it took to route trains through the system.
72,"“Adjusting schedules to accurately reflect actual system conditions allows for less train congestion and faster, more reliable service,” said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system. “This, along with other significant factors such as the $800 million Subway Action Plan and deliberately improved operating procedures, have led to the recent subway performance gains.”"
73,"Though fewer trains are scheduled, the same number of trains are running on the 6 line during the morning rush — an average of about 61 trains, Mr. Young said. Officials also cut service on the No. 1 and 5 lines, which each lost two scheduled trains in Midtown Manhattan during the morning rush."
74,"While fewer trains could help raise the on-time performance, they also can lead to more crowded trains and less capacity on the system. Each train can carry roughly 1,000 passengers."
75,"Most riders never learned about the schedule changes. The authority’s board did not approve them because they only vote on “major” service changes, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority. The schedule changes on the numbered lines were considered “minor” and the board was merely notified."
76,"An investigation by The New York Times in 2017 revealed that the transit agency was running fewer trains. The Lexington Avenue line, which carries the 4, 5 and 6 trains, regularly failed to meet its schedule, effectively canceling dozens of trains and reducing the system’s capacity by tens of thousands of riders. At Grand Central Station, just 77 of 90 scheduled trains regularly ran through the stop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m."
77,"For years, the lettered trains actually had better on-time rates than the numbered trains, but that shifted in January 2018, shortly after the schedule changes took effect. Ms. Librera cited two other factors behind the resurgence: The Second Avenue line opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January 2017, drawing riders who had previously used the overburdened 4, 5 and 6 lines, which bolstered the on-time rate for those lines. New signals on the No. 7 line also improved service."
78,"Most experts agree that the system is bouncing back. Andrew Albert, a board member who represents riders, said he noticed trains running faster along the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan where they used to move at a snail’s pace."
79,"“Absolutely, it’s getting better,” he said. “I’m thwarted less often, and I notice the running times are much faster.”"

81,The police officers who patrol New York City’s transit system are constantly scanning subway stations looking for a familiar set of faces: repeat sexual offenders who have arrest records.
82,"The officers follow them through jam-packed platforms and onto crowded trains, waiting to see if they grope, grind, molest or indecently expose themselves again."
83,Because only then can the police intervene and make an arrest or eject them from the subway system.
84,The authorities have long been frustrated by not being able to keep known subway sexual harassers from returning to the scene of their crimes.
85,"But now, lawmakers and police officials are pushing a dramatic measure: On Monday, a city councilman, Chaim M. Deutsch, introduced a bill that would bar repeat sexual offenders from the subway system for life."
86,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed the idea of dealing more forcefully with sexual predators, though they stopped short of embracing a lifetime ban."
87,"“If someone shoplifts in a store, and they are a recidivist, then that person could be banned from walking into the store,” said Mr. Deutsch, who represents parts of Brooklyn."
88,"“This should not be any different,” added Mr. Deutsch, who said he was prompted to pursue the bill by an article in The New York Post about the challenges the police face in thwarting repeat subway sexual offenses."
89,City Council members often introduce bills that do not progress very far and Mr. Deutsch’s bill likely faces long odds.
90,"Still, it has prompted a debate about a problem that many women who ride the subway must contend with on a near-daily basis."
91,"“We have individuals who, literally, since the 1980s have been committing sexual offenses on the trains,” the Police Department’s chief of detectives, Dermot F. Shea, said on Wednesday during a news conference in Brooklyn. Chief Shea spoke outside the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station, where the police said they had earlier that day arrested a man for forcibly touching a 15-year-old girl."
92,"Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, said he supported barring sexual offenders after a second conviction."
93,"“This is one of these issues that I think common sense needs to prevail,” he told reporters in Albany on Tuesday, adding that groping and grinding was “a major problem.”"
94,"A precedent for such measures, the governor said, already existed because of laws that prohibit sexual offenders released from prison from living near schools."
95,"“You have people who target people in the subways,” he said, adding that the high recidivism rate for such crimes shows that existing laws were ineffective. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over and over again?”"
96,"Mr. de Blasio also did not say specifically whether he supported Mr. Deutsch’s bill, but said he would support legislation that would “help us do more to go at these predators and get them off the subway.”"
97,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, issued a statement saying that it supported efforts to keep repeat sexual offenders out of the subway."
98,"The number of sex crimes, including felonies and misdemeanors, on the subway are on the rise — 165 were reported through March 17, a 10 percent increase compared with the same period last year, according to the New York Police Department."
99,"Even though victims of sexual offenses have been encouraged to come forward for years, Chief Shea said he still believed the number of crimes did not reflect the extent of the problem."
100,"In recent years, the police and the transit agency have focused on making victims more willing to report criminal encounters."
101,"As part of that campaign, the Police Department has trained more female officers to work on sex-crime cases in the subway. They have also encouraged riders to submit cellphone camera photos and videos that could help them identify suspects and have posted these photos on social media."
102,"Still, because most sexual offenses committed on the subway are misdemeanors, prosecutors are limited in punishing convicted offenders and keeping them out of the subway, said Chief Edward Delatorre, who oversees the Police Department’s transit bureau."
103,"In Albany, State Senator Diane J. Savino, a Democrat who represents Staten Island and Brooklyn, has been working for several years to increase the penalties for people who repeatedly commit sexual offenses on the subway."
104,"“Right now, these offenders are only committing misdemeanors and can only be sentenced to up to a year in jail, with most serving little to no time at all,” Ms. Savino said."
105,"While Ms. Savino said she supported the ban proposed by Mr. Deutsch, she believed it would be hard to enforce."
106,"“They can’t be expected to have people at every turnstile checking who gets on and off the subway,” she said. “The real solution is to properly punish these crimes.”"
107,"A bill she has sponsored would make unwanted sexual contact on public transportation — what Ms. Savino called “subway grinding” — a felony. The bill was passed by the Senate three times between 2013 and 2018, all while the chamber was controlled by Republicans, but never made it past the Democratic-controlled Assembly’s Committee on Codes, which has jurisdiction over criminal justice policy."
108,"""Their attitude is that these penalties are severe enough,” she said of the committee. “But they’re not. If they were, you would not have repeat incidents by the same predators.”"
109,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
110,It is a peculiarity of New York City history: The mayor does not control the subway that is so essential to the city’s success.
111,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has some influence over the transit system, but he is largely at the whim of state leaders who have controlled the subway since 1968. Now Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, wants to change that."
112,"Mr. Johnson introduced an ambitious plan on Tuesday to wrest control of the subway from the governor and state lawmakers, many of whom live far from the city and rarely, if ever, take the subway."
113,"“We must take control of our destiny,” Mr. Johnson said during his first State of the City speech. “We must have municipal control of our mass transit system.”"
114,"Mr. Johnson, a Democrat who is likely to run for mayor in 2021, released a 100-page report calling for the creation of a city-controlled entity called “Big Apple Transit” to oversee subways and buses. The idea of the mayor taking charge of the subway has long been debated, but Mr. Johnson’s report is the most comprehensive proposal in years."
115,"New York City is unique in having its transit system run by state leaders. In Los Angeles and Chicago, the systems are mostly controlled by the mayor, allowing those leaders to set their own priorities and to undertake major upgrades. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has overseen a comeback of its aging subway. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti helped win support for a $120 billion ballot measure to expand the rail system."
116,"But some argue that it makes sense for the state to control New York’s subway since it is part of a much bigger regional transit network. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is a sweeping agency that oversees the subways, buses, commuter railroads and key bridges and tunnels."
117,"The debate over the subway’s future comes as state lawmakers in Albany are deciding whether to approve new revenue streams for the subway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has pressed for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise billions of dollars for the transit system."
118,"Mr. de Blasio recently threw his support behind congestion pricing and announced a plan to fix the system with Mr. Cuomo, with whom the mayor has frequently clashed. Their joint plan called for reforms of the transit agency and for new funding from taxes on recreational marijuana and internet sales."
119,"A spokesman for the mayor, Eric F. Phillips, said Mr. de Blasio was focused on “immediate actions to fix the broken subway system.” A city takeover of the subway was worth discussing, Mr. Phillips said, but “in best-case scenario would take years to achieve.”"
120,"Other leaders like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, have called for mayoral control of the subway in the past."
121,"Still, Mr. Johnson’s proposal faces long odds because the governor and the State Legislature would have to sign off on the new structure."
122,"The city once ran the subway, but the state took over the struggling system in 1968, in a power grab by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. Officials wanted to preserve the 20-cent fare and hoped that the tolls on bridges and tunnels would subsidize the costs of the subway."
123,"Mr. Johnson has drawn attention to the fact that he regularly takes the subway, unlike the mayor and the governor. Mr. de Blasio occasionally rides the subway while Mr. Cuomo rarely uses the system. Mr. Johnson has made the subway a priority, pushing for congestion pricing and half-price MetroCards for poor New Yorkers."
124,"Transit advocates praised Mr. Johnson’s proposal, as did Joseph J. Lhota, the authority’s former chairman, who ran against Mr. de Blasio for mayor. Mr. Lhota, who supported the idea of mayoral control during his campaign, praised Mr. Johnson’s “vision for the city.”"
125,"“It’s refreshing to see someone stand before the people,” Mr. Lhota said, “and say, ‘Hold me responsible. Hold me accountable.’”"
126,"Mr. Johnson’s speech had the feel of a campaign rally as he sought to position himself as a leader capable of thinking big, in contrast to Mr. de Blasio, who has been criticized for a lack of bold new initiatives in his second term. Mr. Johnson also challenged the state Legislature, saying that the City Council would approve congestion pricing if Albany failed to do so, though it is not clear whether the Council has the authority."
127,"The speech made clear that if Mr. Johnson runs for mayor, he would use the city takeover of the transit system as a signature issue, just as Mr. de Blasio focused on early childhood education when he first ran for mayor in 2013. Mr. Johnson was introduced by his mother, Ann Richardson, who is from Boston and has the accent to match, telling the audience about her son’s “kind loving haht.”"
128,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has received a wave of criticism over his handling of the transit system. Although he exerts great control over the agency, he has argued that he does not have enough power and that one person or entity should take charge and be accountable to the public."
129,"A Cuomo spokeswoman, Dani Lever, responded to Mr. Johnson’s speech with a short retort: “The city already owns the New York City Transit system,” in reference to a long-running debate over whether the city technically owns the system — a contention that Mr. de Blasio’s office has disputed."
130,"The authority is governed by a board that typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. Mr. Cuomo selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership."
131,"Mr. Johnson was careful not to mention Mr. Cuomo’s name or to attack him directly, though he criticized the unpopular decision by the Cuomo administration to divert transit funding to struggling ski resorts. Mr. Johnson joked that a mayor would never make that decision over fears that it would lead to tabloid headlines of “Mayor to City: Go Sled!”"
132,"Mr. Johnson also raised concerns about whether the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, could fix the system with its current structure under Mr. Cuomo."
133,“Imagine what Andy Byford could do without the built-in dysfunction of the M.T.A. slowing him down?” he asked.
134,"Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the authority, defended the agency. Transit officials, he said, are working hard to improve service and to convince state lawmakers to support a congestion pricing plan before the April 1 budget deadline."
135,"“We are laser-focused on the passage of congestion pricing,” Mr. Young said, “and obtaining the funding we need to deliver the transit system that New Yorkers deserve.”"
136,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
137,"He had wandered onto the Brooklyn subway tracks near Hoyt Street Station on Thursday morning, a boy of about 12, unattended and willing to test fate."
138,He managed to amble over the rail that carries 600 volts of electricity and wedge himself between the columns that separate the local and express tracks.
139,"It was about 9:15 a.m., and a northbound train was barreling his way."
140,The response was swift. A customer hurried to a call box and pushed a button for help. The station agent who got the call notified the rail control center. All train operators in the area received an alert and were told to be on the lookout.
141,"By then Hopeton Kiffin, a 51-year-old operator for the No. 5 train, had already spotted a flash of red on the tracks ahead of him in an area his express train would normally rush through. He slowed the train down. Someone on the platform pointed. There stood a boy in a red shirt, staring straight ahead, clapping his hands."
142,"“I’ve seen strange things, adults walking on the tracks — once I saw a guy who was on there walking to the next station — but this one, with the child standing there, I was taken aback,” Mr. Kiffin said in an interview."
143,"Mr. Kiffin’s reaction was swift but gentle. He secured the train, jumped out and approached the boy, who did not speak or respond physically or verbally to words."
144,"“He was very serious — there was no emotion, no verbal communication, not a lot of eye contact,” Mr. Kiffin said."
145,So the father of three stopped talking and offered his hand.
146,"“I have an 8-year-old daughter and sometimes words — they don’t listen — so I just gently held him by the hand,” he said. “I thought, ‘Let me guide him, and let him feel secure.’”"
147,"For a moment, the frequent subway story line of shared communal woe took a turn. Complaints about delayed trains, jam-packed platforms and violent crime were briefly overshadowed by Mr. Kiffin’s compassion."
148,About 15 minutes passed. Some people watched from the platform. Mr. Kiffin asked them how the boy had gotten into such an unusual place. No one knew.
149,Eventually Mr. Kiffin got the boy to walk to the waiting train and coaxed him into the operator’s cab.
150,"The train then moved to the next stop, Borough Hall, where the police were waiting. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated."
151,Mr. Kiffin was praised for his efforts.
152,"“I’m very proud of our train operator and station agent for their quick action to bring this child to safety without incident so that he can be reunited with his family,” the president of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, said in a statement."
153,"Tony Utano, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said Mr. Kiffin had helped to avoid a terrible tragedy."
154,"“You can never relax when you are operating a subway train,” Mr. Utano said in a statement. “You have to be alert for anything out of place. This story has a happy ending only because this operator spotted this child and managed to get him to safety.”"
155,"Mr. Kiffin lives in East Flatbush and has been a train operator for 13 years. When reflecting on the day’s events, he was relieved that his instincts as a train operator and a parent had quickly fused. Things could have gone very differently, he believed, had the boy become frightened or upset or fallen on the electric rail."
156,"“I feel I did my job,” Mr. Kiffin said."
157,To the Editor:
158,"Re “Cuomo Scoffs at Plan to Lift Subway Fares” (front page, Jan. 23):"
159,"The political gridlock over New York’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority — whether to raise fares, and the L train tunnel repairs — pales in comparison to the bigger question of the subway’s longer-term defense against climate change."
160,"In a better world all sides would work to re-elevate tracks and trains above future mega-floods and surges. After all, the Brooklyn Bridge originally carried trains, and early designs for the George Washington Bridge were all about trains and tracks. "
161,"New buildings are putting emergency generators up top instead of below ground. And, of course, Lower Manhattan used to be served by elevated lines that, when removed, were never replaced as promised by new subways. "
162,Why do straphangers have to tolerate stalemate and dysfunction while drivers pay no congestion fees? Liberate the subway riders from flood-prone tunnels!
163,Mathews HollinsheadSt. PaulThe writer is a representative on the Transportation Advisory Board of the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities. The board votes on the regional distribution of about $180 million in federal transportation funds in a two-year cycle.
164,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in a state of crisis. 
165,Deterioration of service is apparent. Ridership is down and public misery is up. The unacceptable condition of the system is having a negative effect on the city and state economies. It is difficult to imagine how the public transportation network will accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people expected to enter the regional work force over the next 20 years with a system that already delivers an average of 5.6 million rides each weekday.
166,"Most everyone agrees on these facts, but there is no consensus on what to do about that."
167,"Lately, the political debate is focused on the money, and in particular, on a congestion-pricing proposal put forth by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, which, if adopted, would not cover all of the funding gaps. "
168,"Thus, despite the best efforts of those who support congestion pricing, how to properly fund the M.T.A. remains a vexing question. But getting the M.T.A. out of its crisis will also require significant changes in two other related areas: governance and management."
169,"The M.T.A. was created in 1968 to bring together the underfunded and poorly maintained transit systems of New York City and its region. The authorizing statute established very clearly that the chairman of the board of the M.T.A., while appointed by the governor, should be an independent chief executive officer. The heads of each agency under the M.T.A. umbrella — for example, New York’s subway authority and the suburban train lines — would report to the board chairman."
170,"The point was hard to miss: The transportation services needed professional management. No one doubted that politics and competition for resources would remain. But the system needed a voice independent of elected officials like the governor, the mayor and those in the State Legislature. This works, when it is allowed to."
171,"In 1983, Gov. Mario Cuomo pushed the Legislature to pass a law to make the M.T.A. chairman serve at the pleasure of the governor. This proposal had no support and died."
172,"To this day, neither the chairman nor the other board members report to the governor or to the other elected officials who have the authority to make board appointments. This principle has been reinforced over time."
173,"In 2009, New York State passed a law that said members of the boards of public authorities owe their fiduciary duty exclusively to the mission of their authorities — not to the elected officials who appointed them. "
174,"New York’s current governor, Andrew Cuomo, has at times ignored the legally mandated independence of the M.T.A. "
175,"I’ve learned from conversations with lawmakers and M.T.A. officials that Mr. Cuomo has appointed board members who take directions from him and his staff. He has influenced the selection of senior M.T.A. managers. M.T.A. officials have said to me that they report to the governor on many issues. The lines are often blurred among the governor, his staff and senior M.T.A. leadership. "
176,"This is not entirely new — other governors have had influence over the board, especially with the members they appointed. But it has become more pervasive in recent years, according to M.T.A. officers I’ve spoken with. No other governor in my memory has exercised such direct control over the M.T.A. board."
177,"The members of the board, even those not appointed by the governor, have mostly looked the other way. The state agency charged with enforcing the laws that govern M.T.A. independence has not done its job. "
178,"As a consequence of Mr. Cuomo’s interference, M.T.A. managers often do not know whom they report to on any particular issue. They even disagree among themselves on whom they should take direction from. "
179,"No manager, no matter how skilled, can work effectively in this environment."
180,Mr. Cuomo recently proposed some management “reforms” to the M.T.A. that will be considered by state lawmakers along with the congestion pricing plan. But his idea to create an expert panel to set congestion pricing rates and approve M.T.A.’s finances is exactly the opposite of what the M.T.A. needs.
181,"Some observers and lawmakers have proposed that New York City take back the subway and bus system, returning to something resembling the organization that failed more than 50 years ago. This proposal ignores the regional nature of our transportation system and would put in grave jeopardy the Legislature’s responsibility of enacting regional taxes to fund the system. A city-run subway would inevitably become a city-funded subway, with some limited federal contribution for capital costs, and be subject to the complex rules that frustrate effective management of other city agencies. "
182,Let’s be clear: The problem is not with the governance structure created by the original laws. The problem is that this governor is interfering where he shouldn’t.
183,The first step toward reforming the transportation system is to restore the independence of the M.T.A. management. The system will continue to fail as long as the management structure remains as it is today.
184,"If proper governance were in place, the next step would be for the board to take stock of M.T.A. assets to determine their physical condition and the financial resources needed to keep the system in a state of good repair. With such an inventory, priorities can be set, and the public can determine whether the M.T.A.’s funding requests are accurate and adequate or, like many things there, politically determined."
185,"In addition to governance reform, the M.T.A. requires more funding. Congestion pricing — even if it could pass the Legislature — amounts to a regressive tax that will fall significantly short of providing the M.T.A. with the money it needs. "
186,"New revenue streams need to be reliable, such that the source is not substantially diminished in an economic downturn, and they should have minimal effect on the regional economy. Revenue should come from across the metropolitan region, not just the city, and its burdens should be shared by general taxpayers and all the motorists who benefit from a well functioning transportation system. "
187,"These are not simple matters. Previous governors and legislatures have risen to the challenges, and they can do so again, but only if they first focus on the real problems."

190,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
191,Gov. Andrew Cuomo is right: A traffic congestion pricing plan — in which drivers have to pay to get into the busiest parts of Manhattan — is the best way to pay for the bulk of urgently needed fixes for New York City’s decrepit subway system.
192,"Unfortunately, the preliminary plan he laid out in his budget address provides no guarantee that revenue from charging these drivers will go to the subways, where it is needed most, and not used as a piggy bank for politicians’ favored transit projects across the region."
193,"Mr. Cuomo has expressed a refreshing interest in taking overall responsibility for the subway system he has controlled since he took office eight years ago. To show he is serious about the effort, his congestion pricing plan needs to guarantee that legislation would explicitly dedicate an overwhelming majority of the revenue to the subway system. "
194,"To be sure, it makes sense that some of the funds — which would be used to leverage bonds — go toward expanded service in so-called public transportation deserts in boroughs outside Manhattan. Some should go to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s commuter rails, to help build support for congestion pricing among lawmakers who represent the railroad passengers, and because some of the drivers who would be paying the new tolls would be from the suburbs. (Governor Cuomo told Long Island residents on Friday that congestion pricing could help not only the subways but the Long Island Rail Road, too.)"
195,"For too long, though, the M.T.A. has directed a disproportionately large share of funding toward commuter rail service and showy projects at the expense of the subways, which serve far more riders. "
196,"The M.T.A. is set to spend an estimated $12 billion to build a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal, giving Long Islanders access to the East Side. The project, known as East Side Access, has been rife with cost overruns and delays. In 2012, the M.T.A. chief, Joseph Lhota, noted that the authority subsidized the Long Island Rail Road to the tune of $7 per ride, compared with $1 per ride for the subways. This, even though city residents contribute the greatest share of revenue to the authority. "
197,"Guaranteeing that the subways properly benefit from congestion pricing is not just a matter for the governor. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, whose Bronx constituents depend on the subway system, and the Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, can both use their considerable new political clout in Albany."
198,"We hope lawmakers in the suburbs and elsewhere in the state remember that when the subway system deteriorates, the economy is affected, drying up tax dollars from the city that they rely on."
199,"Helping lead the charge should be Mayor Bill de Blasio, whose 8.5 million weary constituents suffer through every commute, while he has largely stayed on the sidelines as the system collapses. Frustratingly, Mr. de Blasio has signaled only a reluctant willingness to support congestion pricing, favoring a higher income tax on millionaires that has had little support in the capital. Congestion pricing is moving forward, so the mayor needs to act quickly to ensure the plan is drafted so that it benefits the subways that are crumbling after decades of neglect and mismanagement. It’s the least he can do to save a service that is vital to his constituents’ lives."

202,"Granted, it’s a strange way to run a subway."
203,"After three years of planning, and of anxiety for thousands of Brooklyn residents, a plan to shut the L train tunnel under the East River in April for 15 months of repairs jerked to a halt on Thursday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that outside engineering experts, taking a fresh look at the tunnel, had come up with a way to make the repairs without immiserating commuters. Only night and weekend service would be disrupted or delayed, he said."
204,"The news was greeted with great relief by many, skepticism by some, and the word “duh” by still others, who, while perhaps not experts on mass transit, found themselves wondering why such a seemingly obvious idea hadn’t surfaced much earlier."
205,"Why, some asked, was the governor getting involved so late? Why hadn’t the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considered this innovative technique years ago? How could the M.T.A. have any credibility with its long-suffering customers after this?"
206,"These are good questions, maybe less about the new proposal than about the system as a whole, which, apparently, requires a bolt out of the blue, or Albany, to shake things up. To respond to them in reverse order: Did the M.T.A. have much credibility to begin with? Is it any surprise that it hadn’t considered a simpler alternative given its record of delays and fiascos? And does it make any difference why Mr. Cuomo got involved so late if it turns out that he has now come up with a better solution?"
207,"The governor reached out to the heads of the engineering departments of Columbia and Cornell Universities last month to see if they could devise a better way to make the repairs. The new approach would change the way that the cables used to power and control trains are put in place. The original $477 million plan, approved by the M.T.A. in 2017, would replace and restore the existing structure that houses the cables, a concrete bench wall that is also used as a walkway along the tracks. The new proposal is to instead suspend the cables on racks along the tunnel wall, a method used in Europe and elsewhere."
208,"The M.T.A. ought to scrutinize the new plan, developed over the past three weeks, to make sure it would work and be safe. The governor suggested on Thursday that the agency should move ahead with it this spring, but he acknowledged on Friday that a delay for more study might be reasonable."
209,"Mr. Cuomo deserves credit for seeking out an alternative to shutting down subway service for months, and for pressing for this new approach at some political risk to himself. They say if you break it you own it. But how about this, Governor Cuomo — if you fix it, you own it."
210,"This development also makes one wonder what else could use some fresh thinking at the M.T.A., and what jolts Mr. Cuomo could deliver to make it happen."
211,"For instance, on this project and all others, attracting more bidders could lead to discussions of less pricey and more reasonable methods. Accomplishing this, though, requires an overhaul of work rules and other impediments to potential contractors."
212,"The governor makes a good case that while he has been adept at responding to critical situations, like the replacement of the Tappan Zee Bridge and the completion of the Second Avenue subway, the M.T.A.’s more serious problems require more complex solutions. The agency is run by professionals dedicated to mass transit. What they lack is not expertise, but political leadership. "
213,"Yes, Mr. Cuomo is not alone in control of the membership of the M.T.A. board. He is, though, the agency’s most powerful constituent, and the skills and forcefulness he has shown in attending to the agency’s acute needs could be applied as well to its more long-term structural ones."
214,The most worthwhile surprise for New Yorkers would be an M.T.A. in which they could have confidence.

217,"Deep under the New York Bay near Brooklyn, covered in mildew, seaweed and other gunk, is what thousands of commuters would consider a hidden treasure: the start of a subway tunnel linking Staten Island to the rest of New York City."
218,"“The idea of a subway to Staten Island really goes way back,” said Stan Fischler, a subway historian. “Way, way back.”"
219,"The plan, first proposed in 1890, was approved. Maps were drawn up. Groundbreaking ceremonies were held. Construction began."
220,What followed were dozens of missed opportunities that could have prevented the fastest-growing borough in recent decades from becoming the most isolated.
221,"Even today, skepticism is high that the M.T.A. will ever consider adding a Staten Island subway to its list of capital projects, especially amid the recent tug-of-war over L train repairs, in which the plan to shut the line down for 15 months was suddenly, and very questionably, scrapped."
222,"James Oddo, the borough president, said in an email that the Staten Island subway had “no chance of happening.”"
223,"“I choose to continue focusing my attentions and energies on more realistic projects,” he added."
224,"Building a tunnel under five miles of waterway in a crowded city is an arduous and costly endeavor, but it would offer immense relief."
225,"About a third of the borough’s 476,000 residents take mass transit to work, most of them relying on the Staten Island Ferry for part of the trip. Of those, about 40 percent spend at least an hour commuting each way to work, a larger proportion than in any other county in the country, according to 2017 data from the United States Census Bureau."
226,"“You would think somebody would wake up in the morning and say, ‘We could do better,’ ” said Dr. Jonathan Peters, a research fellow at the University Transportation Research Center at City College of New York. “This is not an unsolvable problem.”"
227,"For Dr. Peters, the unfinished project is more than research — it’s also personal. His great-grandmother chose to raise her family on Staten Island, relocating from the Bronx in the 1920s because she heard there would be a subway. Every day she slogged to her job in Manhattan’s garment district, telling herself a better commute was on the horizon."
228,"“My family has been disappointed now for 97 years waiting for the subway,” he said."
229,"To be sure, Staten Island does have a train. The mostly elevated Staten Island Railway runs along the east side of the borough, from St. George in the north to Tottenville in the south. But it is the only borough in New York City without a rail link to Manhattan."
230,"Over more than a century, no less than seven official ideas have been floated for connections to Staten Island. One imagined a line from New Jersey. Another proposal claimed its train would zip commuters to Manhattan in a mere seven minutes. A more recent study even considered a sky tram."
231,"None of those proposals, needless to say, have panned out."
232,"The one idea that was approved, in 1912, would have connected Staten Island’s North Shore with Brooklyn, merging with the 4th Avenue line (now the R train) near Bay Ridge."
233,"At the time, a major subway expansion was underway across New York City. The first underground system opened in 1904, propelling riders across Manhattan. The system stretched into the Bronx in 1905 and to Brooklyn in 1908. It would eventually expand to Queens in 1915."
234,The subway to Staten Island even had a name: Route 51.
235,"“Staten Island Expects a Boom,” read a New York Times headline from 1912. “Proposed Subway Under Narrows Has Stimulating Effect on Realty.”"
236,"But the man who was one of the biggest champions of the project, Mayor John F. Hylan, was also its greatest hindrance, said Joseph Raskin, author of “The Routes Not Taken: A Trip Through New York City’s Unbuilt Subway System.”"
237,"“Very little got built or moved ahead under Hylan,” said Mr. Raskin, a retired M.T.A. employee."
238,"“Hylan’s attitude about transit issues was definitely his downfall as mayor,” he added."
239,"And yet Staten Island named its longest thoroughfare Hylan Boulevard, in part because “they thought they would get a rail tunnel out of him,” Mr. Raskin said."
240,"Long before he was mayor, Hylan was a train operator in Brooklyn. He would prop up his law school books in the corner of his cab and study when he could, Mr. Raskin said. He got into a crash and was fired."
241,"Hylan was elected mayor in 1918. A boorish man who maintained a grudge against the subway companies, he actively tried to halt funding to transit projects. Gov. Alfred E. Smith even opened an investigation into allegations that Hylan was being an obstructionist. Stories of their battles frequently occupied the front page of The Times, much like the coverage of a similar political rivalry does today."
242,"One transportation project for the borough Hylan did support was a tunnel big enough to accommodate freight trains. The tunnel would connect New York City, by way of Staten Island, to the rest of the United States, and would be more direct than the existing routes. It was a move that he saw as revolutionary, one that could increase New York City’s potential as a commercial center and heighten his legacy for decades to come."
243,"To sell the idea, he argued that the tunnel could serve both passenger and freight trains."
244,"But there were critics, said Thomas Matteo, Staten Island’s borough historian. Some argued the funds should be used for subways in denser areas. Others questioned the long ride to Brooklyn and thought a train directly to Manhattan made more sense. Then there were the Staten Islanders who didn’t care for freight trains chugging through their backyards."
245,"The borough’s population at the time was only at about 120,000, and few even commuted; many lived and worked locally."
246,"“It was entrepreneurs and businessmen who wanted it,” Mr. Matteo said of the proposed subway. “It was never the local yokels.”"
247,"The freight factor was important — railroad companies were willing to pay for a portion of the cost to dig the tunnel if they could move freight through it. Without their support, the tunnel would be too costly."
248,"Hylan sensed his opportunities were dwindling. He quickly ordered workers to build a tunnel that would be big enough, in his memorable phrase, to “take an elephant.”"
249,"In 1923, he hoisted a silver pick ax high above his head at groundbreaking ceremonies, where he aired his frustrations with pushback from state officials. “It takes a man of iron to deal with these people,” he said."
250,"A number of events finally killed the plan. In 1925, the governor’s transit investigation determined it would cost $60 million instead of $20 million to build a tunnel to accommodate freight, and it recommended a passenger-only tunnel."
251,"The Brooklyn Rapid Transit, the company that would have operated the subway, was in financial turmoil from a worker strike and from the aftermath of New York’s deadliest train disaster, which killed an estimated 100 people. On top of that, it was campaign season, and Brooklyn Rapid was denied a desperately-needed fare increase as politicians promised to make the price — a nickel — sacrosanct."
252,Then another more appealing idea emerged: building a bridge to connect Brooklyn and Staten Island.
253,"In 1955, The Times said that not including train tracks on the bridge would be “one of the great planning blunders of our generation.” But that’s just what happened when the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964 under the auspices of the car-centric city planner Robert Moses."
254,There has been limited interest in a Staten Island subway since then.
255,"In 2013, Joseph J. Lhota, the former M.T.A. chairman, asked city planners during his mayoral campaign whether the Verrazzano Bridge could support the weight of a train; it couldn’t, they said."
256,"Even if a subway tunnel were feasible, there is the sense that it would never get enough support from Staten Islanders, said Allen P. Cappelli, a former M.T.A. board member who was a proponent of a Staten Island subway."
257,"“Probably a fair number of people would love it,” said Mr. Cappelli, now a member of the City Planning Commission “and probably there would be old-timers that would hate it.”"
258,"Mark Cannon, who spent years commuting for an hour to his job as an attorney in Manhattan, embodied those conflicted sentiments. He feared a subway would make Staten Island a more desirable place to live. “The commute would probably be a lot better,” he said. “But the best thing about Staten Island is it’s kind of separate from the rest of the city. It would get too crowded.”"

263,"The city’s subway trains are arriving on time more often, yet riders might be noticing an unusual divide in the system. The numbered lines are performing better than the lettered ones."
264,"To get a sense of why this is happening, I talked to my colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter."
265,[Why New York’s lettered subway lines are “cursed.”]
266,How are the trains performing?
267,"In 2017, less than 65 percent of trains were on time — the worst of any major transit system in the world, Ms. Fitzsimmons has reported. This year, that improved to 76 percent."
268,"But there was a twist: The seven numbered trains were outperforming the 15 lettered trains. Seventy-nine percent of numbered trains were on time, compared with 68 percent of lettered trains."
269,Why are numbered trains doing better?
270,Subway leaders cite several reasons:
271,• Schedule changes on the numbered lines improved the on-time rate.
272,• A computer system on the numbered lines allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains.
273,"• The opening of the Second Avenue subway eased crowding on several numbered lines, and signal upgrades improved service on another numbered line."
274,Is there one thing that can improve all trains?
275,"Modern signals are the No. 1 solution, Ms. Fitzsimmons said."
276,"The subway system’s chief, Andy Byford, wants to install these signals on all the lines, but that takes time and costs billions. He hasn’t secured the funding from state lawmakers (yet)."
277,"The subway system also needs new train cars. Trains on the C line are the oldest in daily operation in the world, according to Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials."
278,Do affluent neighborhoods have better trains?
279,"Not necessarily. The F train goes through Park Slope and other wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and it has really terrible service. The on-time rate is about 50 percent — the lowest in the city."
280,"One reason I left Park Slope was because I didn’t want to live on the F train. I now ride the A train in Washington Heights, and it’s a much better experience."
281,Why were the lines assigned certain letters and numbers?
282,Three competing systems were built throughout the city.
283,• The Interborough Rapid Transit Company built the trains that are numbered.
284,"• The Independent System included what are now the A, C, D, E, F, G, R and Q lines."
285,"• The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation included what are now the B, J, M, N, Z and L lines."
286,The companies were merged in 1953. (The W line was created in 2001.)

333,"In “Caught in Act, Evaders of Fare ‘Don’t Feel Bad’” (front page, Dec. 25), we are introduced to several subway fare evaders who were made to feel “unhappy” or whose mood was ruined when issued summonses."
334,"There is an utter disconnect between their actions and responsibilities. The cavalierly offered rationales mean nothing and don’t change anything. Yes, there are many of us who experience problems while commuting and wish that the system functioned well, but breaking the law is not an answer; it only worsens the existing problems."
335,"Many of those who refuse to pay fares simply do so because it is too easy to do, period. Transit systems in other countries use methods of thwarting fare evasion that are effective, yet respectful. One major problem is that subway turnstiles, while nice-looking, are poorly designed for controlling access. Our current situation is, to no small degree, a product of design flaw."
336,Burt BloomBrooklyn 
337,To the Editor:
338,"When someone vaults over a subway turnstile, or boards a bus through a rear door, it’s generally not a maiden voyage. And when the police redirect their attention away from fare evasion, it sends a clear message that this form of crime (theft) is inconsequential. So no one should look the least bit shocked when fare evasion rockets from 1.8 percent to 3.2 percent of all riders. What to do?"
339,"Fare evasion should be policed like anything else, but maybe getting caught and paying a fine does not act as a deterrent. What may have an impact is the introduction of mandatory community service. Of course this would have to be packaged and sold in a way that did not discriminate, or allow labor unions to claim that community service was taking jobs away from others, and would be an option only where it made sense."

A month before that, a police officer fended off five homeless men who attacked him on a train platform. And on Sunday afternoon, a man was fatally shot at a subway station in Queens, the first recorded murder on the system in six months."
349,"The subway has come a long way since the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s when violence was rampant and riders felt constant dread. The system has become very safe, with just one murder on the subway last year compared with 26 in 1990."
350,"But lately, riders are starting to feel less safe on the subway, a belief that is often reinforced by a flood of complaints about the transit system, doled out in real time on social media."
351,The shooting in Queens on Sunday was captured on Twitter in a graphic video showing a struggle between several men who had stepped out of a southbound 7 train at the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue station around 12:45 p.m.
352,"At one point in the video, gunshots can be heard offscreen. The police said the two suspects in the shooting had fled on foot. On Monday, the police arrested a 26-year-old man whom they identified as a member of MS-13, a violent street gang with roots in El Salvador, in connection with the killing."
353,"“Violent incidents like the one today will not be tolerated on our trains, or anywhere in New York City,” said Phil Walzak, a police spokesman. “The subway system remains incredibly safe, with approximately one crime for every million riders per day.”"
354,"But data shows crime is heading in the wrong direction: Transit crimes were up 3.8 percent last year, according to the police, part of a slight rise since 2014. Still, there were only about 2,500 major crimes — including murders, rapes and robberies — in the system last year, or about seven per day, compared with nearly 17,500 transit crimes in 1990."
355,"Back then, people were afraid to ride the train and often avoided doing so late at night. Some stayed away from the subway altogether. The stabbing of a tourist on the subway in 1990 as he defended his mother during a robbery crystallized fears about crime."
356,Recent concerns about safety have caused subway riders to once again change their behavior. Some do not take the train after a certain hour or allow children and visiting relatives to travel alone. Others switch cars to avoid menacing passengers.
357,"Ana Smith, 62, of Brooklyn, said she does not let her 10-year-old grandson ride the subway alone."
358,"“I have to be with him,” she said as they waited at a station in Brooklyn on a recent morning. “I have to protect him. It’s too dangerous. We have too much crime in this train station.”"
359,"The police insist that the subway is safe and that a few notable incidents captured on social media have skewed perceptions that it is not. The transit police chief, Edward Delatorre, said the rise in transit crimes last year was mainly driven by thefts in Manhattan."
360,"Mr. Delatorre said in an interview that the number of crimes in the subway is so small, that “one or two recidivist offenders can enter the system and throw the crime numbers out of whack.” Still, he said he was adding more officers to the system as part of a new policing model under Mayor Bill de Blasio."
361,"The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, said in a statement: “I want people to know that despite this beyond-horrifying incident which is under active investigation, the subway is remarkably safe, both generally as a public space as well as relative to other modes of transport such as driving.”"
362,"Subway ridership has exploded over the last quarter century, making it all the more notable that crime has remained low on the system. There were about one billion annual subway trips in 1990, compared with 1.7 billion trips in 2017."
363,"But the city’s former police commissioner, William J. Bratton, suggested on Twitter recently that disorder on the subway could signal a return to the conditions that led to soaring crime. On Christmas Day, he posted a video of the officer fighting off the men and said it was a reminder that the city’s descent into violence had begun in the subways. “The quality-of-life declines and warning signs are all there for it to happen once again,” he said."
364,"In the 1980s, muggings and violent crime were rife on the subway. The fear was so universal that Bernard Goetz was applauded by some for shooting four teenagers on a train in 1984 after believing he was being robbed. The 1990 killing of the tourist from Utah, Brian Watkins, was particularly jarring: Mr. Watkins was stabbed in the chest after several young men slashed his father’s pants pocket and hit his mother. The incident represented a breaking point for the city that led to an aggressive police crackdown."
365,"In 1982, a transit officer described sensing “a big sigh of relief” from passengers when he would step on to a train. “You can actually hear it,” he told The Times. “People smile at me. They’re relieved.”"
366,Subway riders today are perhaps most concerned about poor service and constant delays. Subway leaders are also worried about a rise in fare evasion — a problem they say drains more than $200 million in revenue from the system each year.
367,"But New Yorkers are increasingly worried about crime, too. In January, four men attacked an 18-year-old woman at a station in the Bronx, punching her and stealing her headphones."
368,"Ivan Cruz, 20, an architecture student at New York City College of Technology, said he was often harassed on the subway."
369,"“I always try to stick around a group of people to feel safer,” Mr. Cruz said at the Jay Street-MetroTech station, a busy hub in Brooklyn, on a recent afternoon."
370,"Mr. Cruz said he was recently approached by an intoxicated passenger and later by a group of teenagers who bullied him. He worries that someone could try to push him, so he avoids the station at night."
371,"“I only see a few officers patrolling here,” he said. “I’d feel safer with more.”"
372,"The only subway murder recorded last year took place in July at the Broadway Junction station in Brooklyn, when a man pulled a woman onto the tracks in a murder-suicide. In another killing in January, a 65-year-old man died after a teenager knocked him on to the tracks at the Jay Street station and he went into cardiac arrest. The teenager was charged with manslaughter."
373,"New Yorkers regularly encounter agitated people on the subway who yell and threaten other passengers. The city is struggling to cope with a growing homeless population, many of whom have mental health issues. Some of those people end up in the subway."
374,Chief Delatorre said he does not believe there are more outbursts by people with mental health problems on the subway than in the past.
375,"“I believe it’s more noticeable,” he said. “The Wi-Fi is stronger and now anytime anything happens, it’s blasted out right away.”"
376,The challenge of policing the subway was highlighted by an altercation in January when transit officers asked two men to leave an entrance after riders complained they were smoking. The men had been arrested at the same station in December for attacking officers.
377,"The officers, who were caught on video pummeling the men with their batons, are being investigated for using excessive force. Charges were dropped against one of the men — a move that prompted a rare rebuke from James P. O’Neill, the city’s police commissioner. The decision had put the safety of officers and the public in jeopardy, Mr. O’Neill said on Twitter."
378,"The police say the recent uptick in crime was due in part to several international pickpocket rings. Under Mr. de Blasio, the police are using a new approach, known as the neighborhood policing model, on the subway."
379,Chief Delatorre said he is posting more officers on parts of the subway to develop relationships with M.T.A. workers and riders.
380,"“The feedback we’re getting is positive,” he said. “They’re seeing more officers on platforms and on the trains.”"
381,"Cece Colon, a retired legal secretary, fled an F train recently when a confrontation erupted between two women."
382,"“It was too much — I got off and got on another train,” Ms. Colon said while waiting at the Jay Street station."
383,Ms. Colon said she avoids carrying expensive items on the subway.
384,"“Nothing in my purse is valuable,’’ she said. “I feel more liberated.’’"
385,"Lora Hinds, 47, an M.T.A. dispatcher, said she avoids wearing jewelry."
386,"“I try not to travel at night if I don’t have to,” she said."
387,"The Second Avenue station on the F line in Manhattan has become well known for a group of men who harass riders. On a recent afternoon, about eight men sat on the platform drinking and smoking. A high school student said the men yelled racist things at her."
388,Now her boyfriend accompanies her on the subway to make sure she is safe.
389,"“When we are together, they don’t bother us,” the teenager said."

399,The numbers are daunting.
400,"• Only 24 percent of the 472 subway stations have elevators, and the elevators that exist break down an average of once a week."
401,• The subways’ Fast Forward modernization plan calls for making 50 more stations accessible over five years. That would still leave about two-thirds of the stations without elevators. The $40 billion plan has not been funded.
402,"• Many lines have long stretches without any accessible station. On the D, for example, the 10 Brooklyn stops between Barclays Center and Bay Parkway lack accessibility."
403,"If you were disabled, your subway map would look something like this:"

405,State Senator Jessica Ramos of Queens wrote: “We need increased accessibility in every station. That means elevators and escalators that service both directions.”
406,"As sensible as that idea sounds, it has faced huge hurdles over the years."

450,[An MS-13 member was arrested in the fatal subway station shooting. Read our updated story.]
451,"Six shots rang out during a fight on a Queens subway platform early Sunday afternoon, sending straphangers running for cover as a man lay dying and his attackers fled on foot, according to the police and cellphone video of the incident."
452,"The victim was struck in the head and died at the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue station, where the altercation spilled out of a Manhattan-bound 7 train shortly before 12:45 p.m., the police said. There were no arrests on Sunday, as officers continued searching for a motive and for two men seen attacking the victim."
453,"The graphic cellphone video captured the victim struggling with his attackers, who were on top of him as at least two other men attempt to break up the fight."
454,"A police official confirmed the authenticity of the video, which shows a heavyset man wearing a gray hood and colorful scarf rise from the scuffle with what appears to be a revolver in his hand. The victim appeared to reach toward the gun as he struggled to his feet."
455,"Six shots rang out, and the victim fell."
456,"“I was thinking at first they were fighting like they were drunken people,” said Bidur Bista, whose cellphone video appears on Twitter. “Once the guy started shooting, I was scared.”"
457,"The man was pronounced dead on the scene, according to the police. Officials have not identified the victim because he was not carrying identification."
458,Police did not know whether the men knew each other before they met on the train that pulled into the station on the border of Jackson Heights and Elmhurst. Investigators were also trying to determine whether the incident involved gang ties.
459,"Andy Byford, the subway’s leader, said in a statement: “I want people to know that despite this beyond-horrifying incident which is under active investigation, the subway is remarkably safe, both generally as a public space as well as relative to other modes of transport such as driving.”"
460,"The police transit chief, Edward Delatorre, said there was just one crime for every million riders that pass through the system each day. It was the first recorded murder on the subway in just over six months."
461,"Fights are common on the subway, but the video captured a rare instance of deadly violence."
462,"When the train doors opened, passengers in the car where the men fought fled to other cars, prompting Mr. Bista, 47, to step out of the car in front of them. He started recording on his phone."
463,"Mr. Bista said the victim and his assailants were fighting for control of the gun, and the men trying to break it up were asking a city transit worker to help. But Mr. Bista said the worker refused to step in. “He probably could get that gun in his hand and that person would not have lost his life,” he said."
464,Mr. Bista said he struggled to understand how the gunman escaped because police officers are usually camped out on the street below the station and they arrived quickly after the shooting.
465,"The police said investigators were looking for two assailants, but the video appears to show a fourth man wearing a bandanna over his nose and mouth while tugging the victim. An older woman carrying a small rolling suitcase helps peel him from the fight and one of the men breaking it up pushes him against the train."
466,"On the platform after the shooting, a man with a guitar slung over his shoulder appears alone and stunned, repeating aloud, “Oh my god!”"
467,"The train station was closed after the shooting, sending riders scrambling to adjust their plans before it reopened in the evening."
468,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, referred questions to the police."
469,"Maria Romero, the manager of the Nueva Era Flower shop across the street, said she arrived to work shortly after the shooting."
470,"“It is scary, because there are a lot of kids here,” Ms. Romero, who is from Mexico, said through an interpreter. “What could have happened to one of the kids? Sometimes I have my little grandkids here at work with me.”"
471,"She said her customers have been asking her what happened, but she doesn’t have any answers to give them."
472,"Charlie Hernandez, 19, a student at The School of Cooperative Technical Education, was in the middle of moving into a new apartment when he stumbled on the crime scene."
473,"“This happening is surprising because we do have a lot of stabbing or attacks that happened here, but an actual shooting is rarity,” he said."
474,"Mr. Bista said the shooting left him concerned that public spaces weren’t safe. Like many New Yorkers, he depends on the subway to move around the city, and doesn’t plan to stop using it."
475,"“There’s no alternative,” he said. “I have to take it.”"

477,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted on Wednesday to raise fares for New York City subway and bus riders in April. But the agency says that higher fares will not solve its deep financial crisis.
478,"The board voted to keep the base fare at $2.75 while eliminating the 5 percent bonus that riders receive when buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard. Commuters who rely on the authority’s sprawling network of trains, buses, bridges and tunnels will also see fare and toll increases of about 4 percent."
479,"On April 21, the price of a weekly MetroCard will rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass will increase to $127, up from $121."
480,The fare increase vote comes as state lawmakers decide whether to approve new revenue streams for the system. Transit leaders say they need billions of dollars to tackle huge budget deficits and to pay for critical repairs.
481,[Update: Subway fare rises on April 21]
482,"The board has approved modest fare increases every two years, but this is the first one since the subway descended into crisis in 2017. Without additional funding, transit leaders say they could be forced to make service cuts."
483,"The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said it was a difficult decision to raise fares, but that fares needed to keep up with inflation."
484,"“I don’t think anyone relishes this vote today, but I think it’s important to keep this agency running,” said Ms. Trottenberg, who also serves on the board."
485,"Still, some subway riders were angry about being asked to pay more to ride a system that is plagued by delays. Cameron L. Mitchell, a library assistant at Columbia University, posted on Twitter: “The M.T.A. expects us to pay more for service that continues to decline? No wonder ridership is down.”"
486,"In addition to a fare increase on the commuter railroads, the tolls on M.T.A. bridges and tunnels will increase on March 31. For E-ZPass users, the toll on most crossings will rise by 36 cents. At the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, where tolls are collected only when entering Staten Island, the E-ZPass toll will rise to $12.24, up from $11.52, and the toll via mail will increase to $19, up from $17."
487,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is pressing for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, has warned that without congestion pricing, the authority might have to raise fares by 30 percent."
488,"The push for congestion pricing got a significant boost on Tuesday when Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm on the idea, announced his support for the proposal. In a joint plan, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio also called for two new revenue sources for the transit system: a cannabis tax and an internet sales tax."
489,"On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio rode the subway to sell riders on congestion pricing. Cameras captured the mayor, who is known for traveling around the city in a black SUV, handing out fliers at a station in Brooklyn."
490,"“What I would say to drivers is this is what the City of New York needs, this is what all of us need,” the mayor told reporters. “8.6 million people are all in this together. If we don’t fix our subways, our economy is not going to work.”"
491,But a group of Senate Democrats representing Long Island said they had “troubling concerns” about congestion pricing and argued that the plan was too focused on the subway and did not do enough to benefit the Long Island Rail Road.
492,"Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader, warned that these opposing voices must be heard in the debate regarding transit funding. “I look forward to working with my Long Island delegation to ensure that the needs of Long Island are met,” she said in a statement."
493,"The fare and toll increases are expected to raise about $336 million each year, but only about half of the authority’s $16 billion operating budget comes from fares and tolls. The rest comes from dedicated taxes and state and local subsidies and other revenue."
494,"The board was expected to approve higher fares last month, but it delayed the vote after Mr. Cuomo strongly opposed the increases. Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, had raised the prospect of a separate proposal that would tie fare increases to service improvements."
495,"Another board member, Mitchell Pally, who represents Long Island, made a last-ditch effort to delay the fare increase for commuter railroads until the board could consider Mr. Schwartz’s idea. But the board voted down Mr. Pally’s motion to push back the decision."
496,"New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride, the agency’s troubled paratransit service, wanted to keep the base fare at $2.75 since that is what they pay for their trips. A separate proposal would have increased the base fare for a single-ride MetroCard to $3 while doubling the pay-per-ride bonus to 10 percent."
497,"The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has made the case that the system has improved markedly over the last year. The on-time rate, which once hovered around 65 percent, rose to 77 percent last month."
498,"The transit agency also recently unveiled the name of the new fare payment system it will introduce in May. The system will be called OMNY, which stands for “One Metro New York.”"
499,"Subway and bus riders will eventually be able to tap a bank card or a smartphone on an electronic reader to enter the system and the MetroCard will be retired. In May, the technology will appear on the subway for the first time on the 4, 5 and 6 lines, from Grand Central Station in Manhattan to Barclays Center in Brooklyn."
500,"If congestion pricing fails in Albany this year, the authority could face difficult choices, from a major fare increase to laying off workers. Even if congestion pricing is approved, it will not provide all the funding the authority says it needs to improve its network of subways, buses and commuter railroads."
501,Mr. Cuomo says congestion pricing could raise $15 billion. But the authority’s next five-year capital plan could cost between $40 billion and $60 billion.
502,"At the same time, critics say the agency has misspent money and failed to rein in soaring costs on projects like East Side Access, a new train station for the Long Island Rail Road under Grand Central Terminal. The cost has ballooned to more than $11 billion."
503,"The authority has a long list of priorities, from improving the bus network to installing more elevators on the subway. At a board meeting on Monday, accessibility advocates raised alarm over reports that the agency might scale back its plans to install elevators at 50 stations in the next five years."
504,"Mr. Byford, the president of New York City Transit, the agency that oversees the subway and buses, pledged to make elevators a top priority."
505,"“This president isn’t wavering,” Mr. Byford said. “My commitment to those 50 stations is rock solid.”"
506,"As I got off a train in Manhattan on Wednesday, I paid little attention to a flutter out of the corner of my eye on the subway. Then another passenger told me that I had dropped some money."
507,"“That isn’t mine,” I told her as I glanced at what turned out to be $90 on the ground."
508,I realized the flutter had been the money falling out of the coat of a man standing near me who had just stepped off the train.
509,"The doors were about to close, and no one was acting, so I grabbed the cash and left the train. But I was too late. The man had disappeared into the crowd. I waited a few minutes to see if he would return, but he was long gone. I tried to find a transit employee or police officer, but none were in sight."
510,"I was running late, so I left. But now what? What are you supposed to do with money that isn’t yours?"
511,"Note: Are you the mystery man? If so, email me at niraj.chokshi@nytimes.com with as many corroborating details as you can, including 1) the subway line 2) the stop 3) the time 4) the denominations of the bills and 5) your general appearance, including your coat and its color."
512,"Ethicists generally approach moral questions like this in one of three ways, according to Andrew L. McFarland, a professor of philosophy at LaGuardia Community College in Queens."
513,"One approach, credited to Immanuel Kant, is focused on motive: I should return the money because it’s my moral duty to do so, period."
514,"“Kant says, ‘Look, it seems to be that what makes this the right thing to do is doing it because it’s the right thing to do, not because you’re worried about the possible repercussions,’” Mr. McFarland said."
515,"That contrasts with the second approach, which is concerned with the consequences. What will happen if I return the money? What if I donate it to a charity instead? Under that approach, I might act in a way that I believe will produce the most good and alleviate suffering."
516,"The third and final approach, whose intellectual forebears include Aristotle and Confucius, focuses on virtue. Under that approach, I would act neither out of duty nor fear of consequences, but by my sense of what is right. I might seek out the advice of my most moral friend: What would a person who is virtuous do?"
517,"In the end, though, Mr. McFarland told me what he tells his students: These approaches only offer guidance on how to think about a problem."
518,"“Ultimately, you’ve got to figure out what you’re going to do on your own,” he said."
519,NBC gave Michael Schur total freedom. So the TV impresario made a sitcom that’s also a profound work of philosophy.
520,"The law is more prescriptive, even if most have no clue what it says, according to Bruce Green, a professor and director of the Louis Stein Center for Law and Ethics at Fordham Law School."
521,"“The question is, ‘Does the law accord with people’s ordinary moral and societal intuitions?’” said Mr. Green, who is also the chairman of the New York City Bar Association’s Professional Ethics Committee."
522,"“Because nobody’s going to know to look up the law unless somebody gets a call from a reporter,” he added."
523,"Mr. Green was gracious enough to do just that and here’s what he found: Under Section 252 of New York personal property law, any person who finds an item worth $20 or more has 10 days to return it to the owner or report it to the authorities. Fail to do so, and you face a maximum fine of $100 and up to six months in prison. (Yikes!)"
524,"“I don’t think anyone’s going to prosecute you,” Mr. Green assured me. He also offered a recommendation in case I wanted to keep the cash: “Don’t write a piece about it because that’s pretty inculpatory.” Noted."

526,"I want to return the money, so that leaves me with a few options as the deadline approaches."
527,"One of them should be obvious by now. As a reporter at The New York Times, I have access to a huge platform through which I can spread the news. Hey, guy, I have your money!"
528,"For most people in this situation, though, the best option is to turn the money over to a transit official or a police officer."
529,"Station agents, train conductors or bus drivers who receive lost items or money typically collect as much information about the item as possible and provide a receipt to the person turning it in, according to Sarah Meyer, the chief customer officer for New York City Transit."
530,The lost item is then taken to the New York City Transit Lost Property Unit at Penn Station.
531,"“It’s carried by the same system that collects money out of vending machines, so it’s very secure and always accompanied by armed personnel,” Ms. Meyer said."
532,"The transit agency keeps the items for anywhere from six months to three years, depending on their value. After that, the items are auctioned off with proceeds going to the transit agency’s coffers. Last year, the agency returned about $127,000 in lost cash to owners."
533,"The New York Police Department follows a similar procedure for lost items, though the person who turns in money or a valuable item may be able to keep it if it goes unclaimed."
534,"Ideally, this article will mean a happy conclusion for the man who lost the money. If I don’t find him within 10 days, I’ll turn the cash over to the authorities."

536,"New York City’s subway and bus system needs higher fares to shore up its finances and to make much-needed improvements in service. But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he opposed the increase, once again publicly humiliating the behemoth transit agency in an attempt to force it to change."
537,"The brinkmanship has deepened the sense of crisis at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, throwing into doubt the future of the agency’s leadership and leaving riders wondering about what will happen to fares and promised renovations after years of decay."
538,"With his comments, Mr. Cuomo, who has insisted that he does not actually control the authority, has put pressure on the M.T.A.’s leaders to more quickly overhaul the system. The issue, though, is whether being so publicly blunt about the agency, as Mr. Cuomo has been twice this month, is the most effective way to turn things around there."
539,"On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo argued against a fare increase and questioned whether the agency actually needed the money."
540,"“I have no faith in what they say,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, in reference to the fare hike debate."
541,"Mr. Cuomo made clear that his comments were part of a broader strategy to bring about reforms. Asked whether the agency might have to cut service without the revenue, Mr. Cuomo said, “No. Tighten your belt. Make the place run better.”"
542,"With a fare vote scheduled for Thursday, a close ally of the governor, Lawrence S. Schwartz, has intervened to force the agency to examine other options. The board is considering fare proposals that could raise the cost of a MetroCard swipe to $3 in March."
543,"But Mr. Schwartz, an M.T.A. board member and former top aide to Mr. Cuomo, plans to offer his own proposals, which include tying fare increases to better service and investing additional money toward combating fare evasion, which the agency says has become a serious problem."
544,"“I’m dead set against voting for any fare increases without performance improvements tied to it,” Mr. Schwartz said in an interview, adding, “I don’t know what will happen on Thursday.”"
545,"The uncertainty over the fare increase highlights the growing dysfunction at the authority, which has increasingly been subject to the whims of Mr. Cuomo and his allies. For years, subway leaders had been planning to close the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Then Mr. Cuomo abruptly called off the shutdown this month."
546,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has criticized the agency, complaining of its stodgy bureaucracy and saying he wants to “blow up the M.T.A.” The idea of calling off the fare increase — something Mr. Cuomo has supported for months — sounds good in theory. The subway is still far from reliable nearly two years after the system descended into crisis."
547,"But the transit agency’s financial plan relies on modest fare and toll increases, every two years, across its sprawling system of subways, buses, commuter railroads and paratransit service. The fare increase is expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year."
548,"The authority is working to make reforms and improve service with its existing resources, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority."
549,"“The M.T.A. board will have robust discussion and decide on the best course of action in the context of the M.T.A.’s dire financial position, which requires fare and toll increases as well as new, sustainable, adequate sources of funding in order to balance the budget while avoiding painful service cuts,” Mr. Tarek said in a statement."
550,"The authority’s board has been considering two options for fare increases of about 4 percent: The first would keep the base fare at $2.75, but end the bonus for buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard; the second would increase the base fare to $3 and double the bonus to 10 percent. A weekly pass would rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass could increase to $127, up from $121."
551,"Even with the fare increase, subway leaders say the system is in a grim financial situation. They have warned that without new revenue sources, their only options would be even higher fare increases or drastic cuts to subway and bus service. The agency expects to have a deficit of nearly $1 billion by 2022."
552,"Mr. Cuomo supports congestion pricing — a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan — as a new revenue source for the authority, which could generate $15 billion over a decade. The governor has said that congestion pricing will be a top priority during the current legislative session."
553,"At a board committee meeting on Tuesday, transit leaders expressed concern about how the agency’s credit rating had been downgraded twice last year by Standard & Poor’s. David Jones, a board member, asked what would happen if state lawmakers did not approve congestion pricing this year."
554,"“If the legislature were to not pass congestion pricing, we would be effectively back at the drawing board trying to figure out what our next steps would be, to be quite honest,” said Patrick McCoy, the authority’s finance director."
555,Mr. Cuomo has complained that the creation of the authority was “diabolical” and intended to keep elected officials from being held accountable for tough decisions.
556,"“It was purposefully designed so that everyone can point fingers at everybody else, and nobody’s responsible,” Mr. Cuomo said this month. “Why? Because no politician wanted to be responsible. You’re talking about trains and subways and fare increases. And no politician wants to be the one who suggested a fare increase.”"
557,"The authority’s board votes on major issues for the regional transit system like fare increases and service changes. The board typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by the mayor. Mr. Cuomo also selects its chairman and had a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership like Andy Byford, the subway’s leader."
558,Mr. Schwartz said he had decided to search for other fare options on his own and had not discussed the matter with Mr. Cuomo.
559,"“We have to try to do it in a way where those who are economically vulnerable or rely on the system the most are impacted the least,” Mr. Schwartz said. “And I want to assure riders that New York City Transit and Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road are going to be held accountable for performance metrics.”"
560,"Mr. Schwartz did not give specifics about his proposals, but did say that in order for fare increases to take place, leaders would have to show, for instance, that on-time rates were improving."
561,"Lisa Daglian, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a watchdog group, said she was concerned about what would happen to the system without a fare increase."
562,"“How does that money get made up?” she said. “All of the Plan B scenarios are bad and they’re not something riders should want. Nobody wants a fare increase, but nobody wants service cuts.”"
563,"At the board meeting on Tuesday, riders made heartfelt pleas against a fare increase. Valerie Joseph, who relies on the Access-A-Ride paratransit service, said she had limited income and could not afford higher fares."
564,"“Raising the fare,” she said, “I won’t even have money to eat.”"

566,"As commuters shuffled through the Lexington Avenue-53rd Street subway station on Thursday morning, Tyrone Cooper serenaded the bundled-up passengers with his usual renditions of popular tunes."
567,But Mr. Cooper’s performance also came with a warning: “It’s too cold to be outside right now. You can get sick and die out there.”
568,"As a cold spell cloaked New York, with temperatures reaching only into the teens, city officials urged residents to limit their time outside. But for the homeless, options were limited."
569,"Mr. Cooper, like countless others without shelter, sought protection in transit stations and on trains. He spent Wednesday night on the subway’s E line, a popular refuge in the winter because the train stays underground during its 50-minute trip between Queens and Lower Manhattan."
570,"The merciless chill  arrived from the Midwest, walloping the region and interrupting daily routines. New Jersey Transit disruptions on Thursday morning frustrated commuters who were stuck waiting outside for trains, and Newark Liberty International Airport was reporting delays into the afternoon because of weather and wind."
571,Some suburban schools delayed or canceled classes. City public schools and government offices remained open.
572,The outlook for Thursday night was no better: a low of 10 degrees. Temperatures are expected to climb into the 20s and 30s on Friday.
573,[Follow the latest updates on the polar vortex.]
574,"On Thursday morning, Mr. Cooper, 63, seemed in good spirits despite the deep freeze. He was posted in the Lexington Avenue station with his microphone and speaker, singing “Can’t Help Falling in Love” and “Ain’t No Sunshine” in hopes of collecting tips."
575,"“This is like being in your living room,” he said. “I mean not your living room, but compared to some places, this is really a good place to be at because it’s not too cold. You don’t even need a cup of coffee.”"
576,"Mr. Cooper, who has been homeless for the past two years, said he prefers this station because the platforms are far from the entrances, minimizing drafts. The platform was noticeably warmer than other stations in the city."
577,"On days like these, many homeless New Yorkers prefer staying underground to checking into a shelter."
578,"“The shelter environment is so hostile,” said Leopold Wiseman, 37, who has been homeless for about 15 years, as he rested on a bench at the Queens Plaza subway station, also on the E line. “You have to spend all your energy trying to survive.”"
579,"In 2018, The New York Times found several dozen homeless people — including some just released from the hospital — on each E train during frigid nights in January."
580,"The city’s most recent estimate of the population found 3,675 homeless people on the streets, in parks and on subways on a single winter night in 2018 — 48 percent of whom were in the subways. For years, officials have grappled with how to help."
581,"The Bowery Residents’ Committee, a nonprofit that contracts with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the city, sends outreach workers through the subways and commuter rail stations to try to bring the homeless into shelters. When temperatures drop below freezing, the city issues a “Code Blue” alert, and the workers check in more frequently."
582,"“This weather obviously increases the risk to a vulnerable population,” Andy Byford, who oversees the subways, said in a statement. “We are working with the city and N.Y.P.D. to get vulnerable people the help and shelter they need in this extreme cold weather, while taking steps at the same time to maintain a pleasant and safe traveling environment for our riders.”"
583,"This winter, the M.T.A. helped increase the number of Bowery committee outreach workers, including at Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal. At those stations, an M.T.A. spokesman said, the authority has deployed 24 additional transit officers to assist the homeless. The M.T.A. has also provided the Bowery Residents’ Committee extra funding for more beds for the homeless."
584,But Walter Miller Foster Jr. said he was just counting the days until he could spend less time indoors or underground.
585,"“I prefer to be in the parks,” said Mr. Foster, who has been homeless for about 20 years. “That’s where no one will bother you. It’s public domain. I can just hang out and chill.”"

587,"We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave."
588,"The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang."
589,"He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music."
590,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

596,I heard a voice whispering from behind me: “Get the grapes.”
597,"I turned to face a woman with gentle features and streaks of gray hair, her body wrapped tightly in a fur coat."

609,Dear Diary:
610,I was supposed to meet a friend to pick up a dress she was altering for me. We were going to rendezvous in the middle of the No. 1 subway at West 79th Street. She was coming downtown from Washington Heights on her way to work.
611,"When the train pulled into the station, I looked up and down the platform to find her, but I didn’t see her."
612,The train operator poked his head out the window. His smile was as bright as the sun.
613,“Who are you looking for?” he said.
614,"“Jackie,” I said."
615,He got on the public address system.
616,“Will Jackie please step out of the door of your car so your friend can find you?” he said.
617,"Jackie stepped out. I saw her, and we hopped back on the train together."
618,The train operator made another announcement: “Jackie and her friend found each other. That’s good.”
619,People on the train were laughing and smiling. Jackie gave me the dress and I got off at the next station.
620,I ran up to the train operator to thank him.
621,"“You see that musician over there?” he said, pointing to a guy on the platform playing a keyboard. He handed me a $5 bill. “Give him this.”"
622,The train began to leave the station.
623,“How’re you doing my man?” the train operator yelled as he pulled away.

627,"Just as my leg began to tire out from pushing, a small sedan turned the corner behind me and began to trail me. I swerved to the side of the street to make space for the car to drive by."
628,"After speeding up, the car slowed down once it came even with me. The window rolled down, and a young guy wearing a Yankees cap poked out his head."
629,“Where you off to?” he asked as we cruised along parallel to each other.
630,"“L.I.R.R.,” I said between breaths. “Queens Village Station.”"
631,He grinned.
632,“Grab on.”
633,"I smiled, grabbed onto the window and felt my wheels scream as he picked up speed."

638,"The evening rush was all but over on Tuesday as the man, a pizza maker heading home to Queens, walked, unsteadily, down the stairs onto the subway platform. A train, its doors already closed, was picking up speed as it pulled out."
639,"In a few terrifying seconds, the train pulled the man into the tunnel just past the stop at Grand Central Station in the heart of Manhattan. He was unconscious when the police arrived and was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics."
640,"Exactly how the episode unfolded remained unclear on Wednesday. The authorities said that, contrary to earlier reports, neither the man’s coat nor the strap of a bag had gotten caught in the doors of the train."
641,"The police had not released the man’s name on Wednesday afternoon. But he was identified as Vicente Alatorre by his brother, Edilberto, who had spoken to the medical examiner’s office. Edilberto was told that investigators found an I.D. issued by the Mexican consulate on the body, which identified the man as “Vicentito Fidelito Alatorre-Adan,” the same name on Mr. Alatorre’s birth certificate."
642,"“The details they gave me leave me with no doubt that it’s him,” Edilberto Alatorre said."
643,"The youngest of seven children, Vicente, 39, had moved to the United States from Mexico in the late 1990s to join Edilberto and several other siblings in New York."
644,"“He came for work,” his brother said in Spanish. “Our family’s situation in Mexico was tough, and we had scarce resources. He came here to be able to work and make money.”"
645,"Mr. Alatorre had worked at Patsy’s Pizzeria at 801 Second Avenue, a few blocks from Grand Central Station. He lived in Corona, Queens, with his longtime girlfriend, Leticia Hernández Carrillo, who said that Mr. Alatorre usually arrived home by 8:30 p.m. When he did not appear on Tuesday night, she became worried and began calling and texting him. She also called some of his relatives, asking if they knew where he was. Edilberto Alatorre said he had also tried to reach his brother, to no avail."
646,"Subway officials said such accidents are rare in a system with more than five million riders a day. The transit agency reported that 189 people came into contact with a moving train last year, a description that covers a range of encounters. The figure included everything from suicides to people who punched the side of a train, apparently angry that it was leaving a station without them."
647,"Such accidents are so rare that when they do happen they send shudders through riders, rekindling fears about standing too close to the edge of the platform."
648,"While deterring people from deliberately jumping in front of trains is hard, subway officials long ago sought to avoid accidents by installing yellow strips with a knobby surface that are supposed to deliver a tactile warning: Stand back."
649,"That was a cautionary message for subway riders who had been accustomed to leaning over the edge, looking into the darkness for the headlights of an approaching train. And it was a message that some passengers were heeding more carefully than ever on Wednesday."
650,"“I’m not standing on that yellow line,” Mark Joseph, 69, said on Wednesday as he stood on the platform where the accident had occurred and a transit employee in a yellow vest shouted “Step back!”"
651,"“A lot of people don’t listen,” Mr. Joseph said. “They walk right up to the edge. I’m scared you can trip or somebody can push you. It’s not worth it. You can die.”"
652,"But some passengers and some behavior experts said New Yorkers have become so accustomed to the yellow platform markings that they ignore them. What matters more is squeezing onto an already-crowded train, elbowing past other people and slicing through a crowd."
653,"“I guess these dots are supposed to make you aware of the danger,” said Antana Locs, 60. “But when people see the train coming, it’s a natural instinct to lean forward and be first on the train.”"
654,"At Grand Central, witnesses told the police that the man had been walking on the yellow caution line along the edge of a platform around 7:20 p.m. as the train pulled out."
655,"Surveillance-camera video from inside the station showed his body being thrown against a staircase and pulled into the tunnel, according to a law enforcement official."
656,"The man’s body struck an electrical box near the entrance to the tunnel and set off a flash that caught the attention of the train operator, who applied the brakes, the official said."
657,The police said the medical examiner would conduct an autopsy that would include toxicology tests.
658,It remained unclear why or how the man came into contact with the train. One possibility was that he had stumbled into the gap between the platform and the train and had been caught on the lip below one of the train doors.
659,"But some transportation experts wonder whether the yellow warning strips on subway platforms serve their purpose, crowds or not."
660,"“Behavior on subway platforms is not dictated by yellow lines but by how people assess their relative safety and proximity to the subway doors,” said Mitchell Moss, a professor at New York University where he is the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management. “If the yellow lines were effective at one point, most subway riders don’t consider them in their calculus of where to stand on the platform.”"
661,But some transportation experts said the warning strips had made a difference.
662,"“As a rider, you do see people standing further away from the platform,” said Thomas F. Prendergast, a former chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. A warning strip “certainly helps define a place — ‘Beware, move back.’ I think people respect that.”"
663,"Mr. Alatorre’s girlfriend, Ms. Hernandez Carillo, said that he had left for work around 9 a.m. Tuesday as usual. His brother said he “lived a quiet life without a lot of exuberance.”"
664,"“He was almost always home and, if not, he was at work,” Edilberto Alatorre said."

666,"A man has been taken into police custody in connection with a brutal attack on a 78-year-old woman on the subway in the Bronx this month, the police said on Saturday."
667,"The man, Marc Gomez, 36, of Yonkers, was arrested around 10:30 a.m. on Saturday in Lower Manhattan, the police said. Mr. Gomez was identified this week by an anonymous tip that said he often hung around areas of Lower Manhattan. Mr. Gomez was charged with felony assault."
668,"The attack, which took place around 3 a.m. on March 10, surfaced this week when a video of the assault was posted to the internet. The recording of the attack had received more than 10 million views as of Saturday afternoon."
669,"The video showed a tall man wearing jeans, glasses, a leather jacket and a knit cap forcefully kicking the woman at least six times as she sat on a northbound No. 2 train that was pulling into the Nereid Avenue station. Bystanders recorded the encounter and shouted but did not intervene."
670,"As the man made his way off the train, he turned to the passengers recording and said, “WorldStar that” — a reference to a popular website that often showcases clips of violent altercations."
671,"The woman was met by an ambulance at the next train station, and treated for swelling and cuts to the face, the police said."
672,"On Sunday, Alisa Cox, Mr. Gomez’s fiancée, said the woman repeatedly threatened her family, including her 11-year-old daughter, as they were traveling back to Yonkers after attending a birthday party."
673,"“It looks like he just went over there and starting kicking her for no apparent reason,” Ms. Cox, 44, said in an interview, adding, “I’ve known him since he was 16. He’s not a bad person.”"
674,"Ms. Cox said Mr. Gomez, who had been working in a TriBeCa restaurant, immediately expressed remorse after he got off the train, admitting he let his temper get the best of him."
675,"Mr. Gomez has another open case in connection with an arrest from November. Officers arrested Mr. Gomez and a teenager after they found a loaded shotgun in a car the two were riding in on the Cross Bronx Expressway, the police said."
676,"Mr. Gomez was charged at the time with criminal possession of a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of a weapon after the police said they found a Mossberg shotgun in the car, a 2018 Mercedes with taxi license plates."
677,"While crime in the subway — and the city — is at lows not seen since the 1950s, violent encounters in the transit system posted to social media receive outsize attention. One such attack was the murder of 20-year-old Abel Mosso by alleged rival gang members on a Queens subway platform last month."
678,"As of March 17, there were 465 reported crimes in the transit system, down from 476 during the same period in 2018."
679,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lashed out at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in a wide-ranging speech last week, criticizing the agency he effectively controls for its inefficiency and outdated technology."
680,"Though the thrust of Mr. Cuomo’s speech pushed for congestion pricing, he took particular aim at the transit authority for its decision-making related to cleaning subway stations."
681,"“My favorite M.T.A. decision — because you have to laugh, otherwise you cry — is the one they made to pick a product to clean the subway stations,” Mr. Cuomo said Thursday, accompanied by a photoshopped image of a man cleaning the floor of a subway station. “What product did they pick? Tide. Yes, the same Tide detergent you use at home to wash your clothes. If it’s got to be clean, it’s got to be Tide.”"
682,"Mr. Cuomo’s criticism, however, did not seem to register with some riders. The New York Times spoke to nearly two dozen riders on Sunday, none of whom were aware of Mr. Cuomo’s comments."
683,"But most agreed about the state of the subways: They are filthy, and it does not matter how they are cleaned. Riders just want to see improvements."
684,"“It’s pretty gross,” William Sit, 32, said. “It’s not uncommon to have puke on the floor or even on the train as a smell.”"
685,"[Track fires, crowded platforms and delays: Read more tales from subway hell.]"
686,"Standing on the platform for the Q train at the 72nd Street Station, Mr. Sit, a Brooklyn resident, said the cleanliness of stations varies drastically. The newer stations, like one at 72nd Street that opened two years ago, are cleaner."
687,"“It’s not getting better,” said Cynthia Morgan, a 66-year-old from New Rochelle, N.Y., who was waiting for the shuttle at Times Square. “It’s a daily experience.”"
688,"While M.T.A. officials did not directly address Mr. Cuomo’s criticism, they did acknowledge that too many stations are “unacceptably dirty,” and said the M.T.A. is taking steps to address it."
689,"“It was clear that the old methods simply weren’t working, and this new, different and urgent approach will provide our customers with the service and experience they deserve,” Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said in a statement."
690,"In January, the M.T.A., as part of the Subway Action Plan to improve the system, allocated funds for a one-time effort to clean and refurbish 100 stations and up to 3,000 cars. The M.T.A spent $9.5 million on outside contractors to perform the work."
691,"“The fact that the M.T.A. is using Tide to clean the subways punctuates the point that a fundamental overhaul in approach and management is needed,” Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement."
692,A spokesman for the M.T.A said Tide was used before the new cleaning initiatives.
693,Riders seemed concerned whether the subways could be kept clean as a result of the large number of homeless riders.
694,Several said they have noticed an increase in the number of people sleeping on the trains. The subway has long been a refuge for homeless people looking to stay warm during the winter months.
695,"“The smell of the homeless — it’s very sad,” said Martha Carrillo, a 66-year-old resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, who expressed sympathy for their condition but said people who sleep on the subway often bring unpleasant odors."
696,"Richie Johnstone, a 26-year-old Manhattan resident, said he has had to switch train cars because of the smell."
697,"“I had one experience where I walked on the car with my girlfriend and there was a homeless man sleeping there, and the subway car smelled so bad that there was literally not a single person on the car,” Mr. Johnstone said. “Everyone walked on and walked back off and got on the next one.”"
698,"Kathryn Katz, a frequent visitor to New York City from New Haven, Conn., was one of the few riders who said she had seen improvements in subway cleanliness over the past few decades."
699,"“I remember the subways back in the 50s and 60s with rats and everything,” Ms. Katz, 70, said. “It’s significantly cleaner."
700,"She added: “Considering the amount of volume of people going through, it’s just amazing that it’s as clean as it is. You think there’d be trash all over the place.”"

702,Malaysia Goodson entered a Manhattan subway station on Monday night pushing a stroller.
703,"Her 1-year-old daughter, Rhylee, was nestled inside. Ms. Goodson, 22, of Stamford, Conn., had brought her along on a shopping trip to the city."
704,"Like so many New York City parents, Ms. Goodson faced a familiar but perilous challenge: hauling her stroller and daughter down the steps of a station that, like most stops in the city’s creaking subway system, had no elevator."
705,"As Ms. Goodson made her descent, she fell, tumbling down a flight of stairs and onto the subway platform at the Seventh Avenue station, at 53rd Street, officials said."
706,Her daughter survived the fall. Ms. Goodson did not.
707,"Her death reverberated throughout New York City, among stunned parents who often traverse crowded subway stairs with strollers and among people who are disabled and regularly encounter an inaccessible transit system."
708,"“Everybody who has been a parent or a caregiver knows that this is a problem,” said Christine Serdjenian Yearwood, the founder of Up-Stand, an organization that has pushed to make transit more accessible for parents."
709,"“I’ve had a lot of people write and say, ‘This could have been me,’” she said."
710,"Ms. Goodson was a doting parent and an outgoing person, her mother, Tamika Goodson, said. One of four children, she was raised in New York but moved to Stamford with her family nine years ago."
711,"Mark Marchesani, who was her guidance counselor at Westhill High School in Stamford, remembered Ms. Goodson as a teenager who “had a tough shell” but was “a sweetheart.”"
712,"“She was the kind of kid that when you made her smile,” he said, “it felt like a real win.”"
713,"After graduating in 2015, her mother said, Ms. Goodson had big dreams. She worked for about a year at a day care center in Stamford, and loved it. But she had also talked about becoming a security guard or a flight attendant."
714,"Ms. Goodson’s daughter was the light of her life, her cousin, Ronshuana Anthony, said."
715,"“Malaysia just gave so much of her self,” Ms. Anthony said, adding, “She’d give her last breath to her if she could.”"
716,"When emergency responders arrived at the subway station on Monday night, Ms. Goodson was unconscious and unresponsive, police said."
717,"She was taken to the Mount Sinai West hospital, where she was pronounced dead."
718,"Ms. Goodson’s daughter was found conscious and treated at the scene. She was reunited with her father and grandmother in the city and was doing well, Tamika Goodson said."
719,"It was not clear whether Ms. Goodson suffered a medical condition or if she was killed from the impact of the fall. The city’s medical examiner will determine her cause of death, officials said."
720,"Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subway, called the death “a heartbreaking tragedy” and said the agency would work with the police to investigate."
721,"While officials are continuing to probe the circumstances around Ms. Goodson’s fall, her death has shined a light on the lack of elevator service and accessibility issues that have long plagued the city’s subway system."
722,"The station where Ms. Goodson fell does not have an elevator. Only about a quarter of the subway system’s 472 stations have elevators, and the ones that exist are often out of order."
723,"One survey of subway elevator breakdowns found that, on average, each elevator breaks down 53 times a year."
724,"When the elevators are functioning properly, they are often small, odoriferous and inconveniently positioned at the far ends of stations. That can make them frustrating for disabled subway riders who depend on them and an unappealing option for straphangers who do not."
725,"“The subway system is not accessible for everyone, and that’s an environment the M.T.A. should not allow,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter. He was one of several politicians, including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, to call for a more accessible subway system."
726,"A lawsuit filed in 2017 against the transit authority, which operates the subway, described New York’s subway system as one of the least accessible in the country and accused the agency of violating the federal Americans With Disabilities Act."
727,"The case, which was joined by the Justice Department in 2018, is still active, according to Disability Rights Advocates, which is representing the plaintiffs."
728,"The authority has been slow to add elevators to its sprawling system, which first opened more than a century ago. Washington’s subway, which was built in the 1970s and is much smaller than New York’s, has far more elevators."
729,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office, which called Ms. Goodson’s death a tragedy, responded to questions about the system’s lack of elevators with a statement saying that the transit agency “must make accessibility a priority.”."
730,"Andy Byford, the subway’s leader, embraced the cause when he announced a major plan to modernize the subway last year. The plan, Fast Forward, calls for increasing the rate of elevator installations, to more than 50 stations in the next five-year capital plan from 19 in the current capital plan."
731,"The plan would also add enough elevators to the subway system by 2025 so that no rider would be more than two stops from an accessible station, Mr. Tarek said. But Mr. Byford’s proposal could cost $40 billion over 10 years and has not been funded."
732,"Currently, there are gaps as big as 10 stops between accessible stations in some places. Besides accessible stations, New Yorkers who rely on wheelchairs can use buses or Access-A-Ride, the city’s notoriously unreliable paratransit service."
733,Mr. Byford has made accessibility one of his major priorities since joining the transit agency one year ago. He hired Alex Elegudin as the subway’s first “senior adviser for systemwide accessibility.”
734,Mr. Elegudin uses a wheelchair as a result of a spinal cord injury stemming from a deer-related car accident in 2003.
735,"Danny Pearlstein, of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group, said the lack of an elevator at the Seventh Avenue station, a transfer point between three subway lines that cross four boroughs, was “indicative of how much the system falls short today, and how much we need to improve the situation.”"
736,"“At some point in each New Yorker’s life, they will need an elevator to travel the subway,” said Mr. Pearlstein, the alliance’s policy and communications director."
737,"New Yorkers with young children said the scenario was all too familiar. On a popular Facebook group for mothers, UES Mommas, one woman posted about Ms. Goodson’s death, quickly drawing dozens of comments."
738,"“How many of us do this on a daily basis?” the woman wrote, of lugging her stroller on subway stairs. “I know my family does.”"
739,"Christine Ann Denny, a mother of two and a psychiatry professor at Columbia University, said the stress of carrying her daughter on the subway was one reason she moved to New Jersey."
740,"“Carrying a stroller, my briefcase for work, my daughter and her backpack with bottles for day care — it was a nightmare,” she said."
741,Ms. Denny said she was not even surprised by the news.
742,"“Going down the stairs, I didn’t feel safe,” she said. “People are trying to push by you to get ahead of you. Once in a while, you’d meet a great human being who would help you get down the stairs.”"

747,"On Sunday, a man was shot dead on a train platform in Queens. In response, the head of the subways, Andy Byford, said in a statement, “Despite this beyond-horrifying incident which is under active investigation, the subway is remarkably safe, both generally as a public space as well as relative to other modes of transport.”"
748,"But though the crime rate in the subways remains much lower than it was in the 1980s and 90s, a story by my colleagues Emma Fitzsimmons and Edgar Sandoval found that many riders are concerned that crime and disorder may be heading in the wrong direction."

752,"Even an M.T.A. dispatcher, Lora Hinds, said she takes precautions. She avoids wearing jewelry on the trains, and, she said, “I try not to travel at night if I don’t have to.”"
753,"For longtime residents, the subways are much safer than they used to be. Scott M. Stringer, the city comptroller, said that when he was growing up, the A train was a “rolling crime scene.” Hardly anyone would describe it like that today."
754,"Still, transit crimes were up 3.8 percent last year, and have been increasing since 2014. And a series of high profile incidents — including video of a police officer fighting several men in a subway in December — has brought more attention to the issue."
755,"The transit police chief, Edward Delatorre, said that while crime remains relatively rare, the transit system is, in a way, a victim of its own success. “The Wi-Fi is stronger and now anytime anything happens, it’s blasted out right away,” he told my colleagues."
756,Police have said crime is so low that a handful of people — like the international pickpocket ring that struck recently — can make a statistically significant dent.

760,"The club gained notoriety last year after Gavin McInnes, the founder of the right-wing nationalist group the Proud Boys, spoke there and his followers brawled on nearby streets with protesters."
761,The campaign for club president became a test of Republican loyalties in the Trump era.
762,"The eventual winner, Ian Walsh Reilly, represented a segment of the party that celebrates the president’s role as a disrupter."
763,"His opponent, Bob Morgan, 66, a lawyer, represents a more establishment brand of Republicanism that goes back to Teddy Roosevelt."
764,"The club’s membership more than doubled in the run-up to Wednesday’s election, as both sides sought to enlist new members loyal to them."
765,"In the end, Mr. Reilly outpolled Mr. Morgan 324 to 270."
766,"“I see myself as a conservative and a centrist,” Mr. Reilly said. “I am more socially liberal on so many things. I am the first openly gay president of the Metropolitan Republican Club. I’m not radical.”"

809,"Two days after a 22-year-old woman with her 1-year-old daughter in a stroller fell down the steps of a Manhattan subway station, the city’s medical examiner suggested that the woman’s death was not caused by the fall but “appears to be related to a pre-existing medical condition.”"
810,"The chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, did not provide details but said “no significant trauma” was involved in the death of the woman, Malaysia Goodson. She said the cause of Ms. Goodson’s death had not yet been determined. Ms. Goodson’s daughter Rhylee, who was tucked in the stroller, survived."
811,"Malaysia had been healthy all her life, including the past year after the birth of Rhylee, Tamika Goodson, her mother, said. She said she was awaiting word on an autopsy. “I need to know,” she said. “We’re going to find out. If there’s anything, we’re going to find out.”"
812,"Whatever the circumstances that resulted in Ms. Goodson ending up at the bottom of the stairs, her death shaped an anguished dialogue about life in New York City — about how people so rarely offer to lend a hand to those with strollers, about how so many subway stations lack elevators, about how the elevators in stations that have them are so often broken and about how the limitations of the city’s old and creaking transportation system create obstacles, not just for people with small children but for older passengers and people with disabilities."
813,"But more than any other, the idea of stopping and helping someone struggling in the subway echoed through the conversation on social media and on the country’s busiest and biggest public transit system."
814,"“Sometimes strangers will offer to help,” said Aurora Nona-Barnes, 35, “but not as often as you think.” Ms. Nona-Barnes, who was riding the B train on the Upper West Side, had her 2½-year-old son in a stroller and said she was eight months pregnant with her second child."
815,"Ignacio Karacsonyi, who lives in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, with his 21-month-old daughter, said it’s unusual for someone to offer help. “I get a lot of props for being a dad carrying around a kid,” he said, “but no help carrying her up stairs, just, ‘Oh that’s so cute.’ When you’re carrying a stroller up stairs it’s not about cute.” He said he’s had a few close calls, nearly slipping as he went up or down subway stairs with a 40-pound stroller and a 10-pound backpack."
816,"Outside the station where Ms. Goodson died, several people, including some in wheelchairs, left flowers at a makeshift memorial for Ms. Goodson. And in Albany, the managing director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, told state lawmakers that the agency would consider making the station accessible. It opened in the 1930s and has escalators that only go in one direction — up. It has no elevator."
817,"Online, there were efforts to raise money for Ms. Goodson’s family. One page on GoFundMe.com was set up by Ms. Goodson’s brother Dieshe to help pay funeral expenses because the family does not have the money. “If you could help me please lay my sister to rest in peace,” he wrote, “it would help me be at peace knowing I did what she would have done for me.”"
818,"Another campaign on GoFundMe, set up by the day care center where Ms. Goodson worked, is raising money for Rhylee’s education."
819,"“This has heavied a lot of hearts,” her brother wrote."
820,"For many New Yorkers who navigate the subway system every day without realizing how treacherous it can be, the accident was a reminder of how quickly something could go unstoppably wrong"
821,"Last year, Andy Byford, the subway chief, proposed a rescue plan for the failing system that included adding enough elevators by 2025 so that no subway rider would be more than two stops from an accessible station."
822,"That is an ambitious goal for a system in which only about a quarter of the city’s 472 subway stations are wheelchair accessible, one of the lowest percentages of any major transit system in the world."
823,"The rail networks in Boston and Chicago, like New York’s subway, are century-plus old systems. Yet they have more than twice the station accessibility, which means they offer more opportunities for passengers who cannot navigate stairs."
824,About 71 percent of Boston’s subway stations and 69 percent of Chicago’s rail stations have been made accessible. Both cities have concrete plans to reach full accessibility.
825,"The transit agency in New York says the ultimate goal is full systemwide accessibility, and it has been conducting a systemwide survey, assessing accessibility in every remaining station that needs it. On Thursday, Veronique Hakim, the managing director of the transit agency, told state lawmakers that the agency would consider making the station where Ms. Goodson died accessible."
826,"Advocates for the disabled said that accessibility helps everyone. “A more sensitive policy recognizes that at some point in everyone’s life, they’re going to need greater measures of accessibility,” said Danny Pearlstein, the policy and communications director for the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
827,That includes parents with strollers as well as people carrying packages or suitcases or people with injuries that temporarily limit their mobility.
828,"Another group, Disability Rights Advocates, is involved in three class-action lawsuits against the transit agency that involve accessibility. One challenges the agency’s failure to install elevators in every station. Another focuses on elevator breakdowns and alleges that elevator maintenance problems have the effect of excluding people with disabilities from the subway."
829,"At many stations in New York where elevators have been added, the elevators often carry as many parents with strollers as people with disabilities. The transit agency’s “Riding Safely” webpage advises people with strollers to fold them “so that you can carry infants on stairs or escalators.”"
830,"Diego Perez, 44, said on Wednesday that he had noticed how limiting the subway system was, especially for parents — but then he developed a hip problem that forces him to walk with a cane."
831,"“It’s just difficult getting up and down the stairs,” he said, standing outside of a station in Astoria, Queens, that does not have an elevator. “And people rush to get in front of you.”"
832,"Buses may be more accessible, but he said they pose a problem for disabled people, parents or travelers with suitcases. “The buses are packed,” he said, as he leaned on his cane and winced from knee pain."
833,"Going into the subway on Wednesday, Rosie Navarro, 38, went through her usual routine, lifting her son Rodrigo out of his stroller and hoping that someone would carry it — or him. Sometimes someone offers to assist, sometimes not, she said as Rodrigo began to cry."
834,"Ms. Navarro said the stations near where she lives in western Queens lack accessibility. The closest accessible station in one direction is at Queens Plaza, two stations from the one in her neighborhood. In the other direction, she said, the closest station was four stops away."
835,"Walking to either station with a stroller could take a half-hour, she said."
836,"“It’s difficult,” she said. “Without elevators, it’s just difficult.”"

838,A 26-year-old man who the police said is a member of the violent MS-13 street gang was arrested Monday in connection with the brazen murder of a gang rival on a Queens subway platform the previous day.
839,The killing was the first recorded murder on the subway in just over six months.
840,Chief of Detectives Dermot Shea said the fatal shooting stemmed from a feud between rival Central American gangs in Queens.
841,"The victim, Abel Mosso, 20, had been identified by investigators as a member of the 18th Street gang, he said. The gunman is a known MS-13 gang member, Chief Shea said."
842,"Though Chief Shea did not name him, the man taken into custody was Ramiro Gutierrez, a law enforcement official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss an open case. Mr. Gutierrez and 11 others were charged in December by the Queens district attorney with conspiracy and attempted murder, as well as drug and weapons charges. He was freed on $2,500 bail awaiting trial."
843,[Read more about MS-13 and President Trump’s use of crimes committed by the gang to argue for tighter immigration laws.]
844,Mr. Gutierrez was being questioned by detectives on Monday evening. The district attorney had yet to file charges against him in connection with Mr. Mosso’s death.
845,"The shooting, which was caught on video by a bystander, occurred around 12:45 p.m. on Sunday. A fight broke out on a crowded 7 train bound for Manhattan and spilled out onto the platform at the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue station in Elmhurst."
846,"In the video footage, three men can be seen wrestling on the ground. One man gets to his feet and points what appears to be a small revolver at Mr. Mosso. Six shots ring out, as bystanders scream and run for cover."
847,"Mr. Mosso was shot several times in the face and died at the scene, the police said."
848,"Photographs of a man resembling Mr. Gutierrez, taken from security cameras near the subway station, were circulated by the police, and witnesses identified him to detectives. The gun was not found."
849,The police were still seeking a second man filmed by security cameras as he fled the subway station wearing a gray sweatshirt and covering his face with a scarf.
850,"The rivalry between MS-13 and 18th Street goes back decades to their origins in Los Angeles. Both gangs later established criminal operations in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, among other places. They view each other as mortal enemies."
851,[Read about the efforts of the United States to help El Salvador contain violence from gangs like MS-13.] 
852,"MS-13 has been active in New York City and the surrounding region for over a decade, and remains a persistent threat despite several rounds of indictments by local and federal authorities. In December, five accused MS-13 members lured a 23-year-old man, Ian Cruz, to a bird sanctuary in Far Rockaway, Queens, where he was shot to death."
853,"The 18th Street gang is a newer arrival to New York, but has begun to target its longtime rivals, the police said. In May, the Queens district attorney indicted seven men accused of being 18th Street members in the murder of an MS-13 rival."
854,To the Editor:

856,I was saddened and quite outraged to read about the young mother who died carrying her child in a stroller down the subway steps where I frequently travel.
857,"As a young mother 20 years ago, I would frequently be faced with trudging through the snow and having to carry my son and stroller down treacherous stairs. Like Christine Ann Denny, who is quoted in the article, just as I had about given up, someone would help, restoring my faith in humanity."
858,"Fast forward to my B/C train stop at 72nd and Central Park West recently being closed for six months for “extensive renovation.” Did they put in an elevator or escalator? No! Instead, they widened the platforms and put up pictures of clouds with the word “Imagine” on them."

862,The new fees were supposed to help fix New York City’s ailing subway by raising more than $1 million a day from those who could afford to take taxis and Ubers in Manhattan.
863,"But before the $2.50 fees on rides could even go into effect as planned on Jan. 1, they were sidelined by a lawsuit brought by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers."
864,"The opponents warn that the fee will add up for passengers, and will also deal a final blow to a taxi industry teetering on the brink. They say the surcharge will drive away customers when they are already losing business to Uber and other app-based services and struggling with enormous debt and bleak prospects."
865,Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year.
866,"“If they put the surcharge on, that’s it, we’ve lost our whole life investment,” said Gloria Guerra, 62, who with her husband, William, owns a taxi medallion, the aluminum plate required to drive a yellow taxi in New York that once sold for more than $1 million. “The business will be bankrupt. All the medallions will be bankrupt.”"
867,"On Thursday, the Guerras and other taxi owners and drivers took their fight against what they call a “suicide surcharge” to a state court hearing in Lower Manhattan, capping off months of protests. Their lawsuit contends that by imposing the new taxi fee, state and city officials “seek to drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”"
868,"Last month, a state court judge temporarily blocked the fee until both sides could present arguments. At Thursday’s hearing, a judge continued the suspension of the fee until the next hearing, scheduled for Jan. 31."
869,"The $2.50 taxi fee was passed by state lawmakers last year along with a $2.75 fee on other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts, and a 75-cent fee on shared pool rides. The fees are expected to raise more than $400 million annually, according to budget projections."
870,"Every day those fees go uncollected means lost revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways and buses. As a result, taxi drivers and owners have found themselves pitted against state officials, business leaders and transit advocates who see the new fees as crucial to the city’s transit system."
871,"“Transit riders, individual taxpayers and business are all contributing toward the cost of modernizing our transit system and it is only fair that the taxi industry and their customers do the same,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of influential business leaders that supports the fee."
872,The $2.50 taxi fee has also divided city officials and transportation advocates and complicated a renewed effort by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and transit advocates to push for a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all drivers a fee for entering the busiest neighborhoods at peak times. Mr. Cuomo and others have called the fees on taxis and for-hire vehicles the first phase of congestion pricing.
873,Mayor Bill de Blasio has also backed the new fees on for-hire vehicles.
874,"But Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has criticized the fee, saying that it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry. Ms. Joshi, who is stepping down in March, is named in the taxi lawsuit and declined last week to comment on the case."
875,"The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 — which is still lower than an Uber ride. The cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will rise to a minimum of $10.75, including the new $2.75 fee."
876,"Unlike the taxi industry, Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city."
877,"“In order to truly address these issues, it’s imperative that all vehicles, including personal and commercial, are included in this effort,” said Campbell Matthews, a spokeswoman for Lyft."
878,"Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders, said most taxi riders in Manhattan can afford to pay the fees. They have access to more public transit options than in the other boroughs, he said, and should pay more if they choose to use a taxi or car service."
879,"“There are a privileged number of people who take taxis and Ubers to get around the core of the city,” he said. “They can afford to support the transit system that makes New York what it is.”"
880,"But others said the new fees unfairly single out taxis and for-hire vehicles without a larger plan in place to charge all cars on congested streets — and by itself, will have little, if any, impact on reducing gridlock."
881,"Marco Conner, a deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said the taxi lawsuit — and the resulting court-ordered delay in fees — “shows the fallacy of taking baby steps to address a problem as tremendous as congestion and the M.T.A. crisis.”"
882,"In the lawsuit, taxi owners and drivers also claim that they should not be charged a so-called “congestion tax” because their numbers have been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services had been allowed until recently to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services."
883,"Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official, said taxis and ride-app cars have contributed to Manhattan gridlock. In a study last year, he found equal numbers of taxis and black cars in the central business district during the weekday — together accounting for two-thirds of all the vehicles there. Making matters worse, the for-hire vehicles often drove around with empty back seats."
884,"“You don’t just tax the last person in,” Mr. Schaller said. “You tax everyone causing the problem. It’s not like moving around Manhattan was la-dee-da before Uber.”"
885,"While Mr. Schaller agreed that the taxi fee would do little to reduce congestion, he said that it would raise badly needed money for the transit system. Chicago, Seattle and other cities and states have adopted similar per-ride fees to pay for public transportation and other services. “It’s a misnomer to call this a congestion fee,” he said. “It’s all about raising revenue.”"
886,"Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the new for-hire fee would force more taxi owners into bankruptcy, while taxi drivers would earn less and could have to cut back on food, medical care and other necessities."
887,"“I don’t know anybody who has savings left,” she said. “They will face foreclosures because payments simply won’t get made. I believe it will be this dire.”"
888,"Augustine Tang, 34, a yellow taxi driver who planned to attend Thursday’s hearing, said he makes about $240 after 10 hours of driving. That is about $100 less than he earned four years ago when he said he inherited a taxi medallion — and the remaining $500,000 loan on it — when his father died."
889,"“It’s a little annoying that people are saying the lawsuit is costing public transportation,” he said. “We’re trying to save our lives.”"

891,"New Yorkers who rely on the L train are bracing for months of upheaval when their line is partially closed for repairs. Subway leaders have warned of fewer trains on nights and weekends, crowded platforms and the need to divert riders to buses."
892,"In other parts of the city, subway riders have felt a sense of relief — and even schadenfreude — to be spared from the transit nightmare."
893,But their line could be next.
894,"With New York City’s subway in crisis, the only way to improve service is to shut down large swaths of the system to overhaul its ancient equipment. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, wants to greatly expand night and weekend closings in the coming years."
895,"“We need to start getting used to the idea that we’re entering a period of shared sacrifice,” said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group."
896,The disruption planned for the L line is in many ways a preview of what lies ahead for the rest of the system. In a city that takes pride in its round-the-clock subway — it’s one of the only systems in the world that never closes — the L train repairs will be painful: fewer trains starting at 8 p.m. on weeknights and a 20-minute wait between trains on the weekend.
897,Mr. Byford’s sweeping $40 billion plan to save the subway calls for installing modern subway signals on several lines at the same time. Some could be closed on most nights and weekends for two and a half years.
898,The service cuts will fall the hardest on New Yorkers who work nights and weekends like Amy Malale who lives in Queens and works on Sundays at a bookstore in Manhattan.
899,"“I question whether it is going to make the subways better,” Ms. Malale said as she rode an F train on a recent afternoon. “Two and a half years? That’s a scary thought.”"
900,"Transit workers have started to upgrade signals on the Queens Boulevard line, from Rockefeller Center in Manhattan to Kew Gardens in Queens. The F train in Brooklyn and the 8th Avenue line in Manhattan are next. Construction on the Lexington Avenue line, the nation’s busiest subway route, could start as early as next year."
901,"But Mr. Byford’s ambitious “Fast Forward” plan will not proceed without significant new funding from state leaders in Albany. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, is pressing for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the subway."
902,"“If Fast Forward is going to gain momentum or if it’s going to die a painful death, it’s going to happen at the hands of Albany legislators,” Mr. Sifuentes said."
903,"During station closings on nights and weekends, riders could have other options like extra buses, said Veronique Hakim, the managing director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Because the system is so large and interconnected, there are often alternate subway lines nearby, though that is not always the case in far-flung corners of the city beyond Manhattan."
904,"“What riders need is certainty and information,” Ms. Hakim said in an interview. “Being able to say this particular line is going to be closed from this hour to that hour. As long as you give people that information ahead of time, they can plan accordingly.”"
905,"But despite assurances from officials that the impact of the L train repairs will be minimal, transit advocates say the contingency plans are too meager."
906,The tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn had been set to close entirely for 15 months to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Officials planned to offer a “busway” on 14th Street across Lower Manhattan and high occupancy vehicle rules for the Williamsburg Bridge. Then Mr. Cuomo — upending years of preparation — intervened with a new repair plan that avoids a full closure and those alternatives were abandoned.
907,"When subway lines are closed in the years ahead, the routes should be replaced with dedicated bus lanes that prioritize transit riders over cars, said Joe Cutrufo, a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for bikers and pedestrians."
908,"“The subway doesn’t share the tracks with cars — neither should buses,” he said."
909,"While overhauling New York’s century-old subway will be disruptive, installing modern signals is the key to making the system reliable again. In London, another vast and aging system, the signals have been upgraded much faster. On one line with modern signals, trains regularly arrive every 100 seconds."
910,"In New York, only the L train and the No. 7 line have modern signals, known as communications based train control, or C.B.T.C. The installation was plagued by delays and took nearly two decades, but the L train is now the most reliable with a 90 percent on-time rate. The No. 7 line can run 29 trains per hour during rush hour, up from 27 trains before new signals were installed. Mr. Cuomo has also urged Mr. Byford to use a new technology called ultra-wideband radio that could allow the signal work to be done faster."
911,"On the F line, where the signals are currently being upgraded, some riders understand the need to shut down parts of the route. Patrick Smith said he watched an interview with Mr. Byford on “60 Minutes” last year that portrayed him as the subway’s cheerful savior. He supports Mr. Byford’s plan to fix the subway."
912,"“I think the crux of the situation is, how do you modernize a 110-year-old system without grossly impacting everyday life?” said Mr. Smith, who works in information technology and lives in Brooklyn."
913,"If the subway was closed on nights and weekends, Mr. Smith said he would be fine with taking a backup shuttle bus. “Short-term sacrifice usually pays off,” he said."
914,"Andrew Fox, who lives in Queens and works in construction on the weekend, said the subway often ran local during repair work which made his commute a “nightmare,” turning a 30-minute trip into an hourlong ride."
915,"“It’s only massively inconvenient,” he said. “From far out in Queens to Manhattan, a local train is just the worst.”"
916,"Mr. Sifuentes, the transit advocate, said he welcomed the disruption, as long as the authority provides “a really good bus route to compensate.”"
917,"“Shut my line down,” he said, “Give me C.B.T.C. I want that as soon as possible.”"
918,"Regularly closing the subway on nights and weekends would be a dramatic change for New York, where many people work outside the traditional 9-to-5 schedule. Those who work at places like medical centers and restaurants commute at all hours, even between midnight and 5 a.m., said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University."
919,"“Those are the key hours when office towers are cleaned,” he said, “when hipsters are out at comedy clubs and music venues and, of course, when the vast kitchens are baking bagels, boiling eggs and cutting up fruit.”"
920,"Christine Sherlock, a teacher who lives in Queens and teaches college classes on nights and weekends, said if she had to take a bus, instead of the subway, that could more than double her commute to two hours. Despite the hassle, she wants the subway to be upgraded."
921,"“It would be worth it,” she said, “in the long run.”"
922,"“Once in a while, you’d meet a great human being who would help you get down the stairs.”"
923,"CHRISTINE ANN DENNY, a mother of two who said the stress of carrying a child on the subway — in which only a quarter of stations have elevators — was one reason she moved out of New York."
924,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
925,A man and woman walked out of a subway car at the 51st Street station in Manhattan and darted into the next one on the same train. A plainclothes police officer noticed.
926,"It was rush hour on a Tuesday evening in September on the busy No. 6 line. The officer watched as the woman dipped her hand into a commuter’s purse while her partner stood in front of her, shielding her from view, according to the officer’s affidavit. The woman lifted out a wallet, and the officer and his partners closed in."
927,"She threw the wallet to the ground, and the commuter quickly identified it as hers. The woman, Jenny Gomez Velandia, 27, and her accomplice, John Diaz-Albarracin, 31, were arrested, according to a criminal complaint. What seemed like a routine pickpocketing had been thwarted."
928,"But the suspects were not routine. Unlike most pickpockets, they had no criminal history in New York City. They were not locals. They were from Colombia and had come to New York for the purpose of stealing wallets on subways, one of several international pickpocket rings to descend on the transit system in 2018, the police said."
929,"“They come, they do what they can do, then they move,” said Chief Edward Delatorre, who leads the Police Department’s transit bureau. The woman and man arrested in September were tied to nine other thefts in the subway, the police said."
930,"Little is known about these international pickpocket crews outside of the narrow scope of their crimes, the police said. They tend to avoid detection longer than their local counterparts because they are new faces, and their lack of criminal histories in the city is to their advantage when they are caught. They move from city to city, trying to stay ahead of investigators."
931,"A three-man ring from Chile worked the No. 7 train in Queens during the United States Open last summer, when the platforms were extremely crowded, the police said. The three were finally caught in Manhattan. On Aug. 28, a straphanger on an uptown No. 4 train “felt himself being jostled” by a man beside him wearing a black bag. He realized his wallet was gone, and he told officers at the 59th Street station, who arrested the man with the bag, Victor Diaz Jimenez, 33, according to a criminal complaint. He was carrying, among other things, three MetroCards and four phones."
932,"“I’m used to this,” Mr. Jimenez later told the police, according to court documents. “Everywhere I go, every country kicks me out.”"
933,"He described his methods. “This is how I make my living,” he told a detective. “I open the purses, put my hands in and take the wallets out. I pick people who are distracted.” He recalled lifting a wallet from “a tourist on the green line.” He took stolen credit cards to Target to buy watches he sold on the street, he said, and if the card had already been reported stolen, he threw it away."
934,"“I’ve only been here for two weeks,” he said."
935,"The police also arrested two teenagers who worked with Mr. Jimenez, Michael Camilo Joya Pinzto and Jhon Quintero Santos, despite Mr. Jimenez’s claims that he did not involve them in his work."
936,"That group, like the Colombians, was tied to other crimes: nine previous grand larcenies in Queens and Manhattan — and in Mr. Jimenez’s case, elsewhere in the country. The police discovered an open arrest warrant for Mr. Jimenez from Kansas City, Kan., where he was wanted for charges of larceny and identity theft, according to prosecutors there. Mr. Jimenez remains on Rikers Island, facing a possible extradition to Kansas, and he declined a request for an interview."
937,"The 18 thefts linked to these two teams, along with the perennially robust activity of local thieves in the subway system, contributed to a rise in grand larcenies in transit in 2018 compared with previous years. In Manhattan alone, transit larcenies were up 15 percent in 2018, with 754 reported cases; in Brooklyn, there was a 4 percent increase, to 474 cases."
938,"“They feed off our ridership,” Chief Delatorre said. “It’s always around.”"
939,"The international pickpockets blend in with the “Nifty Fifty,” police parlance for local repeat offenders, who appear to be too busy to care about foreigners encroaching on their hunting grounds."
940,Two New Yorkers were arrested 11 times each last year for lifting wallets from commuters in the subway; they had 39 previous arrests between them. Another arrested eight times had 16 previous arrests.
941,"The “Fifty” — more a nickname than an exact number — are well known to plainclothes officers who keep track of their patterns. “We look at where they’re hitting, when they’re hitting, what line,” said Yeuris Mejia, a detective with more than 10 years in transit."
942,"The surveillance and countersurveillance between the police and the pickpockets never stops. Officers loiter at busy platforms, where most picks occur, in the jostle of boarding and exiting a train. The pickpockets are watching, too. One was recently seen outside a transit police building near Canal Street."
943,"“This guy was casing our station,” Detective Mejia said."
944,"Proficient pickpockets dress to blend in with the people they want to steal from. “Some guy with earbuds in bumps into you — that’s Wall Street,” Sgt. Bryan Giordano said. “That’s you bumping into you.”"
945,"Perhaps there is another well-dressed individual nearby, watching the pickpocket. “We play their game,” Detective Mejia said. “I see pickpockets who wear a suit, I wear a suit.”"
946,"International visitors who pick pockets thwart this strategy. “When they come here, no one knows them,” Chief Delatorre said. “They get a bit of a stretch there.”"
947,"But sooner or later, they attract notice, as their tactics are universal. “Behavior’s behavior,” Sergeant Giordano said."
948,"When pickpockets are arrested, however, a second advantage comes into play. Their lack of a criminal history in New York leads to light sentences. Mr. Jimenez, after pleading guilty to grand larceny, was sentenced to 30 days in jail, prosecutors said. Mr. Pinzto, 18, was sentenced to three days of community service; Mr. Santos is 17, and thus his case was sealed. The two from Colombia received 70 hours."
949,The youth of Mr. Jimenez’s confederates stood out to officers more used to watching for veterans of the age-old crime.
950,"“We have these real young groups doing picks,” Detective Mejia said. “One guy told me he learned it from an older guy. He went off with him, and he taught him how to do it.”"
951,"Jaime Permuth never forgot the day 20 years ago when he met Olmedo Renteria on the subway. How could he? With his tuxedo, red shirt and courtly manner, Mr. Renteria cut quite a figure among the weary commuters. But after that first encounter, he disappeared, which is not unusual."
952,"Mr. Renteria is a magician. Not just any prestidigitator, but Olmedini El Mago, who rose from poverty to fame in his native Ecuador before seeking to make his mark in New York City 30 years ago. The routine Mr. Permuth saw in 1998 was indelible: Olmedini whistled Beethoven’s Fifth as he turned drab rags into colorful streamers, made a plump rabbit appear from a seemingly empty box, and tossed a cage into the air and made it vanish."
953,"Mr. Permuth, a Guatemalan photographer in New York, was smitten. “I clicked with him like I was back home,” Mr. Permuth recalled. Last year, he set out to find the magician, whom he located through social media. “Is this Olmedini?” he asked when they met face to face. “He was quiet and then said, ‘At your service.’ It was such an old-fashioned voice coming from another place and time.”"
954,"After a stroke had rendered him blind 10 years ago, Olmedini started working the trains with an assistant. To other Ecuadoreans who encounter him, he is a welcome link to their childhood, when the magician appeared on television shows and judged beauty pageants. “He was a fabulous magician back home,” Mr. Permuth said. “He opened for Menudo once. He was a celebrity.”"
955,"He still is, just on a smaller, moving stage."
956,"“He is such a romantic, old-fashioned figure,” Mr. Permuth said. “When I look at him, I think of Don Quixote. Even though he is 78 years old, he still believes he can make it in New York City. He gets up each morning and fights his windmill.”"
957,“You don’t just tax the last person in. You tax everyone causing the problem. It’s not like moving around Manhattan was la-dee-da before Uber.”

959,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] 
960,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has faced its greatest challenge in a generation as officials have struggled to modernize New York City’s failing subway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has responded by promising bold solutions to fix the troubled agency and regain the trust of angry riders.
961,"But here are the changes Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers unveiled this week as part of the new state budget: A reorganization plan due in June, a “forensic audit” of train cars and signals, a group of outside experts who will review major projects and a “debarment process” that would ban contractors who do not finish projects on time."
962,"And even though state leaders have vowed more transparency, the authority’s new chairman — among the most powerful positions in New York government — was confirmed by the State Senate around 2 a.m. on Monday when most New Yorkers were asleep."
963,"Transit advocates have praised Mr. Cuomo for persuading state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, which will raise billions of dollars for the subway by establishing tolls to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan. But they were less enthusiastic about his changes at the transit agency, which appear to be more of a bureaucratic reshuffling than a radical transformation."
964,"Many New Yorkers view the authority, the nation’s largest transit agency, which oversees more than 70,000 employees, as inept — if not corrupt. The authority’s construction projects are routinely late and over budget — as high as seven times as costly as elsewhere in the world."
965,"The authority’s new chairman, Patrick J. Foye, was approved by the State Senate in the dead of night after hastily called hearings on Sunday, leaving virtually no chance for any significant public input."
966,"“This is just a wildly bad start at real M.T.A. reform,” said Benjamin Kabak, a transit advocate who runs the Second Ave. Sagas website."
967,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, defended the timing, saying that Mr. Foye’s appointment was part of the budget deal, which included both congestion pricing and changes at the transportation authority."
968,"“I said unless we have a management reform plan, I’m not going to approve more money,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday."
969,"His budget director, Robert Mujica, said in an interview that new rules would make the authority’s board more accountable to the public and the M.T.A. leadership team understood the urgency of overhauling how it does business."
970,"“You have a management team now that recognizes what the failures are and recognizes that there has to be a significant cultural change,” Mr. Mujica said."
971,"But Richard Ravitch, a former M.T.A. chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s when it was plagued by delays and crime, said he was concerned about new rules allowing M.T.A. board members to serve only while the person who appointed them was in office. The board’s members need to be more independent to make tough decisions for the system, he said, instead of acting like political appointees."
972,"“This certainly gives the governor more power,” Mr. Ravitch said of the reforms."
973,"John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a watchdog group, said the changes did not address the agency’s politicization under Mr. Cuomo, who has been accused of micromanaging the system. Mr. Cuomo has at times prioritized aesthetics, like the appearance of subway stations, over the nuts and bolts of maintenance."
974,"“The thing at the top of everyone’s list is to hire good transit managers and let them do their jobs,” Mr. Kaehny said. “It may seem obvious, but that’s one of the crucial problems.”"
975,"Maria Doulis, a vice president at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said the changes did not address the costs of an upcoming union contract for subway workers or improving work rules to reduce costs. The union, Transport Workers Union Local 100, is a close ally of Mr. Cuomo."
976,"“Increasing the productivity of the work force to be able to perform the work more cost effectively is essential to the success of the M.T.A.,” she said. “I don’t see that part here.”"
977,"The legislation did expand the use of “design build,” a construction approach favored by Mr. Cuomo that bundles together the design and construction phases of a project instead of carrying them out separately."
978,"Mayor Bill de Blasio, a frequent adversary of Mr. Cuomo, said on Monday that he supported the M.T.A. reforms, even though some say the congestion pricing plan gave away control of city streets to the state."
979,"“The final plan on the M.T.A. is one I fully supported,” Mr. de Blasio said in a television interview. “We got the important changes and reforms we wanted to see in the name of fairness.”"
980,"The authority, which oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads, had gone nearly five months without a permanent leader. Its previous chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, stepped down in November amid questions over his potential conflicts of interests and outside jobs."
981,"Mr. Foye is a respected transit executive, though not exactly a revolutionary choice: He had been a top leader at the agency for the last year and a half. He is taking over at a critical time. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has an ambitious plan to fix the subway by upgrading its signals."
982,"The agency’s bridges and tunnel division will oversee the rollout of the Manhattan toll plan in 2021, making New York the first city in the country to impose congestion pricing."
983,"Mr. Foye told reporters on Monday that the agency had to do better and “everything is on the table” in terms of reforms, like merging procurement and legal departments at different parts of the agency. “The harsh truth is we’ve lost credibility with our customers and with our funders both in Albany and City Hall,” he said at a news conference to discuss the congestion pricing deal."
984,"At a hearing called by the Senate on Sunday afternoon that was streamed online, Mr. Foye pledged to serve as the authority’s full-time chairman and chief executive, without taking on outside jobs. Asked why the system had not improved since he joined the authority, Mr. Foye said the subway was getting better and now he would have full responsibility as chairman."
985,"“The buck stops at my desk,” Mr. Foye said."
986,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
987,"ALBANY — After years of hesitation, New York is poised to become the first city in the United States to introduce congestion pricing, which would put new electronic tolls in place for drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan."
988,"Though state leaders have not ironed out details, they had reached consensus on Monday that the plan was necessary to help pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s beleaguered subway system."
989,"The proceeds from congestion pricing are expected to enable the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the city’s public transit network, to raise billions of dollars in bonds to modernize the antiquated subway. Such a windfall overwhelmed lingering concerns about various aspects of the plan, including the cost to commuters in the boroughs and suburbs outside Manhattan who rely on cars."
990,"Other American cities are exploring variations of congestion pricing, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The idea dates back decades, with supporters often pointing to an array of health, safety and environmental benefits, including reducing air pollution and pedestrian injuries, and alleviating the stranglehold on gridlocked city streets."
991,"Those arguments have been bolstered by the success of plans in places like London, Stockholm and Singapore, where congestion pricing helped unclog streets. Still, such plans have also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that especially hurts poor people who do not have access to public transit."
992,"In New York, for example, a 2008 proposal from Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, died in the face of legislative apathy. But with the state currently facing shortfalls in income tax revenue and a subway crisis looming, Albany’s lawmakers on Monday finally agreed that it was an idea whose time had come."
993,"“Safe to say that the Assembly is ready to go forward on congestion pricing,” Carl E. Heastie, the chamber’s speaker, said on Monday; the Democratic-controlled Assembly had been the holdout in endorsing the plan. “We’re at the point where the Assembly members understand the need to fund the M.T.A.”"
994,"The State Senate, which is also controlled by Democrats, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, have already expressed support for congestion pricing, with the governor suggesting that without it, subway and bus fares could rise by 30 percent."
995,"Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has pushed for it as a funding mechanism for the subway system; in late February, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Cuomo, also warmed to the idea, saying there was no way to address the problems in the subway “without congestion pricing.”"
996,"Mr. Heastie and other legislative officials stressed that specifics about the plan, including the exact price for entering Manhattan’s main business district, were still being considered, though he seemed confident that a deal could be brokered, likely before the state’s budget deadline on April 1."
997,"Assembly members and Mr. Heastie have been hunkered behind closed doors in recent days, discussing a broad array of exemptions that would make congestion pricing more palatable, according to several members and aides. These include exemptions from the congestion fees for drivers who are poor, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments, among other things."
998,"Calls for a congestion pricing plan had also increased. On Monday, prominent congestion pricing supporters, including Patrick Foye, the M.T.A. president, and Polly Trottenberg, the New York City transportation commissioner, came to Albany to meet with legislative leaders."
999,"Kathryn S. Wylde, the head of the influential Partnership for New York City, a business group, was also pushing for such a plan, and praised Mr. Heastie shortly after he announced the deal for his “real skill” in “pulling together his diverse membership.”"
1000,"In a sign of widening support this year, two separate grass-roots campaigns had emerged, as advocates lobbied legislators to gain their support, flooded local subway stops and urged frustrated subway riders to call and text their legislators."
1001,"“Transit riders were up in arms about the state of our subway system and it seems that our representatives in Albany really listened,” said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, which helped organize the #FixtheSubway coalition. “I think the visceral anger of subway riders stuck on yet another unreliable train played a pivotal role in legislators feeling the urgency of the problem.”"
1002,"One congestion pricing plan backed by the governor and mayor is projected to raise about $1 billion annually from fees for driving into a congestion zone spanning Manhattan’s central business district, from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would, in turn, be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for M.T.A. capital projects through 2024."
1003,Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge on Manhattan’s West Side would receive a credit toward the fees. Those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the F.D.R. Drive to go north past the congestion zone would be exempted from the fees.
1004,"The potential passage of congestion pricing would be a win for Mr. Cuomo, who was heavily criticized for his handling of the subways last year during his successful bid for re-election. He has pushed this year to overhaul the M.T.A., saying he will not sign a budget without reforms to the authority, and touting congestion pricing as a valuable source of funding for badly needed repairs."
1005,"“Congestion pricing is the greatest opportunity we have had,” Mr. Cuomo said last week, in an interview on WNYC. “We have talked about it for 20 years. It is the smartest idea I think for urban development.”"
1006,Suburban lawmakers have raised objections about the financial impact on those driving into the city and also have sought to ensure that some of the money from congestion pricing go to commuter railroads. But they seemed ready to make a deal.
1007,"“Long Island senators have stated clearly that a fair and equitable congestion pricing plan must include a dedicated revenue stream for infrastructure upgrades to the beleaguered L.I.R.R.,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who represents Nassau County. “I am optimistic that an agreement can be reached that benefits both the region and the suburban commuter.”"
1008,"With the budget deadline still a week away, and Albany known for its fractious and fragile deal making, there could still be snags before such a plan becomes law."
1009,"Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat and leading critic of congestion pricing, said on Monday that he remained opposed to it unless his request for an exemption for all city residents was included in the plan. He represents parts of Queens where he said many residents have to drive because they do not have ready or affordable access to public transit. “I know there are a lot of exemptions on the table,” he said. “They could exempt residents of the five boroughs.”"
1010,"Mr. Heastie said that such details were still being discussed, though he seemed reluctant to allow too many exemptions."
1011,"“The more you carve out, the less you have in revenue,” Mr. Heastie said."
1012,"The speaker said several issues still remained to be addressed, including help for so-called “transit deserts,” tolling on bridges and possible discounts for commuter rail users. Still, he seemed confident that such tolling would soon be the norm in Lower Manhattan."
1013,"“I think we’re in a very good place,” he said."
1014,"At long last, New York is getting what it deserves: broad agreement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to address the subway crisis that has frustrated millions of people and hobbled the economy of the largest city in the United States."
1015,"The two men, both Democrats, have wasted years in a damaging rivalry that has stymied progress on crucial infrastructure, like mass transit and housing. On Tuesday, they overcame their animus and released a plan to raise revenue for long overdue subway repairs and to reform the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, buses and the region’s commuter rails."
1016,"At the heart of the proposal is a version of congestion pricing, which Mr. de Blasio finally backed outright for the first time — reason enough to cheer. Also included in the proposal are revenue from planned sales taxes on marijuana — which the Legislature is expected to legalize soon in the state — and money from an internet sales tax. The plan calls for loosely limiting fare increases to inflation of no more than 2 percent a year."
1017,"State and city officials said the $1.4 billion a year raised by the plan could be used to back bonds of $20 billion to $22 billion over five years, roughly the estimate of many advocates of congestion pricing as well. According to a news release from the governor and mayor, those new funds would be dedicated to the M.T.A.’s capital needs, “with priority given to the subway system.” Fare increases would go toward running the subways and buses. "
1018,"Now, state legislators will have to approve the plan, but votes for congestion pricing could be hard to come by. It will be up to the governor, as well as the State Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins,  and the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, to persuade their colleagues of its merits. This latest plan still leaves several details to be determined, but concessions have already been made — for example, it doesn’t include tolls on East River bridges, as past versions have, instead digitally collecting a fee only on vehicles that enter the busiest part of Manhattan, below 61st Street. The mayor can use his bully pulpit to push for the plan."
1019,"As the legislation takes shape in the coming weeks, there are several other things to look out for: "
1020," While avoiding tolls on the East River bridges may make the plan more appealing to state lawmakers and others, it also leaves money on the table that the transit system needs."
1021,"The subways serve the most riders and are in the gravest state of disrepair. They need the most help. Because of that, the legislation ought to include a guarantee that an overwhelming majority of money generated by this plan will be permanently allocated for the subway system. The rest of the money, say 20 percent, could be used to upgrade commuter rails and improve service in so-called transit deserts in the boroughs outside Manhattan."
1022,"The proposal calls for the consolidation of the six entities within the M.T.A., a smart move that could cut costs and make the authority more efficient. Yet finding the deepest savings may require the state to renegotiate contracts with transit unions to change work rules. Ultimately, it may also mean consolidating the workforces of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. And as the state changes the way contracts for major projects are negotiated — a needed fix — there should be far more transparency about bidding and procurement processes. More transparency is also needed around where the agency’s dollars actually go, and how they benefit subway riders compared with commuter rail passengers. An independent audit called for under the proposal is a good place to begin, but the public should be able to easily review these figures in the long-term as well."
1023,"State lawmakers may want to consider adding other sources of revenue. Reinstating the 0.45 percent commuter tax on the incomes of people who live in the New York suburbs would be one good idea. A former M.T.A. chairman has said the agency contributes seven times more to each Long Island Rail Road ride, and four times more to each Metro-North Railroad ride, than to each subway ride. Another idea worth considering is to tax second homes in New York City worth $5 million or more, known as the pied-à-terre tax."
1024,"Does the M.T.A. need to create a six-member oversight board for capital construction and congestion pricing, as the proposal suggests? It’s an idea that deserves careful consideration, especially since the purpose of the restructuring is to create clear accountability for the agency, not add more bureaucracy."
1025,"So there is work to do. But this latest proposal from the governor and the mayor is also the first sign that New York’s elected officials may indeed be capable of rising to meet the state’s most pressing challenges. Let’s hope the Legislature is, too. "

1029,"New York City’s subway riders are used to a spectrum of smells, most of them unpleasant."
1030,"But the mysterious fumes that have permeated the L train this week and made some subway riders and transit workers feel ill, go beyond the usual odors a New Yorker endures."
1031,"On Tuesday, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suspended service for two and a half hours to investigate harsh fuel smells at the Graham Avenue stop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. On Thursday, subway riders and transit workers said the odor, a dizzying chemical stench that forced some to breathe through tissues over their faces, continued to linger."
1032,"Amie Roe, 34, who is eight months pregnant, said the smell hit her especially hard on Tuesday. “It was really intense,” she said, swaying side-to-side to pantomime her dizziness."
1033,"“I’m happy it’s no longer going to be shut down,” she said about the L train, “but I’m upset that this happened.”"
1034,"The now multiple-day episode is just the latest in a series of troubles for the city’s subway system, coming on the heels of the aborted L train shutdown and near constant complaints from the public of poor service."
1035,"[As the subway struggles, New York’s governor warned of a possible 30 percent fare hike.]"
1036,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said on Thursday that the stench was caused by nonflammable heating oil from a source outside the subway system
1037,"While the transit authority and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation had not yet publicly identified the source of the leak, officials and M.T.A. employees said Thursday that one potential source they were exploring was an abandoned gas station above the tracks between the Graham Avenue and Grand Street stations."
1038,"On Thursday, the station, near the intersection of Bushwick and Metropolitan avenues in East Williamsburg, was surrounded by a wooden fence. The property was littered with debris, and the building inside was covered with graffiti."
1039,"On Wednesday, the transit authority’s chief safety officer, Pat Warren, said the agency had removed “almost all” of the oil from the tracks."
1040,Mr. Warren also said there was no health or safety threat to riders and that the transit agency had worked with experts at the Fire Department and the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation to determine that there was no risk to the public.
1041,"“The air on the L train and in the stations is 100 percent safe,” he said."
1042,"Not every subway rider was convinced. Jerry Holste, 69, said that when he got on the subway on Tuesday, he became terrified when the fumes filled the train car."
1043,"“I don’t like being exposed to that,” he said. “I don’t trust it. They need to clean it up.”"
1044,"Sandhya Jain-Patel, 45, an art specialist, said the situation had made her furious."
1045,"“Yesterday I got down here and my eyes started watering,” she said. “I said, ‘If my eyes are watering it’s not safe for children.’”"
1046,She and other nearby parents from her children’s school hired a Lyft to take them to their children’s school in Manhattan.
1047,"“So that’s money out of my pocket in addition to the money I pay for a monthly MetroCard,” she said."
1048,Mr. Warren told reporters on Wednesday that officials were not sure why the smell was so strong. He could not estimate when the fumes would dissipate and said he was surprised that they had lingered this long.
1049,"In the meantime, the authority has been continuously monitoring air quality in stations as complaints about the smells have continued, Mr. Warren said."
1050,"To help remove the scent, the agency placed heavy-duty fans on subway grates near the Graham Avenue station, the authority said. Workers were also using absorbent pads and blankets to soak up the oil."
1051,"Despite the authority’s efforts, station agents and subway conductors have reported feeling nauseous and suffering headaches over the past several days."
1052,"Dozens of transit workers have complained about the smell, and at least four have gone to the hospital, according to the New York City’s transit workers’ union."
1053,"“The L-train situation is completely unacceptable,” Tony Utano, the president of a local union chapter, said in a statement. “The air still stinks and we are concerned about long-term exposure and the health of our members working 8-hour shifts along the line.”"
1054,"He said the union had pulled workers from several locations and would ""take further action” if the smell did not improve over the weekend."
1055,"On Thursday morning, the fumes continued to penetrate subway cars traveling between the Grand Street and Graham Avenue stations, upsetting riders’ stomachs and irritating their throats."
1056,"The scent appeared to have migrated as well. At the Lorimer Street stop, one stop west of Graham Avenue, the smell was so powerful that groups of riders were bunched underneath a subway grate in order to inhale fresh air. The odor was also noticeable at the Bedford Avenue station, the westernmost Brooklyn stop on the L train."
1057,The New York City subway system has been plagued by high-profile issues recently. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has criticized the transit agency several times in recent weeks. The system’s ridership has been in decline amid competition from ride-hailing services as well as delays caused by deteriorating infrastructure.
1058,"As a result, the transit authority has been facing a growing budget hole. But last month, after transit leaders spent months urging the need for a fare increase to fix the issue, the M.T.A.’s board delayed a vote on the fare hike."
1059,"The L train has been especially beleaguered. After the transit agency spent years preparing to shut down the subway line in order to make repairs to a tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo halted the plan and introduced an alternative proposal that he said would be less disruptive."
1060,"Though the transit authority has said it would follow the governor’s plan, it remains unclear when the repairs would begin and exactly how service would be affected."
1061,"Olivia Gallinaro, a regular L train rider, said she learned to accept the inconvenience that has become associated with that particular subway line. She took the smelly disruption in stride."
1062,"“I was annoyed but I was like, what can we do? When can we catch a break?” Ms. Gallinaro said."
1063,"She wasn’t alone. Another rider at the Graham Avenue stop on Thursday, Sarah Feldman, said that had she not been told about the scent she would not have deemed it out of the ordinary."
1064,"“There are so many smells in this city,” she said. “If bad smells bother you, it’s not the place for you.”"
1065,"A woman attacked seven people with a substance like pepper spray in four places in Harlem and the Upper West Side on Friday, including two subway stations, in a series of attacks that were being investigated as possible hate crimes, the police said."
1066,"Detective George Tsourovakas, a police spokesman, said the woman was black and the seven victims were white. He declined to elaborate on the hate crime investigation."
1067,"As of Friday night, the police were still searching for the woman, who had not been identified or arrested."
1068,"The attacks occurred between 11:50 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday, Detective Tsourovakas said."
1069,"He said the first victim, a man, was on the southbound platform at the 125th and Lenox subway station. The woman walked up to him and sprayed him in the face without either of them exchanging words, he said."
1070,The detective said the woman then left the station and pepper-sprayed a 47-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman as they were walking near 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. She then sprayed another man and a 38-year-old woman near 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
1071,"A 23-year-old woman reported being sprayed near 125th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, Detective Tsourovakas said. A 30-year-old woman then reported being sprayed on the platform at the 96th and Broadway subway station, he said."
1072,"None of the victims had serious injuries, he said. The woman who was attacked at the 96th and Broadway station was taken to a hospital."

1074,"At Hudson Yards, the expansive real estate development that is about to open in Manhattan, seven floors of retail are occupied by Fendi, Dior, Neiman Marcus and other high-end shops. Major corporations, including WarnerMedia and L’Oreal USA, will have their headquarters there. In the luxury residential buildings, one-bedroom apartments will rent for at least $5,200 a month — or you can buy a two-floor penthouse condo for $32 million."
1075,All thanks to the help of taxpayers.
1076,"New York was riveted for weeks by a debate over whether Amazon should receive $3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives in return for setting up a headquarters in Queens and creating 25,000 jobs. But with far less public attention, the city government has for more than a decade been funneling even more aid to Hudson Yards, a 28-acre complex of gleaming office buildings and luxury residential towers that is one of the nation’s biggest real estate projects in recent years."
1077,"In all, the tax breaks and other government assistance for Hudson Yards have reached nearly $6 billion, according to public records and  a recent analysis by the New School."
1078,"The city spent about $2.4 billion to extend the No. 7 subway line to Hudson Yards and set aside $1.2 billion for about four acres of parks and open spaces called Hudson Park and Boulevard. The City Council stepped up to pay $359 million in interest payments on bonds when revenue from the development, which was supposed to cover the tab, fell short of projections."
1079,"As a result, Hudson Yards is perhaps an even more resonant symbol of the role of government in giving tax breaks and other incentives to spur development. In this case, two of the world’s largest real estate developers, Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which together built Hudson Yards, have significantly benefited."
1080,"Supporters of the Hudson Yards project say the government incentives will pay vast dividends by creating an entirely new business district, generating thousands of new jobs and retaining many thousands more. They point out that the No. 7 subway extension, the parks and other improvements that the city financed will help make the Far West Side an overall better neighborhood."
1081,"But the project’s detractors voice the kind of criticism that reverberated during the Amazon deal: Wealthy businesses, no matter their promises of jobs, should pay their own way and not demand government incentives to undertake projects. (Stung by the backlash over the incentives that it would receive, Amazon last month abandoned its plans for its campus in Long Island City.)"
1082,"The opponents are focused in particular on a lengthy and lucrative property tax break for developers within the broader Hudson Yards area. So far, the cost of that tax break has surpassed $1 billion, according to the recent analysis by Bridget Fisher and Flávia Leite at the New School."
1083,"Future properties in Hudson Yards can also take advantage of the tax break, which can be as much as a 40 percent discount and last about 20 years. The opponents said such incentives inevitably end up widening income inequality in a city like New York."
1084,"“We are still giving tax breaks to a development that enriches billionaire developers and high-rise commercial and residential development that is not benefiting ordinary people in New York,” said James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School."
1085,There are other incentives as well.
1086,"BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, which ended 2018 with $5.98 trillion under management, can obtain $25 million in state tax credits if it adds 700 jobs at Hudson Yards. L’Oreal USA is in line for $5.5 million for the same discretionary tax credit, while WarnerMedia can get $14 million."
1087,"Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, a supporter of the Hudson Yards project, is now expressing some misgivings about the property tax breaks. Mr. de Blasio had been a backer of the Amazon deal, but since the company pulled out, he has abruptly shifted tone, just as he has been seeking to solidify his credentials with progressives."
1088,"Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that the subway and park spending had broad benefits, but added: “We’ve moved away from providing discretionary incentives like the prior administration. I believe state and local economic development programs need to be re-evaluated and updated.”"
1089,"Hudson Yards sprouted during a moment of post-Sept. 11 pride and economic uncertainty, with the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg, vowing to reclaim a neighborhood that included a stubby collection of brick warehouses, factories and tenements built when the Hudson River docks were busy. In the middle was an unsightly rail yard."
1090,"On Friday, when Hudson Yards officially opens, a city within a city will rise as the centerpiece of an area bounded by Eighth and 12th Avenues from 30th to 42nd Streets. The main site, developed by Related Companies and Oxford Properties, was built over the rail yard, and it is by some estimates the largest real estate project in New York since Rockefeller Center in the 1930s."
1091,"The $25 billion neighborhood has 13 buildings, including a school and parks, that will bring more than 55,000 employees to new offices there. There will also be a major dining complex with restaurants run by celebrity chefs like Thomas Keller and David Chang."
1092,"“Without a doubt, we now have millions of square feet of office space and housing we did not have,” said Alexander Garvin, a former commissioner on the New York City Planning Commission, who became involved with Hudson Yards in the mid-1990s. “We have that many more jobs, that many more places for people to live, and that much more property taxes that come into the city.”"
1093,"(The Related Companies chairman, Stephen M. Ross, a 78-year-old billionaire who is one of the world’s richest people, is moving into a penthouse in the 72-story tower, which is known as 35 Hudson Yards.)"
1094,"L. Jay Cross, president of Related Hudson Yards, which oversees the development of the site, said in an interview that the redevelopment would not have gotten off the ground without the subway extension and tax breaks that allowed for new office space to be offered at rates comparable to Midtown’s."
1095,Mr. Cross said it was vital that the city throw its support behind major development projects to ensure that it remained attractive to businesses in an increasingly globalized economy.
1096,"“With all those old buildings we have in aging Midtown, we have to find a way to build modern buildings to compete with London, Singapore and Tokyo,” he said."
1097,"Mr. Cross said that as Hudson Yards grows, the city would take in more in property taxes that it could use to pay off the bonds that financed the subway extension."
1098,"The groundwork for Hudson Yards was set in motion in the 1980s. When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority created a yard for commuter trains on the West Side, its chairman at the time, Richard Ravitch, knew the site could be valuable one day. He had the tracks spaced far enough apart that columns could be installed to support a deck."
1099,"A decade later, the property became the centerpiece for an ambitious plan by a young investor named Daniel L. Doctoroff to attract the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York. The rail yard could be covered and support an Olympics stadium, which could also be the new home for the New York Jets."
1100,"While the city debated the merits of hosting the Olympics and the economic impact of a stadium, Mr. Doctoroff, who became a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, and other city planners moved ahead with the broader redevelopment of the West Side."
1101,"The area was rezoned, making room for towering buildings, and Mr. Bloomberg committed to the city to expanding the subway when the M.T.A. said it would not."
1102,"“There wasn’t any genuine opposition to Hudson Yards at all,” said Peter J. Kiernan, a lawyer who helped write a 2007 study on the city’s finance plan for the subway extension."
1103,"By the time New York lost the Olympics bid to London in 2005, the Far West Side was well along into becoming Hudson Yards. New apartment buildings were going up, and subway construction was about to start. In 2008, Mr. Ross swooped in to pay $1 billion to the M.T.A. to develop a project over the rail yards, salvaging a deal after the first-place bidder backed out."
1104,"Hudson Yards would not exist in its current form without significant government assistance, especially the expansion of the 7 line, said Mr. Ravitch, who was initially skeptical of the city’s plan to pay for the subway expansion."
1105,"“The M.T.A. didn’t have the money, and it wasn’t a priority,” Mr. Ravitch said last week. “Thank God it turned out to be a great success. It was worth what the city did for it.”"
1106,"Still, the fallout from the Amazon deal may be having an impact on how the city approaches megaprojects in the future."
1107,"Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn, a Democrat who is a founder of the Council’s Progressive Caucus, said it was smart to expand the No. 7 subway and create parks on the West Side."
1108,"But tax breaks for specific companies are a different story, said Mr. Lander, who was an opponent of the Amazon deal."
1109,"“We’re giving away tax breaks without paying close attention to what’s a good deal or not a good deal,” he said."
1110,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1111,"Mayor Bill de Blasio threw his support behind congestion pricing on Tuesday as the best option to raise money for New York City’s failing subway, announcing an unusual alliance with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his frequent rival, to fix the system."
1112,"Their joining forces could give congestion pricing momentum as state lawmakers debate whether to embrace Mr. Cuomo’s proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. The idea has long faced difficult odds in Albany, and a proposal by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was defeated a decade ago."
1113,"But with the subway in crisis and the streets of Manhattan choked by traffic, Mr. Cuomo has argued that the proposal is the best option for raising billions of dollars and reducing congestion. For months, Mr. de Blasio had resisted endorsing congestion pricing and instead favored a tax on wealthy New Yorkers."
1114,"With state lawmakers facing an April 1 deadline to consider congestion pricing as part of the budget, Mr. de Blasio decided to back the idea to help mitigate the region’s transportation crisis."
1115,"“This crisis runs deeper than ever before,” the mayor said in a statement, “and it’s now clear there is no way to address it without congestion pricing and other dedicated revenue streams.”"
1116,"Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, two Democrats who are often bitter opponents, put aside their differences to show unified support for congestion pricing in the hope of persuading Democratic legislative leaders to rally their members. Democrats control both the Senate and Assembly for the first time in years, but some lawmakers are reluctant to approve new tolls, fearing a backlash from drivers."
1117,"Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio released a 10-point plan that called for reorganizing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads. They also proposed two new funding sources for the transit system: a tax on recreational marijuana sales, if they are legalized in New York, and an internet sales tax."
1118,"The two leaders embraced an idea that is popular among subway riders: using revenue from a state tax on cannabis sales in New York City to pay for subway upgrades, which state officials said could generate $125 million per year for the system. A separate tax on purchases like furniture from online retailers could raise an additional $320 million per year. Those two sources could allow the authority to issue bonds to raise $7 billion. Congestion pricing is expected to generate $15 billion, for a possible total of $22 billion in new revenue for the transit system, officials said."
1119,"Transit advocates, who have been pressing for new revenue sources for months, praised the plan."
1120,"“The governor and mayor are working together to address the transit crisis, and now we need the Senate and Assembly to do their part and pass congestion pricing as part of this year’s budget,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
1121,"On Tuesday afternoon, Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker and a Democrat from the Bronx, said there was more support for congestion pricing in his conference than in years past, but that there were ample questions about the plan."
1122,"“I think there’s still many concerns from members, particularly those members in Queens and Brooklyn, who represent transit deserts,” Mr. Heastie said in Albany. “So, I would say more people are open to it, but by no means is it a fait accompli.”"
1123,"Without congestion pricing, Mr. Cuomo has warned that subway and bus fares could rise by 30 percent. Transit leaders say they are facing a huge budget deficit and need billions of dollars to upgrade the aging system."
1124,The authority’s board is expected to vote on Wednesday to approve a fare and toll increase of about 4 percent. The plan from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio urged the agency to continue its practice of limiting fare increases to 4 percent every two years.
1125,"Their plan did not say how high congestion tolls might be, but they would not likely take effect until 2021. A task force created by Mr. Cuomo proposed last year that drivers pay $11.52 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street."
1126,"Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, has called for city control of the subway and, in a statement, criticized the plan by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio."
1127,"“While I am glad to see the Mayor finally taking an interest in congestion pricing and the Governor being open to M.T.A. reform, I strongly disagree with the idea that giving the State more control of City generated revenue and our transit infrastructure is going to magically solve our problems,” Mr. Johnson said."
1128,[Is 2019 the year when New York passes congestion pricing?]
1129,"Mr. Cuomo said the joint proposal addressed some concerns raised by past congestion-pricing plans. It calls for charging lower tolls outside of the rush hour and establishing tolls to enter Manhattan’s central business district rather than tolling the East River bridges. A driver could, for instance, cross the Brooklyn Bridge and take the F.D.R. Drive north, without paying the congestion fee."
1130,"“This is a different plan, I think, than previous congestion-pricing plans,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview. “The mayor has a number of issues that he felt strongly about and so did I.”"
1131,"Congestion pricing, which has been embraced by cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm, has been debated in New York City since at least the 1970s."
1132,"The plan calls for toll exemptions for certain groups: emergency vehicles, vehicles transporting people with disabilities, and people who have an “identifiable hardship” or limited access to medical facilities within the congestion zone. It would also establish a “regional transit committee” to review toll and fare increases, and move to centralize legal and human resources work for various M.T.A. agencies."
1133,"Revenue from congestion pricing, the cannabis tax and the internet sales tax would be put in a “lockbox” for the authority’s capital plans, which pay for repairs and upgrades across the network. The top priorities will be the subway, accessibility, buses and the expansion of transit in the boroughs outside Manhattan."
1134,"The plan will face hard questions in the state Legislature, particularly in the Assembly, where Democratic leaders have expressed concerns about the effect of congestion pricing on commuters not well served by public transit."
1135,"In the Senate, leaders have been at war with Mr. Cuomo after the collapse of an agreement to build a campus for Amazon in Queens. Mr. Cuomo has blamed Senate Democrats for scuttling the deal — he did so again on Tuesday — and neither the Assembly or the Senate offered an immediate endorsement of the 10-point plan, with representatives from both chambers saying it was too early to gauge its chances."
1136,"Still, Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate, said his conference would work with the Assembly, the governor and the mayor to “finally move forward on solutions to the M.T.A. catastrophe.”"
1137,"“Clearly, there is a crucial need for a dedicated stream of revenue to fix the crumbling M.T.A.,” Mr. Murphy added."
1138,"Mr. Heastie also seemed skeptical about spending money from any marijuana plan on subway repairs, saying that cannabis revenue should instead be directed toward low-income communities “that have been impacted by criminal justice issues.”"
1139,"On Tuesday, Mr. Heastie said he “was very clear with the governor and the mayor” that any marijuana revenue should first go to “community investment.”"
1140,"The M.T.A.’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, said he supported the plan, which included measures to reform an agency known for sky-high construction costs and a lethargic bureaucracy."
1141,"“This proposal is a holistic cure for much of what ails the M.T.A.,” Mr. Ferrer said in a statement, “and I hope to see it enacted swiftly for the benefit of our 8.5 million daily customers.”"

1143,"As New York edges closer to adopting congestion pricing, a major obstacle could stand in the way: the suburbs, where many lawmakers and commuters see the plan as benefiting the city at their expense."
1144,Leaders in Albany announced this week that they had reached a consensus that a congestion pricing plan to charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods was needed to raise billions of dollars for the failing subway.
1145,"But the details have yet to be worked out, and Long Island lawmakers want revenue from congestion pricing to flow to the commuter trains their constituents ride."
1146,[Driving into Manhattan may soon cost well more than $10. Here’s more on how congestion pricing would work.]
1147,"“At the end of the day, congestion pricing for Long Islanders should mean a better Long Island Rail Road,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who leads an influential six-member Long Island delegation that is part of the Senate’s Democratic majority."
1148,"But suburban demands for a generous slice of the congestion-pricing pie gloss over a stark financial reality: Long Island already benefits from a far larger pot of transit money than New York City, and its commuters who drive tend to be wealthier than most city subway riders."
1149,"The Long Island Rail Road accounts for just 3.5 percent of all transit rides provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the railroad and the city’s public transit."
1150,"Yet the M.T.A. subsidizes each ride on the Long Island Rail Road by $7.68, compared with $1.58 for everyride on New York’s subway trains and buses."
1151,"Even the Metro-North Railroad that serves suburbs north of the city, which the authority also manages, gets less than the L.I.R.R. — $6.54 per ride."
1152,"The Long Island Rail Road has also received nearly $3 billion for repairs and improvements since 2015, accounting for 9 percent of the M.T.A.’s five-year capital spending plan."
1153,Another $4.8 billion went to two huge projects: a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal that will serve Long Island Rail Road trains and new tracks on Long Island for more trains.
1154,"“In the past, they’ve gotten their fair share — and you could even say they’ve gotten more than their fair share because some of these megaprojects have been over budget,” said Jamison Dague, the former director of infrastructure studies for the Citizens Budget Commission."
1155,"Still, many Long Island residents and officials say their trains have grown crowded and service has deteriorated with constant delays and cancellations. “Whatever is happening, it isn’t working,” Mr. Kaminsky said. “To ask them not to drive when mass transit may not be up to the task, I think, would be seen as unfair.”"
1156,Legislators from the Hudson Valley have also called for congestion pricing revenues to be directed to the Metro-North Railroad.
1157,"“We’ve just felt neglected and forgotten about by the M.T.A. for years,” said Senator David Carlucci, who represents parts of Westchester and Rockland counties, adding that he could not support any congestion pricing plan without dedicated money for Metro-North."
1158,"A congestion plan backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio could raise about $1 billion annually in fees for driving into Manhattan from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for the transportation authority, which could also benefit suburban commuters."
1159,"But transit officials say at least $40 billion is needed to turn the creaky subway, which carries an average 5.6 million riders every weekday, into a modern 21st century system."
1160,"Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit, while those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive north past 60th Street would not have to pay."
1161,"Suburban senators have called for exemptions or toll credits for crossings heavily used by commuters — the Robert F. Kennedy, the George Washington and the Governor Mario M. Cuomo bridges. They also want improvements in bus service in transit deserts, and for suburban commuters to be represented on a proposed committee to review M.T.A. capital projects."
1162,"Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers and the majority leader, has said “there is a need for a dedicated stream of revenue to fix the crumbling M.T.A. but any fix must benefit all parts of the M.T.A.”"
1163,"Providing too many exemptions or toll credits would undermine the goal of reducing traffic and could result in higher fees for others to ensure enough revenue is collected, state officials said."
1164,"Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing, said he believed lawmakers were engaging in typical Albany negotiations since congestion pricing is part of the next state budget, which is due April 1."
1165,"“They’re laying out their interests,” she said. “That’s very standard for this time of year.”"
1166,"About 36,000 Long Island residents drive to work in Manhattan, including about 5,000 who participate in car pools, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Three times as many, or 108,000 commuters, take the train to work anywhere in New York City."
1167,"Long Island drivers who would pay congestion fees are generally better off financially than subway riders who live and work in the city: Long Island drivers have a median income of $72,500 compared with $41,400 for subway riders, according to the analysis."
1168,"Steve Levy, the executive director of the Center for Cost Effective Government, a conservative fiscal policy group on Long Island, said congestion pricing was simply another way to squeeze more money out of commuters and taxpayers and fails to address the M.T.A.’s “out-of-control spending.”"
1169,"“Enough is enough,” he added."
1170,"Even Long Island residents who support the idea of congestion pricing say it could create more problems. “In practice, there’s no way to make it work because the Long Island Rail Road is so broken,” said Jen Hosford, 45, a risk manager whose commute by train to Manhattan has never been worse. “If you’re going to add that many people, where are they going to go?”"
1171,Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislators are nearing agreement on a more than $170 billion budget that could help the subways and reform election campaigns.
1172,"But in Albany, nothing can be taken for granted. "
1173,"The deal, which must be approved by Monday, the start of the fiscal year, includes a congestion pricing plan to help fund public transit and a voluntary system to match small political contributions six-to-one to increase competition in state elections."
1174,"Though Mr. Cuomo, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader, and Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, have all committed to supporting these key measures, they haven’t reached a final agreement on the details. "
1175,The congestion pricing plan to charge drivers more than $10 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street could generate $1 billion every year that could pay for $15 billion in bonds for major transit repairs.
1176,"Making the plan a part of the budget helped pressure upstate and suburban legislators to support it. But the final version still needs to ensure that a clear majority of revenue goes toward the city’s subways, rather than suburban rail lines. The subways serve by far the most riders, have been underfunded and are in by far the worst shape."
1177,"Reaching an agreement on public financing of elections could be harder. Many legislators, especially in the State Assembly, have opposed it. After public pressure, Mr. Heastie backed the measure. The plan is worth the fight. A similar system has worked well in New York City, where it has increased competition in elections, one way to improve the responsiveness of elected officials."
1178,"One thing that needs to be included in the final deal is full funding for early voting, without shifting the cost to local election boards. Though the state approved much-needed legislation in January allowing New Yorkers to vote up to 10 days before an election, local election boards need funding to the changes."
1179,"But the proposal includes elements that have little to do with budgeting and deserve more careful attention. One such proposal would give police departments expansive discretion to withhold arrest information. Cuomo officials say the proposal is meant to protect individual privacy by addressing a scurrilous practice in which private websites post mug shots, then demand payment to remove them. But the measure is far too broad, and could prevent the public from learning basic information about who is arrested and why. On Friday, efforts were underway to narrow the scope of the measure to limit it to the release of mug shots, according to a spokesman for Mr. Heastie."
1180,This year’s state budget includes promising initiatives that can help move New York forward. Here’s hoping Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders can get it right.

1183,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1184,Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.
1185,"It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery."
1186,"The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning."
1187,"New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic."
1188,The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.
1189,"Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees."
1190,"Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks."
1191,"His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit."
1192,Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.
1193,"State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely."
1194,"Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond."
1195,"Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere."
1196,"Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone."
1197,But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.
1198,"After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing."
1199,"Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”"
1200,"Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing."
1201,"The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels."
1202,"Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later."
1203,"“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”"
1204,"One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates."
1205,"London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution."
1206,"Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h."
1207,"Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."
1208,"In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home."
1209,"But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted."
1210,"And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars."
1211,Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.
1212,"Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians."
1213,"Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic."
1214,"“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”"
1215,"The L train line, from the Rockaway Parkway Yards to the last stop on the west end of 14th Street in Manhattan, is about 10 miles. But for a kid growing up in the immigrant neighborhood of Canarsie, it might have just as easily been a universe away. I grew up in the subway cars of Brooklyn, and graffiti was the wallpaper of my childhood. I would often trace the fluid lines of a black tag with my fingertips, feeling the wild stroke of a derelict hand that had dared to leave its mark on the world."
1216,"These were the markings of a small, underground world written in code, performed in darkness and proudly criminal. What most citizens deemed vandalism, I saw as art. I didn’t visit museums. The only galleries I knew were the streets and subways of New York City where young kids sought immortality in an otherwise bleak world of food stamps and white bread."
1217,"Graffiti as we know it today evolved from a specific time and place: N.Y.C. in the 1970s and ’80s. There are rival origin stories in Philadelphia, and cities like Chicago and Los Angeles had their own scenes, but I grew up here, the golden age of vandalism, and nothing else came close to that cultural electricity, which still resonates today."
1218,"Everything started in subway cars, because everyone who was poor converged in those spaces and found each other, unrehearsed and unfiltered. Graffiti was the backdrop to an early hip-hop culture that was rising from the streets: breakdancing, bomber jackets, Adidas shell-toes with fat laces, Krylon cans and boomboxes. I heard kids spitting out rap lyrics on the train faster than I could think. I saw moves that defied gravity, with nothing more than a human beatbox for rhythm and piece of cardboard for a dance floor. "
1219,"I knew kids who couldn’t read but who could throw down masterpieces in sketchbooks with a handful of Sharpies. Pioneers like Taki 183 gave rise to a generation of bomb artists like Dondi, Seen, Lee, Revolt, Phase 2, Sane, Smith, Lady Pink and countless others. They paved the way for artists like Cost, Revs, Shepard Fairey and Banksy, who are known and beloved the world over."
1220,"But this was the city before Koch, before gentrification. Before graffiti moved into galleries. When crime here was climbing to all-time highs. There is no way to romanticize the era. Poor people committed crimes against other poor people. Drug dealers seemed omnipresent. The hopelessness lived in crumbling brick buildings and rat-infested subway platforms. Art was solace. I remember my friends swarming over every blank wall in the city with black markers and Krylons hoping their tags would stay up just long enough to become more than a blemish to be painted over. That maybe, it would last long enough to become Art."
1221,"There is an undying paradox in graffiti that makes it the most tragic form of art — it is the act of being anonymous while simultaneously aspiring to fame. You are known for your tag, not your real name. Your identity is hidden, but your tag is everywhere. It is both profane and sacred. At its core, it is nihilistic. And that is why I love it."
1222,"Because pretty food is the same. I am a chef and there is a connection between the permanence (or lack thereof) of food and street art. When the culture of graffiti I grew up with died out at end of the ’80s, I longed for something as sublime and as useless as spraying art on a wall. I found it on a porcelain plate in a French kitchen. I found a tribe of derelicts who were unhinged and passionate and nocturnal. There is an insanity to the number of hours spent over a stove to create a plate of food that will disappear in mere minutes. It’s not logical. But we do it anyway. We live for the few people out there who will truly get it. It means the world to us. To the rest of society, we are as anonymous as that fool who scrawled an illegible word on the back of a subway car."
1223,"Edward Lee, the author of “Buttermilk Graffiti” and “Smoke & Pickles,” is the chef and owner of 610 Magnolia, MilkWood and Whiskey Dry in Louisville, Kentucky, and the culinary director of Succotash in National Harbor, Maryland, and Penn Quarter in Washington, D.C. He earned an Emmy nomination for his role in the series “The Mind of a Chef” and, most recently, he wrote and hosted the feature documentary “Fermented.” He is on Instagram and Twitter @chefedwardlee"
1224,Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Thursday warned of a possible 30 percent subway fare increase if state lawmakers do not approve a congestion pricing plan that would pay for improvements to the subway system.
1225,"Mr. Cuomo threw down the gauntlet in a speech in Manhattan, pressuring state lawmakers who are reluctant to support his proposal with the idea of a staggering fare increase that would undoubtedly infuriate transit riders. Transit officials are already planning to raise fares this spring by about four percent."
1226,"“Either the rider pays in fares and tolls or it’s congestion pricing,” Mr. Cuomo said at a luncheon sponsored by the Association for a Better New York. “That’s the real choice.”"
1227,The governor’s blunt assessment was his most forceful argument for the proposal since he first embraced congestion pricing — a plan to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the failing subway system — two years ago.
1228,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has made congestion pricing one of his top legislative priorities in Albany this year, but some lawmakers are concerned about pushback from drivers."
1229,He acknowledged that congestion pricing would be a “politically difficult battle” this year.
1230,"“Why? Politicians do not like to vote for toll increases — myself included,” the governor said."
1231,"But congestion pricing offered the best option, he said, to raise money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subways, buses and commuter railroads. All of the systems are struggling to provide reliable service."
1232,"Congestion pricing has a long history in Albany, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg failed to garner enough support for the idea about a decade ago. Mr. Cuomo said his proposal could raise about $15 billion for the transit agency."
1233,"Under a 30 percent fare increase, the price of a monthly MetroCard could jump to $157, from the current price of $121. The price of a single swipe could increase to well above $3."
1234,Mr. Cuomo revived the idea of congestion pricing in 2017 after the subway descended into crisis and it became clear that a new revenue source was needed. But supporters of the proposal say Mr. Cuomo did not push hard enough last year to convince lawmakers to support the idea.
1235,"Mr. Cuomo’s comments on Thursday suggest that he is serious about winning approval for the proposal this year and wants to frame congestion pricing as the best choice among many difficult options. But Mr. Cuomo also slammed the transportation authority, calling it a “disgrace” and a “governmental Frankenstein.”"
1236,"Mr. Cuomo says he wants more control over the system, though he already has near total control of the transit agency. Still, Mr. Cuomo urged lawmakers to approve rules to improve the agency, including reorganizing the board to “put someone in charge” and to start a “forensic audit” to determine reasonable costs for its capital plan."
1237,The authority has said it could need as much as $60 billion for its next five-year capital program — a staggering figure that is nearly double the cost of its current capital plan. That includes about $19 billion for Andy Byford’s “Fast Forward” plan to modernize the subway.
1238,"Mr. Cuomo’s speech had a silly tone at times — perhaps an attempt to grab attention for admittedly dry topics like railroad procurements. It featured a peculiar slide show suggesting that Arnold Schwarzenegger, as the “Terminator,” might save the subway, or that Chris Christie, driving a yellow hummer SUV, should pay higher tolls to enter from New Jersey."
1239,"Democratic leaders in the Senate and the Assembly said they were considering congestion pricing, but did not enthusiastically endorse it."
1240,"“Senate Democrats are prioritizing the need to fix the crumbling M.T.A. with dedicated revenues implemented in a fair manner,” said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for Senate Democrats. “We will discuss congestion pricing and other M.T.A. solutions as a conference and move aggressively toward a solution.”"
1241,"Opposition to congestion pricing has generally come from lawmakers who represent the boroughs outside Manhattan and the suburbs. They have argued that tolls would unfairly burden their constituents, some of whom rely on cars because they do not have access to reliable public transit."
1242,"Mr. Cuomo sought to address those concerns by noting in his speech that few people in the region commute to Manhattan in cars. Only about 1.3 percent of Brooklyn residents, 2.2 percent of Queens residents and 2.2 percent of Westchester County residents drive to work in Manhattan, according to census figures."
1243,But Mr. Cuomo has not said how high the tolls might be. A task force created by Mr. Cuomo proposed last year that drivers pay $11.52 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street.
1244,"The governor’s office wants the tolls to begin in 2021. Mr. Cuomo still has to work with lawmakers on the details, including different fees for cars and trucks and at certain times of the day, with higher prices expected during rush hour."
1245,"Congestion pricing has been debated in New York City since at least the 1970s. It has already been embraced by cities like London, Singapore and Stockholm."
1246,"Transit advocates praised Mr. Cuomo’s support for congestion pricing. Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, said lawmakers could no longer kick the can down the road."
1247,"“The onus is now on every single senator and assembly member,” he said."

1249,"Even when there are no subway delays, it takes Amy Sacks at least an hour and 20 minutes to get to work in the Bronx."
1250,"The problem is that the subway still leaves her about a mile — and a bus ride away — from her office. “There’s always a transfer unless I use my feet for the second half,” said Ms. Sacks, a writer who lives in Manhattan."
1251,"But the key to a shorter, easier commute lies just outside her office door: railroad tracks that run through the Bronx."
1252,"The tracks are used by Amtrak trains, but would be opened to new commuter trains under a billion-dollar expansion by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of rail service linking Manhattan with suburbs north of New York City. Four new train stations for the Metro-North Railroad would be built along the line in the eastern Bronx, where subway service is sparse and buses are often slow and unreliable."
1253,"The aboveground rails that crisscross the city are increasingly being seen as a way to alleviate some of New York’s most pressing transportation problems. City leaders and transit advocates say commuter trains could be put into service to fill transit gaps and reduce congestion on subways, buses and roads. In neighborhoods where new train stations are built, new jobs, housing and development could follow."
1254,"“It leverages important assets that are already there and underutilized rather than having to build anew,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots organization of transit riders. “It saves money and time, and it brings new services online that we might not have access to — or at least not in a generation.”"
1255,"There are 38 Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, many in neighborhoods with sparse subway and bus service, according to a recent analysis by the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. But the comptroller noted that there is limited service at those stations, or tickets are priced so much higher than subway and bus fares that residents cannot afford them."
1256,"Mr. Stringer and transit advocates have suggested pricing commuter trains within the city the same as subways — $2.75 for a ride, including free transfers to subways and buses — to encourage more riders."
1257,"Transportation authority officials said they have been reviewing these issues and are conducting a pricing study on some Long Island Rail Road trains in Brooklyn and Queens. Since 2004, the price of commuter train trips within the five boroughs has been lowered on weekends through a program called City Ticket, which officials say has contributed to increasing ridership."
1258,"Ridership in general on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road has increased to the highest levels in decades, resulting in overcrowding. But transportation authority officials said projects are underway to significantly expand service, including building a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal with eight new tracks for Long Island Rail Road trains. The authority is also moving to add tracks on Long Island and run more trains across the region."
1259,"New York’s rail network has also become part of the debate over congestion pricing, which would charge drivers a fee to enter Manhattan neighborhoods at peak traffic times to raise money primarily for fixing the subways. Both supporters and opponents have called for expanding rail service outside Manhattan to provide an alternative to those who drive because they do not have easy access to subways and buses."
1260,"A state panel recently recommended expanding Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road service in transit deserts in the Bronx and Queens. Though that would likely increase the transportation authority’s costs and lengthen commutes for suburban riders who would have to sit through more stops, the report concluded that the idea, while complicated, was worth pursuing."
1261,"“The importance of opening up commuter rails has really come to people’s attention,” said Kathryn Wylde, the chairwoman of the panel, who is the president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of top business leaders. “In places where there is no subway service and lousy bus service, they’re watching these nice commuter trains roll right through their neighborhood without stopping. It’s pouring salt in the wounds.”"
1262,"In the Bronx, the M.T.A. plans to offer new commuter service by expanding and improving railroad tracks that are owned by Amtrak and run between Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan and New Rochelle in Westchester County. It would build four new stations on Amtrak-owned property in the neighborhoods of Morris Park, Parkchester, Co-op City and Hunts Point."
1263,"The authority’s capital plan includes $695 million for the project — roughly half the estimated cost — including $250 million that was provided by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. The remainder will be covered in the authority’s future capital plans, Aaron Donovan, an authority spokesman, said."
1264,"Tom Wright, the president of Regional Plan Association, a transportation research and policy group, said the new commuter line would increase the passenger capacity of the rail network across the New York region, and give all riders — not only those in the Bronx — more transit options if a catastrophe were to cripple subway and suburban commuter train service."
1265,"“Right now we’re using the system above capacity, so it doesn’t have any give from those kinds of shocks,” he said."
1266,"The line could begin service as early as 2023. But in recent months, the project has stalled as M.T.A. officials have been unable to reach an agreement with Amtrak to use the tracks. Mr. Cuomo has met with Amtrak officials to try to resolve differences, an aide said."
1267,"Amtrak has demanded that the transportation authority pay additional money to use the tracks and repair a bridge along the line, Mr. Donovan said. Amtrak faces major financial challenges to upgrade its aging network."
1268,"“They’re just trying to milk it,” said Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, whose office has collected more than 5,000 petition signatures urging Amtrak to “get on board.” “Amtrak still thinks we are in the age of the robber barons. They need to stop playing monopoly with the commuters of the city.”"
1269,"Jason Abrams, an Amtrak spokesman, said Amtrak and the transportation authority had met frequently in recent months to try to reach agreement on key issues such as design, construction and train operations “to ensure that the proposed expansion of Metro-North service does not adversely impact Amtrak intercity passenger rail operation.”"
1270,"He said that Amtrak will significantly expand in 2021, with more high-speed Acela service between New York and Boston, and that the Metro-North project must be integrated with other transportation projects in the city and region."
1271,"Still, city officials have forged ahead to lay the groundwork for new streetscapes and developments around the stations in the Bronx, New York’s fastest growing borough with more than 1.4 million residents. Nearly one-third of them live within a mile of one of the proposed four stations, according to city planners."
1272,"Israel Nazario, 64, a retired stagehand, said he moved to Parkchester in 2008 partly because he heard that a Metro-North station was coming. He has to walk 10 blocks to the closest subway station. The train station would be about a block away."
1273,"“I’ll save my legs because my legs aren’t what they used to be,” he said. “And instead of taking 40 minutes to get downtown, it’ll take me 20 minutes.”"
1274,"During a recent community meeting, city planners displayed maps and diagrams showing the Morris Park station as an anchor for a medical and science hub. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have this level of investment in transportation infrastructure,” said Carol Samol, the Bronx director for the city’s Planning Department."
1275,"Ms. Sacks, who lives in Greenwich Village and works at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Morris Park, said direct train service from Penn Station could cut in half her nearly three-hour round-trip commute."
1276,"“Besides the time, it’s very stressful because we’re always stopping,” she said. “We’re stuck often, and the trains are crowded and loud.”"

1278,Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was not at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board meeting in Lower Manhattan on Thursday. But his influence was obvious.
1279,"Transit leaders had been sounding the alarm for months over the need for a fare increase. A vote was scheduled for Thursday. Then Mr. Cuomo and his allies on the board intervened, and the vote was delayed for at least a month."
1280,Now subway and bus riders have no idea if the agency will increase fares or even cut service to tackle a growing budget hole.
1281,"“I’m not for service cuts. Let me be very clear about that,” the authority’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, told reporters after the board meeting."
1282,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has opposed the fare increase. He has relentlessly criticized the transit agency in recent weeks and told it to instead “tighten your belt.”"
1283,"Mr. Ferrer, however, said he believed a fare increase was necessary."
1284,"“We’re serious about cleaning our own house and putting the M.T.A. on a diet, but that alone isn’t going to solve our problems,” Mr. Ferrer said."
1285,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
1286,"The board was expected to consider two proposals for a fare and toll increase across its network of trains, buses, bridges and tunnels. The higher fares would have taken effect in March."
1287,"Then last week, Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, raised the prospect of a third proposal that would tie fare increases to service improvements. On Thursday, Peter Ward — who, like Mr. Schwartz, was a Cuomo appointee — made a motion to delay the fare vote."
1288,"“There’s some confusion, and some new suggestions have been made,” Mr. Ward said. “I’m concerned that we’re making a decision today when we need to be a little bit slower, a little more thoughtful, and need to consider a few more options.”"
1289,"The vote to delay the fare discussion was unanimous, including “yes” votes by three board members appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. de Blasio, a frequent adversary of Mr. Cuomo when it comes to the subway, said on Thursday that delaying the vote was “smart.”"
1290,"Board members want assurances that state lawmakers will approve new funding for the transit agency during the current legislative session, Mr. de Blasio said."
1291,"“The thing we need to focus on is a solution in Albany,” Mr. de Blasio said."
1292,"Subway riders are likely to cheer the fare reprieve. But the delay also brings further uncertainty for commuters who are grappling with unreliable service and questions over Mr. Cuomo’s recent decision to call off the L train shutdown. The board has raised fares every two years, but this is the first fare increase to be considered since the subway descended into crisis in the summer of 2017."
1293,"Without a fare increase, the authority expects to lose about $30 million in anticipated revenue each month. If the board votes on a fare proposal next month, it is unlikely to take effect before April."
1294,"It is unclear what fare options the board might consider. Mr. Schwartz has not revealed the details of his plan, though he said it could require subway leaders to show improvements in the on-time rate for trains."
1295,"The board was considering two options for fare increases of about 4 percent: The first would keep the base fare at $2.75, but end the bonus for buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard; the second would increase the base fare to $3 and double the bonus to 10 percent."
1296,"A weekly pass would rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass could increase to $127, up from $121."
1297,The fare and toll increase was expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year.
1298,"The debate over fares comes against a backdrop of a power struggle over the system and political pressure from Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority. Some board members have raised concerns over the board’s independence after Mr. Cuomo scrapped the L train shutdown without their approval."
1299,"One board member, Andrew Saul, said the board should have an opportunity to vote on Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan, which would make repairs to the line’s crucial tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan on nights and weekends. Any effort to go around the board, he said at the meeting, would be “a really bad mistake and sets a really bad precedent.”"
1300,"Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan has been called a temporary fix and criticized over safety concerns. A draft memo about the logistics of the plan, obtained this week by the transportation website Streetsblog, warned of major disruptions for riders, including making stations at First and Third Avenues in Manhattan “exit only.”"
1301,"Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority, defended the new L train plan on Thursday and argued that avoiding a full shutdown of the tunnel would benefit riders. But it would also mean that “far less alternate service will be needed.”"
1302,"“Just like the previously announced alternative plan, the new one — which is not yet completed and will incorporate significant community input — will accommodate every affected customer through alternate means like other subway lines,” Mr. Tarek said in a statement."
1303,"At the same time, the authority is facing a dire budget crisis. Even if the proposed fare increase is eventually approved, subway leaders have warned of steeper fare increases and major service cuts if state lawmakers do not approve new revenue sources for the system this year."
1304,"Mr. Cuomo has called on state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to pay for subway upgrades by tolling cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo appeared open to a fare increase if it also came with reforms."
1305,"“Money alone does not solve a problem,” he said. “Management reforms alone won’t solve a problem. You need both.”"

1307,"A poster hanging on the walls of New York City subway stations advertises a new book celebrating the life and work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling the Supreme Court justice a “trail blazer” and a “history maker.”"
1308,"On Tuesday, the advertisement at one Brooklyn subway stop included another message: an anti-Semitic slur and a swastika scrawled over her face."
1309,"The New York Police Department’s hate crimes unit and officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were investigating the incident, which came to wider attention after it was reported by a commuter on Twitter, officials said."
1310,"The vandalism, which was swiftly condemned by city officials, came amid a  rise in hate crimes in New York City, driven in large part by anti-Semitic attacks and incidents. There were 86 hate crimes reported in the city this year as of March 10, an increase of 62 percent over the same time period last year, the police said. About 60 percent of those were anti-Semitic crimes, with 52 such incidents reported so far this year, compared with 32 by the same time in 2018."
1311,"In 2018, hate crimes in New York City rose by 5 percent; anti-Semitic crimes alone rose 22 percent last year compared with the year before."
1312,"The poster, which was hanging at the Nassau Avenue stop on the G line in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, was defaced with the phrase “Die, Jew” and another profane slur written in capital letters in what appeared to be black marker. Underneath the expletive, which was punctuated with an exclamation point, was a swastika drawn over Justice Ginsburg’s lips."
1313,"The graffiti was removed from the poster on Tuesday afternoon, the transit authority said."
1314,"“We have zero tolerance for hate and violence, and this is a horrendous example that has no place anywhere,” an agency spokesman, Shams Tarek, said in a statement."
1315,Officials said they would share any available surveillance video with the police to assist them with their investigation.
1316,The Police Department confirmed on Wednesday that its hate crimes unit was investigating the incident.
1317,"The subway poster was advertising the book “The Unstoppable Ruth Bader Ginsburg: American Icon,” a photo history released in 2018 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Justice Ginsburg’s appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993."
1318,"When she was confirmed, Justice Ginsburg, a Brooklyn native, became the second woman and first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. During her confirmation hearings, she spoke about facing anti-Semitism in her past."
1319,"At one point during the hearing, she recounted a childhood experience of seeing a sign in front of a restaurant that read, “No dogs or Jews allowed.”"
1320,"“One couldn’t help but be sensitive to discrimination, living as a Jew in America at the time of World War II,” she said."
1321,"In an interview with The New York Times in 2015, she also spoke about facing anti-Jewish sentiment when she was trying to find a job after she graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959."
1322,"“I had three strikes against me,” she said. “First, I was Jewish, and the Wall Street firms were just beginning to accept Jews. Then I was a woman. But the killer was my daughter Jane, who was 4 by then.”"
1323,"In a tweet on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Justice Ginsburg represented “the very best” of New York City and vowed that city officials would find and punish whoever defaced her portrait."
1324,"The vandalism was the latest in a string of high-profile, anti-Jewish hate crimes in New York City in the last month. At the end of February, a 12-year-old boy was arrested and charged in connection with swastikas and other Nazi symbols on a public school playground in Queens."
1325,"Weeks earlier, two men threw an object into the front window of a synagogue in Brooklyn at about 2 a.m. No one was injured, but the attack, which broke the window, was being investigated as a possible hate crime."
1326,"The Jewish community in Brooklyn has been particularly on edge after a set of videos that showed Orthodox Jewish men being beaten, chased and choked in Crown Heights."
1327,The graffiti found this week also came a week after a chalk drawing depicting a noose showed up on a wall at another Brooklyn subway station. Transportation authority officials worked quickly to clean it up and denounced the drawing as hateful imagery.

1329,Nehad Ahmed fields the question day in and day out: What is that little tiled triangle carved into the sidewalk outside the smoke shop he manages in Greenwich Village?
1330,The answer: It was once considered the smallest piece of private property in Manhattan.
1331,"The triangle is roughly 25 by 27 inches — smaller than a yield sign on a highway, or about 0.0000797113 of an acre. Not quite eight hundred-thousandths."
1332,"Mr. Ahmed said the triangle is one of those things that tour guides mention, along with what has long been known as the narrowest house in the Village, a nine-and-a-half-foot-wide structure at 75½ Bedford Street that has been home to famous residents, including Cary Grant, John Barrymore and the poet and playwright Edna St. Vincent Millay."
1333,"The triangle outside Mr. Ahmed’s smoke shop is completely covered by a plaque. People walk right over it. They stomp on it. They hopscotch around it. Or they do not notice it as they trudge toward the corner of Seventh Avenue South and Christopher Street — itself a triangle, Olympic-size by comparison and bracketed by sidewalks and two subway staircases less than 30 feet apart."
1334,"New York has many lots that were too narrow to build on or, like the triangle, were left over after construction was finished. But Andrew Berman, the executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, had a lot to say about the little triangle."
1335,"“Literally and figuratively, it’s emblematic of the Village,” Mr. Berman said. “It goes against the grain — it’s about a resistance to having the order imposed that is commonplace in the rest of the city — and it’s about the little guy taking on City Hall.”"
1336,He could have said the Village went against the grid. Its patchwork of streets was laid out when the city pushed northward on a rectangular plan. That was fine until the city decided to connect the subway to Pennsylvania Station after it opened in 1910 — and extended the subway line farther south.
1337,"Until then, the city’s one subway line had run down the West Side to 42nd Street, where it turned east and went to Grand Central Terminal. Then it headed south, with stations all the way to City Hall."
1338,"For the extension below Penn Station, the city planned a long, straight avenue — Seventh Avenue South — atop the newly dug subway. The project forced massive demolition of buildings that were in the way. The New York Times said an 11-block stretch was to be “ruthlessly cut through, destroying many curious old residences and businesses.” More than 250 buildings faced demolition, most by condemnation by the city, amid some concerns that the project would “cut the heart out of old Greenwich Village.”"
1339,"One of the condemned buildings was an apartment house known as the Voorhis, owned by the estate of David M. Hess, a Philadelphia entrepreneur and real estate investor who died in 1907."
1340,Mr. Berman of the historical society said that Mr. Hess’s heirs put up a fight to save the Voorhis. They went to court. They lost.
1341,"And then a surveyor made a mistake. Somehow, after the distances and angles were calculated and recorded on the tax roll, the Voorhis lot did not disappear completely, as the city expected it to. The tiny triangle survived."
1342,"“Some versions of the story say it was overlooked by the city,” Mr. Berman said. “Others say the Hess estate refused to give up the property from the beginning. From most of the writing I’ve seen about it, it seems that it was a mistake on the city’s part that the city tried to correct” by asking the Hesses simply to donate the triangle."
1343,"Apparently still angry about the razing of the Voorhis, they refused, he said."
1344,So the triangle stayed. And the city moved on.
1345,"“My assumption is, the city decided it wasn’t worth it or didn’t think there was a case for eminent domain here,” Mr. Berman said."
1346,"Some accounts suggest that no one realized the triangle existed until well after the subway had been finished, and Seventh Avenue South paved over. The Philadelphia Evening Public Ledger ran an article about the little lot in 1922. It said the city had demanded payment of property taxes in 1921 and that Frank Hess, the son of David M. Hess, said he had not been aware of the existence of “any such ‘lot.’”"
1347,"“He went to New York,” The Evening Public Ledger reported, “and saw it — a piece scarcely large enough for the erection of a slot machine.”"
1348,"The building that the smoke shop occupies had been built by then. It was a cigar store, and Frank Hess arranged for the owners to lease the triangle. The deal called for it to be marked so “the city might know it had not been dedicated to public purposes,” The Evening Public Ledger explained. “Had the piece been allowed to remain unmarked and unfenced, the city might have claimed it.”"
1349,"So the plaque was laid, saying the triangle belonged to the Hess estate. The last six words mattered the most, at least to the Hesses: “Never been dedicated for public purposes.”"
1350,"The Hess estate finally sold the triangle to the cigar store’s owners in the 1930s, for $100, about $1,781 in today’s dollars. At the time, the Hesses had been charging the store rent of “a couple of hundred dollars a year,” according to The New York Herald Tribune. The triangle has been a part of the cigar store’s lot ever since."
1351,"For all the times that the Hess triangle was in the newspapers (and, more recently, online), it did not get the spotlight the way a slightly larger but still small slice of the city did."
1352,"That sliver belonged to Brian G. Hughes, a “famous joker,” as the headline on his obituary described him when he died in 1924. He had also been the president of the Dollar Savings Bank in the Bronx and the owner of a company that made paper boxes."
1353,He said he would give the city the little piece of land he owned for use as a park.
1354,"He arranged for a ceremony to hand over the deed. He hired a band to entertain the crowd that showed up — all without saying exactly where the property was or how large it was. Meaning, how small."
1355,"“He solemnly turned over the deed to a two-by-four bit of property to a popeyed city official,” according to Ross Duff Whytock, who wrote about New York for a number of newspapers, including The Hartford Courant. He did not say where the plot was."
1356,"“No attempt has been made, so far as I can discover, to carry out Mr. Hughes’s injunctions that it be set out with trees, shrubs, flower beds, a bandstand and benches,” Mr. Whytock wrote. “In Manhattan it would hardly serve as a breathing space for a subway sardine.”"

1359,"Weather: Powerful winds that can blow down trees and power lines are sweeping through New York City and the suburbs, weather officials said. The National Weather Service issued a High Wind Warning that is in effect until 6 p.m."
1360,Winds as fast as 60 miles per hour may be felt around the region.
1361,Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 6 (Ash Wednesday).
1362,Commuters who rely on the L train will soon have fewer options on nights and weekends.
1363,Similar disruptions may come to other subway lines before long.
1364,"As my colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons writes, the plan to run fewer L trains on nights and weekends to allow for repairs to the line’s tunnel is “in many ways a preview of what lies ahead for the rest of the system.”"
1365,"The subway system’s chief executive, Andy Byford, has said that the only way to improve service is to shut down swaths of the system to overhaul old equipment, including signals."
1366,"So, what’s the plan for the L train? "
1367,"Starting the weekend of April 27, fewer trains will run after 8 p.m. on weeknights; weekend service, which has sometimes been shut down while the Metropolitan Transportation Authority prepares for the overhaul, will operate with 20-minute gaps between trains."
1368,"The M.T.A., which runs the system, said it would provide enhanced service on the M, G and 7 lines, as well as additional M14A buses and a new “Williamsburg Link” bus."
1369,The disruption is expected to last about 15 months.
1370,Why are disruptions necessary?
1371,Workers need to repair the L-train tunnel that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy.
1372,"On other train lines, workers will upgrade the signal systems. Signals are sort of like traffic lights; the better the signals, the M.T.A. said, the greater number of trains it can run."
1373,"So, how do these upgrades get made? "
1374,Slowly.
1375,Mr. Byford has a $40 billion plan that calls for installing modern signals on several lines. (State lawmakers have yet to give him the money to do it.) He wants to expand night and weekend closings in the coming years to accommodate the installations.
1376,Some subway lines could see disruptions for more than two years.
1377,Have any signal upgrades already been made? 
1378,"So far, only the L and 7 trains have new signals, and those installations took longer than expected."
1379,What lines are next?
1380,"Work is being done in phases. It has started on the Queens Boulevard line (the E, F, M and R trains) ."
1381,"The F train in Brooklyn and the 8th Avenue line (the A, C and E trains) in Manhattan will be upgraded next. Work on the Lexington Avenue line (the 4, 5 and 6 trains) could start next year."
1382,The full list of lines that could be affected is on Page 25 of the subway’s Fast Forward plan.

1386,"On Friday, the federal government finally announced its appointment: Bart Schwartz, who ran the criminal division of the Southern District of New York when Rudolph W. Giuliani was the United States attorney in the 1980s."
1387,"Mr. Schwartz, now chairman of the investigations and compliance firm Guidepost Solutions, monitored Deutsche Bank after its involvement in fraudulent tax shelters, and General Motors after an investigation into lethal defects in its ignition switches."

1439,“Where are the rats?” he asked. “I can’t believe how clean it is on these platforms.” 
1440,"Many of the stations are works of art. Kievskaya, one of my favorites, has chandeliers and glittering mosaics with scenes from Ukrainian and Russian history. My other favorite station, Dostoevskaya, has murals depicting some of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s famous works, including “Crime and Punishment.” "

1445,"I live in Tokyo and rely on three trains — JR and Tokyo Metro lines — to get to my job leading food tours at the Tsukiji fish market. My first train is famous for being packed during the morning commute. But riders are good for the most part about making room for as many people as possible. When things go smoothly, a new train comes on the JR Chuo line every few minutes. If there are ever delays, train stations, social media and TV news are quick to share the information."
1446,"Trains are clean, and some cars are reserved for women and children. There are staff at the stations who are helpful and friendly. One time I left my keys on the train, and the staff at my station quickly figured out which train it was and where I could track it down. The keys were turned in and I retrieved them."
1447,"Japanese culture respects others before yourself. My train ride is so quiet in the morning that a baby could sleep. There are rules, such as letting people off first, that everyone follows."
1448,"New York impressions: I lived in New York for many years, and two things happened to me on the subway. First, I was held up. There were other riders in the car, and no one did anything to help. Second, I was on a train and a man had a gun. Everyone panicked, and people fled to the ends of the train. This doesn’t happen in Tokyo."

1451,"I came to Amsterdam in 1989 to work for Radio Netherlands Worldwide and started living here full time seven years later. Now I’m retired, and as a senior on a limited income, I qualify for a free pass on all city transportation. This mobility has opened my life."
1452,"When American friends visit, they think our system is like a dream. But it isn’t. It’s the result of decisions made by the city and national governments and supported by the citizenry, who benefit daily and are willing to pay taxes to support it. "
1453,"New York impressions: When I moved to Amsterdam after 15 years in New York, I had no idea that transport could actually run on a schedule. All I knew was to schedule extra time. "
1454,"I still don’t trust the timetables, mainly because I want to keep some of my New Yorker-ness!"
1455,— Ruth Dreier
1456,The metro here is known as the world’s longest art gallery.
1457,"One card allows you to ride the commuter trains, metro, trams, ferries and buses. There are even driverless vehicles. Transit is safe, punctual and affordable. Between my commute from the suburbs and my work co-directing the Stockholm Fringe Festival, I take three to four transportation modes a day. The system is part of my office. "
1458,"For the festival we rely on public transit to get our actors, crew and audience members to each venue. In fact we plan the locations and schedule around the metro lines. In 2012 we had a roaming performance that took place across different stations and trains. It won the Audience Choice Award."
1459,New York impressions: The subway looks like it does in the movies and smells like a shady nightclub toilet.
1460,— Adam Potrykus
1461,"When my husband and I were both working remotely, we thought, “Why not do this from Berlin instead of home?” So we left Austin, Tex., and spent a month there in 2016. We returned last year to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and my birthday. Berlin is our favorite big city, in large part because of how easy transportation is. "
1462,"The U-Bahn was our primary method of transit for everything. Trips on it aren’t particularly memorable, and that’s how it should be. Systems are consistent across platforms and stations. There aren’t obstacles to smooth travel. What’s memorable, though, is the exquisite, ornate tiling in many of the stations. You also don’t validate your ticket when you enter a platform, which I think only works because of German culture."
1463,"New York impressions: When I visited New York, the stations were grungier and more rundown than the U-Bahn. But the U-Bahn serves a city with 3.5 million people. It’s harder to maintain and clean a system in a city of 8.5 million. "
1464,— Jamie Miller
1465,"My family has a foundation that manages a robotics competition in Turkey. My work for it often requires taking public transit to meet with schools, sponsors and teams across Istanbul. When I was looking for an apartment, access to the metro and buses was basically my only criterion. "
1466,"The metro is pretty fantastic. The trains can carry a massive number of people. We have mild overcrowding for an hour or two a day, but it’s usually not horrendous. Trains are almost never delayed thanks to good maintenance. My line, the M2, carries about 400,000 people each day without trouble. "
1467,The trains have TV screens that play lots of things. My favorites are the cat (and sometimes dog) videos. 
1468,"The metro sparkles: Trains and stations are shiny clean. What I like most, though, is how fast it’s expanding. There are plans to go from 105 miles of track to about 680 miles in the next decade or so."
1469,"New York impressions: I’ve come to New York for robotics competitions. The subway gets you there. That’s about it. It was slow and broken, with lots of trash and decay. I felt like I was in an underworld."
1470,— Alex Francis Burchard
1471,
1472,"My work addresses urban-planning issues. Before moving to Vancouver, I lived in San Francisco, where I helped take down the Embarcadero Freeway and create the Presidio, a national park. Here, I’m working to remove two old highway viaducts, which will be replaced by a new roadway, parks, housing, bike paths and more."
1473,"The SkyTrain, our rapid transit system, has three lines that run through metro Vancouver. It plays a key part in a transportation strategy that makes walking, cycling and transit account for half of all trips in Vancouver. "
1474,"The entire system is driverless. I’ve sat in the front seat of a SkyTrain, imagining that I’m the engineer as we race across the Fraser River. "
1475,"Automation puts more money into maintenance and expansion. Six new stations opened in 2016. A project that will connect the suburbs to a major hospital has been approved, and an extension to the University of British Columbia is being discussed. "
1476,"New York impressions: The subway is a critical public asset with impressive 24-hour service. But it’s antiquated, inefficient and not designed for all ages and abilities."
1477,— Michael Alexander
1478,
1479,"I’m a professor of computer science and use public transit on weekdays to drop off my youngest daughter at school, get to my university, run errands and go to meetings. "
1480,"Zurich’s system has many desirable features. Most trams and many bus lines have their own lane, so travel time is more or less predictable. "
1481,"The buses, with few exceptions, and many trams have low floors, allowing a stroller, wheelchair or suitcase to be moved easily onboard. Most U-Bahn stations are also accessible."
1482,"The timetables are fairly dense on many lines, and the evening and weekend schedules aren’t much thinner. On Friday and Saturday there’s a late-night network. I’ve never felt unsafe in any bus or tram."
1483,Public transportation covers every part of the city. I don’t recall walking more than five minutes to a stop. It also has wide social acceptance; I know C.E.O.s who take public transit.
1484,"We once had visitors from the United States who left a handbag with money, jewelry and their passports on a bus. It took a phone call to find out when and where to meet the bus, and the driver handed over the bag."
1485,New York impressions: The subway is a nice working museum.
1486,— Thomas Gross
1487,I go to Northeastern University in Boston and studied in London for six months in 2017. I return every so often to work with a friend there on a business venture. 
1488,The Tube was the most amazing thing to happen to me. I could reach practically every spot in London in less than 40 minutes. 
1489,"The system is extremely efficient, with frequent trains during the day. For me this is one of the main reasons that London has stayed ahead of many cities that haven’t aged as gracefully."
1490,"The trains are extremely long and can fit tons of passengers. Some stops also serve as national rail stations. I could board a train near my apartment and head out almost anywhere in the United Kingdom, from London’s suburbs to Edinburgh."
1491,"Transit fares are based on zones. One time I accidentally left the area that my card could access. It was 2:30 a.m., and I was six miles from my apartment. A security guard offered to pay for me and I was home within 30 minutes."
1492,"New York impressions: I like that New York’s subway is extensive (more so than Boston’s), but it’s extremely poor quality. It’s closer to London in terms of having many stops in many places, but not close in much else."

1497,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seemingly rescued New York City from the L train shutdown on Jan. 3 by offering a last-minute solution. But two weeks later, no one knows what exactly is going to happen to the subway line."
1498,Critics have pilloried the new repair plan over safety concerns. It is not clear how long the solution would last or when construction would begin. It might still need approval from federal and local officials.
1499,Even one basic question has not been resolved: Is the shutdown really off?
1500,"The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, asked subway officials on Tuesday what would happen if the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board votes no on changes to the L train contract."
1501,"“What would that mean — that the L train shutdown isn’t averted?” Ms. Trottenberg said at a special meeting of the board, which oversees the subway."
1502,"“You vote whichever way you like,” the authority’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, responded."
1503,"The old plan — calling for a 15-month shutdown of the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn — was widely loathed. But at least there was some certainty. For the 250,000 riders who rely on the tunnel every day, there had already been months of preparing for life without the line. Now they are facing transportation purgatory."
1504,"The new plan calls for making critical repairs on nights and weekends, when workers would close one tube at a time and trains would run about every about 20 minutes. It has raised a flurry of questions and created uncertainty over what riders can expect in the coming months. The shutdown was scheduled to begin on April 27. With many details left to sort out, it seems unlikely that Mr. Cuomo’s plan would start by then."
1505,A new wrinkle emerged on Thursday night: an M.T.A. official said transit leaders believe the board would not need to approve a revised contract for the L train work unless the total cost of the project increased. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.
1506,"The upheaval has cast the transit agency in a negative light, prompting doubts about the competence and independence of the sprawling state-run agency, which is trying to pull the subway out of crisis. Mr. Cuomo appears to exert near-total control over the agency, and some doubt whether his latest deus ex machina was in fact the right move."
1507,"The authority’s leaders support Mr. Cuomo’s plan and say they are moving forward with it. The agency released a statement on Thursday night reiterating that a full shutdown “will not be necessary” but failing to address whether the board could vote down the new approach. It will take several weeks to decide on a “final construction schedule” for the partial shutdown, the statement said. “As soon as we have more definitive information, we will provide it to our customers and the public,” the statement said."
1508,"Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, said he was confident the agency would have clearer answers soon. He praised the new approach for alleviating pain for L train riders."
1509,"“Between now and April 27, all of the questions regarding health and safety issues, which are obviously relevant to both workers and the public, will be answered,” he said at the meeting."
1510,"Still, elected leaders sent Mr. Cuomo a letter this week asking for an independent analysis of his plan. At the board meeting, Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, seemed exasperated over the many unanswered questions."
1511,"“This is better than ‘Law & Order,’ which we all watch on a daily basis, in terms of intrigue,” she said."
1512,"The L train tunnel, which was inundated by floodwaters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, needs major repairs. Experts have raised concerns about the presence of silica dust, a hazardous mineral that is released when concrete is demolished and can cause lung cancer. They are also concerned that if construction is confined to weekends, it would be difficult to restore train service by the Monday morning rush."
1513,"“Riders want to know if the tunnel is closing, but they also want to know if the tunnel stays open, will it be safe and will service start again reliably every morning?” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
1514,"The announcement of the L train shutdown in 2016 hurt real estate prices in Williamsburg, a popular Brooklyn neighborhood that depends on the line. Now landlords and residents are waiting to see what happens next."
1515,"“If the shutdown is truly off, there will be landlords who are anxious to make up for deals they cut in 2018 and 2017,” said Grant Long, a senior economist for StreetEasy, a real estate listings website."
1516,"Renters saved nearly $27 million in North Brooklyn because of lower prices leading up to the shutdown, according to an analysis by Mr. Long. If Mr. Cuomo’s plan does not move forward and the shutdown is back on, the neighborhood might be even less attractive because of the negative publicity and the “whiplash of emotions” over the line, he said."
1517,"“It could make things even worse than they were before,” Mr. Long said."
1518,"Subway leaders say their goal is to begin work in late April. The board, which usually goes along with recommendations from M.T.A. leadership, plans to hire an independent consultant to review the safety of the new plan. Officials at the Federal Transit Administration are also expected to weigh in, but the agency has been affected by the partial shutdown of the federal government."
1519,"Mr. Ferrer, at a news conference on Jan. 3, said construction for the new plan could take 15 to 20 months. Veronique Hakim, the agency’s managing director, was less certain — she said on Tuesday that her staff was working to confirm that timetable."
1520,"The new approach would hang the tunnel’s cables from the wall, instead of encasing them in a structure known as a bench wall. Workers would secure parts of the bench wall with a substance known as fiber reinforced polymer that could last 40 years. If the bench walls were rebuilt, as the original plan called for, they could last more than 80 years."
1521,"The M.T.A. examined a similar idea for the L train in 2014 — to hang cables from the tunnel wall — but officials decided against it because of safety concerns. Engineers feared that bolting cables to the wall could damage the tunnel lining or cause leaks, according to documents obtained by The New York Times."
1522,"Subway leaders say the new approach is different because it relies on racks, instead of affixing cables directly to the tunnel wall, which would result in a 60 percent reduction in the number of bolts needed to hang the cables."
1523,"A spokeswoman for the governor, Dani Lever, said on Thursday that Mr. Cuomo did not know that the transit agency had previously considered hanging cables on the wall as part of the L train project. But she insisted that the new plan was different and better than the previous proposal."
1524,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has taken a firm hand over the authority, including setting priorities in its capital plan and pushing officials to open a new subway line in Manhattan, the Second Avenue subway, on time. Even so, he has argued in recent days that he needs more control over the agency."
1525,"Ms. Lever said the governor names only six members to the board and other elected officials can veto capital projects. “If that is control,” she said, “Nancy Pelosi is president.”"
1526,"But Mr. Raskin, of the Riders Alliance, said Mr. Cuomo already had great sway over the system."
1527,"“The governor’s L train maneuver,” Mr. Raskin said, “has one clear political ramification — to make clear the governor’s already in charge of the M.T.A.”"
1528,"Since 1851, many remarkable black men and women did not receive obituaries in The New York Times. This month, with Overlooked, we’re adding their stories to our archives."
1529,By David Gonzalez
1530,"In the 1970s, decades before entire New York City subway cars were wrapped with ads for Target or Amazon, teenagers with lots of talent — but little money — turned trains into rolling canvases, with graffiti tags that proclaimed their identities through kinetic lettering and comic book-style characters."
1531,"In a city reeling from near bankruptcy, their spray-painted expressions gave the cars a touch of color, humor or social commentary as they pulled into dirty stations or rumbled along streets lined with blocks of buildings that had been abandoned, incinerated or reduced to rubble."
1532,Critics and commuters called it vandalism. Donald White considered it art.
1533,"White, better known as DONDI, was stylish and shy, but his pieces were forceful visual postcards from the margins of the city. They ranged from quickly written tags to creations that covered whole cars, making him a legend on the streets and in galleries years before “street art” became popular, and setting a standard that is still followed to this day."
1534,"He was a master of technique, working for days in his Brooklyn home on designs that he would later spray paint during nighttime forays in train yards and tunnels. And when downtown galleries discovered the medium in the early 1980s, Dondi was among the first aerosol artists to achieve aboveground success. Long after his contemporaries traded train yards for galleries by the mid-1980s, he would still hit a whole car. Later, he produced sketches and collages that were as precise and innovative as his subway graffiti."
1535,"And then he was gone. Dondi was 37 when he died, on Oct. 2, 1998, of complications of AIDS. But his reputation as the “style master” endures, with his sketches now going for $100,000 or more, and his canvases for triple that."
1536,"“I never had to compromise myself,” he said in the book “Dondi White: Style Master General” (2001) written by his brother, Michael White, and Andrew Witten. “It was always me, doing what was comfortable, and relaying the message that I didn’t have to be taught to be creative and do good things. I guess what I’m saying is that I’m here and I want to be heard. I come from the streets, I painted on subways, and I feel my work is important. I want people to see it — I want to influence others.”"
1537,"Donald Joseph White was born in Manhattan on April 7, 1961, the youngest of five brothers to Alan Albert White, Jr., an African-American nurse and political campaign worker, and Lucy Mary Espanet, an Italian-American nurse. Nicknamed Dondi as a child, after the popular comic strip of an Italian orphan adopted by an American soldier during World War II, he attended a parochial school in East New York, Brooklyn, and passed the time riding his bike, raising pigeons on the roof of his house and drawing."
1538,"His earliest interest in graffiti was practical: he kept an eye out for tags by gangs whenever he ventured beyond his block to make sure he wasn’t entering dangerous turf, like Intermediate School 302."
1539,"“You couldn’t go out to Miller Park anymore because of the Tomahawks, which was a black gang,” he said in a 1995 interview that was published in “Dondi White: Style Master General.” “And then there was the Crazy Homicides, a Puerto Rican gang that was over on Pitkin Avenue near 302. They had that area. And across Atlantic Avenue there were the crazy Irish kids called the Headers.”"
1540,"But along the way, his interest in drawing led him to try his hand at graffiti."
1541,"His brother Michael White said Dondi first took to the trains in the mid-1970s with a graffiti crew known as TOP, an acronym for The Odd Partners. Within a few years, he was covering entire cars of trains that traversed miles of tracks, his work commanding notice from southeast Brooklyn to the northernmost reaches of the Bronx."
1542,His style later drew admirers even outside the five boroughs.
1543,He was known for his palette of soft colors and his ability to render his vision quickly and precisely.
1544,"“When I looked at something, I would see a line out of place,” he said in 1995. “Whereas other guys, they couldn’t see it, they couldn’t see that their ‘E’ got skinny in that section, that they didn’t think of it in that manner. My whole idea, my thing for style, was keeping the letters consistent, keeping them flowing.”"
1545,"His Children of the Grave series — the title taken from a Black Sabbath song — was among his most memorable of his whole-car work. The three pieces were produced between 1978 and 1980, featuring his name emblazoned across the car, flanked by cartoon figures or an outstretched hand and dotted with stylistic flourishes."
1546,"“He had a really beautiful, clear concise way of painting,” said John Matos, a graffiti artist known as Crash. “He would stare at it, pull back, do a line and look at it. It was like he was doing math. His paintings looked simple, but they were not.”"
1547,"Yet no matter how much buzz his pieces generated, they were — like all graffiti — ephemeral. Very often, apart from his sketches, photographs are the only remaining testament."
1548,"The most iconic image of Dondi was taken by the photographer Martha Cooper. In it, she captured Dondi, spray can in hand, straddling two subway cars at daybreak inside a Brooklyn train yard. The photo, she said in a recent interview, “captured the intensity of having to paint quickly and illegally.”"
1549,"It now appears on the commemorative reissue of “Subway Art,” the seminal book Cooper compiled with Henry Chalfant in 1984."
1550,"“That photo alone did a lot for the culture,” Cooper said. “It captured an urban adventure.”"
1551,"Eric Felisbret, a former graffiti artist and friend, said Dondi was generous with his time and advice with younger artists, giving them outlines to follow or touching up details himself."
1552,"“He had this whole crew of wannabes,” said Felisbret, the author of “Graffiti New York” (2009). “He was someone who not only had great command over letter forms, he became known for mentoring others. He was a style leader.”"
1553,"He dressed and acted like a leader, too, said Patti Astor, the platinum-haired artist who gained fame during New York’s 1980s downtown scene."
1554,"“Dondi was very understated,” Astor said. “His jean jackets were pressed, he had beautiful shirts. He was very good-looking and very elegant, and that commanded respect. He knew exactly where he was going to go and how he had to play the game to get there, and he was not going to compromise. To make a name for yourself in graffiti is a literal statement, after all.”"
1555,"Astor gave Dondi his first solo show at Fun Gallery, a venue in the East Village that she ran with Bill Stelling. (The gallery has also exhibited Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.)"
1556,"Dondi took to the gallery scene, with shows elsewhere in New York City and abroad. The timing was right; eventually graffiti began to fade from the public eye as city officials aggressively ordered train cars to be scrubbed before putting them into service."
1557,"Two decades after Dondi’s death, street art is commonplace, if not tame, attracting muralists who never did traditional graffiti, much less paint in a train yard. Whole-car advertisements on subway cars are just as common, as the city has sought new ways to generate revenue."
1558,"Yet Dondi attained a measure of immortality as a master of ephemeral art. His reputation has only grown, said the artist Sandra Fabara, who starred in the hip-hop cult classic “Wild Style” and is known as Lady Pink."
1559,"“You wish you could do style like Dondi, just like you wish you could play guitar like Hendrix,” she said. “But no one ever will.”"

1561,"When New York City’s transportation commissioner returned from a recent trip to California, she seemed downright jealous. There were electric scooters in Oakland. New train lines in Los Angeles. Self-driving cars in the Bay Area. She tried them all."
1562,"“It is an incredibly exciting time to be in urban transportation,” the commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, told a breakfast gathering of powerful New Yorkers, pointing to California’s progress."
1563,Her glee signaled a noteworthy and sobering shift. Wasn’t it her city that was once the envy of the nation when it came to transportation?
1564,"Not anymore. The subways on the East Coast that allowed New York, Washington and Boston to thrive are showing their age and suffering from years of neglect, while cities on the West Coast are moving quickly to expand and improve their networks."
1565,"The Los Angeles area, the ultimate car-centric region with its sprawling freeways, approved a sweeping $120 billion plan to build new train routes and upgrade its buses. Seattle has won accolades for its transit system, where 93 percent of riders report being happy with service — a feat that seems unimaginable in New York, where subway riders regularly simmer with rage on stalled trains."
1566,"“It’s a tale of two systems,” said Robert Puentes, the president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan research center in Washington. “These new ones are growing and haven’t started to experience the pains of rehabilitation.”"
1567,"In New York, Ms. Trottenberg returned to a laundry list of messes: a subway crisis, buses that move at a snail’s pace, the looming shutdown of the L train between Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the rebuilding of the dilapidated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway."
1568,"“There is a political will to invest in expansion” on the West Coast, Ms. Trottenberg said in an interview, though she noted that New York’s system was still the country’s largest by far. Its daily subway and bus ridership of nearly 8 million dwarfs Los Angeles’s 1.2 million riders."
1569,"Still, transit systems on the East Coast are losing ridership. New York’s subway has not expanded in decades, besides a handful of new stations in Manhattan — one on the Far West Side and three on the Upper East Side."
1570,"City officials have been reluctant to embrace electric scooters or self-driving cars, even as scooters have become a popular way to get around a growing roster of cities — including Austin, Tex., and Detroit — and provide an alternative to sitting in clogged traffic. A proposal by Mayor Bill de Blasio for a streetcar in Brooklyn and Queens appears to be stalled."
1571,"There is at least one bright spot: Citi Bike has become an essential part of the city’s fabric. The bike-share system has 12,000 bikes across Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens and recently announced plans to expand under new ownership by the ride-hail company Lyft, which will triple the number of bikes."
1572,"Only a decade ago, the New York region was flying high. More than 90 percent of subway trains were on time, compared to about 70 percent today. In the 1990s, New Jersey Transit won a coveted award three times from the American Public Transportation Association."
1573,"But in recent years, the East Coast has been notably absent from the awards ceremony, the Oscars of public transportation. Cities including Seattle, Salt Lake City and Houston have captured the title of outstanding transit system."
1574,"“In some of these growing communities like L.A. and Seattle, they haven’t been blessed with great infrastructure, and they’re trying to play catch up, frankly,” Paul Skoutelas, the association’s president, said."
1575,"When Seattle’s King County Metro won the award in September, it was praised as “a system that is expanding and innovating to meet rising demand” — not to mention a program that offers lower fares for poor riders that has served as a model for New York and other cities. Transit ridership in Seattle is growing, and car use is down."
1576,"One key difference is the West Coast has the ballot measure, while New York State does not allow voters to directly approve measures like transit funding. In 2016, both Los Angeles County and the Seattle region approved measures to boost transportation funding. The Los Angeles proposal, known as Measure M, won nearly 70 percent of the vote, greenlighting $120 billion in spending by raising the sales tax."
1577,"“The ballot initiative allows them to proceed without the political angst you’d have in Albany,” said Jon Orcutt, a director at TransitCenter, a research group in New York. “It takes some pressure off politicians. The voters go out and do it, and that creates political cover.”"
1578,"Los Angeles plans to build 100 new miles of rail — essentially doubling the Metro system, whose first rail line opened in 1990. There are now six lines and 93 stations. Huge machines recently began digging new tunnels for a Purple Line extension to the county’s Westside — part of a plan to attract younger people who are more likely to favor transit and worry about the environmental impact of cars."
1579,"“We had a political miracle,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in an interview. “A permanent 1-cent sales tax.”"
1580,"Mr. Garcetti, a Democrat, hopes the new rail lines will boost transit ridership. The number of train and bus trips in Los Angeles has dropped in recent years, though he blamed that on low gas prices and national trends in declining transit ridership."
1581,"Mr. Garcetti makes a point of using the subway. He took the Red Line recently, from City Hall to MacArthur Park, to visit Langer’s for the city’s “best pastrami sandwich.” He is also deciding how best to regulate the electric scooters that have flooded Los Angeles."
1582,"“I want to make them work,” he said. “I’m excited by them. They’re generally taking car trips off the road.”"
1583,"New York has unique challenges when it comes to funding and governance, Ms. Trottenberg said. In Los Angeles, the transit system is controlled by Mr. Garcetti, while New York’s subway is controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state lawmakers, many of whom rarely use the system and have shown little interest in making it a priority."
1584,"If New Yorkers had been asked to approve new transit funding in a ballot measure during the midterm election, Ms. Trottenberg believes it would have won."
1585,"“It would have to be a mixture so that we’re fixing the old, and you have to put in some new things in, too,” she said."
1586,"Instead, the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, is pleading with state leaders to approve new revenue sources when they return to Albany in January. Mr. Byford says it will cost more than $40 billion to fix the system — a figure that does not include any expansion or new lines."
1587,"In Seattle, a $54 billion ballot measure approved two years ago will help extend the region’s light rail system to 116 miles from about 20 miles."
1588,"Dow Constantine, the executive of King County, which is home to Seattle, said the city’s culture was changing, too."
1589,"“Folks are tired of sitting in traffic,” Mr. Constantine, a Democrat, said. “They’re mindful of the environmental implications of driving.”"
1590,"Seattle also wants to learn from the East Coast’s mistakes, Mr. Constantine said."
1591,"“I made sure we included funding for long-term maintenance,” he said, “so you don’t get the situation we’re seeing in New York and Washington where the systems have been neglected and it’s expensive and inconvenient to rebuild.”"
1592,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1593,"Recently Mayor Bill de Blasio went to Iowa, not for the first time, presumably to vision-board a bid for the presidency despite his public equivocations. Over the course of two stops, one in Sioux City and another in Des Moines, roughly 65 people came out to see him, a number that might disappoint even organizers of a municipal town hall on new concepts in recycling. Never one to be deterred by absurdly long odds, he is on his way to Florida this weekend."
1594,"Let’s take it as a matter of certainty that with a 43 percent approval rating in the city he runs and no reality-television franchise to explode his fan base, Mr. de Blasio has little chance of becoming the next president of the United States. Delusion often protects us from acknowledging life’s unsettling ironies. Six years ago, when he was elected the mayor of New York, in a landslide of the kind not seen since 1985, he was poised to become the country’s most prominent voice of the progressive left."
1595,"It is easy to forget how concisely he delivered his message on the corrosive effects of inequality and how much it resonated when he campaigned in 2013, a moment when few politicians of his stature were branding themselves so definitively this way."
1596,"And yet by the time of the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Mr. de Blasio was relegated to a minor speaking slot scheduled during rush hour on the East Coast. This was partly retribution for his slow reflex to endorse the Democratic nominee, but it made clear how little currency he actually had with a new and growing movement he was so crucial in fomenting."
1597,"Now, even if he were to serve merely as a traveling salesman for a particular strain of liberal problem-solving, something he seems compelled to do, Mr. de Blasio could easily be a liability to Democrats in the 2020 election cycle."
1598,"On the one hand, a new wave of progressives shares little of his comfort with real estate and other moneyed interests. This was clear when his initial support of Amazon’s expansion in New York was met with a fury he did not anticipate. He could not see that his relentless focus on the 25,000 jobs Amazon promised was misguided given low unemployment rates and the increasing number of technology jobs that have already come to New York. Good jobs are available to New Yorkers; what they don’t have is affordable housing, and that is a problem Amazon wasn’t going to solve."
1599,"Beyond that, the mayor is especially vulnerable to attacks from the right that would, predictably, suggest that his administration has embodied the failure of so-called big government. It is hard to defend his disastrous handling of the New York City Housing Authority, which has been troubled and underfunded for decades but reached peak crisis during his tenure, with lies and obfuscations about lead paint inspections and the increasing debilitation of the buildings themselves."
1600,"Just this week at a panel discussion on the future of Brooklyn, the urban planner and Yale professor Alexander Garvin, who oversaw the development of Lower Manhattan after the attacks of Sept. 11, argued that the city has passively and pointlessly waited for federal money to repair public housing — money that was never going to come — instead of pursuing innovative means of financing those repairs itself, through bond issues."
1601,The troubled subway system and Mr. de Blasio’s unsuccessful Renewal schools initiative simply provide more bait for privatization hawks to discredit the viability of a liberal approach to accomplishing fundamental problems with infrastructure and education that plague the whole country.
1602,"While blame for the dysfunctional transit system can largely be laid at the feet of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the mayor’s inability to work with him as a grown-up has only made things worse. It took Mr. de Blasio until the last possible minute to get behind a congestion-pricing plan that could divert revenue to subway repairs."
1603,The mayor is increasingly oblivious. This week he rode the subway and seemed surprised to discover just how exasperated New Yorkers are with their inability to get to where they are going without delays and hassles and endless anxiety.
1604,"“What I gleaned is people really depend on their subways,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference later, sounding as if he were a tourist from Havana with limited access to the tens of thousands of words that have been devoted to this subject by the local press during the past few years."
1605,"“‘Some days I get to work on time, some days I’m a half-hour late, 45 minutes late,’” Mr. de Blasio continued, recounting the conversations he had on the train. “You can hear the frustration.” That frustration has been within audible range for a very long time."
1606,"Mr. de Blasio’s style seems particularly ill-suited to a moment when personality politics have entered a new and hypercharged phase, when the ability to create an obsession both among one’s own constituents and the opposition seems so essential to getting ahead. Mr. de Blasio has always dismissed the criticisms that he is too earnest, too arrogant, too unlikable, too aloof. But how does he plan to compete in a world of Donald Trump rage tweets and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking to voters as she sings in her kitchen or chops squash?"
1607,"Somewhere he may have the knives to cut through, but they all lack the edge."

1625,"Updated: April 11, 2019"
1626,"This week’s image comes from the article “Subway Break Dancers, Clad in Armor, Go Medieval at the Met Museum.” The original caption on the video reads:"
1627,Nazier “Bless” Morales solos in a skit that draws similarities between medieval warfare and contemporary street dance battles.
1628,The article begins:
1629,"Out of nowhere, the clang of armor and the beat of hip-hop music boomed through a gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Tourists who had been peering at filigreed shields and wrought-iron broadswords swung toward the sound."
1630,"There, beside a cluster of horse statues in armor, a dancer moved into a handstand — one-handed by necessity. On his free hand, he wore a gleaming silver gauntlet, which he shimmied off and placed on the floor so that it stood upright like the disembodied hand of a knight."
1631,"Above the medieval-style metal glove, he spun, he kicked, he flipped."
1632,"Then, he fistbumped it."
1633,"For New Yorkers, busking dance troupes on the subways have been a spectacle (or scourge) since the 1980s, when they first began appearing on moving trains."
1634,But this performance at the museum was not a guerrilla-style takeover of the medieval gallery.
1635,"The dancers popping and locking in rehearsals in the gallery for the past several months — some in chain mail, others in helmets and breastplates — have collaborated with the curators of the museum’s arms and armor collection in an attempt to bring the ancient battle gear alive."
1636,"The video was created by James Thomas, Karen Hanley, Scott Blumenthal and Meghan Louttit."
1637,"I was at the airport, killing time in a Hudson News with a luxury-travel-magazine feature about Cara Delevingne’s favorite private island, when another magazine caught my eye. In bold type, a cover line blared: “What if Your Ocean Liner Is Hijacked?” This event seemed about as likely to happen to me as a visit to Cara Delevingne’s favorite private island, so I purchased both. As I waited to board, I started flipping through the second magazine, Recoil Offgrid. It’s a sister publication to Recoil, the “firearm lifestyle” magazine, but geared toward the more apocalypse-minded. Whereas most prepper culture skews rural, Offgrid welcomes those who live on the grid — and are utterly terrified about what would happen if the grid turned off."
1638,"The boat hijacking story was part of “What If?” a recurring feature that is Offgrid’s most addictive: it blends fiction, journalism and alarmingly evocative illustrations to describe the most agonizing ways to die in modern life — and offers expert advice on how to avoid or escape them. Examples include “What if You Were Trapped in a Mass Shooting?” “What if You Have to Deliver a Baby Without Medical Help?” “What if Your Utilities Are Indefinitely Disrupted?” and “What if Your Subway Is Attacked With Chemical Weapons?” Each scenario begins with some fictional mise-en-scène: “The rhythmic vibrations of the subway car had almost lulled me back to sleep, even though the cabin was crowded with morning commuters,” the chemical-attack story opens. “It was working, until the passengers at the end of the subway car started screaming.” Written in the first- or second-person, this setup imagines the unimaginable, in granular detail."
1639,"The fictional protagonist always has an identity: In the subway story, “you” are depicted as a bookish intellectual who takes the 7 train to Columbia University for a lecture. (Forgive them for reimagining the 7 train’s route; Offgrid is based in California.) Sometimes the identity is a story unto itself, like in “What if You’re Stranded in the Desert?” Here, “you” are “a portly sales executive in your early 50s named Mark, about to depart on a long road trip back home to Wichita, Kan. You dropped off your daughter, Laura, at her new home for the next four years: New Mexico State University. Despite the tears and laughs, the trip was a success, thanks to your trusted ’90 Ford F-150.” But then your vehicle breaks down on an unmarked road in the middle of nowhere, and your phone’s GPS doesn’t work."
1640,"Bullet points outline vital information like the season, place and weather. (100 degrees and sunny in New Mexico? Of course your old truck overheated, you fat fool!) And then a panel of experts explains your options for saving yourself. It’s like reading all of the possible endings in a Choose Your Own Adventure novel — while knowing the “adventure” could actually happen, if you choose poorly in real life, or if your luck runs out."
1641,"The experts who appear in “What If?” are paramedics, firefighters, a guy who trains Navy SEALs and the occasional lawyer for ominous consultation on self-defense laws. Their professional advice would seem to offer an antidote to the anxieties “What If?” stirs up. But like all great literary works, “What If?” resists simple resolution: The panelists rarely agree on what you must, or must not, do to survive. In the advice portion of the ocean-liner story, a former cop recommends “establishing an operable militia of ship patrons.” But a professional survivalist argues that resistance would be futile in your average hijacked-by-ISIS-backed-pirates scenario: “You’re not going to go up against an AK-47-wielding attacker with a rolled-up magazine or a butter knife.” Smarter to barricade yourself in your room with a satellite telephone and call the State Department."
1642,"Among the contradictions, there is a more abstract form of comfort — a tacit acknowledgment that, though we may struggle mightily to influence fate, we can never entirely predict or control it. Offgrid’s “What If?” does for disaster what Penthouse letters do for sex: It vividly describes events that its readers may have contemplated, or even obsessed over, but lack the imagination or information to really bring to life. (What nuclear war and three-way sex have in common: public interest vastly outpaces real-world probability.)"
1643,"But amid this chaos, “What If?” also provides small points of stability. Chlorine gas, I learned, is heavier than air. In the event of a chlorine attack, you should not crawl on the floor, as you might in a fire, but stand and seek higher ground. If you come across a rattlesnake while you are trapped in the desert, hold still — rattlesnakes track movement with ground vibrations."
1644,"“What If?” may be doomsday pornography, but whereas apocalyptic religions promise eternal bliss for followers after the storm, “What If?” sees bliss in the lives its readers already have. After all, to care about catastrophe and to fear loss, you must value that which you have. Before descending into chaos, “What If?” tends toward bourgeois idyll: “You” are a proud father who successfully raised a newly independent daughter. “You” have a loving spouse and enough money to take them on a cruise. “You” ride a secret uptown 7 train where there’s always a seat. Yes, the survivalists of Offgrid think you should toughen up — but only so you can preserve, and return to, that which is soft and sweet."

1657,"Supporters say a vacancy tax would push landlords to fill empty spaces or work with their tenants so they don’t leave in the first place. Landlords, not surprisingly, think it’s a bad idea."
1658,"But Mr. Hoylman says that the city hasn’t done a survey to fully know the scale, or nature, of the problem."
1659,"“We’re looking for an evidenced-based policy on this,” he said. He seemed to suggest that without knowing that, how can a tax be the solution?"

1684,"Yesterday was the 18th annual “No Pants Subway Ride,” which you might have noticed if you didn’t spend all your time looking at your phone."
1685,"It all started when Charlie Todd and some friends thought it would be funny to surprise people by showing up in a subway car, in the dead of winter, without pants. It worked."
1686,"Mr. Todd turned that prank, and others, into his full-time job at Improv Everywhere, a production company. And the no-pants subway ride has been copied in cities around the world: London, Berlin, Amsterdam and Portland, Ore."
1687,"“It’s not particularly fun,” Mr. Todd said during a brief interview: He did not intend to create a mass-participation event. He just wanted to catch passengers off guard."
1688,"But he became a victim of his own success. Now Mr. Todd, 40, has to handle the logistics of an event that can draw more than 1,000 participants."
1689,"“We have to divide people into 10 train cars, and then we divide them into multiple cars in each train. And then we divide them into multiple stops,” he said. “It’s a lot of work to make sure it’s not this unruly mob.”"

1691,Mr. Todd has turned down sponsorship requests and keeps political messages out of the ride.
1692,Which is why his answer to who he’d like to see participate next year was surprising.
1693,"“I would love to invite Mayor de Blasio,” Mr. Todd said. “More important, I would like to invite de Blasio to start taking the subway to Park Slope, to his gym, so he’s not taking a caravan of S.U.V.s through our congested streets. And he could do that with or without his pants.”"

1749,I saw that he was reaching for a glove that couldn’t have been his: It was on the ground in front of him as he bent over.
1750,"I looked around, trying to figure out whom the glove belonged to and what the man was going do with it. I was intrigued, but mostly out of self-interest. If he started asking around about whose glove it was, I wouldn’t get as far down the platform as I wanted before my train arrived."
1751,"A man who looked like a construction worker started walking our way. The first man tossed the glove in his direction, like you would with a pal. The construction worker caught it, smiled, winked, turned around and walked away."

1755,[Read our latest story on the cancellation of the L train shutdown.]
1756,"It was called the coming L train apocalypse: a 15-month shutdown of a major subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn that would cause one of the biggest transportation disruptions in New York City’s history, affecting 250,000 daily riders."
1757,"On Thursday, though, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced an unexpected reprieve, saying that engineers would use a new technology from Europe to make critical repairs to the tunnel without having to close it entirely."
1758,"The original plan would have shut the tunnel’s two tubes, starting on April 27, to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy’s floodwaters in 2012. Mr. Cuomo’s new plan could take about the same amount of time, but would keep full train service during weekdays and close just one of the tubes on nights and weekends."
1759,The news was a head-spinning turn of events for Brooklyn residents who had rearranged their lives in anticipation of a shutdown that would have severed their lifeline to Manhattan. They moved apartments. Changed jobs. Plotted new commutes. Rethought their social lives.
1760,"Of course, the announcement was also celebrated by New Yorkers who rely on the line. Jocelyn Crespo, 35, who lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, described herself as “very relieved.”"
1761,"“It gives us more options to get into work and opportunities to get to our friends,” she said."
1762,"But Mr. Cuomo’s announcement also raised a host of questions: Would the new technology work? Has it been effective elsewhere? Why did the governor wait until the last minute to do this? Transit advocates wondered how much the construction would cost and raised questions over whether Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, had made the decision unilaterally."
1763,"Mr. Cuomo appeared pleased to have stepped in to save the day. The decision, he said, would be a “phenomenal benefit to the people of New York City.”"
1764,"Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office, however, sounded a note of caution, saying the whiplash move by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, “was certainly no way to run a railroad.”"
1765,"“So long as this new strategy proves to be real, the mayor thinks this is great news for L-train riders,” Eric Phillips, a spokesman for the mayor, said in a statement. “But like everyone else, the mayor thinks the M.T.A. has some real explaining to do about how it has handled this for the last few years.”"
1766,"The authority’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, said the agency welcomed the new ideas and planned to adopt them. Mr. Ferrer said the work could take about 15 to 20 months."
1767,"Some New Yorkers who had already fled Williamsburg and other neighborhoods along the L line were frustrated. Andrew Klawiter was annoyed that he moved from Bushwick to Crown Heights, two neighborhoods in Brooklyn, to avoid the upheaval, only to have the shutdown called off."
1768,"”I was speechless for, like, half an hour,” Mr. Klawiter said of learning the news."
1769,[The L train isn’t shutting down after all. What exactly does that mean?]
1770,"For months, subway officials have been preparing for the closing and planning alternate options for commuters, which would have included a significant expansion of bus service and more trains on other subway lines. When the shutdown was announced in 2016, the news prompted panic in Brooklyn over what it would mean for real estate and local businesses."
1771,"In more working-class neighborhoods served by the L line, riders without the means to move were resigned to whatever misery the shut down would bring."
1772,"But last month, Mr. Cuomo said he convened a panel of engineering experts to consider other options for repairing the tunnel. He called the design they recommended a “major breakthrough” and the first of its kind in the United States."
1773,"“No rail system has used this approach before,” Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference, where he was joined by the panel members from Columbia and Cornell Universities. “So it really is, from their point of view, exciting.”"
1774,"“I don’t know if you can tell,” Mr. Cuomo joked, “but these engineers are excited.”"
1775,Some transit advocates were less enthused.
1776,"“The governor’s plan may or may not work, but you’ll pardon transit riders for being skeptical that a last-minute Hail Mary idea cooked up over Christmas is better than what the M.T.A. came up with over three years of extensive public input,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
1777,"Other leaders criticized the decision. Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, said a briefing from the M.T.A. had “left me with more questions than answers.”"
1778,"Melissa Mark-Viverito, the former City Council speaker who is running for New York City public advocate, said Mr. Cuomo and the agency “owe New Yorkers the truth about why this new plan came so late in the game.”"
1779,"“Subway riders are sick of being lied to and jerked around,” she said in a statement."

1781,Gov. Andrew Cuomo presented a new plan that calls for work to be done on nights and weekends.
1782,"The authority’s reputation has taken a beating as the subway descended into crisis two years ago. Officials have been working to fix the system, but it is still often unreliable for the nearly 6 million people who use it every day. Under the new plan for the L line, trains would run less frequently on nights and weekends."
1783,"Mr. Cuomo said that the L train tunnel was structurally sound, but that salt water from the storm damaged its bench walls, which house important power cables."
1784,"Instead of replacing the bench walls as originally envisioned, workers will use a “racking system” to mount the cables, covered in a fireproof material, to the tunnel wall. This system is used in London, Hong Kong and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Mr. Cuomo said."
1785,"“It’s faster, it’s cheaper, and it’s better than the way we’ve been doing it now,” he said."
1786,Workers will remove unstable parts of the bench wall and support weakened parts of the wall with “fiber reinforced polymer” wrap. They will install a new walkway to provide a way for people to enter or exit the tunnel — a function the bench wall had served.
1787,"Last month, Mr. Cuomo toured the L train tunnel with engineering experts to see if there was another way to undertake the repair work. With only about four months left until the shutdown, Mr. Cuomo said, he wanted to examine the tunnel himself so that he could tell New Yorkers that the closing was the only option."
1788,Mr. Cuomo said the transit agency had planned to tackle the repairs in the same way it always had. His experts offered a new way.
1789,"In 2017, the authority’s board approved a $477 million contract for the L train repair work. Mr. Ferrer said the contract — awarded to two companies called Judlau Contracting and TC Electric — would have to be renegotiated. The board would have to approve any amendments to the contract, he said."
1790,"Mr. Ferrer said he did not know how much the new plan would cost, but Mr. Cuomo said he expected that it would be less than the initial contract for repairs."
1791,"The transit agency initially said the shutdown would be 18 months and later shortened it to 15 months. Subway officials had considered two proposals: a shorter, full closing of the tunnel or a partial three-year shutdown that would have allowed some trains to run."
1792,"Some businesses along the L line were relieved by Thursday’s news. Leanne Hauser, 37, who tends bar at the Greenpoint Tavern outside the Bedford Avenue L stop in Williamsburg, said having construction on nights and weekends was not ideal."
1793,"“But at least people will be able to get here,” she said, “for happy hour.”"
1794,"ALBANY — After weeks of intraparty bickering, the New York State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday signed off on a $175 billion budget that was wreathed with progressive initiatives, including changes to the cash bail system, a new tax on high-end homes and a groundbreaking plan to charge motorists to drive into Manhattan’s busiest stretches."
1795,"The budget deal was immediately hailed as “transformative” by Mr. Cuomo, and it will clearly have an impact felt far beyond taxpayers’ wallets. The agreement included deals that will likely change the way millions of New Yorkers shop, commute and vote: bans on plastic bags from retail stores, billions in new funds for New York’s troubled subway system and a new paid three-hour break on Election Day."
1796,"The budget’s progressive theme was a victory for Mr. Cuomo and the newly elected Democratic majority in the State Legislature, most notably Democrats who helped give the party control of the State Senate for the first time in a decade. They largely lived up to pledges to address big money in politics, raise taxes on the wealthy and overhaul a criminal justice system that disproportionately targets minority communities."
1797,"But the deal announced in the wee hours of Sunday morning also showed the limits of those campaign promises. Activists criticized a plan to empower small campaign donors as halfhearted. A measure to tax luxury homes was refashioned at the last minute after the powerful real-estate industry intervened. And, perhaps most significant, hopes for legalizing the recreational use of marijuana were dashed, though lawmakers could still approve that later in the legislative session."
1798,"Still, for veteran observers of Albany, the sheer variety of issues settled since January — from infrastructure to the environment, from voting rights to transgender rights — was a relief from years of divided government, when interests of Republicans in the Senate often stood in contrast to the state’s overwhelmingly Democratic electorate."
1799,"“The process seems very similar,” said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, and a former aide to Mr. Cuomo. “But the product is obviously very different because you have a new majority in the Senate.”"
1800,"Most of the deals announced on Sunday were largely made behind closed doors, and left to the 11th hour: Voting was likely to push right up to, and perhaps past, the midnight deadline."
1801,"Chief among the new policies was congestion pricing, which is likely to affect the habits of anyone who works or plays in Manhattan. Under the plan, the first of its type in the nation, vehicles traveling below 60th Street will be subject to a toll, revenue that will be funneled into the city’s beleaguered subways and other regional transportation needs."
1802,"The congestion pricing deal deferred many of the difficult decisions — how much to charge drivers and who will receive exemptions — to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and a new traffic mobility review board. Eighty percent of the revenue will be directed to the subway and bus network, and 10 percent each to the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad."
1803,"The agreement also calls for an overhaul of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees New York City’s bus and subway system. Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the authority and who has been heavily criticized for the subway’s shoddy performance, has scapegoated the agency in recent months. As part of the budget deal, the authority’s policies will be changed to encourage speedier capital projects and to increase oversight."
1804,"A wave of new progressives in the Legislature believed the issue of criminal justice reform was of critical importance, and the new budget reflected that. Under the budget legislation, the state will eliminate cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes, though it will not be completely eliminated, as some of the Legislature’s more liberal members — still recalling the case of Kalief Browder, who took his own life after spending three years on Rikers Island because his family could not raise $3,000 bail — had hoped it would be."
1805,Lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo also agreed to a number of changes to discovery — allowing defendants more access to evidence that prosecutors intend to use against them — and processes to ensure speedy trials.
1806,"The compromise on bail, which came after law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the total elimination of such a system, is one of many compromises that appear in the budget."
1807,"Another saw a proposed pied-à-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes that were valued at $5 million or more, eliminated. Although the tax had the backing of state leaders, it evaporated under pressure from real estate interests and legal concerns."
1808,"In its place, lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo agreed to a “mansion tax” coupled with a real estate transfer tax, two one-time levies that would be charged at the point of sale on multimillion-dollar homes. The tax rate would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of properties worth $25 million or more."
1809,"A plan to ban plastic bags in the state was also included in the budget, but it makes a fee on paper bags optional, which some environmentalists worry will lessen the popularity of reusable bags. New York would be the second state, after California, to ban plastic bags. (Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.)"
1810,"Mr. Cuomo trumpeted several other accomplishments, including a permanent property tax cap of 2 percent, something he had said was nonnegotiable, and a new tax on “internet marketplace providers” which he anticipated would generate $320 million a year to help fund the M.T.A. The state also approved a tax on opioid pills."
1811,"The budget also increases education spending by more than $1 billion. Mr. Cuomo had initially proposed a number about $50 million lower; the Legislature had requested about $600 million more. Education is consistently one of the biggest spending increases, as well as spending commitments, in the budget."
1812,"Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized for sponsoring big-money fund-raisers, also announced a commission to develop a plan to provide up to $100 million annually in public financing for campaigns for legislative and statewide offices, including his own. The commission’s recommendations, due in December, would be legally binding unless the Legislature convened specifically to overrule them."
1813,A small-donor matching program was a central demand of many of the new legislators who won seats last year by defeating better-financed incumbents.
1814,"Under such programs, candidates can collect government assistance for their campaigns as long as they meet certain criteria. Such programs are usually intended to encourage small contributions, and don’t offer a match for large ones."
1815,"And while the inclusion of public financing in Sunday’s budget seemed like a victory for proponents, many remained unsatisfied, noting that many details, such as the ratio of matching funds and contribution limits, remained undetermined. That has led some activists to worry that the commission’s recommendations would be weak. Asked why he had chosen to form a commission rather than allowing public hearings and a legislative solution, Mr. Cuomo said that the issue was “too complicated” to be taken up by the state’s 213 elected lawmakers."
1816,"Still, if New York adopts a 6-to-1 matching system modeled after New York City’s, it would become the first state in the nation to match small donors’ contributions by a ratio of more than 1 to 1, according to Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the democracy program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. (Hawaii matches donations 1 to 1.)"
1817,"The negotiations over the budget were the first of Mr. Cuomo’s more than eight years in office in which he dealt with an entirely Democratic-controlled Legislature, and they came at a time of increased financial stress for the state, which had its income tax revenue dip sharply in recent months."
1818,"Mr. Cuomo consistently railed against the 2017 federal tax overhaul and the policies of President Trump for worsening the state’s financial problems, but still increased state spending to record levels. His administration also said it would codify protections of the federal Affordable Care Act, such as insurance exchanges and protections for pre-existing conditions, into state law."
1819,"During a news conference in the Capitol’s ceremonial Red Room on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo likened the trouble caused by Mr. Trump’s government to those caused by “extreme weather” and “political extremism.”"
1820,"“This is a difficult time for government,” the governor said. “It’s a difficult time for New York State.”"
1821,"It was also difficult, at times, in Albany, as the new Democratic majorities in the Legislature flexed their independence and power, creating significant intraparty tension with Mr. Cuomo."
1822,"During negotiations, the governor and other members of his administration repeatedly accused lawmakers of having unrealistic expectations and a lack of experience, a situation that was inflamed by the loss of a giant, multibillion-dollar Amazon deal in Queens in mid-February. Tension boiled over last week when a senior aide of Mr. Cuomo verbally attacked several newly elected lawmakers after they criticized Mr. Cuomo’s fund-raising habits, calling them “idiots,” preceded by a profanity."
1823,"Still, Mr. Cuomo seemed to want to glide past such unpleasantness on Sunday, saying that “all Democrats are not the same,” and thanking the legislative leaders for their hard work."
1824,"Indeed, even as his exhausted aides left the room, Mr. Cuomo stopped and spoke again."
1825,"“This is the best budget that has been produced,” he said, as the room cleared, “since I’ve been governor.”"
1826,A lot of life in New York takes place on the street. We carry our crumpled laundry down the block to the dry cleaner; we push overloaded strollers to the playground; we grab a slice of pizza on the way to the subway after a long day at work. 
1827,"Our backpacks and briefcases are weighted with laptops and water bottles, reading glasses, lipstick, a change of clothes for the gym. One hand (the other is always holding a phone) has to juggle, balance, point, clutch, smooth, zip. And that means we drop a lot of stuff."
1828,"Last winter on the way to work I noticed a child’s glove on the sidewalk, lying as if placed intentionally in the grid of cement squares. After that I began to notice other lost items. I liked the way the objects were framed by the crosswalk stripes, the cracked asphalt, the black dots of sidewalk gum, and I began to photograph them."
1829,"It’s surprising how quickly things appear and disappear. A large stuffed unicorn, on the curb near a yogurt store on Amsterdam Avenue in the late evening had been collected by the time I returned to shoot it in the morning. I saw a red book perfectly set against an orange traffic cone on my way to get a coffee and five minutes later I had the coffee but the book was gone. Doormen constantly sweep papers and cigarettes and other haphazardly discarded objects out of view."
1830,"Once, walking to the street from the subway, I heard shouting. “Your wallet! Your wallet! MISS! YOUR WALLET!” The young woman attached to earbuds acknowledged the exasperated good Samaritan — but only for a second and not long enough for a photo. She scooped up her wallet and returned it to her purse with the precision and efficiency of a shortstop making a double play."
1831,Not long ago I was bent over photographing some French fries. 
1832,"A friend happened to walk by and, after I explained what I was doing, told me about being outside of Whole Foods one Thanksgiving when a man was carrying out a large tray for what appeared to be a family dinner — turkey, stuffing, cranberry dressing, mashed potatoes, cornbread, brussels sprouts, pie, the works — and dropped it. Splat, on the ground, food everywhere. Now, that would have been a good photo."

1836,"The special counsel, Robert Mueller, found no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election, according to a summary of the key findings of his nearly two-year investigation that was made public on Sunday by Attorney General William Barr."
1837,"The special counsel, Mr. Barr said, stated that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him” of illegally obstructing justice. Nevertheless, Mr. Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, announced that there was insufficient evidence that President Trump had committed that crime."
1838,Read: Here’s the four-page summary of Mr. Mueller’s findings. Democrats have called for the release of the full report.

1840,"The Daily: On today’s episode, two of our reporters discuss the findings."
1841,"Calling the special counsel’s investigation an “illegal takedown that failed,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday: “It’s a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest, it’s a shame that your president has had to go through this.”"
1842,"The White House does not yet have the full report, a spokesman said, and it was not clear when, or even if, the president would get complete access."
1843,What’s next? Federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other investigations that grew out of Robert Mueller’s work. The end of his investigation also offers clarity to the Democrats who hope to beat Mr. Trump in next year’s election. 
1844,"Perspective: In an Op-Ed, the lawyer who drafted the regulations under which Mr. Mueller was appointed says that the attorney general’s unilateral conclusion that Mr. Trump did not obstruct justice makes it imperative that the public see the full report."
1845,"Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, is supporting two new measures as part of an effort to tackle anti-Semitic hate speech and anti-Israel language, an issue that has divided Democrats in the House."

1869,"Last week, Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The Times, wrote about the strange disparity in New York’s subway lines, exploring why lettered lines — notably the F — performed particularly badly. We noticed that the subway system skips a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain."
1870,"The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero."

1880,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1881,"Four days after Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s surprise decision to call off the L train shutdown, his plan faced growing skepticism over whether it is the best way to repair the subway tunnel."
1882,"The plan has been criticized as being a temporary fix and a risky solution since it has not been tried in New York before. Seeking to address the critics, officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority sat down with reporters on Monday to defend the decision and to explain their new approach to fixing the tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn."
1883,"The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, said he supported Mr. Cuomo’s plan, adding that he would make sure the work was safe and he believed it was the best option for riders whose lives would have been upended by a full shutdown that would have lasted more than a year."
1884,"“We had a robust plan,” Mr. Byford said in an interview at the authority’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan. “This is a better plan.”"
1885,"The solution,  developed by a team of engineers from Columbia and Cornell Universities over the last month, relies on a “racking system” to house the tunnel’s cables on the wall, instead of encasing them inside a separate structure, known as a bench wall."
1886,"Still, elected officials and M.T.A. board members have criticized the secrecy over the announcement and raised questions about whether the plan for the tunnel, which was built in 1924, was a permanent solution. Weak parts of the bench wall would be secured rather than replaced."
1887,"Michael Horodniceanu, the authority’s former president of capital construction, said the new solution might only last 15 to 20 years while the earlier proposal, calling for a full rehabilitation, could last more than 80 years."
1888,"“A repair cannot last as long as a total rebuild,” said Dr. Horodniceanu, who is now an engineering professor at New York University."
1889,"But Mr. Byford said he believed the substance that will be used to “entomb” the bench walls, known as fiber reinforced polymer, could last 40 years."
1890,"“This is certainly a long-term fix,” Mr. Byford said. “If it were as some have suggested — if we were having a Band Aid offered to us — I for one would have rejected that.”"
1891,"Under the revised plan, starting in late April, repair work would happen on nights and weekends, when one of the tunnel’s two tubes would close. But closing one tube would still be significantly disruptive for New Yorkers who rely on the L train."
1892,"“When you have only one tube in service, you may have three to four trains maximum an hour,” Dr. Horodniceanu said. “You’re going to have people who are going to wait on the platform for 20 minutes.”"
1893,"The old plan, which would have closed the entire tunnel for 15 months to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy, prompted outrage in Williamsburg and other neighborhoods in Brooklyn along the L line. Some people moved away and others began to plot intricate plans to reach Manhattan."
1894,"Elected officials held a news conference on Sunday to complain about how the new plan was foisted on them without many details. Brad Hoylman, a state senator who represents a slice of Manhattan along the L line, compared the process to marrying someone you had never met."
1895,"“I kind of feel like we were planning a wedding for the last three years,” said Mr. Hoylman, a Democrat. “We get to the altar and not only does the groom run off, but you look at the guy next to you, and you’ve never seen him before."""
1896,"At the same time, New Yorkers have asked why subway officials had not thought of the solution sooner. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, complained to reporters last week of a “transportation industrial complex,” made up of consultants and contractors, that benefit from the M.T.A. doing things the way they always have."
1897,"Mr. Byford, who has led the subway for a year and pledged to turn around terrible service, said the agency had considered a racking system for the L train project before his arrival, but there were concerns about “slinging the cables off what is a very old tunnel.” He said the panel of experts had found a way to make it feasible."
1898,"Mr. Byford said he had started a “due diligence exercise” to get answers to some of his “outstanding questions” about the new repair plan, like whether removing unstable parts of the bench wall could create silica dust that would be hazardous to riders."
1899,"“Dust mitigation is one of the main questions I need to have answered,” Mr. Byford said."
1900,Subway officials said they had also started discussions with the Federal Transit Administration about whether the agency would need certain federal approvals for the project — another potential roadblock.
1901,"Subway officials are also deciding on the best time to close the L train each night. The work is expected to take 15 to 20 months. More than 6,000 riders use the tunnel traveling to Brooklyn each weekday between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m., but the number drops off after that, Mr. Byford said."
1902,"Mr. Byford said he planned to meet this week with Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, to discuss which travel options to offer to displaced riders on nights and weekends, including buses."
1903,"As for the racking system, Mr. Byford said it was already being used on the No. 7 line extension to Hudson Yards on the Far West Side of Manhattan."
1904,"When he introduced the plan, Mr. Cuomo said the technology was innovative and was used in other cities, like London and Hong Kong."
1905,"In fact, in London, the subway has hung power and signal cables on its tunnel walls using brackets, shelves and other fixtures since the system was founded in 1863, often because there was no choice. Most of its tunnels are too narrow to accommodate bench walls. The cables, which are hung on the sides of walls and also overhead, run along parts of the deepest and most narrow tunnels, including the Northern, Central and Bakerloo lines."
1906,"Officials at Transport for London, the operator of the London Underground, said it was easier to repair and maintain the cables when they are not built in the walls. Although the cables can be vulnerable to leaks and track fires, officials said that it is not a major problem because the cables can easily be inspected and repaired."
1907,"In New York, bench walls serve a second purpose: to evacuate passengers during an emergency. In London, riders exit the front or back of the train, once the power to the tracks is shut off, and walk directly on the tracks."
1908,"The main complaint about hanging cables is that some riders view the jumble to be an eyesore. In some prominent locations, workers put covers over the cables to hide them."
1909,"Amtrak said it will now consider using hanging cables, instead of bench walls, for repairs to its tunnel under the East River that was also damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Those repairs could happen in the next six years."
1910,"But Amtrak officials said they are not currently considering hanging cables in its tunnel under the Hudson River. The design plan for repairing that tunnel and building a new tunnel under the Hudson River, known as the Gateway project, calls for using bench walls."
1911,"Veronique Hakim, the authority’s managing director, called the new plan a “game changer” and said it showed that the agency was willing to try new things."
1912,"“This is a new approach,” she said. “We’re embracing it, and we’re excited about it.”"
1913,"BERLIN — In Germany, women are paid an average of 21 percent less than men, one of Europe’s widest gender pay gaps. In Berlin next week, for one day only, the public transportation system will offer them a corresponding discount."
1914,"The BVG, which runs the city’s bus, tram and subway systems and is the country’s largest public transit authority, will offer women an unlimited day pass for 5.50 euros, about $6.20, instead of the regular €7."
1915,"The Frauenticket, or women’s ticket, is limited to Monday, which campaigners in Germany have designated as Equal Pay Day, and the authority is calling the promotion “Mind the Pay Gap.”"
1916,"“The women’s ticket not only challenges the discriminatory wage gap in our country, but also shows that the BVG itself is doing something about it,” Sigrid Nikutta, the authority’s director, said."
1917,"Despite its reputation as a socially progressive country — and its long-serving female leader — Germany has the third-widest pay gap in the European Union, according to 2017 figures from the bloc’s statistical agency. Only the Czech Republic and Estonia, both much smaller countries, did worse. (It also lags the United States, where the figure was 19.5 percent in 2017.)"
1918,"Quotas for the representation of women on corporate boards became law here in 2015, but the number of women in the national Parliament has declined since then, with the arrival of a male-dominated delegation from the far-right Alternative for Germany. There are now two male lawmakers for every female one."
1919,"The city state of Berlin, which is governed by a coalition of progressive and socialist parties, has been actively pushing women’s rights, and for the first time this year made March 8, International Women’s Day, an official holiday in the city."
1920,"Iris Spranger, a member of the city’s House of Representatives who campaigned for that measure, is also supportive of the transportation system’s public relations exercise."
1921,"“The women’s ticket is an original idea to highlight the gender pay gap,” she wrote in an email. “The lively discussion alone shows that it was a good idea.”"
1922,"According to Ms. Spranger, even more important than the ticket is the fact that the BVG has had an equal-pay policy since 2003."
1923,"Equal Pay Day, which in Germany this year falls on Monday, has been around since 1988. It symbolizes the extra days into the new year that German women have to work to earn the same as men."
1924,"The public transport system in Berlin attracts over three million riders a day and has rails spanning almost 300 miles. Its yellow subway cars have become symbols for the city, as have its cheeky ads."
1925,"In one of its online ads for the women’s ticket campaign, the BVG says: “Gender-specific wage gap. Sounds stupid. Is stupid. We’ll close it.”"
1926,"Men found using the special tickets, the authority said, would be treated like regular fare evaders and charged €60."
1927,But in a city where day passes are largely purchased by tourists — regular riders tend to buy monthly tickets — few men seemed to be taking offense at the idea.
1928,"“With the campaign, we also call on women to apply for jobs with us,” said Ms. Nikutta, the first woman to run the BVG and the first leader to make it profitable."
1929,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1930,The proposal was intended to help poor New Yorkers by offering them discount MetroCards for the subway and buses and put the city at the forefront of national efforts to find ways to address inequality.
1931,"But the launch of the program has turned into a mess for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on improving the lives of those struggling in an increasingly expensive city."
1932,It did not start on time. No one knows how to apply. It is unclear who will qualify or even which subway and bus passes will be offered at half-price.
1933,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, had initially failed to embrace the idea — he agreed to pay for it only after being pushed by the City Council — and is now under fire for his handling of the rollout."
1934,"On Thursday, Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, stood outside City Hall with transit advocates to call on Mr. de Blasio to release details about the program."
1935,"“Now we have to make sure that the people who are not left behind are the people that this program is supposed to serve — struggling New Yorkers, New Yorkers living below the poverty line,” Mr. Stringer said."
1936,"Mr. de Blasio had initially resisted calls to have the city pay for the program. But Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, convinced him last summer to include funding in the city’s budget. The two men even held a rally at the Fulton Street subway station in Lower Manhattan to celebrate the agreement."
1937,"In June, Mr. de Blasio said the discount program, known as Fair Fares, would start on Jan. 1. Looking ahead six months, Mr. de Blasio said, “I’m confident we can work out the details in that time frame.”"
1938,"But as 2018 came to a close, transit advocates became alarmed that his administration had not released any details. On Dec. 12, they sent Mr. de Blasio a letter raising concerns about the timing of the rollout and reports that the discount would apply to only weekly and monthly passes. They did not receive a response."
1939,"On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio told reporters that he would announce the details “in a few days” and that New Yorkers would understand if it “takes a few extra days.” Mr. de Blasio said the city was considering how it could include pay-per-ride MetroCards, which are often favored by New Yorkers who are living paycheck to paycheck."
1940,"The city agreed to pay $106 million for the first six months of the program. Under the agreement, it would apply to New Yorkers below the federal poverty line — a household income of about $25,000 for a family of four."
1941,[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  canceled the full shutdown of the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan.]
1942,"For transit advocates who aggressively pushed Mr. de Blasio to support the idea, his failure to start the program on time or to publicize it has been frustrating."
1943,"“To see people not taking this as incredibly seriously as they should be, it is disappointing to say the least,” said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit. “This is not just any ordinary mayor, this is a mayor who guaranteed he’d make this the most equitable city in the nation.”"
1944,Mr. de Blasio has struggled at times to prove he is skilled at managing a sprawling city government. And he has recently received criticism for spending less time at City Hall and for his hands-off management style.
1945,"Mr. Johnson, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Fair Fares, has not yet joined in the chorus of criticism over the start of the program. His office said in a statement on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson was “working to make sure that Fair Fares is a success.”"
1946,"“The Council has always believed that this program is for all New Yorkers living at or below the federal poverty line, and is committed to making sure that vision becomes a reality,” said Breeana Mulligan, a Council spokeswoman."
1947,"Mr. Jones, who was appointed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board by Mr. de Blasio, said the discount program was urgently needed, especially since fares are expected to rise again in March. The base fare for subways and buses could jump to $3."
1948,"“This starts to become serious money for people,” Mr. Jones said."
1949,"As many as 800,000 people could qualify for the program, according to a report by the Community Service Society. The program could eventually cost $250 million each year."
1950,"Mr. de Blasio had liked the idea of a discounted fare, but he did not want the city to be responsible for its costs. Instead, he wanted to pay for it by resurrecting one of his favorite ideas, a new tax on millionaires. But that would have to be passed by the state legislature, an unrealistic scenario last year given that the Senate was controlled by Republicans until Democrats retook the chamber in November."
1951,The concept of offering transit discounts for low-income riders is gaining momentum in other cities. Seattle started a program in 2015 that has served as a model for other cities. Toronto is implementing a similar plan.
1952,"In New York, the lack of information this week sowed confusion. When someone asked an M.T.A. Twitter account how to get an application for the Fair Fare program, the subway account said to contact 311, the number for information about city services."
1953,"A spokesman for the mayor, Eric Phillips, had to clarify. He said the program had not started yet, but when it did, services like 311 would have the details."
1954,"“But we aren’t there yet,” he said on Twitter. “Stay tuned!”"
1955,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1956,"It is not enough that a subway fare increase could soon make traveling underground in New York City more expensive. The cost of getting around above ground is going up, too."
1957,"An extra $2.50 fee will be tacked onto any yellow taxi rides in Manhattan that begin, end or pass through south of 96th street, and an extra $2.75 fee will be added for other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts — all before the car even starts."
1958,"The new ride fees were supposed to start Jan. 1, and are intended to raise more than $1 million a day to help fix the city’s broken subway system. New York is following a growing number of states and cities, including Chicago and Seattle, that have adopted similar per-ride fees in recent years to pay for public transportation and other services."
1959,"In New York, the new ride fees had been temporarily blocked at the last minute by a lawsuit filed by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers who called it a “suicide surcharge” that would drive away customers and devastate an industry already crumbling under financial pressures."
1960,"Judge Lynn R. Kotler of State Supreme Court disagreed, ruling Thursday that the new ride fees could proceed, noting that the taxi coalition had not “demonstrated irreparable injury.” But she did deny a motion from the state to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that the coalition’s arguments merited moving the case forward."
1961,The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 in Manhattan.
1962,Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s office would not say when the fees would start.
1963,The new ride fees are seen as the first step in passing a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all vehicles a fee to drive in the busiest neighborhoods and help reduce gridlock. The fees were approved last year by the State Legislature and also included a 75-cents fee for shared car-pool services.
1964,The taxi coalition argued in its lawsuit that the fees would “drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”
1965,"But lawyers for the state attorney general’s office countered that the lawsuit hurt city transit riders, and that every day the new fees went uncollected meant less money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways."
1966,"Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the decision was “a positive step in our efforts to find a dedicated revenue stream for our subways and buses, as well as easing congestion in Manhattan’s central business district.”"
1967,"But taxi owners and drivers criticized the judge’s decision, saying it would only add to their problems. Many are already struggling with enormous debt as the value of their taxi medallions — the aluminum plate that once sold for more than $1 million — has plummeted. Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year."
1968,"“It’s a big problem — that means people will not ride in taxis anymore,” said Mahmud Hossain, 54, a yellow taxi owner and driver from Astoria, Queens. “It’s very hard.”"
1969,"Mr. Hossain said that he typically takes home $70 or less after a 12-hour shift, or about half of what he used to make five years ago before ride-hailing apps started taking away customers. He worries that he will take home even less now."
1970,"Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said taxi drivers would feel the effect right away from the new fee. “Their income will drop immediately and force them to delay decisions over food and medicine,” she said."
1971,Ms. Desai called on the governor to hold off collecting the new fee while the lawsuit continues and said her group would lobby state legislators to pass an exemption for taxis from the new fee.
1972,"“Implementing the surcharge while the lawsuit continues could put the industry in the predicament of figuring out how to refund passengers, even those who paid with cash, should the drivers ultimately win the case,” she said."
1973,"With the new $2.75 fee, the cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will also rise to a minimum of $10.75. But Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city."
1974,"The taxi lawsuit had argued that taxis should not be charged a “congestion tax” because their number has been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services were allowed to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services."
1975,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has supported the new taxi fee, but Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has said it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry."
1976,"David Graves, 60, a taxi driver for almost two decades, said he was frustrated that the city had created the congestion problem and was now trying to address it by turning taxis into “unpaid tax collectors for the M.T.A.”"
1977,"“This is my future, this is the future of the New York City taxi,” he added."

1980,"The population density of New York City creates the ideal conditions for a car-free zone. Residents can commute by subway and borrow cars for longer trips from shared lots, and defunct light-rail systems (trolleys) could be reinstated. The California Tomorrow Plan, published in the 1970s, lays out clear plans for going car-free."
1981,"Lest we think that this change would require too large an investment in infrastructure, consider the changes wrought when cities from New York to Portland, Ore., paved over existing light rail lines (a change facilitated by carmakers)."
1982,"Madrid just announced that it will go car-free in its city center, and Oslo has committed to ban cars from the city entirely by the end of this year. When a third of Paris went car-free for a day, air and noise pollution was significantly reduced. In America, Minnesotans are eyeing Norway as a potential model."

1990,"From those first banjo licks, Bostonians know what’s coming:"
1991,“Let me tell you the story of a man named Charlie. …”
1992,"As sure as the train is roaring down the tracks, it’s the cautionary tale of Charlie, the Everyman who gets caught up in Boston’s soul-crushing subway system, whence he will never return."
1993,"Jacqueline Steiner, who died on Jan. 25 at 94, was the lyricist who conjured up poor Charlie early in her singing and songwriting career. She and the song’s co-writer, Bess Lomax Hawes, dashed it off for a Boston mayoral candidate in 1949. They expected it to fade after the election along with their candidate, who received only 1 percent of the vote."
1994,"But 10 years later, the folk music group the Kingston Trio picked it up. With a slightly new spin, the trio gave it a second life, and their “At Large” album, with the song, “M.T.A.” (also known as “Charlie on the M.T.A.”), as the opening track, hit No. 1 on the charts."
1995,"“M.T.A.” received an astonishing third life in 2004, when Boston officials did away with subway tokens and issued an automated fare card. They called it the CharlieCard, which is still its name. At the ceremony showing it off, Gov. Mitt Romney heartily joined the Kingston Trio and belted out the song."
1996,"The original version written by Ms. Steiner and Ms. Hawes and based on the tunes of two old folk songs, had a political edge. They wrote it for a progressive candidate named Walter A. O’Brien, who opposed the latest fare increase. Subway riders would pay a dime to get onto a train, but if they transferred to an aboveground streetcar, they had to pay an extra nickel to exit. (The system was so complex that the M.T.A. issued a 15-page booklet with instructions for both riders and subway operators; the agency ended the system after only a few months.)"
1997,"Charlie, alas, did not have that extra nickel."
1998,"His absent-minded wife came down to the station every day, but instead of handing him a nickel, “through the open window she hands Charlie a sandwich as the train comes rumblin’ through.” (Ms. Hawes wrote the sandwich verse, which Ms. Steiner always believed gave the song its punch.)"
1999,Charlie was thus doomed to “ride forever ’neath the streets of Boston / He’s the man who never returned.”
2000,"After the election, Mr. O’Brien was deemed a Communist and blacklisted. The clean-cut Kingston Trio, trying to advance their careers in the midst of the McCarthy era, generally avoided overtly political songs. They sanitized the Steiner-Hawes version of “M.T.A.” and changed the name Walter O’Brien to the fictitious George O’Brien."
2001,The song remains embedded in Boston’s collective unconscious and is something of an unofficial city anthem.
2002,"It has also served as a metaphor for other horrors, as when a Soviet cosmonaut was stranded in space after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union; Fred Small wrote a parody called “Sergei in the Milky Way,” based on the Kingston Trio’s arrangement."
2003,"Some in Boston find an enduring poetic resonance in Charlie’s plight. Thomas Whalen, a social scientist at Boston University, said that with the fare increase, resentment toward the onerous arm of government and hints of corruption, the song taps into a rich vein of Boston history."
2004,"“Charlie is caught in that political vortex, as we all are in Boston,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s this Kafkaesque nightmare — Charlie can’t get off that train.”"
2005,"Jacqueline Steiner was born on Sept. 11, 1924, in Manhattan to Joseph and Jane (Lippert) Steiner. Her father was a clothing retailer, her mother a telephone operator. Her parents divorced when Jackie, as she was known, was a toddler, and two aunts and sometimes her mother raised her, mostly in Greenwich Village."
2006,"Jackie skipped two grades and arrived at Vassar College at 16. She graduated in 1944 with a bachelor’s degree in philosophy, then headed to Radcliffe to study philosophy but dropped out to pursue a career as a folk singer and songwriter, taking odd jobs to support herself. It was while she was living in Cambridge that she and Ms. Hawes, who died in 2009 at 88, wrote “M.T.A.”"
2007,"Ms. Steiner’s first marriage, to Arnold Berman, ended in divorce after three years. Her second marriage, to Myron Sharpe, ended in divorce in 1980."

2009,"Ms. Steiner was always politically active, starting early in the peace and civil rights movements. In Norwalk, she served for many years as secretary of the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P."
2010,"A mezzo-soprano, Ms. Steiner was passionate about singing and playing the guitar. She sang at hootenannies with Pete Seeger and others and studied voice with Max Margulis, a founder of Blue Note Records, who also coached Judy Collins."
2011,"She also recorded two albums. The first, “No More War,” which she recorded in 1966 as Jacqueline Sharpe, consisted entirely of original antiwar songs. The title track, “No More War,” was based on a 1965 speech by Pope Paul VI at the United Nations. On her second album, “Far Afield: Songs of Three Continents,” released in 1991, she sang her own version of “M.T.A.” as well as songs in multiple languages."
2012,"As a singer for hire, Ms. Steiner sang solo and in choirs, at churches and synagogues. She even sang for prisoners at Sing Sing. She often hummed around the house, her son said, usually classical music."

2015,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
2016,The strategy for coping with the impending L train shutdown in New York City took three years of meticulous planning. Its unraveling took three weeks.
2017,"It started with a chance meeting in Brooklyn late last year, when an irate man told Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo that closing the subway tunnel for 15 months would hurt his community. It ended Thursday with a news conference so quickly thrown together that the board that oversees the subway was told 11 minutes before it began."
2018,Mr. Cuomo — after taking a midnight tour of the tunnel in December and consulting with his own panel of experts — dropped a bombshell: The L train would not fully shut down in April as planned.
2019,"It was a remarkable moment in the fraught relations between a bulldog governor, a besieged transit agency and the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, who has long been frustrated by his lack of influence over the subways. Mr. Cuomo essentially overruled transit executives and the mayor by deciding to pursue his own solution."
2020,"Mr. Cuomo’s announcement circumvented the authority’s board, even though the governor has insisted over and over that he does not actually run the subway, in a move that could further damage the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s already dim credibility. And Mr. Cuomo left Mr. de Blasio, a persistent adversary, scrambling to respond."
2021,"“I want to know for sure that this will work, but also why on Earth wasn’t it considered previously?” Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview on Friday."
2022,"Mr. Cuomo introduced fresh uncertainty over the L train’s future on Friday morning when he said his plan to repair the tunnel, damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, still needed to be approved by the M.T.A. board. He called for the board to hold an emergency meeting to consider the plan."
2023,"“If they decide to pursue this alternative plan, great,” Mr. Cuomo told reporters in a conference call. “If they decide not to pursue the alternative plan, make a decision, right?”"
2024,"The abrupt turn of events, while mostly welcomed by subway riders, was met with confusion and frustration among some elected officials and transportation advocates. The plans were made in secret. The city had already started to pay for contingency plans to replace a critical tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn that carries 250,000 people each day. People had rearranged their lives, moving and finding new jobs to avoid the pain to come."
2025,[The L train shutdown was canceled. What exactly does that mean?]
2026,"The new repair plan relies on an unproven technology that has never been used in the United States, raising questions about whether it can work without causing major disruptions. And the plan, for all of the governor’s promotion, was criticized as a simple patch job instead of a permanent solution."
2027,"Mr. Cuomo’s 11th-hour dramatics are well known. He has fashioned his political brand around a series of concrete accomplishments and an aggressive response to disasters and other headline-grabbing events, like his campaign to make sure the Second Avenue subway opened on time. He has not been shy about wading into city affairs, including the management of the New York City Housing Authority and placing state troopers on city streets."
2028,"His L train announcement on Thursday came together hastily. An email arrived at 12:34 p.m., alerting board members that the M.T.A.’s chairman, Fernando Ferrer, had accepted the Cuomo panel’s recommendations. Mr. Cuomo’s news conference began at 12:45 p.m."
2029,"His panel of experts had been working for weeks behind the scenes, even on Christmas and New Year’s Day. Mr. Ferrer said leaders at the transit agency welcomed the new approach."
2030,"“We’ve actually, over the last three weeks, literally spent hundreds of hours collectively working on this project,” Mary Boyce, dean of engineering at Columbia University, said."
2031,"When Mr. Cuomo was asked on Thursday whether the board had to approve the repair plan, Mr. Cuomo said, “I don’t believe so.” Mr. Ferrer clarified that the board would, in fact, have to approve a new contract for the work."
2032,"Veronica Vanterpool, a board member appointed by Mr. de Blasio, said Mr. Ferrer’s stamp of approval was premature. She said she did not have the answers she needed to vote in support of the new plan."
2033,Gov. Andrew Cuomo presented a new plan that calls for work to be done on nights and weekends.
2034,"“The original proposal would have fixed and repaired the tunnel for 50 or 60 years,” Ms. Vanterpool said. “It’s not clear to me the longevity of this solution.”"
2035,Ms. Vanterpool said the announcement had undermined the board.
2036,"“This continues to show that the board is essentially an afterthought,” Ms. Vanterpool said. “We’re not consulted, we’re not briefed, but yet we’re expected to move important projects along.”"
2037,"The authority’s board makes decisions for the regional transit system — which includes subways, buses, Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad — and votes on issues like fare increases. The governor names six representatives to the authority’s board, including the chairman. The mayor appoints four members. The executives of Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties each recommend one member, while the members that represent Dutchess, Orange, Putnam and Rockland Counties share one vote."
2038,"Mr. Cuomo’s repair plan relies on a new technology that Mr. Cuomo said had not been used in the United States, but had been used in London and Hong Kong. The approach uses a “racking system” to house cables on the tunnel’s wall, instead of encasing them in a separate structure known as a “bench wall.” During Hurricane Sandy, the bench walls were damaged by salt water from the storm’s floodwaters."
2039,[They upended their lives to avoid the shutdown. Then there was no shutdown.]
2040,Mr. de Blasio said he wanted to proceed with preparations for the shutdown because there was still uncertainty over what would happen.
2041,"“We should not, in my opinion, turn off all of the efforts that had been underway to prepare for the shutdown until we are 100 percent certain what’s going on,” the mayor said."
2042,"Andrew Smyth, a professor of civil engineering at Columbia, said his dean reached out to him, and within days he found himself underground with Mr. Cuomo."
2043,"“It happened very, very quickly,” Mr. Smyth said of the December tour."
2044,"Mr. Smyth said he had expected some pushback from the contractors who had designed the previous solution, but said they were extremely accommodating."
2045,"“It was really a very positive working collaboration,” he said. “Some of us going into it were a little bit skeptical.”"
2046,"Elected officials were also surprised to hear the shutdown had been called off. State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Democrat whose district includes the Manhattan stops on the L train and who welcomed the new plan, said he had only been briefed just before the announcement."
2047,"While Mr. Cuomo said a stranger had drawn his attention to the shutdown, Mr. Hoylman suspected that other constituents, and colleagues, were also a factor."
2048,"“The pending chaos is probably what motivated the governor,” Mr. Hoylman said. “And people whispering in his ear that this was not going to go well.”"
2049,"New York City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, the chairman of the Council’s Transportation Committee, said New York’s efforts to prepare for the L train shutdown should be assigned a monetary value and counted as part of the city’s future contributions to the M.T.A."
2050,"“That’s money that could have been used for other things,” he said."
2051,"Mr. Rodriguez said council members and staff had spent hundreds of hours preparing for the shutdown and meeting with residents, including holding a hearing last year. He said that he supported the new plan, but that it should have been introduced much sooner."
2052,"Council Speaker Corey Johnson said that while the averted shutdown was good news, residents deserved better than a surprise change, especially since many had already uprooted their lives."
2053,"“I’m having a tough time with this,” he said. “For years, the M.T.A. told New Yorkers that a shutdown was unavoidable. Now, at the last minute, we’re presented with a new proposal with no details on cost or a solid time frame.”"
2054,"Joseph Lentol, a veteran Democratic assemblyman from North Brooklyn, said he was pleased by the new plan, but still concerned about the potential effects on businesses focused on entertainment and night life."
2055,"Still, Mr. Lentol said, he was “happy for my constituents, if this plan can work.”"
2056,"“This is what governors should be doing,” he added. “Coming to the rescue.”"

It was through voluntary agreements, not eminent domain. The article also misstated what portion of the initial 1,200 acres meant for the project had been acquired by December. It was 99 percent, not 85 percent."

2062,"An article on Monday and two others on Tuesday about a fatal shooting at the 90th Street-Elmhurst Avenue subway station in Queens, using information from the New York Police Department, referred incorrectly to the murder and to the one recorded murder that took place on the subway in 2018. The killing in Queens was the first recorded murder in just over six months, not a year. The 2018 incident was a murder-suicide that occurred in July at the Broadway Junction station in Brooklyn, not in January at the Jay Street station."

2075,"When Hannah Ryles was a junior at a Tokyo high school in 2008, she was determined to attend David Lee’s junior prom."
2076,"“I loved him,” Ms. Ryles said, “and nothing was going to stop me from being with him that night.”"
2077,"Her father, Richard Ryles, a retired colonel in the United States Army, already knew that neither force nor negotiation would get his 17-year-old daughter to retreat from the idea of seeing Mr. Lee, a former classmate who was also 17."

2159,New Zealand
2160,Ms. Ryles
2161,By Scott Reinhard
2162,"“She was the new kid in school and I had a crush on her,” said Mr. Lee, recalling the start of eighth grade in September 2004. “She was so beautiful that I just couldn’t muster the courage to approach her and start a conversation.”"
2163,"She also liked what she saw, hairdo aside. “He was this tall, lanky kid who wore nerdy glasses, and had this ridiculous bowl haircut,” Ms. Ryles said. “But he also had this remarkable confidence about him, which I observed in the second semester that year, when we ended up sitting at the same table in Japanese class.”"
2164,"Ms. Ryles, the daughter of Melissa and Mr. Ryles, a career Army man, had moved with her parents to Japan from St. Louis in 1999. They lived on two military bases, Sagami Depot and Camp Zama, each two hours from Tokyo."
2165,"Five years later, her family moved to the suburbs of Tokyo, in Setagaya, as Mr. Ryles was transferred to the nearby Hardy Barracks in Akasaka."
2166,"Mr. Lee, the son of Jin Lee and Yu-Ching Lee, had enrolled at the American School the previous year. His mother, an information technology specialist with the United States Foreign Service, left Davis, Calif., with her family and traveled to Akasaka, as she was assigned to the American Embassy there. Her family was housed on its residential compound."
2167,"Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee briefly dated other classmates, but eventually began waiting out each other’s relationship as they held a huge, not-so-secret crush on one another."
2168,"Ms. Ryles’s was the first to break up, and a few days later, when Mr. Lee told her that his relationship had also ended, Ms. Ryles literally pounced on him. “I just kind of jumped on him and gave him this giant hug,” she said. “One half of that hug was meant for being sympathetic, but the other half was meant for celebration.”"
2169,"They continued as friends before they began dating in April 2005, and soon after, “our mutual crush quickly blossomed into full-blown teenage puppy love,” Ms. Ryles said."
2170,"They shared a first kiss at the ticket booth inside the Tameike-Sannō subway station, neither realizing that their young love was about to be thrown off course."
2171,"By late summer, 2005, Mr. Lee’s mother had accepted a two-year assignment from the State Department that would take the family to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At around the same time, his father accepted a job in Shijiazhuang, China, working as the chief executive of a Chinese-Indian joint-venture pharmaceutical company and commuting from Kuala Lumpur."
2172,"“We were both very upset, but despite the geographical distance that was about to come between us, we weren’t going to let each other go without a fight,” Ms. Ryles said."
2173,"They made a pact to keep in touch, and did that through hourslong Skype sessions, phone calls and emails."
2174,"“I kept telling David that Hannah lived too far away,” said Mr. Lee’s mother, Jin Lee. “He would look so sad on occasion because he missed her, and I would say, ‘David, there are so many girls out there, why are you doing this to yourself.’”"
2175,"But Mr. Lee would have none of it, and in the winter of 2005, he returned to Tokyo for a week to visit Ms. Ryles and other friends he had missed since his departure."
2176,"The following spring, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee convinced their respective families to vacation in Thailand, both conveniently forgetting to explain the reason."
2177,"“As soon as we arrived Hannah says to me, “Oh, by the way mom, David Lee and his family are here as well,” recalled Ms. Ryles’s mother, Melissa Ryles. “It was unbelievable.”"
2178,"The two family vacations overlapped by a single day, so the former classmates made a plan to introduce their parents once they arrived in Bangkok, then sped off to spend their precious time alone."
2179,"When Mr. Lee’s parents saw that Ms. Ryles had dyed her hair red and was sporting large hoop earrings, they sent Mr. Lee’s younger brother, Jamie, to spy on them. “I guess I wasn’t a very effective spy,” Jamie Lee said, “because all I was able to report to my parents was that Hannah and David seemed to be having the greatest time.”"
2180,"Ultimately, the stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship while not knowing when they might see each other again took a toll, and Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, both 15, reluctantly agreed to start seeing other people. “I was heartbroken,” Ms. Ryles said. “That’s not what I wanted.”"
2181,"In the summer of 2006, Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo but chose not to see Ms. Ryles, because the thought of seeing her with another boy was too much to bear. He decided to call her from the airport, just before boarding a flight back to Kuala Lumpur."
2182,"Ms. Ryles was heartbroken again. “I felt as if he had stood me up,” she said."
2183,"Though their pact had come unglued, neither could stay angry, or apart from each other for very long."
2184,"In January 2007, they patched up their friendship via social media and by February were professing their unwavering love for each other."
2185,"In April that year, Ms. Ryles, then 16, convinced her parents to allow her to visit Mr. Lee in Kuala Lumpur, where they committed to a long-distance relationship."
2186,"That summer, Mr. Lee began living with his father in Shanghai — making that decision after his mother decided to take a new assignment in Bangkok — and adding another international stop on a dizzying romantic journey that “mile for mile, began proving how truly committed Hannah and David were to each other,” Mr. Ryles said."
2187,"Indeed, Mr. Lee and Ms. Ryles continued to pursue each other aggressively. In 2008 Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo for a visit, and this time, the teenagers spent the better part of a week together, catching up on their lives while exploring the city."
2188,"That spring, Mr. Lee visited Ms. Ryles once more in Tokyo, and she returned the favor by “sneaking out” to his senior prom in Shanghai. This meant crossing the Sea of Japan once more, this time without telling her family."
2189,"“I told my parents I was going hiking with a friend in the mountains of Japan for three days,” said Ms. Ryles, who played hooky from school one morning to get a visa for her excursion, and paid for round-trip airline tickets with money she had earned as a babysitter and as a school-bus monitor."
2190,"“I also told my parents that we would have no cellphone reception, so don’t bother trying to call us,” she said."
2191,"They continued to creatively scheme and boldly plot new ways to continue to see each other. But no scheme was as creative and no plot as bold as the one they would hatch that summer, when they both enrolled in a summer volunteer program to teach English to elementary school students in Ayutthaya, Thailand."
2192,"By now, each was 18 and a high school senior."
2193,"They received approval from their parents, who did not know that their children were going together."
2194,"“David’s parents were very liberal, while my parents were much more conservative, which is why I always had to make up stories to go places,” Ms. Ryles said. “My parents always trusted me, and though they might not have known I was sneaking out, it was always with David, I never took advantage of their trust for any other reason.”"
2195,"For Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, the experience offered a first taste of living together for three months in a house in rural Thailand they shared with a high school teacher from Texas, a French university student, and several others."
2196,"One month after they returned from Thailand, Ms. Ryles visited Mr. Lee in China once more, and in the spring of 2009, they continued to rack up frequent flier miles as Mr. Lee managed to find a way to escort Ms. Ryles to her senior prom in Tokyo."
2197,"After high school graduation, they decided to go to nearby colleges in the United States. Ms. Ryles went to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she studied psychology, and Mr. Lee to Haverford College, less than a mile away, where he studied chemistry."
2198,"They spent one semester of their junior year studying abroad together at the University of Melbourne, in Australia, then went on to Sydney, then New Zealand and on to the Great Barrier Reef before returning to their respective colleges, from which they each graduated in 2013."
2199,"For the next two years, they lived together in Philadelphia, working as technicians in cancer research laboratories. Life was beautiful, but not quite as easy beneath a roof that did not include their parents."
2200,"“We would come home from work smelling like mice from working in mouse research laboratories all day,” Ms. Ryles said. “Our apartment also had no working heat.”"
2201,"She took on a second job as a waitress at an Italian restaurant, working nights and weekends to help pay bills."
2202,"Both applied to medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where they were accepted."
2203,"But before medical school began in 2015, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee made yet another international voyage, a sentimental trip back to China and Japan, where they revisited the Tameike-Sannō subway station in Tokyo to recreate their first kiss."
2204,"The next year, Mr. Lee proposed to Ms. Ryles in John F. Collins Park across from where they now live in Philadelphia in front of close friends and family. Mr. Lee’s parents and his younger brother, Jamie, as well as Ms. Ryles’s sister and brother-in-law, Elizabeth and Scott Downie, were all there to witness the moment. Afterward, everyone sat around a photo album that Ms. Ryles had been putting together since the day she met Mr. Lee, flipping through pages filled with pictures of their days in middle school, high school and college, and many other images from across a decade filled with more than 100,000 miles worth of sacrifice, commitment and dedication."
2205,"“It’s like no other fairy tale I have ever heard of,” Mr. Lee’s father, Yu-Ching Lee, said."
2206,"In May, Ms. Ryles will graduate from medical school and begin applying for obstetrician/gynecological residency programs, while Mr. Lee completes his Ph.D. in genomics and computational biology at the University of Pennsylvania."
2207,"“Every day when I see Hannah’s beautiful face,” Mr. Lee said, “I’m reminded that life is an exciting, happy, sad, inspiring, scary, wonderful, beautiful adventure.”"
2208,"Their adventure continued on Feb. 2 in Philadelphia, where Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee were married in a self-uniting ceremony at Union Trust, an events space where the reception was also held."
2209,"Ms. Ryles’s father presided over the ceremony, which included 112 guests, among them the bride’s paternal grandmother, Tomiko Fujiwara, 83, and her great-aunt in-law, Tamae Onodera, 76. Both women served as flower girls, each toting a basket filled with white rose petals that they scattered down the aisle ahead of the bride’s grand entrance."
2210,"The bride, immaculate in a lace and ivory Mikado Lazaro dress, began to cry midway through her vows when she said to her new husband, “We’ve grown up together, navigated through stages in our lives together, and grown together into the people we are today.”"
2211,"The groom, suave in a black tuxedo and a slick hairdo returned a bit of sentiment to his new wife. “Before I knew myself, I knew that I wanted to spend as much time with you as I possibly could, I couldn’t get enough of you,” he said. ""You have turned out to be perfect for me in ways that I couldn’t even imagine, and continue to discover every single day.”"
2212,"ALBANY — The words “Albany” and “lively” are not often used together, but on Wednesday, the first day of the year’s legislative session, the halls of the New York State Capitol were roaring."
2213,Legislators shouted greetings down the ornate Romanesque hallways. Aides jogged between offices. Lobbyists swarmed the elevators and rifled for business cards.
2214,"In the coming months, there will be bills to pass and deals to cut. Egos and relationships will bruise along the way. But on the first day, optimism was the dominant emotion, at least for Democrats, who this year will control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office for the first time in a decade."
2215,"That optimism became especially clear just after 1 p.m., when Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins formally ascended the dais as the first woman ever to lead the Senate majority. As the applause settled and the senators, both Republican and Democratic, took their seats after a standing ovation, Ms. Stewart-Cousins — wearing a custom scarf emblazoned with New York State’s seal — nodded to the historic nature of her ascent."
2216,"“Not that long ago, women weren’t even allowed to walk on the floor of these chambers,” she said."
2217,Ms. Stewart-Cousins then proceeded to list the many reforms she said will follow this year. A sampling: the codification of abortion rights under state law; expansion of voting rights; protection of child sex abuse victims; bail reform; a revamp of campaign finance laws.
2218,"“There is nothing to stop us, and there is so much more that we have to accomplish,” she said."
2219,"While that may be true on some bills — the ones above are expected to sail through — on others, fissures are already showing. And for the most part, the disagreements are within the Democratic Party: between urban legislators and those from outside cities, moderates and progressives."
2220,"In other words, the liveliness of the first day is sure to continue in the months ahead, but the fate of the optimism remains to be seen."
2221,Here are five of the most pressing and vexing questions that loom in Albany:
2222,"The subways need money. The subways have no money. On that much, lawmakers agree. But when it comes to how to get that money, things get complicated fast."
2223,"The most high-profile suggestion is congestion pricing, which would charge drivers who enter parts of Manhattan during the busiest times of day. Mr. Cuomo has declared it the “only realistic option” for saving the subway, and groups from unions to real estate developers have backed it. But the plan foundered last year after lawmakers outside Manhattan said it would burden constituents in transit-starved areas who had no choice but to drive."
2224,"It was a rare issue that fell not along partisan lines but rather geographic ones. This means the Democratic takeover of the Senate does not necessarily mean the proposal will fare any better this time. Ms. Stewart-Cousins represents suburban Westchester, and has said congestion pricing is one of many options she will examine."
2225,"Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, said he had seen no indication that revenue would go toward urgent repairs, rather than flashier projects like the new Second Avenue subway stations."
2226,"“If I had to make a list of priorities, adding a few subway stations to the richest neighborhood in the country wouldn’t have been my top,” he said, adding, “We have to remember that we have five boroughs, not just Manhattan.”"
2227,"But other funding proposals, such as a tax on high earners, have been shot down by Mr. Cuomo and others. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens, said he would support a tax on commuters from outside the city, but that idea cost Senate Democrats their last majority in 2010. Even a halfway measure last year, which put a surcharge on for-hire vehicles such as taxis and Ubers, has stalled after outcry from taxi drivers."
2228,"And even if congestion pricing does pass, it would not cover all the needed subway repairs."
2229,"But hey, at least the L train is staying open."
2230,"New York’s rent stabilization laws expire in June, and activists and lobbyists are already arming for what they say will be one of the year’s biggest battles."
2231,"Tenants’ rights advocates say this is their chance to end loopholes that help landlords remove apartments from rent stabilization. Bills that lawmakers may tackle relate to vacancy decontrol, which lets landlords deregulate certain apartments when they become empty; preferential rent rates, which can disguise illegally inflated rent; and the use of major capital improvements to allow landlords to raise rents after big renovations."
2232,"But the real estate industry has long been a source of political donations, funneling money to Mr. Cuomo and the long-reigning Senate Republicans. This year, as the political winds shifted, developers began giving to the Senate Democrats, and they also fueled the wins by Mr. Cuomo and the new state attorney general, Letitia James."
2233,"Still, there are signs of the industry’s weakened grip. Several newly elected lawmakers have pledged to fight for universal rent control; Senator Michael Gianaris, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, has stopped accepting real estate donations, as his Queens district has seen an influx of young and vocal progressives."
2234,"Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, an advocacy group, said he was optimistic but not naïve about winning stronger rent laws."
2235,"“We obviously can’t take anything for granted just because we have a Democratic majority,” he said. “We’re going to have to work very hard for this, because we have powerful enemies and they have a lot of money.”"
2236,The issue of school funding has perhaps offered the clearest sign that a Democrat-run Albany does not mean one big happy family.
2237,"The trouble started in December when Mr. Cuomo called a 1993 lawsuit, which successfully argued that the state had underfunded public schools, a ghost of the past. "
2238,"Six newly elected senators hit back to say the state still owed districts money. “And if the governor tries to deny me that, then he’s got a fight on his hands,” Senator Robert Jackson, who was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview."
2239,"Lawmakers, advocacy groups and Mr. Cuomo have continued to trade barbs on the topic, with the governor comparing his critics to people who believe Earth is flat."
2240,"New York State United Teachers, the state’s powerful teachers union, has also called for more funding. It is still pushing to increase oversight of charter schools and decouple teacher evaluations from test scores — a measure that both chambers actually agreed on last year, but that ultimately died amid end-of-session horse-trading."
2241,"A bill to create a Medicare for all-styled system for New York would be one of the most expensive items the Legislature could take up this year. It has passed the Assembly several times, and Senate Democrats have pledged their support, too. The idea has high-profile backers including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson. So it should fly through, right?"
2242,Not exactly.
2243,"Powerful insurance companies and business councils have hired lobbyists and rolled out campaigns to oppose the plan. They warn of job loss and new taxes. (A study by the RAND Corporation last year found that single-payer could save the state money, but that the findings were “highly uncertain.”)"
2244,"Mr. Cuomo — a fiscal moderate — may also not run to sign such a bill. He has called single-payer “conceptually” the right idea but said it would be better tied to action on the federal level, citing the huge upfront cost to the state."
2245,"“I have a lot of great ideas of Christmas gifts that I want to get, but then I’m going to have to deal with the reality of the cost and the budget,” he said in a radio interview."
2246,"If a promise to clean up Albany is a prerequisite for any candidate’s stump speech, a failure to do it seems the norm once they are elected."
2247,"Like congestion pricing, this issue doesn’t fall neatly along partisan lines. (Both the former Democratic Assembly speaker and the former Republican Senate leader were convicted recently, as were aides to the governor.) And the issues on the table are myriad, from legislators’ outside income to bid-rigging scandals."
2248,"One of the ugliest fights so far — and the session hasn’t even started! — stems from an outside panel’s recommendation last month that legislators receive their first pay raise in 20 years. But the rub was the proposal to cap outside income, which has been at the heart of corruption woes. The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, was decidedly not pleased by that caveat, accusing the commission of overstepping its bounds and calling one of its members a “chicken” and a rubber stamp for the governor. "
2249,"Mr. Heastie has promised to address the issue somehow this year, though he’s been short on details."
2250,"Then there are the escalating threats over who will investigate the other more. Several Democratic legislators have promised to make the Legislature a more robust investigative body, open to probes of the governor’s office. Mr. Cuomo, in turn, threatened to investigate them right back, in what he called “an investigations battle.”"
2251,"“Every grant that the Legislature does goes through my government, so I can investigate every one of those,” he said in a radio interview."
2252,"The Legislature’s track record on actually moving oversight bills does not inspire confidence. Last session, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to clean up the state’s contracting process and create a “database of deals” to track state subsidies. The Assembly refused to take it up. "
2253,"Still, some reformers are optimistic that the wave of energetic progressives will finally force lawmakers to act. Or as Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a newly elected Democrat from the Bronx who will lead the chamber’s ethics committee, put it: “Let me get to work!”"
2254,Dear Diary:
2255,I was wandering through the Times Square subway station at rush hour when I noticed a blind woman walking perilously close to the tracks.
2256,I approached her and offered my assistance. She took my arm with her left hand and held her walking stick in her right.
2257,She said she was on her way to catch a No. 1 train. I said it would be my pleasure to walk her there.
2258,"As I led her along, following the clearly marked signs toward her destination, we started to talk. I was recounting the story of my life when she stopped me short."
2259,"“I think it’s that way,” she said. She was pointing toward a passageway to the left."
2260,"The sign above us proved her right. I changed course, and she joked that she had made a lucky guess."
2261,We reached the No. 1 platform as a train was arriving. The crowd parted as I guided her onto the train.
2262,"“This is where we go our separate ways,” I said."
2263,“Where are you headed?” she asked.
2264,"“The Q train,” I said. “Heading home to Brooklyn.”"
2265,"As the subway doors closed, she reached out her hand and extended her index finger. She was pointing me in the direction of the Q."

2271,Dear Diary:
2272,"It was a hot, humid August afternoon in 1974, the summer between my sophomore and junior years in college. I was working as a bank messenger, traveling between branches to pick up the day’s records for delivery to the bank’s computer center."
2273,I was on an uptown No. 4 train with the guy who would succeed me. I was training him before I went back to school. He was wearing a pith helmet to combat the heat and humidity.
2274,"New York City’s subway cars typically lacked air-conditioning in those days, and the windows would often be opened to allow the occasional breeze."
2275,"That was the case in the car that my successor and I were on. We were sitting on a long bench seat, open windows over our heads."
2276,"The train pulled into the Wall Street station. Passengers got off and passengers got on and the car doors closed. And then, as the train lurched forward, a hand reached through an open window and snatched the pith helmet off my colleague’s head."
2277,"Everyone in the car was silent, stunned by the brazenness of what had just happened. And then everyone in the car broke into laughter and applause at the nerve and dexterity required to carry out such a masterful theft."
2278,— Patrick M. Malgieri 
2279,Dear Diary:
2280,"In fall 1996, my mother visited me in New York. Besides taking her to my favorite haunts, I had arranged a surprise for her: a visit to meet Helene Hanff, the author of “84, Charing Cross Road,” one of my mother’s favorite books."
2281,"Truth be told, it was a surprise for me too. After thinking up the idea on a whim, I had not expected that Helene Hanff would be listed in the phone book, answer my call and invite us to her apartment."
2282,"The Columbus Day Parade was in full swing as we left the subway at 72nd Street that day and made our way to Ms. Hanff’s cluttered Upper East Side studio apartment, where she lived by herself."
2283,"She expressed incredulity that my mother had read her books in India and had wanted to meet her. While the two of them chatted and Ms. Hanff autographed my own much-loved copies of her books, I offered to tidy up her little space, turning her bed back into a sofa, emptying ashtrays, folding clothes and fetching her a cup of coffee."
2284,"On the wall outside her tiny kitchen, Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins stared down from a poster for the movie version of “84, Charing Cross Road.”"
2285,"Ms. Hanff passed away six months later, in April 1997."
2286,— Vidya Shenoi Madiraju
2287,Dear Diary:
2288,I was walking north on First Avenue when I decided to cross the street to look at the menu posted in a restaurant window.
2289,I was about halfway across the street when a woman came up next to me.
2290,"“Excuse me,” she said, “do you know where I can pick up the Q train?”"
2291,"“I’m really sorry, but I have no idea,” I said. “I don’t live in the city.”"
2292,"She took a few steps, and then she turned around."
2293,"“But you look like you belong here,” she said."

2298,Good morning. 
2299,"The special counsel found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, Brexit remains a mess and Boeing may have rushed to finish its 737 Max 8. Here’s the latest: "
2300,"The investigation led by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, found no evidence that President Trump or any of his aides conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. "
2301,"The long-awaited report stopped short of exonerating the president of obstructing justice, according to the summary of findings made public by Attorney General William Barr on Sunday. "
2302,"Obstruction of justice: Mr. Barr concluded that Mr. Mueller’s report, which he reviewed over the weekend, did not present sufficient evidence of a crime. "
2303,"Analysis: Although Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Mueller’s findings were “a complete and total exoneration,” Mr. Mueller explicitly said they were not. Still, a cloud had been lifted, wrote our reporter."
2304,"What’s next? Democrats are demanding the full report, and they are conducting several investigations. Federal and state prosecutors are pursuing a dozen other inquiries that grew out of Mr. Mueller’s work."
2305,"In the wake of a Brexit extension, hundreds of thousands of protesters overtook the streets of London this weekend, calling on lawmakers to break the political stalemate and hold a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U."
2306,"The march reflected growing popular frustration over the gridlock, but few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote."
2307,"What’s next? The E.U. gave British Parliament until April 12 to decide how to proceed. If lawmakers approve Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan by then, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22."
2308,"If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a delay of up to two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed these options, too."
2309,"Today, lawmakers will vote on amendments to the plan. "
2310,How we got here: Britons who once simply wanted a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. are now willing to accept a no-deal Brexit.
2311,"In order for Boeing to clinch a deal with American Airlines — and to keep the airline from ordering hundreds of planes from Boeing’s rival, Airbus — the aircraft manufacturer knew it would need to update its workhorse 737 Max 8 within six years."
2312,"That competitive pressure to build the 737 Max 8 now threatens Boeing’s reputation and profits, after two deadly crashes of the jet in less than five months."
2313,"The pace of the work on the 737 Max was frenetic, according to current and former employees who spoke with The Times. Prosecutors are investigating whether Boeing rushed, missed crucial safety risks or underplayed the need for pilot training."
2314,"Inside Boeing: Engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings at roughly double the normal pace, and managers quickly pulled workers from other departments when someone left the Max project. "
2315,"Over the weekend: About a dozen pilots and trainers from American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, as well as from two non-U.S. airlines, Copa Airlines and Fly Dubai, met with Boeing executives to discuss proposed changes to the 737 Max. Many of the pilots simulated flights under conditions similar to those believed to have brought down the two planes, and they were able to land safely. "
2316,"President Xi Jinping of China visited Monaco and France this weekend as European leaders grappled with how to engage with China and benefit from its trade, while setting limits on its appetite for greater influence. "
2317,"A divided front: Italy defied allies and became the first Group of 7 nation to sign on to China’s Belt and Road initiative on Saturday.  President Emmanuel Macron of France opposed the move, and he, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and representatives of the E.U. are expected to present a united front to Mr. Xi this week against what they consider China’s aggressive expansion into the continent. "
2318,The memorandum of understanding that was formalized on Saturday provides a framework agreement for billions of euros in business deals between Italian and Chinese-state-backed companies. 
2319,"Belt and Road: The project is an attempt by China to expand its influence and economic interests around the world, building out its global infrastructure. "
2320,Algeria: Protesters are demanding the ouster of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and his entire system — and demonstrations are growing larger and larger. 
2321,"France: Thousands of police officers fanned out across Paris and other cities as “Yellow Vest” protests entered their 19th weekend. Though sporadic clashes erupted late in the day, violence dropped as protesters marched peacefully in the capital. "
2322,"Norway: A cruise ship stranded off the country’s coast finally reached shore, a welcome sight for hundreds of passengers who had not been evacuated in a harrowing rescue operation. They arrived bruised and battered, hurt by falling objects and shattered glass on the rocking ship."
2323,"Syria: The last bastion of the Islamic State’s caliphate fell to American-backed forces on Saturday after a four-year battle. It was a blow to the terrorist group, which once controlled land in the region the size of Britain, but ISIS remains a serious threat."
2324,"The Netherlands: The primary suspect in a shooting aboard a Dutch tram that left three dead and five wounded confessed to the crime on Friday, prosecutors said. "
2325,"North Korea: The country’s state media escalated calls for South Korea to distance itself from the U.S., as the U.S. sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North."
2326,"Cambodia: Top E.U. officials visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to consider revoking a special trade deal because of the country’s deteriorating human rights record."
2327,"Russia: A marathon across the frozen surface of Lake Baikal in Siberia attracts runners both for its exotic, ethereal beauty and the unpredictable, grueling conditions. “Baikal prepares new surprises,” said the founder of the race. “That makes it more interesting.”"
2328,"Class divide: Human contact has become a luxury good. Tech-free private schools are booming, and things like quitting social networks have become a status symbol. “The richer you are,” writes our tech reporter, “the more you spend to be offscreen.”"
2329,Tips for a more fulfilling life.
2330,"Recipe of the day: You can always toss roasted broccoli with something delicious, like a Thai-style vinaigrette. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)"
2331,Passion can be a gift or a curse. We have guidance on avoiding obsession as you pursue your most profound interests.
2332,Knees are the body’s most taxed joint. Here are some ways to keep from injuring them.
2333,"Last week, Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The Times, wrote about the strange disparity in New York City’s subway lines, exploring why lettered lines — notably the F — performed particularly badly. We noticed that the subway system skips only a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain."
2334,"The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero."
2335,"There once was an H train — a shuttle line in Rockaway Park, Queens — but in 1992 it was changed to an S for shuttle."
2336,"The K once ran along the C line in Manhattan, but the letter was retired in 1988."
2337,"Once a letter disappears from the map, that doesn’t mean it is gone forever. The W train, between Queens and Manhattan, was axed in 2010 and then reappeared in 2016 as part of new service after the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which diverted the Q train to three new stations on Manhattan’s Upper East Side."
2338,"As for the Z, transit advocates held a funeral for the line amid budget cuts in 2009, but it has survived after all (for now)."

2343,"Shortly after graduating from Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Pa., Melissa Miller returned home to Baltimore and prepared to head to New York to pursue an acting and voice-over career."
2344,"She briefly considered living in Hoboken, N.J., where a friend was moving, until she realized it would make for a three-leg commute to Manhattan — to, on and from the PATH train."
2345,"“I wanted to be in New York City so I could take the subway and be anywhere,” said Ms. Miller, 22. Specifically, she wanted easy access to Times Square, Penn Station and the theater district, where she takes classes and goes to auditions."
2346,"For her new home, her requirements included a doorman, a laundry room and not too many stairs."
2347,"“I wanted to live alone,” she said. “I had too many bad roommate experiences with people I thought I knew.”"
2348,"Unlike some of her friends, she had no nearby relatives to stay with, so she hunted while living briefly with the family of a college friend on Long Island. In mid-fall, with a rental budget of $2,000 a month, she went to see a $1,975 studio in a Murray Hill co-op building that met her criteria. The unit had a main room of around 200 square feet plus pink-bathroom charm."
2349,"“It was exactly what she was looking for: a studio in a lower price range,” said Jessica Flynn, a licensed sales agent at Keller Williams TriBeCa, who showed her the apartment."
2350,"Ms. Miller was ready to sign on. But “her parents wouldn’t let her,” Ms. Flynn said, “because it was the first one she saw.”"
2351,"She continued hunting on her own, unable to find anything suitable: Most places were tiny or far from the subway. So she contacted Ms. Flynn again, this time with a budget of up to $2,250."
2352,"“She needed one of those larger studios, where you feel you’ve found a gem,” Ms. Flynn said."
2353,"Ms. Miller mentioned her interest in the theater district. She liked one spacious studio there, in a condominium building a block from the Broadway musical “Mean Girls.” For $2,300, it included a foyer, a separate kitchen and ample closet space."
2354,"She called her parents on FaceTime and declared, “Welcome to Melissa’s dream house.”"
2355,"But her father objected to the busy neighborhood, teeming with theatergoers."
2356,"“He said, ‘If you can buy pizza for a dollar, you are not in the right neighborhood — they are targeting tourists,’” Ms. Miller said. “He didn’t actually care about the cost of pizza, but there was no sense of community.”"
2357,"She wanted a neighborhood where she could find “a restaurant where people knew me,” she said. “I can take the subway to the theater district, but I don’t have to live there.”"
2358,"She saw more tiny studios west of Times Square and east of Grand Central Terminal. One had a pole in the middle, which she didn’t mind, although she did mind the “micro kitchens.”"
2359,"Heading uptown, Ms. Miller went to see another spacious studio with Ms. Flynn, this one in the West 80s, for $2,450. She applied, only to learn that another application had arrived just minutes earlier. The landlord chose the other person, possibly because it was someone with a regular job and regular hours."
2360,"“Melissa is in and out of the house all the time,” Ms. Flynn said. “They wanted a tenant who wasn’t going to be home and using the space.”"
2361,"On a fifth day of hunting, Ms. Flynn scheduled more places with a dwindling sense of optimism. “This was the last of what was available,” she said, at least until the following month."
2362,"They entered another large studio, in an Upper West Side co-op building, for $2,500. It had a small renovated kitchen with a peninsula, a large closet and three windows overlooking an air shaft. “The second I walked in, I knew it was the one,” Ms. Miller said. “I loved the location, the doormen were friendly, and the people going in and out seemed happy.”"
2363,"The broker’s fee was 15 percent of a year’s rent, or $4,500. She arrived in the fall with the family cat, and furnished the place with pieces from Ikea."
2364,"“It is my first apartment, so it is a really big deal,” said Ms. Miller, one of four siblings. “I am on my own for the first time, living by myself. It’s different when you’re not around your family all the time. You don’t have people you can always go and get a hug from. When I talked to my cat about my problems, she didn’t give me the same advice my parents would give me.”"
2365,"In addition to spotty advice, the cat kept her awake all night, poking and meowing, and was sent back to Baltimore."
2366,"Now Ms. Miller has her neighborhood diner and her neighborhood bank, where people know her. At the nearest pizza place, a slice costs $3."
2367,"“The neighborhood feels really homey,” she said. “There are a lot of families around, and I love to see people walking their dogs.”"
2368,"And like many New Yorkers, she is learning that the apartment is hot inside regardless of how cold the temperature is outside. She had an air-conditioner installed for both winter and summer use. "
2369,"Opening a window helps, but it also lets in noise from nearby construction, especially in the morning. “One site is really close, and I hear everyone yell for this guy named John,” she said."
2370,"Her schedule includes a new job as a waitress — a quick subway ride downtown — and she is seeking babysitting jobs. If acting doesn’t pan out, she plans to study child psychology in graduate school."
2371,"As for her new quarters, “It all worked out,” she said. “I can’t imagine getting anything better for my price range.”"

2375,Good morning.
2376,"Congress finds out what’s in the Mueller report, Thailand’s military appears to have won elections and Brexit continues to confound a nation. Here’s the latest:"
2377,Attorney General William Barr sent lawmakers a summary of the special counsel’s highly anticipated report on Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. The key findings will be made public later today.
2378,"This much is clear: The Mueller report established no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but left it to Mr. Barr to determine whether President Trump's actions constituted obstruction of justice. Mr. Barr found that they did not."
2379,"Our Washington Bureau is assessing the summary in greater detail now, and we’ll be updating the news story linked above and our live briefing."
2380,"Impact: The report’s delivery “marked a turning point that will shape the remainder of Mr. Trump’s presidency and test the viability of American governance,” our chief White House correspondent writes."
2381,"Other investigations: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued no further indictments but federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other inquiries that grew out of his work, meaning President Trump hasn’t yet emerged from a looming legal threat."
2382,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters took over the streets of Central London on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to break the political stalemate and hold a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U."
2383,"Few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote, however, so the march’s main impact may be as a reflection of growing popular frustration over the gridlock."
2384,"What’s next? Officials in the E.U. gave the British Parliament until April 12 to decide what it wants to do, so Brexit will not take effect on March 29, the date set two years ago."
2385,"On the table is Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan. If lawmakers approve it by the E.U. deadline, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22."
2386,"If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a longer delay of possibly two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed all of these options, too."
2387,"Today: Lawmakers are to vote on proposed amendments to Mrs. May’s plan, including one that would allow for a rapid-fire round of voting on alternatives."
2388,"Analysis: Ellen Barry, our London correspondent, looks at how some Brexit supporters have shifted from the original goal of a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. to willingness to walk away from the bloc with no deal at all."
2389,"A military-linked party seemed to have emerged as the winner of parliamentary elections, the country’s first vote since a coup in 2014."
2390,"With about 90 percent of the ballots counted as of Sunday, Palang Pracharat, the military’s proxy party, had 7.5 million votes, the Election Commission said. Pheu Thai, the populist party toppled in the coup, had been widely expected to finish first, but was second with seven million votes."
2391,"The remaining votes will be counted today, but it appears to be the first electoral failure since 2001 of a party aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, the polarizing former prime minister."
2392,"Concerns: More than 5 percent of the ballots were invalidated, raising questions about the integrity of the results. And turnout was 66 percent, lower than the expected 80 percent."
2393,"Democracy activists say the new military-backed Constitution worked in favor of the country’s armed forces, which has orchestrated more than a dozen successful coups over the years. Electoral rules blunted the power of some blocs, and the threat of jail time hung over leaders of anti-junta parties."
2394,"The voting was for the lower house. The new Constitution gives the military the power to appoint all 250 members of the Senate, so its power in Parliament will be overwhelming."
2395,A four-year military operation to push the terrorist group from Iraq and Syria ended on Saturday when American-backed forces took back the last speck of land in the region controlled by the group.
2396,"The end of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, which at its peak was the size of Britain, is a major blow to the group. The group continues to exist, however, as a diffuse insurgency from Afghanistan to the Philippines, and experts say it is more powerful today than it was in 2011, enriched by years of collecting taxes in Iraq and Syria and returning to the guerrilla tactics it used in the past."
2397,"By the numbers: The group has tens of thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria as well as followers around the world. Since last summer, it carried out at least 250 attacks in Syria. ISIS followers have carried out attacks in at least 25 countries since 2017."
2398,"Recruiting: A modern, educated couple in the Philippines became key recruiters for the Islamic State, calling on followers to wage jihad in Muslim parts of the archipelago."
2399,"On the ground: Hours after a U.S.-backed militia announced victory over the Islamic State in Syria, a local driver working with a team of journalists from NBC News was killed in an explosion in the area. It was not immediately clear whether the group had been targeted, or whether previously unexploded ordnance from heavy militia bombing might have been involved."
2400,"Boeing: An investigation by The Times looks into how the aircraft manufacturer rushed to develop the 737 Max 8 to keep American Airlines from ordering hundreds of planes from its rival, Airbus, and how the frenetic pace played out for engineers and construction teams."
2401,"New Zealand: The country banned the so-called manifesto of the man suspected in the Christchurch massacre, making it a crime to possess or distribute the content in an attempt to limit the spread of hateful ideas and foil his desire for notoriety."
2402,"China-E.U. relations: President Xi Jinping secured Italy’s cooperation with his Belt and Road initiative and then headed to France to meet with European leaders, some of whom fear widening internal divisions over China’s increasing reach."
2403,"Cambodia: Top E.U. officials visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to consider revoking a special trading deal because of the country’s deteriorating human rights record."
2404,"North Korea: The country’s state media escalated calls for South Korea to distance itself from the U.S., as the U.S. sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North."
2405,"Norway: A cruise ship stranded for nearly 24 hours by rough weather and engine trouble finally headed to shore, after about a third of the 1,300 people aboard were airlifted, one by one, to safety."
2406,"Coming this week: Apple will unveil its video streaming service on Monday, and Lyft — Uber’s main rival in North America — will make its debut on the stock market on Friday in what could be the tech world’s biggest initial public offering since 2014."
2407,"Russia: A marathon across the frozen surface of Lake Baikal in Siberia was a precarious endeavor through unpredictable and grueling conditions. “Baikal prepares new surprises,” said the founder of the race. “That makes it more interesting.”"
2408,"Perspective: Calling Asian women “adorable,” “cute” or “beautiful” in professional settings is a form of racism that “dresses up its violence in praise,” the author R.O. Kwon argues in an Op-Ed."

2423,To the Editor:
2424,"Re “I Remember When Queens Was Lame,” by Barbara Brotman (Sunday Review, Feb. 17):"
2425,"In college, I can’t say I shouted from the mountaintops that I hailed from Queens. I wasn’t ashamed, but neither was I proud. "
2426,"Back in the day, I remember cutting high school and taking the subway to the Village to experience, if only briefly, a different slice of life. The city was grittier back then, literally with grime and pollution, but also with higher crime or just the sotto voce offers in Washington Square of “Hey, man, want some acid?” "
2427,"But I wouldn’t trade my Queens days for anything. Our unrivaled, however simple, cuisine — arguably the best pizza and bagels in town. Playing ball every day: basketball in the backyard of a friend who was lucky enough to have a hoop; football under Friday night lights in the supermarket parking lot, its stripes used to determine first downs; and baseball in the streets, where we relied on manhole covers, car taillights and the like for bases. "
2428,"And, of course, the great friends, alas too few of whom I’ve kept up with over the years."
2429,"Neil G. BennettStamford, Conn."
2430,"If you see a suspicious package or activity on the train or the platform, please tell a police officer or an M.T.A. employee. What New York subway rider doesn’t know that? A young woman named Frances McCullen — a recent transplant from Boston, as if that’s an excuse — who finds an expensive-looking handbag on the Lexington Avenue local and pays dearly for ignoring mass transit protocol. “Greta,” the movie about what happens to Frankie (as she’s called), can stand as a cautionary tale for straphangers. If you see something, say something."
2431,"Having seen it, I will say that “Greta,” directed by the always-estimable Neil Jordan (“The Crying Game,” “Michael Collins,” “The End of the Affair”), is a mixed bag, a skillfully executed psychological thriller with not quite enough in the way of psychology or thrills to be as disturbing or diverting as it should be. And maybe not enough Isabelle Huppert, either, though she is the major and almost sufficient reason to bother with the film in the first place."
2432,"Huppert plays Greta Hideg, the owner of that purse and a bunch more like it, accessories that she uses to lure young women like Frankie to her house in Brooklyn. Frankie (Chloë Grace Moretz), whose mother has recently died and who is semi-estranged from her father (Colm Feore), finds in the older woman a mirror for her own loneliness. Greta has lost a husband and a dog, and misses her daughter, who she says is off in Paris studying music."
2433,"Greta’s empty nest is filled with Chopin and Liszt and strange noises from behind the piano, and she and Frankie strike up what seems to be a warm intergenerational friendship. Frankie’s roommate, Erica (Maika Monroe, supplying a superfluous but satisfying jolt of bratty energy), thinks it’s a little weird, and of course she turns out to be right. The lady has a cupboard full of identical handbags! Then she goes full stalker, flooding Frankie’s phone with texts and voice mail messages and showing up at the restaurant where Frankie works."
2434,"Frankie is probably too young to have seen “Fatal Attraction,” “Single White Female” or the other madwoman-in-the-city movies of the ’80s and ’90s. “Greta” updates the genre (people have smartphones now) without improving on it much, though the maniac-mommy twist is an interesting wrinkle, adding a sinister fairy-tale element to the modern setting. (It’s hard to hear the title without thinking of Hansel and Gretel, and Greta is distinctly witchy.) But the plot moves a little too quickly from intriguing ambiguity to straight-up terror, without giving Moretz and Huppert enough time to explore the kinks in the characters’ relationship or the temperamental contrast between them."
2435,"Moretz is soft-featured and forthright, her face a blunt register of Frankie’s feelings. Huppert is all angles and shadows, and Greta is a mystery wrapped in an enigma bundled up in a neatly tied package of pure crazy. The script, written by Jordan and Ray Wright, makes a small effort to explain Greta’s mania, or at least to fill in her background — a hapless detective played by Stephen Rea is deployed for that purpose — but understanding what makes her tick is not even remotely the point of the movie."
2436,"The point, and the fun, is the wild mischief of Huppert’s performance, which grows lighter and more joyful as Greta’s behavior slides from menacing to murderous. Jordan contrives to make Huppert’s mere presence in the frame almost absurdly frightening, and Huppert compounds the fright with elegant comedy, so that while the movie is impossible to take seriously, it’s also hard to resist, like an unattended bag on the subway that’s just begging you to look inside."

2438,Good evening. Here’s the latest.
2439,"1. President Trump took his case for a wall to El Paso, where there is one."
2440,His rally was his first event along the border since a debate over funding a wall shut down the government. Negotiations to head off another shutdown appeared to be close to succeeding on Monday night.
2441,"In a twist of political theater, Beto O’Rourke, below, a former Democratic congressman from El Paso and possible presidential candidate, spoke at a rally less than a mile from Mr. Trump’s."
2442,"Ahead of the events, people across the political spectrum in El Paso had a message for the president: Don’t speak for us."
2443,_____
2444,2. “Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes.”
2445,"That was Representative Ilhan Omar, a freshman congresswoman from Minnesota, seen above two weeks ago. She had come under fire from Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the entire House Democratic leadership for insinuating on Twitter that American support for Israel was fueled by money from a pro-Israel lobbying group."
2446,"She did not back away from her contention that the lobbying group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, has too much power in Washington. “At the same time, I reaffirm the problematic role of lobbyists in our politics, whether it be AIPAC, the NRA or the fossil fuel industry,” her statement said."
2447,_____
2448,3. A Virginia Democrat’s push to begin impeachment proceedings against Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax stalled after furious opposition from the party’s black caucus.
2449,"They insist there not be a rush to oust Mr. Fairfax, who is black, over accusations of sexual assault while the state’s white governor and attorney general are refusing to resign after they admitted wearing blackface in their youth."
2450,"Mr. Fairfax entered the legislative building around 11:30 a.m. this morning, made his way to the Senate chambers through a scrum of TV cameras, repeated that he had “called for an independent investigation,” adding: “I am still very confident in the truth.” And went to work, above."
2451,_____
2452,"4. Shrill, abrasive, aloof, unlikable."
2453,Some of the adjectives used to describe Hillary Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign are now bubbling up in uncharted territory: a presidential race featuring six women running for the Democratic nomination.
2454,"Few people admit they would hesitate to vote for a woman for president, but they don’t have to. We took a look at how sexism plays out on the campaign trail."
2455,"And we have closer looks at two senators among the six: Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, above, who joined the race Sunday, and Kamala Harris, whose record as a former district attorney and California attorney general faces a chorus of critics — especially on the left."
2456,_____
2457,5. Assisting the doctor: A.I. 
2458,"In a new study, researchers from universities in the U.S. and China built a highly accurate system that could automatically diagnose common childhood conditions — including influenza and meningitis — after analyzing the patient’s symptoms, medical records, lab results and other clinical data."
2459,"The system used a neural network, a breed of artificial intelligence, to digest the electronic health records from more than 1.3 million patient visits at a pediatric hospital in China. Above, doctors competed against A.I. computers to recognize illnesses during a competition in Beijing last year."
2460,"Able to recognize patterns in data that humans could never identify on their own — and might not be able to understand — A.I. could assist doctors in diagnosing complex conditions, potentially transforming the health care industry and reducing the chances of misdiagnoses."
2461,"In other A.I. news, President Trump signed an executive order meant to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence."
2462,_____
2463,6. Brandi Carlile gave a thrilling performance. Drake showed up (though his acceptance speech got cut off). Alicia Keys was a laid-back host (and deftly played two pianos at once).
2464,"We rounded up the best and worst of the Grammys, according to our music critics. At a ceremony dominated by female performers and presenters, Kacey Musgraves won album of the year for “Golden Hour,” as well as three other awards. Cardi B, above, became the first woman to win best rap album as a solo artist for “Invasion of Privacy.” Here’s the complete list of winners."
2465,"From Cardi B on the half shell to Michelle Obama in a silver lounge suit and a barefoot Alicia Keys, women were front and center, our fashion critic writes. (The embedded slide show has all the red carpet looks.)"
2466,"This year’s award ceremony was perhaps as notable for who didn’t show up as who did, our pop music critic suggests."
2467,_____
2468,"7. The accusations against Óscar Arias Sánchez, a former president of Costa Rica and Nobel laureate, are mounting. Above, Mr. Arias last month."
2469,Yazmín Morales is one of at least nine women who have now come forward with accounts of sexual assault or misconduct.
2470,"Telling her story was hard. Finding a lawyer to take the case was harder, revealing the social and political obstacles facing women in the region when they seek legal recourse, even in Latin America’s most significant #MeToo case."
2471,And our Interpreter column examines why the movement has made little headway in curbing abuses by ordinary men.
2472,_____
2473,"8. For New Yorkers who hate the subway, and anyone who likes to hate New York, this one’s for you."
2474,"A portrait of subway hell in words and images, drawn from commuters’ tweets."
2475,"Accessibility is a key issue. There are 550,000 New York residents who have difficulty walking. Our analysis found that two-thirds of them live far from an accessible subway station."
2476,"And from Tokyo to Zurich, readers told us how New York’s subway compares with the public transportation in their cities (spoiler alert: not well)."
2477,_____
2478,9. “It’s almost like heavenly visual music.”
2479,"That’s Trond Trondsen of Calgary, an expert on the aurora borealis. He grew up in Norway fascinated by the mysterious light display, and he’s not alone. Seeing it has become a must for camera-toting international tourists, whether in Russia, Alaska, Greenland or Scandinavia."
2480,"The sight can prove to be elusive, if ultimately rewarding, our writer found during a trip to northern Sweden, above. “It’s just a matter of waiting for the cosmic show,” she writes."
2481,_____
2482,"10. Finally, we end the day with some very good dogs."
2483,"When we began digitizing six million photos in the Times archive, it quickly became apparent that while people and places changed, the dogs stayed very much the same, providing the kind of reliable delight they now deliver on Instagram scrolls. Above, a man and his dog driving down Fifth Avenue in New York in 1977."
2484,"As the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show kicks off, we assembled a panel of dog fans — from the Times staff to artists and animal trainers — to examine the everlasting obsession. “Dogs are just really pure,” one panelist said."
2485,Good luck to all the groups and breeds! We’ll see you Tuesday night when best in show is awarded.
2486,Have a winning night.

2492,UNDERGROUND A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet By Will Hunt
2493,"A book can often have its greatest impact by rethinking familiar terrain, forcing readers to reconsider their entrenched preconceptions. Sometimes this comes from embracing an unexpected vantage point, as in Howard Zinn’s classic “A People’s History of the United States,” which chronicled American history from the bottom up rather than the top down. The sociologist Sudhir Venkatesh’s work examines the unseen economic and social forces operating all around us; his last book, “Floating City: Hustlers, Strivers, Dealers, Call Girls and Other Lives in Illicit New York,” has forever colored my interactions with the city’s hotel concierges, bartenders and bodega owners."
2494,"Will Hunt taps into our deep fascination with what lies beneath the surface of things by exploring, quite literally, what’s going on beneath the surface. His book, “Underground: A Human History of the Worlds Beneath Our Feet,” delves into the natural and manufactured caves, catacombs, mines and tunnels that dot the globe in both urban and rural settings. Using assorted scientists, tribesmen, urban adventurers and other locals as his guides, Hunt has spent years burrowing into the most storied holes in the grounds."
2495,"In following his journey — from New York’s subways to the Parisian catacombs and from Australian ochre mines to the prehistoric caves of the French Pyrenees — it soon becomes clear that Hunt is less interested in what he actually finds underground than in his own obsession with this dark world. Yes, we encounter plenty of graffiti, cave paintings, stalactites, subterranean creatures and remnants of religious rituals. But “Underground” is most concerned with understanding the fixation, shared by humans for millenniums, with these hidden realms."
2496,"The connections Hunt makes — for instance, between his own experience as a teenager exploring an abandoned train tunnel in Providence, R.I., and a young Mexican man who discovered the walled sanctuary within the ancient Mayan Balankanche cave — sometimes feel strained. Similarly, some of his sweeping conclusions (for instance, that “our connection to caves may well be our most universal, most deeply inscribed, perhaps our original religious tradition”) seem overblown. That said, if not taken too seriously, Hunt’s musings on our relationship to the underground world, drawing on literary, academic and mythological sources, are both provocative and satisfying."
2497,"The real pleasure of “Underground,” however, is not to be found in its philosophical reflections. Rather it is in simply following Hunt on his quest, meeting those he encounters along the way and learning about those who came before. Whether attempting to traverse the entire six-mile length of Paris underground (spoiler alert: He doesn’t quite pull it off), tracking down the mysterious New York subway graffiti artist who over six years produced 235 large autobiographical panels in the tunnels, or profiling the original entrepreneurs who figured out subterranean photography and mapmaking, Hunt proves an able chaperone."
2498,"At the end of your excursion through “Underground,” you are unlikely to partake in Hunt’s longtime obsession. But you may never look at a hole in the ground in quite the same way again."
2499, [Want to get New York Today by email? Here's the sign-up.]
2500,It’s Thursday. A dog on the tracks on the Williamsburg Bridge delayed subways for over an hour last night.
2501,Alternate-side parking: in effect till Jan. 21.
2502,Maybe we should call it the Soggy Apple. New York City just experienced its fourth-wettest year on record.
2503,"In 2018, 65.55 inches of precipitation fell in Central Park, according to the National Weather Service. That’s more than 15 inches, or 31 percent, above normal."
2504,This is part of a broader pattern caused by global warming. The Northeast is getting wetter; the Pacific Northwest is getting drier; and the South is getting hotter.
2505,"Out of the 149 years of weather data collected at Central Park, the 10 wettest have all happened since 1972."
2506,To put it another way: New York City’s wettest years all occurred since “The Godfather” hit movie theaters.
2507,Weren’t around for that movie? Try this: five of New York City’s 10 wettest years have taken place since 2003 — when the first “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie was on the big screen.
2508,Not that excess wetness is a consistent phenomenon — the three years before 2018 were all unusually dry. But the overall trend is real.
2509,"How does global warming fit in? Warmer air can hold more moisture. And if that warmer air is holding more moisture, it can drop more moisture."
2510,"And if you think all that moisture is coming down nice and easy, think again."
2511,"Precipitation is coming in “big, flood-producing events, extreme events,” said Jessica Spaccio, a climatologist at the Northeast Regional Climate Center at Cornell University."
2512,“We’re seeing a lot of precipitation coming down quickly and not so evenly spread throughout the year.”
2513,"The on-the-ground effects of all that stuff falling from the sky include overwhelmed irrigation systems producing pollution-carrying runoff (yuck) and washed-out streets, Ms. Spaccio said."
2514,"And, based on my own scientific research: Everybody forgets how to drive, subway stations get flooded and sidewalks fill with people carrying obnoxiously large umbrellas."
2515,Meteorologists at the National Weather Service were not available to comment because they’re dealing with their own problem: a government shutdown.
2516,"Today, however, the rain is taking a day off. Skies will clear, with a high of 47. But it returns on Saturday."
2517,Here’s what else is happening:
2518,Showtime at the Apollo: The history of the legendary theater is told in a new graphic novel.

2520,"Illegal silicone injection proves fatal: An unlicensed, self-styled plastic surgeon was charged with manslaughter."
2521,"$400 million, and counting: Ridership on the Port Authority’s PATH train is up, but it is losing money."

2535,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
2536,The L train shutdown is not funny. But it is a game.
2537,"More than $3,000 has been raised on Kickstarter for the creation of Escape from HelL, a “board game about getting to Manhattan from Williamsburg once the L train shuts down.”"
2538,"How it works: As in Chutes and Ladders, players roll dice and move around the board to reach a destination."
2539,"In Escape, each player is a hipster in Bushwick trying to get to work in Manhattan. Since the L is not running, players have to rely on buses, ferries, bikes and cabs."
2540,Along the way are cards of chance.
2541,For example:
2542,Move back three spaces because “Your ex is the other person in your carshare. You open the door and jump out.”
2543,Another card: “Your SoulCycle sweat looks like you peed yourself. Go back and change clothes.”
2544,Go back two spaces because “You finally got on the J/M/Z but your subway car only has one person on it. And it smells like a toilet.”
2545,"The board is colorfully decorated, with ride-sharing bikes, a graffiti mural and a bridge. (The song about the game is pretty catchy, too.)"
2546,The L train shutdown starts in April and is expected to last 15 months.
2547,"Unlike the train, the board game is moving ahead without problems. It will be delivered to Kickstarter supporters next month, according to Hunter Fine, a co-creator."
2548,"If games are left over, Mr. Fine said he would try to sell them, possibly in subway stations."
2549,Dear Diary:
2550,"It was summer 2001, and my mother and I were having lunch at the Cupping Room in SoHo."
2551,"“That guy over at that table is the one who wouldn’t pitch on Yom Kippur,” my mother said out of nowhere."
2552,What would Sandy Koufax be doing here? I replied.
2553,"A few minutes later, the man she was referring to got up from his table and walked past the one where we were sitting."
2554,“Are your initials S.K.?” my mother said without hesitating.
2555,"“Yes,” he said before continuing on his way."
2556,I don’t know what amazed me more: seeing Sandy Koufax or my mother recognizing him.

2561,"Noted in “Cuomo’s L-Train Save Resembles Plan Rejected Earlier by the M.T.A.” (news article, Jan. 16) are disagreements among world-class engineers over safety of the subway tunnel during and after repairs."
2562,"This highlights what we professionals and oversight agencies know and suffer silently to remain in operation: Planning and design are subject to political and economic interests of our clients that bend, stretch — even break — sound judgments."
2563,"Risks of this practice are cloaked in smooth-talking rationales to satisfy agendas beyond professionals’ control. To avoid professional suicide, it’s best to hold tongues."
2564,"Concealed high risk has become inherent in New York City structures, new and repaired. Imagine who is left holding the bag when disaster strikes: those who are licensed to assure the safety of the public."
2565,John YoungDeborah NatsiosNew YorkThe writers are architects.
2566,"There is a lot to like in New York State’s $175 billion budget. Democrats, in commanding control of the Legislature for the first time in a half-century, agreed on Sunday on sweeping changes that had been blocked for years when Republicans ran the State Senate."
2567,"New York City will become the first city in the country with congestion pricing, securing crucial funding for the subways in a long-delayed victory for mass transit over the automobile."
2568,"Bail and pretrial detention will be eliminated for a vast majority of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, and prosecutors will have to turn over far more of their case files to defense lawyers before trial."
2569,"Single-use plastic bags will be banned, putting New York in line with California and environmentally conscious cities and counties that have long had this common-sense measure. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislators killed New York City’s effort to ban the bags in 2017."
2570,"One thing that hasn’t changed is the way the state budget is completed: behind closed doors, in the middle of the night, with the governor and legislative leaders slipping in all manner of surprises and pork."
2571,"Chief among the victims of Albany deal-making this year was public financing of election campaigns, which would give candidates matching funds to make it easier for challengers to run and to empower small donors."
2572,"Facing opposition from many Assembly members, legislative leaders and Mr. Cuomo punted, creating a new commission to fashion a plan instead. The budget requires the state to establish the public financing system but leaves critically important details to the commission, which will be made up of nine members appointed by Mr. Cuomo and senior lawmakers. It is to issue recommendations for the new system by Dec. 1. Those proposals will go into effect Dec. 22 unless a law is enacted before that date to block the plan."
2573,"The commission could succeed — but only if Mr. Cuomo; Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader; and Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, move swiftly to appoint independent and knowledgeable people to the panel."
2574,"To make the system useful for first-time candidates, it will also have to offer a substantial match for small-donor contributions. New York City’s public financing system, for example, offers a candidate $8 for every dollar raised."
2575,Other provisions touted as major victories came with asterisks.
2576,"The congestion pricing agreement, under which cars will pay tolls for entering the busiest part of Manhattan, directs 80 percent of the revenue raised to the subways, where it is most needed. But the plan left unclear how much sway New York City, as opposed to Albany, will have over how the program is run."
2577,"The budget includes a $1 billion increase in education funding — but advocates said state leaders yet again failed to address the inequity in funding to New York City districts, the subject of a 20-year-plus court battle."
2578,"Legislators approved a transfer tax on the sale of homes worth more than $2 million, with a sliding scale up to 4.15 percent for homes worth $25 million or more. The legislators agreed on the tax after scrapping what would have been a more lucrative, annual tax on thousands of those properties, known as the pied-à-terre tax, after an intense campaign from the real estate industry."
2579,"In an eyebrow-raising move, Mr. Cuomo gutted the independence of the Public Authorities Control Board — the body that had the ability to reject the deal for Amazon to build a major complex in Queens — by allowing the governor to remove any board members he decides have acted beyond their powers. "
2580,"Still, despite the messy way the budget was passed, it came with real gains."
2581,"Public defenders, for instance, say that its criminal justice reforms will keep tens of thousands of people who are charged with nonviolent crimes from languishing in jail before they get a trial. The reforms were inspired in large part by cases like that of Kalief Browder, who spent three years at the city jail in Rikers Island without trial for allegedly stealing a backpack. The charges were eventually dismissed. Two years later, Mr. Browder committed suicide."
2582,"Justine Olderman, executive director of the Bronx Defenders, a legal aid group, said the reforms enacted by Albany were the most promising she had seen in a 20-year career and could turn the state into a leader in criminal justice. "

2584,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
2585,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
2586,"“You have to be tough to make it in New York City,” Mayor Bill de Blasio boasted, choosing to jeer at Amazon as it canceled its plans on Thursday to build a new headquarters in Queens, after some local officials angrily criticized its proposal. "
2587,"What a strange thing for the mayor to take pride in. It’s certainly true that you have to be tough these days. But that’s because the subways don’t work, the streets are gridlocked, the housing is unaffordable, the shelters are overcrowded, and the schools are segregated and often inadequate. Now think how much tougher it’ll become for the typical citizen — not the ones who ride in chauffeured government cars — if New York gets a reputation for the smugness of its politicians and their hostility to business. "
2588,"There were all sorts of problems with the deal New York cut to bring Amazon to the city, and Amazon is no paragon, but its abrupt withdrawal was a blow to New York, which stood to gain 25,000 jobs and an estimated $27 billion in tax revenue over the next two decades. This embarrassment to the city presents a painful lesson in how bumper-sticker slogans and the hubris of elected — and corporate — officials can create losers on all sides."
2589,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, in a rare fit of comity, rolled out the red carpet for Amazon, for what would have been one of the biggest economic deals ever in the state. They offered the company $3 billion in tax benefits to build a campus in the Long Island City neighborhood. But it was clear as soon as the company, governor and mayor announced the deal in November that not all New Yorkers felt welcoming. "
2590,"Politicians and activists had good reason to criticize the size of the tax breaks and the secrecy of the negotiations. After years of rapid development in New York that has come with soaring real estate prices, many rightly feared Amazon’s arrival could accelerate already costly gentrification. "
2591,"Things quickly got out of hand, though, and reasonable criticism of the deal was overwhelmed by opposition to the company itself, even as polls showed wide support for Amazon’s move to Queens. Elected officials who identify as progressive painted Amazon as a rapacious engine of inequality. It seemed that few were interested in having a constructive conversation about how to improve the deal and make it work for the tech giant and the city."
2592,"Some berated the company’s executives in a City Council hearing and at rallies. That kind of tough talk is par for the course in “if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere” New York. But in grandstanding, they missed an opportunity to try to get the company to help address housing and infrastructure problems that the development, for all its benefits, would exacerbate. Perhaps they thought the city’s pool of skilled workers and many other attractions made it so irresistible that there was no need to negotiate."
2593,"“We have the best talent in the world, and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone,” the mayor said. “If Amazon can’t recognize what that’s worth, its competitors will.” Because, you know, Amazon’s competitors have a great track record of seeing the future more clearly than Jeff Bezos."
2594,"Last week, the State Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, nominated a critic of the deal, Senator Michael Gianaris, to a state board that had veto power over it. Mr. Gianaris, who represents the district where the campus would have been located, had legitimate concerns over the arrangement and wanted more investment from Amazon in the city. Though his staff was engaged in discussions with Amazon, he refused even to meet with anyone from the company. His appointment could only have helped Amazon decide to call New York’s bluff. The governor seems to think so."
2595,"“The New York State Senate has done tremendous damage,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement on Thursday. “They should be held accountable for this lost economic opportunity.” He’s got a point."
2596,"Blame also needs to be assigned, of course, to a system in which powerful corporations can milk billions in tax benefits out of cities and states to locate facilities, without any added investment in infrastructure, schools and other benefits. Amazon, one of the richest companies in the world, run by the richest man in the world, had held a nationwide contest in which governments scraped together enough entitlements to satisfy it, even as those same cities struggled to fortify corroding infrastructure and stave off a housing crisis that has pushed the middle class to the brink and forced the poor into homeless shelters. "
2597,"Amazon’s initial offerings to New York — like a $5 million commitment to work force development — were meager. The company displayed arrogance of its own and seemed to have little respect for greater public scrutiny and review, and little interest in salvaging the deal once it became vulnerable. "
2598,"Mssrs. Cuomo and de Blasio should have better prepared for what was in store, since their constituents are maybe more worried about housing, subways and the cost of living than in job creation alone. In fact, it’s partly thanks to the failure of these elected leaders to seriously address the subway and housing crises that Amazon was met by some with such visceral anger and anxiety. If they’d better anticipated that reaction, they might have worked with the company to address these issues, and win local buy-in before things went off the rails. Then, together with Amazon, they could have helped the city diversify its economy and leverage the power of a tech giant to help solve big problems. It’s an opportunity lost. May it also be a lesson learned."
2599,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
2600,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
2601,"Do you notice things on the ground when you walk? Have you ever seen anything interesting, valuable or strange?"
2602,"Did you ever keep something that you found on the street? Conversely, have you ever lost something that was important to you? Did anyone try to return it?"
2603,Look through the article’s photos of things people have lost on the street: Which is the most intriguing?
2604,"In “A Mitten, a Key, a Unicorn: Did You Drop Something?” Sara Barrett writes:"
2605,A lot of life in New York takes place on the street. We carry our crumpled laundry down the block to the dry cleaner; we push overloaded strollers to the playground; we grab a slice of pizza on the way to the subway after a long day at work.
2606,"Our backpacks and briefcases are weighted with laptops and water bottles, reading glasses, lipstick, a change of clothes for the gym. One hand (the other is always holding a phone) has to juggle, balance, point, clutch, smooth, zip. And that means we drop a lot of stuff."
2607,"Last winter on the way to work I noticed a child’s glove on the sidewalk, lying as if placed intentionally in the grid of cement squares. After that I began to notice other lost items. I liked the way the objects were framed by the crosswalk stripes, the cracked asphalt, the black dots of sidewalk gum, and I began to photograph them."
2608,"It’s surprising how quickly things appear and disappear. A large stuffed unicorn, on the curb near a yogurt store on Amsterdam Avenue in the late evening had been collected by the time I returned to shoot it in the morning. I saw a red book perfectly set against an orange traffic cone on my way to get a coffee and five minutes later I had the coffee but the book was gone. Doormen constantly sweep papers and cigarettes and other haphazardly discarded objects out of view."
2609,"Once, walking to the street from the subway, I heard shouting. “Your wallet! Your wallet! MISS! YOUR WALLET!” The young woman attached to earbuds acknowledged the exasperated good Samaritan — but only for a second and not long enough for a photo. She scooped up her wallet and returned it to her purse with the precision and efficiency of a shortstop making a double play."
2610,Not long ago I was bent over photographing some French fries.
2611,"A friend happened to walk by and, after I explained what I was doing, told me about being outside of Whole Foods one Thanksgiving when a man was carrying out a large tray for what appeared to be a family dinner — turkey, stuffing, cranberry dressing, mashed potatoes, cornbread, brussels sprouts, pie, the works — and dropped it. Splat, on the ground, food everywhere. Now, that would have been a good photo."

2614,— What is the dearest thing you have ever lost? Tell us what it was and how you felt after you discovered it was lost?
2615,"— Have you ever tried to return something you found on the street? If so, why? Has anyone ever returned something you dropped or lost in public? How did that make you feel?"
2616,"— Which photo is most interesting, intriguing or strangely beautiful? Tell us why? If you are inspired, write a short story or poem about one of the objects. Who dropped them? Why? How did they feel when they realized it was gone?"
2617,"— The author writes, “The city’s streets can seem like an open-air lost and found.” What can we learn about humans — their behavior, their values, their lives — from what they lose?"

2619,"In 2012, Superstorm Sandy infiltrated the Canarsie Tunnel, which carries the L train under the East River between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Seven million gallons of corrosive saltwater damaged the tube structure, the tracks and ties, and signal and other electrical equipment."
2620,"The repairs needed on the tunnel are extensive, and the engineering plans to make it more resilient in future storms are complex and took considerable time to develop. "
2621,"The solution identified by the engineers and consultants of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who have expertise with both subways and under-river tunnels, was designed to evaluate the integrity of the tunnel and produce a permanent fix. That project, involving shutting down the tunnel for 15 months, was supposed to begin in April."
2622,"Last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that he was recommending an alternate plan of action for the Canarsie Tunnel. That plan calls for hanging cables from straps on the tunnel walls instead of embedding them in the benchwall itself, and using a fiberglass polymer to repair the wall, among other recommendations. The plan suggests the tunnel could be fixed without shutting down service."
2623,"As the former president of New York City Transit — a part of the M.T.A. responsible for the city’s buses and subways — and someone who witnessed firsthand the level of destruction and its impact on subway infrastructure as a result of Superstorm Sandy, I am concerned that the decision to change course on the Canarsie Tunnel project is premature and uninformed. This new plan has not been fully evaluated in terms of costs, available M.T.A. resources and, most important, safety."
2624,"Nor am I aware that the technology recommended to repair the benchwall has ever been used in an under-river environment. As president of New York City Transit, I would have found this new course of action completely unacceptable."
2625,"It is totally understandable that for those living in the communities affected, this news is wildly popular, as it will allow for trains to run through the tunnel during construction. However, since transit engineers were not consulted as part of this new plan, the lack of in-depth knowledge of what’s at stake leaves me concerned for the future safety and reliability of this under-river tunnel."
2626,"The decision to reconstruct the tunnel after the storm was not made lightly. Transit leadership and the M.T.A. board knew the effects on the community would be extraordinarily difficult. We looked at every possibility before deciding to shut down the entire tube. We modeled numerous operation and construction scenarios short of a total shutdown, but all had significant safety and operational concerns and fell well short of a long-term fix."
2627,"Believe me, transit decision makers would have seized on a viable solution that would have accomplished the task and still allowed for adequate and safe train service — but that solution did not materialize. While a total shutdown is painful to the community and businesses alike, the pain was measured in months rather than years, and safety and the long-term viability of the tunnel were at the center of that decision."
2628,"While I respect the knowledge of the team the governor brought together to give this a fresh look, the proposed plan falls far short in so many ways, especially regarding safety. How can this decision be made without a hazard assessment? "
2629,"A list of important questions to be reviewed needs to include the following: What are the risks to employees and customers should a fire occur or if a train needs to be evacuated? What impact will the new plan have on maintenance in the years ahead? Does it even meet industry standards for the United States? Without a hazard assessment, we cannot answer those critical questions."
2630,"Keep in mind this is a subterranean environment well below the East River. Even in the best conditions, under-river tubes present some of the greatest operational and engineering challenges to transit leaders. In confined spaces like these, in a tube that is nearly a mile long, ventilation is complicated, and emergency egress is more difficult, with passengers and employees having to travel longer distances to safety in a compromised environment. The space is also narrow, making it difficult for employees to work. "
2631,"There is no room for error when it comes to the lives of our customers and employees, and every decision needs to be carefully evaluated."
2632,"While many details about the new plan have not been made public, on its surface, this new approach appears to be a Band-Aid that does not fundamentally address the long-term structural needs of the tube. The result? We’ll be right back here in the same situation in 10 to 20 years, when customers will have to endure additional service disruptions and taxpayers will have to foot the bill for work that should have been done now."
2633,I believe this decision illustrates politics colliding with sound leadership and management. In several years those associated with this decision will be gone and transit leadership and the community will be living with this decision for decades. This is a decision we could live to regret.

2636,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
2637,"On Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, presented his vision for the coming year, a spectacle accompanied by predictable standing ovations and a 353-page briefing book. It was the ninth such address for Mr. Cuomo, and as in every year before, it was chockablock with dozens of ideas, goals and proposals, ranging from making marijuana legal to banning revenge pornography to allowing people to place bets on sporting events in four casinos upstate. "
2638,"Unlike in past years, however, when the divided Statehouse made big chunks of the State of the State address a pipe dream, the newly elected Democratic-controlled State Legislature puts the governor’s agenda much closer to becoming reality. "
2639,"“It’s just us,” as the governor put it. “We are in control."""
2640,"What, exactly, will that control bring? That depends on whom you ask. Here’s a look at what 2019 in New York may look like, as told by the governor’s speech, his colleagues in the Legislature and history. "
2641,"Less than two years ago, Governor Cuomo was warning that marijuana was “a gateway drug,” a “Reefer Madness”-style condemnation that put him out of step with a national trend toward the acceptance of cannabis as both medicine and recreational hobby. "
2642,"On Tuesday, however, it seemed his evolution was complete, as he touted the potential economic benefits of legalization (some $300 million per year in tax revenue by 2024) as well as its ability to support programs in poor communities. "
2643,"Still, legal sales would not be sanctioned until next year at the earliest, and would come festooned with a variety of rules and regulations, including no sales to anyone under 21 and an ability for any county or city to opt out of the program. (That the governor still wants strict controls is not surprising; when he signed a law legalizing medical marijuana in 2014, it was roundly criticized as being too restrictive, including a ban on smoking the drug.) "
2644,"Well, Mr. Cuomo was largely a centrist for much of his political career but has undeniably banked left in recent years. And Tuesday’s presentation was a veritable all-you-can-pass progressive buffet, with plans to strengthen rent regulation, extend a tax on high earners, ban single-use plastic shopping bags, reform cash bail, protect the coast from offshore drilling, combat the Trump administration at every last possible …"
2645,You get the idea. 
2646,"There are a few theories about that liberal tilt: He has always been a secret progressive, thwarted by a Republican Senate (which he was all too willing to work with for eight years); he has been secretly scared to the left by last year’s primary challenge by Cynthia Nixon (whom he handily dispatched in September); he is secretly running for president and knows the Democratic Party may be in the market for a pure-at-heart firebrand who can back up rhetoric with accomplishments (Mr. Cuomo has repeatedly denied wanting the top job in Washington)."
2647,"Regardless, it would be tough to say that Mr. Cuomo isn’t embracing his inner liberal, at least for the moment, particularly with plans to eliminate all fossil fuels and make the state 100 percent carbon free by 2040, as part of an idea known as the “Green New Deal.” It is an idea also trumpeted by none other than Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, another New York Democrat. "
2648,"If many of Mr. Cuomo’s proposals sounded familiar, that’s because they are."
2649,"The governor’s vows to introduce early voting and close a campaign finance loophole were already passed by the State Senate and Assembly on Monday, the first legislative accomplishments of the new year; all that is left is for Mr. Cuomo to sign them. But you wouldn’t have known that from Mr. Cuomo’s speech, as he didn’t mention those milestones at all."
2650,"Many of these proposals are also old hat for the Assembly, a fact that was not lost on its leader, Carl E. Heastie, who diplomatically noted that “a lot of these ideas have long been introduced by members.” Indeed, even before the governor spoke, legislative leaders had said they would pass a bill to codify Roe v. Wade early next week, a concept that the governor made a central part of his “women’s agenda” on Tuesday. "
2651,Note: Mr. Cuomo also pushed for a “women’s agenda” last year. 
2652,"One of Mr. Cuomo’s biggest pushes this year will be to put into effect a congestion pricing plan, which would use a fee on drivers who enter the busiest parts of Manhattan to fund the city’s flailing subway system. That plan could generate $15 billion for the subway system over 10 years."
2653,"The same idea died last year, when legislators outside of Manhattan rejected it as unfair to their constituents. This time, those legislators have said they need to see details before they make up their minds. For now, they will have to keep waiting. A bill from the governor’s office on Tuesday provided only the plan’s organizational mechanism: The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, an arm of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would set the tolls, which would apply to certain roads, bridges or tunnels in or entering Manhattan south of 60th Street."
2654,"Those very rough parameters sound similar to the proposal put forward last year; at the time, a task force convened by Mr. Cuomo recommended that cars pay $11.52, trucks pay $25.34, and taxis and for-hire vehicles pay a surcharge of $2 to $5 per ride for entering the congestion zone."
2655,"Even if the proposal does go through, it will not be enough to meet all of the M.T.A.’s capital needs, which could be as high as $60 billion. Mr. Cuomo has promised to make up the rest by splitting the tab with the city — a proposal Mayor Bill de Blasio has panned."
2656,"In other words, the subway system’s problems aren’t going away any time soon."
2657,Better pump the brakes. 
2658,"If there was one phrase that was heard again and again in Albany on Tuesday, it was “the devil’s in the details.” Speeches and promises are nice enough, but real bills that make real laws are usually the result of days, months and sometimes years of negotiations by lawmakers and vetting by lawyers. (Oh yes, and lobbying by lobbyists, who may also face new oversight under a proposal by Mr. Cuomo.) "
2659,There are also some troubling economic signs — tax receipts slumped in recent weeks — and the potential for intraparty conflicts among all those Democrats. 
2660,"Still, for one day at least, Mr. Cuomo seemed sanguine and dismissive of any suggestions that there could be friction between himself and his legislative counterparts."
2661,"“The tension is how much can we get done to make the state better,” Mr. Cuomo said before making his speech. “And it’s a positive tension.” "
2662,"The Muslim college student was on the New York City subway when three men snatched her bag, reached for her hijab and called her a terrorist. A Houston sixth grader was kidnapped and robbed by a band of young white supremacists, one with an “I hate black people” tattoo on his arm. And on one of the coldest nights of the year in Chicago, Jussie Smollett, a black and gay actor, was attacked by two men who shouted “MAGA Country” and slipped a noose around his neck."
2663,"The three victims reported these horrific assaults to the police as hate crimes, all built on America’s race, religion and sexual identity fault lines. Except the police say the incidents never happened."
2664,"Mr. Smollett’s dramatic tale of a hate-fueled assault by Trump supporters last month was pure fiction, according to the Chicago police, a calculated stunt to generate publicity and a higher salary for his role on the show “Empire.” On Thursday, the actor was arrested on a felony charge of having filed a false police report."
2665,"Despite the headlines that have dominated the news cycle since, fake hate crime reports are uncommon."
2666,"Hoaxes are not tracked formally, but the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, said that of an estimated 21,000 hate crime cases between 2016 and 2018, fewer than 50 reports were found to be false. The center believes that less than 1 percent of all reported hate crimes are false."
2667,"But such false reports can play an outsize role in undermining the credibility of real bias victims and anti-hate efforts. In the aftermath of Mr. Smollett’s arrest, one lawmaker has even promised to draft a bill increasing the penalty for filing false hate crime reports."
2668,"“Devastating is how I would describe this Smollett story, especially during this legislative season when some states are trying to pass hate crime reform bills,” said Brian Levin, a national hate crime expert and the California center’s director. “This has the potential to eclipse the real facts about hate crimes.”"
2669,"In the six weeks after Donald J. Trump’s election, hate crime reports spiked to their highest number in more than a decade, according to the center. Mr. Levin, whose research draws from news media reports, counted nine false hate crime claims in this period, most detailing pro-Trump signs and symbolism."
2670,"Among those cases was the one in 2016 reported by Yasmin Seweid, 18, the young woman on the New York City subway who told the police that she was the victim of an anti-Islamic assault. She said the attackers yelled “Donald Trump.” But within weeks, Ms. Seweid admitted that she had made up the story, reportedly to cover for a night of drinking with friends. She was charged with filing a false report, a misdemeanor in New York State."
2671,"As with the Smollett case, the sensational elements of the story — a young Muslim woman cornered, harassed and followed — became fodder for the news media."
2672,"“These kinds of rare cases do damage, especially in the current hostile political environment,” said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “They are seized upon and used to try to discredit legitimate anti-Muslim incidents or used to say there is no such thing as a hate crime.”"
2673,"Mr. Hooper said his group received 2,000 to 3,000 bias reports annually before verification, and “less than a handful” were deemed false each year."
2674,"Cynthia Deitle spent more than 20 years as an F.B.I. special agent in the civil rights unit, focused on hate crimes and police brutality. As the director of programs and operations at the Matthew Shepard Foundation, she said the most common motivation behind the false hate crime reports that she had investigated was the desire for attention and sympathy."
2675,"“They felt that being labeled a ‘hate crime victim’ would be a positive result,” Ms. Deitle said. “The cases I examined took place in a workplace environment and at residences, and sometimes the allegation was made to draw attention away from a real negative aspect of the complainant’s life, like poor performance at work or school, or a feeling that the complainant was not getting the attention she or he deserved.”"
2676,"In Mr. Smollett’s telling of the Chicago attack, he was leaving a Subway restaurant in the Streeterville neighborhood when two masked men attacked him around 2 a.m. He said they called him homophobic and racial slurs and slung a rope around his neck. Even by hate crime standards, the story of an assault on a celebrity seemed shocking, and garnered relentless attention."
2677,"But it wasn’t long before the story collapsed. Questions, inconsistencies and a lack of evidence chipped away at Mr. Smollett’s version of events. He steadfastly pushed back at doubters, even appearing on “Good Morning America,” where he passionately proclaimed his innocence and questioned why anyone would make up a hate crime. “You do such a disservice when you lie about things like this,” Mr. Smollett told Robin Roberts."
2678,"According to some experts, the motivation behind filing false hate crime reports may be more than just getting attention."
2679,"“As a community we have to say this is unacceptable, because it’s wrong and dangerous and puts others at risk,” said Kelly Champion, a clinical and forensic psychologist specializing in trauma and anxiety. And, she added, Mr. Smollett “may have been under so much stress that we don’t know about that this seemed like an effective solution” to his problems."
2680,"By the end of the week, the police had built their own narrative. They announced that Mr. Smollett had staged the assault, hiring two brothers for $3,500. They said he was also responsible for sending himself a threatening letter. Both acts were done to promote his career, they contend. The felony charge carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison."
2681,"Mr. Smollett’s legal team has denied the claims made by the police. “He wants nothing more than to clear his name,” said Jack Prior, one of his lawyers."
2682,"In the wake of the Smollett case, State Representative Nick Zerwas, a Minnesota Republican, said that he planned to introduce legislation this session increasing the penalty for falsely reporting a hate crime. The announcement was met with pushback from Democrats."
2683,"Representative Ryan Winkler, the Democratic majority leader, called Mr. Zerwas’s proposal “grandstanding on a high-profile news story.”"
2684,"“If you were to pass a bill, you would create a chilling effect. If anything, people underreport these kinds of crimes,” Mr. Winkler said. “This idea is going in the opposite direction. We should be encouraging people to report.”"

2748,"STOCKHOLM — Footage of security officers dragging a pregnant black woman off a Stockholm subway train and pinning her to a bench has caused an outcry in Sweden, raising questions about the treatment of minorities in a country often seen as a beacon of tolerance."
2749,"Two security guards have been suspended and the police have begun an investigation into the encounter, officials said."
2750,"Footage showed the woman shouting in protest and a child crying as the episode unfolded. The video was widely shared on social media, with many Swedes complaining that a black woman had been unfairly targeted. Some expressed shock that the child had been left crying while the woman was being overpowered by the guards."
2751,"Many asked whether the guards, who appeared to be white, would have forcibly removed a pregnant white woman from the subway."
2752,"Henrik Palmer, a media officer for the Stockholm public transport authority, said on Sunday that the woman had been accused of traveling without a valid ticket and had grown angry when given a fine and asked to leave the train."
2753,"When she refused, he said, security officers took hold of her arm. “That is when the tumult started,” Mr. Palmer said, adding that her removal involved “the very disturbing consequence of her being pushed down on a bench.”"
2754,"In the footage, she is shown having an argument with security guards, then being dragged off the train and held down."
2755,A bystander can be heard saying: “Take it easy. She’s pregnant. Leave her alone.”
2756,"The woman was later taken by ambulance to Huddinge Hospital, where she spent the night, officials said."
2757,"The police said they were looking into charges of misconduct against the security guards, as well as charges of “violent resistance” by the woman against a public servant."
2758,"Sweden, once one of the most welcoming of nations for immigrants and long considered “a moral superpower,” as the political scientist Lars Tragardh put it, has experienced a rise in anti-immigration sentiment amid increasing globalization, immigration and anxiety about national and cultural identity."
2759,"The episode occurred days after a prominent TV investigative program reported on racial profiling in Sweden. TV4’s “Kalla Fakta” spoke with about 100 Swedes with foreign backgrounds who said they had been stopped, checked and treated by the police in a disparaging and condescending way."
2760,"John Stauffer, chief legal counsel with the Stockholm-based Civil Rights Defenders, said by phone that ethnic profiling was widespread. The rights group published a report on the issue in 2017, showing that people were being stopped, questioned and controlled."
2761,"“We can see that people experience being profiled on a daily basis and in everyday situations, such as on the subway system, on the way to work and school, moving around in public places,” he said."
2762,"Interviews on Sunday with the woman — who insisted on being identified only by her given name, Jeanine, because she feared for her safety — and with others revealed that she is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo and worked at a beauty salon."
2763,"She said that she had been on her way to the hospital with her 5-year-old daughter on Thursday evening because she was having contractions. She said she had her travel card with her at the time but could not find it. By the time she pulled it from her pocket, she said, the ticket controller had already issued a fine."
2764,"“I took the fine and threw it on the ground,” she said. “I was angry at myself for losing the card.” That’s when the ticket controller said she had to leave the train."
2765,"“I said, ‘Why do I have to get out?’” she said. “I wanted to go to the hospital because I was in pain.”"
2766,"When the train car stopped at Hotorget Station, she said, security guards arrived and pulled her from the car. When they took hold of her, she said, she started to panic."
2767,"“They took me by the arm very hard,” she said. “They forced me out. They put me on the bench, with my stomach down. One of them put their knee on my back and I lost my breath."
2768,“I was afraid that my baby was going to die in my belly.”
2769,"One witness, Francisca Infante, 42, a human resources manager, said that she had been sitting nearby when the argument began."
2770,"“She raised her voice and she moved her arms — and that is all that was needed for them to take a police grip on her,” Ms. Infante said by phone. She said that the guards “pressed her and her stomach against the edge of the bench and pushed with all their weight.”"
2771,"“I don’t know why she reacted like that,” Ms. Infante said. “But if they had more than two weeks’ training they would know that humans react in different ways.”"
2772,"Asked whether she believed that she had been profiled, Jeanine said: “I don’t think a white woman would have to go through this. I was treated like an animal.”"
2773,"Lovette Jallow, a blogger and social justice activist who lectures about racial profiling, collected testimony from witnesses and posted videos of the guards’ tactics on social media."
2774,"“They are not meant to remove you,” Ms. Jallow said. “They can do that with drunk people. They can do that with violent people. They do not know her background.”"
2775,"She said that she had met with Jeanine at the hospital. “She is 36.5 weeks pregnant,” Ms. Jallow said. “She worked full time up until last week in a beauty salon.”"
2776,"Ms. Jallow, who is Swedish and Gambian, said that she herself had received racist and sexist threats on Instagram and on her cellphone since publicizing the treatment of the mother."
2777,"“We are living in a dangerous country right now,” she said."
2778,"Jeanine’s baby is due on Feb. 20, and she said that she still had bruises on her back, thighs and arms. She is scheduled to return to the doctor’s office on Monday."
2779,She said she would take a taxi.

2781,"When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly called off the L train shutdown, he upended years of careful planning to ensure that 275,000 displaced riders were not left stranded in an L-pocalypse."
2782,"Now, even as officials forge ahead with a widely debated alternate plan, many transit advocates are calling for those contingency measures — more bus and ferry service, new bike lanes, traffic restrictions — to be put in place even with no shutdown. The planned changes, they say, are still needed in a growing city facing critical transportation challenges from congestion to a broken subway system."
2783,"Why turn back, they say, when so much of the groundwork is done. Bike routes have been expanded. Bus lanes have been painted, and the skeletons of bus fare machines have been installed on sidewalks. New bus and ferry services have been announced."
2784,"“What we have in front of us is a city that has to expand our transportation system,” said Ydanis Rodriguez, the chairman of the City Council’s transportation committee. “We have an opportunity to become the most pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly city in the whole nation.”"
2785,"But critics counter that some of the changes would turn their neighborhoods into testing grounds for transit experiments that focus largely on moving commuters, and that the plans should be re-evaluated and weighed against the safety, health and quality of life of residents."
2786,"Across the country, cities are grappling with similar issues as they try to reimagine their aging and increasingly inefficient transportation networks for modern needs. Many cities have overhauled subways and buses to attract more riders, and redesigned streets to make more room for cyclists, pedestrians and green spaces. They have embraced a host of initiatives to raise money for public transportation and reduce congestion and pollution."
2787,"San Francisco has transit-only lanes on 30 miles of streets and plans to add 20 more miles in the next decade. It has even highlighted some busy lanes with red paint to make them more visible to drivers, resulting in fewer cars blocking the lanes, transit officials said."
2788,"Portland, Ore., is spending millions to promote walking and cycling in its downtown area, and working to make bus service faster and more reliable. It has also offered incentives to commuters to take alternative transportation, including a program that gives free transit passes to those who turn in their city-issued parking permits."
2789,"“Major cities across the country face the same challenges, and they are likely to only get worse unless we take action now,” Chloe Eudaly, Portland’s transportation commissioner, said. “Investment in our active transportation infrastructure and increasing ridership on public transit is critical to preserving and maintaining the livability of our city and our planet.”"
2790,"In New York, there are more alternatives than ever for subway riders who tire of delays and overcrowding. Ferry routes will serve all five boroughs next year. New bus lanes are being installed at an average of seven miles a year, for a total of 111 miles so far, with city officials planning to pick up the pace. The city’s network of bike lanes has grown to 1,240 miles, including 300 miles of bike lanes added to streets since 2014 alone."
2791,"But the 15-month shutdown of the L train had been the catalyst for faster and more sweeping changes. It spurred the installation of more Manhattan crosstown bike lanes — cyclists complain that there are not enough — on 12th and 13th Streets, and a bike lane on Delancey Street to keep cyclists moving on and off the Williamsburg Bridge, the city’s busiest bicycle bridge crossing with 7,300 trips per day."
2792,"The city’s first “busway,” or bus-only corridor, was designed to restrict car and truck traffic on 14th Street. Officials also planned to impose high-occupancy-vehicle requirements on the Williamsburg Bridge: Private vehicles with fewer than three passengers — including taxis and ride-hailing cars — would be barred from using the bridge between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. to make room for a fleet of new temporary buses carrying displaced L riders."
2793,"Under the alternate plan backed by Mr. Cuomo, weekday L train service — including during morning and evening rush hours — will remain unchanged, and repairs will be carried out at night and on weekends, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
2794,"The agency plans to increase bus and subway service — including on the G, M and 7 lines — to accommodate L riders affected by the construction, but has not yet released specific details. Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman, said no final decisions had been made on other specific plans or services in the previous shutdown plan."
2795,An M.T.A. draft memo obtained recently by Streetsblog NYC suggested that there would no longer be a need for the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge and the new ferry service. Mr. Tarek said the memo was outdated and that options were still being studied.
2796,"Veronique Hakim, the M.T.A.’s managing director, said the agency was seeking public input and working with city officials to come up with a new plan “serving the needs of our customers while being sensitive to local communities.” The plan would be constantly monitored and adjusted as needed, she added."
2797,"“New Yorkers can be certain that the alternate service plan for the new and improved L project will include additional transportation options designed to accommodate every affected L customer,” she said."
2798,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
2799,"Still, Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University, said that without the pressure of a looming shutdown, “there is now a risk that momentum will be lost,” adding that “planning for bus lanes, better ferries and more bike options is hard enough without sudden shifts in policy.”"
2800,City officials would not answer questions about whether specific contingency measures would go forward or the costs incurred in planning for the shutdown.
2801,"Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a recent news conference that the city was evaluating the new L train plan to decide “if there’s anything that we were planning that is no longer needed because of the L train, but that we might want to do anyway.”"
2802,"The mayor has made improving bus service a priority, and many transit advocates said he could start by keeping the new bus lanes that are already on the ground."
2803,"“It would be lame to peel a bus lane off after pledging in his state of the city to get bus riders moving,” Jon Orcutt, a former city transportation official, said. “These are standing city policies and — L train shutdown or no L train shutdown — they should continue to be city policies and programs.”"
2804,"Even without a shutdown, commuters will need backup options during “the great L train slowdown” on nights and weekends, said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders. He added, “We can’t just go back to the norm and pretend nothing’s happening.”"
2805,"The uncertainty about the alternate plan has also raised concerns among New Yorkers. On the Lower East Side, residents had braced for more gridlock and air pollution from the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge. Now they do not know what to expect. Susan Stetzer, the manager of a local community board, said she remained concerned “about all the unknowns.”"
2806,"The 14th Street Coalition, which represents more than two dozen residential buildings, block associations and businesses in the West Village, Chelsea and Flatiron neighborhoods, has called for officials to abandon the plans for a busway and wider pedestrian areas on 14th Street — which in some places would narrow the street to two lanes from four lanes — and restrictions that would divert car and truck traffic to nearby streets. Some residents also want the crosstown bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets removed."
2807,"Judy Pesin, 66, a member of the coalition, said the 14th Street changes would restrict deliveries to homes and businesses, slow down emergency vehicles, and make it harder for older people, parents with young children and those with disabilities to access cars."
2808,"“Clearly the change in plans means it’s time to listen to the community,’’ she said, “because the commuters are still going to have a moving L train.”"

2810,"The road to the nation’s first tax on superluxury second homes may well have begun at 220 Central Park South, where a four-story, 24,000 square-foot penthouse, unfinished and unfurnished, recently sold for $238 million."
2811,"That deal — the most expensive residential sale in United States history — seemingly set the stage for New York’s sudden embrace of a so-called pied-à-terre tax, a potential windfall for the city’s subway system and a small, subtle victory for those who believe Manhattan has become an unfettered playground for the rich."
2812,"If the measure is passed and signed into law, New York would join cosmopolitan hubs like Paris, Singapore and Vancouver, which already charge fees on secondary or part-time homes. It would also be a prime example of how headlines and hard times can sometimes intersect with a political moment, giving an outre idea a chance to become policy."
2813,"“When over six million New Yorkers are dealing with a crumbling and dysfunctional subway and the crisis in public housing, to see this opulence in the sky by someone who doesn’t even live here, struck a chord,” the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said."
2814,"The tax seems to be riding on a unique crest and confluence of several factors, including shaky tax revenue, uncertainty over the prospects for legal marijuana, and a general anti-rich, anti-corporate mood exemplified by the recent collapse of the Amazon deal in Queens."
2815,"The outlook for the tax is good: Both houses of the State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo support the proposal. Under the proposal, owners of second homes worth more than $5 million would be subject to a sliding tax surcharge and fees; homes that are valued more will incur higher fees and taxes."
2816,"The financial impact could be significant. New York City has about 75,000 pieds-à-terre, according to a city estimate in 2017. Of those, about 5,400 residences were sold for $5 million or more, the threshold where the proposed pied-à-terre tax would begin to kick in."
2817,"Mr. Cuomo estimated on Monday that the state could raise $9 billion in bonds off that revenue that would help fund repairs for the city’s troubled subway system. But the philosophical and psychological impact might be even more profound, offering a concrete, almost classist, rebuke to ultra-wealthy apartment buyers who sojourn in the city, enjoying its services and amenities, but often pay few taxes."
2818,"“There’s a growing realization with Billionaires’ Row, and the super-talls, that a lot of these homes are vacant and viewed as sky-high security deposit boxes for very wealthy foreigners,” said State Senator Brad Hoylman, the Manhattan Democrat who has sponsored the tax legislation for several years. And, he said, “because of our system of laws, because of our fire and police, because we are a secure financial investment, they should be charged for that.”"
2819,"The speed with which the pied-à-terre tax has become politically popular is also remarkable: The idea was floated by a liberal think tank and lawmakers in New York in 2014, but had repeatedly been shunted to death in committee by Republicans leading Albany’s upper chamber, and quietly ignored by Democrats leading the Assembly."
2820,"The blue wave of November, however, changed the balance of power in Albany, with Democrats taking both houses of the Legislature, and unleashing a phalanx of progressives on the capital, part of a left-wing movement bent on correcting income inequality and pushing for higher taxes on the rich."
2821,"Liberal supporters of the tax had long pointed to a range of problems associated with pieds-à-terre, including encouraging real-estate speculation, inflating property values and associated taxes and speeding up gentrification in once-affordable neighborhoods."
2822,"Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who carries the bill in that chamber, said longtime residents “are finding it hard to stay.”"
2823,"“They made districts and parts of New York very livable and very attractive,” she said. “And they are driven out by people that don’t even want to live here.”"
2824,"The bill’s sudden political momentum blindsided real estate executives, who fear the tax could irreparably damage the city’s high-end market, which is already experiencing a downturn."
2825,"Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said the market for high-end co-op and condo purchases has steadily declined since 2016, according to data provided by his firm. In 2016, 1,087 units sold for more than $5 million but less than $25 million. In 2017, the number dropped slightly to 1,075 units and decreased further to 849 units in 2018."
2826,"John H. Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful trade group, said that “nobody has done any analytics as to the impact on the broader economy” as well as the local real-estate market."
2827,"“We are very concerned it’s going to have a huge chilling effect on high-end co-ops and condos,” Mr. Banks said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that he’d been taking calls from concerned members all week."
2828,"“Five million dollars sounds like a lot; you can buy the biggest house in Montana,” said Dolly Lenz, chief executive of Dolly Lenz Real Estate and former vice chairwoman of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. “In New York, $5 million buys a two bedroom in Hudson Yards.”"
2829,Ms. Lenz said she now spends more time in Florida looking at developments since many of her high-end clients are planning to move.
2830,"“So many people have told me they are planning to transition to Naples, Miami or Palm Beach,” she said. “It may not be today, but soon.”"
2831,"Others, including Governor Cuomo, disagree that the tax would scare away potential homeowners."
2832,"“If they have money to buy a $5 million apartment, which is not their prime residence, and it’s their little Manhattan getaway, they can afford the tax,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday. “We need to fund the M.T.A.”"
2833,"Indeed, with the state facing a shortfall in income-tax receipts, the pied-à-terre tax has become an attractive option, especially as other possibilities — marijuana legalization and congestion pricing — may stall."
2834,"The real issue is that New York City needs to fix its property tax system, said Martha E. Stark, a professor at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and the city’s former finance commissioner."
2835,"Under the city’s antiquated property tax system, co-ops and condos are not taxed at their true market value, but on the income generated by similar rental buildings."
2836,"The $238 million apartment, purchased by the Chicago-based hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, is currently valued at $9.4 million, according to the Department of Finance. That comes out to less than 4 percent of the sales price. A property valued at that amount would pay approximately $516,000 in taxes per year, Ms. Stark said."
2837,"If the property were taxed at the same rate as some single-family homes in Queens or Staten Island, the penthouse would produce around $2.4 million in property taxes."
2838,A plan to revise the city’s property tax system is being studied by a tax reform commission.
2839,"For early-adopters of such taxes, the increasing interest and new legislative traction has been satisfying. “It’s like a fine wine,” said Ron Deutsch, executive director of Fiscal Policy Institute, the left-leaning think tank which offered a white paper on the idea in 2014. “Sometimes it takes a little time.”"
2840,"Carol Channing, who died on Tuesday at 97, was a Broadway legend, an actress who toured well into her 70s and remained a cultural fixture long after that. Those who knew her remembered her as both a larger-than-life presence and a woman who was delightfully unpretentious, a tireless performer who would ignore doctor’s orders to go onstage and a tireless promoter of her shows, even in front of a crowd of Brownie scouts."
2841,"Lee Roy Reams performed with Ms. Channing in several shows, including “Hello, Dolly!” Ms. Channing originated the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi on Broadway and reprised it several times. Mr. Reams said she was a performer who tried to never — never, ever — miss a show."
2842,"When she injured her arm on a tour of “Dolly” in the 1990s, Mr. Reams said, she performed in a sling, switched out periodically to coordinate with her costume. When that tour went through Reno, Nev., he said, both of them lost their voices, so they went on anyway and talked through their songs. And when the show was in Denver, she hurt the ball of her right foot. A doctor said she could not go on for at least two to three weeks."
2843,"That night, Ms. Channing went onstage in a pair of flats, which had been covered in spats to match her costume. No one seemed to mind: The reviews were raves."
2844,"The next day, Mr. Reams arrived at the theater to find Ms. Channing back in her original costume, high-heeled boots and all."
2845,"“I said, ‘You can’t do that, you heard what the doctor said,’” Mr. Reams recalled. “And then she said — in that voice of hers — ‘Isn’t it a miracle what a good review can do?’"
2846,"“She wore her heeled boots from that point on,” he said."
2847,"[How the “Hello, Dolly!” cast album lured the theater critic Ben Brantley to New York.]"
2848,"“A few years ago I was performing in Palm Springs, and Carol was in the audience,” Ms. Peters said in an email. “I introduced her and said, ‘Can you believe she’s going to be 94?’ Just then I heard this very strong voice correcting me: ‘95!’”"
2849,"“She had humor,” Ms. Peters said, “and personified the love of performing.”"
2850,"Dori Berinstein, a Broadway producer who directed the documentary “Carol Channing: Larger Than Life,” described her as someone who stood by people with AIDS at a time when that was rare, as a vocal supporter of civil rights, and as a public figure who was “very, very proud to be on Nixon’s enemies list.”"
2851,"“To Carol, every night was opening night,” she said."
2852,"After several years of shooting for the documentary, when that process was finally complete, Ms. Berinstein said she wanted to take Carol and her husband, Harry Kullijian, out to dinner."
2853,"“I had these restaurants in mind that were really special,” Ms. Berinstein recalled."
2854,"“But Carol wanted to go to Subway,” she said. “She was so completely down to earth. So off we went to Subway.”"
2855,She said Ms. Channing ordered a turkey sub.
2856,"Joshua Ellis, Ms. Channing’s publicist for many years, said that part of his job was to monitor what they called the Channing Art, which were file cabinets filled with hundreds of pictures of Ms. Channing with famous people, including actors, politicians, athletes — anybody. When a celebrated person died, his office was to send copies of Ms. Channing with that person to news outlets including The New York Times, The New York Post and The Daily News."
2857,"“She was larger than life onstage and offstage,” Mr. Ellis said. “It wasn’t like you came back stage and somehow she was diminished in size. Some actors are quite big onstage but kind of small offstage. She was big all the time."
2858,"“And I truly believe she would do absolutely anything to publicize whatever show she was in,” he said."
2859,"He recalled that she was once asked to make a presentation to 5,000 Brownies, the junior Girl Scouts, in Central Park. He remembered wondering what she would possibly have to say to thousands of little girls who probably had no idea who she was. It was 9 a.m. on a roasting hot Saturday when she took the stage."
2860,"“She knew who the woman was who founded the Girl Scout movement — whose name I do not remember,” Mr. Ellis said. “She said that she was a woman of independent thought, very much like the character she played, Lorelei Lee, in ‘Gentlemen Prefer Blondes’ — she was pushing her show and found a connection between the Brownies and Lorelei Lee!”"
2861,"Gerard Alessandrini, the creator of “Forbidden Broadway,” a long-running musical revue that spoofed Broadway shows and stars, said that Ms. Channing was a regular at their performances, during which she would delight as actors parodied her onstage."
2862,"“More than any other celebrity, she was fond of ‘Forbidden Broadway’ and was a good sport about it,” he said. “She’s even on one of our cast albums.”"
2863,"In fact, Ms. Channing did impressions herself, and early in her career was known for her Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Alessandrini said."
2864,"“One night Marlene Dietrich came to see her do it, and Marlene Dietrich got up and walked out,” Mr. Alessandrini said."
2865,"Ms. Channing, he said, never responded that way."
2866,"In a famous medical study, two doctors traced a chain of errors that brought the wrong patient, a “Mrs. Morris,” to an operating room for an invasive heart procedure that she did not want, did not need and that no one had actually ordered for her. "
2867,"It turned out that 17 separate mistakes were made before anyone realized that the wrong woman was on the table. Thankfully, Mrs. Morris was not harmed. The doctors said it was an “organizational accident,” meaning that one person could not have done it alone. Sticking tubes into the wrong person’s heart required mess-ups by many people."
2868,"One day, Mrs. Morris may be joined in the great case studies of near blunders by New York’s L train fiasco. This one took a team of people, too."
2869,"Right after the New Year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo made the startling announcement that New York City’s L subway line, whose East River tunnel was damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, could remain in service while fixes were carried out. "
2870,"Talk about whipsaw changes. In April, the line was to stop serving Manhattan for 15 months so the repairs could be made in the river tunnel. Its users had spent two years planning alternative routes and, in some cases, finding new places to live. They are just a fraction of the city’s subway riders, up to 300,000 people a day. But that’s more than the ridership of most mass transit systems in the country. "
2871,"Losing L service for more than a year was a big, disruptive deal. But there was no way around it — or so the public had been told, over and over. "
2872,"Now, it seems almost certain, that was a mistake. A team of academic engineers brought in by the governor last month devised a suite of repairs that they say would return the tunnel to a long-term safe condition with minimal closings. The academics collaborated with the government and consulting engineers who had come up with the original plan. "
2873,"Their approach has been criticized in general terms by two former officials of the agency who had roles in the first plan, saying that the new one would be neither as safe nor as built to last as the original. They have identified no specific risks, and when you drill into the details, it is hard to see where the latest plan falls short. "
2874,"Jerry Jannetti is a senior vice president at WSP, the consulting firm that has worked on the project since 2013 for New York City Transit, which operates the city’s subways as part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. If Mr. Jannetti personally owned and operated the tunnel, would he prefer his firm’s original plan, or the one that emerged last month?"
2875,"“I would choose the way we are moving forward now,” Mr. Jannetti said."
2876,"Which leads us to the next question: If the planned new repairs would be as safe and durable without requiring closing the line, why didn’t anyone think of them before? Shouldn't someone downstream of the governor have thought to bring in outside experts for a fresh look, given the disruptive stakes?"
2877,"Some people are skeptical about this new plan, in fact, precisely because it was driven by Governor Cuomo. That’s good. Without skepticism, society collapses. But this entire episode illustrates a failure to be skeptical. And it shows us the risks of ignoring what it means to fail, at scale, in a booming city that grows every month.  It didn’t have to be the governor asking for a better way. But no one else did."
2878,"Until then, the new array of repairs had not been considered by the in-house engineers at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the WSP consultants or others involved in the project. Andy Byford, the president of New York City Transit, said he was conducting an independent review of the plan and would not sign on unless he was convinced of its safety and durability. That said, he is enthusiastic about its prospects. “I own the risk,” Mr. Byford said. “I am the president, the accountable person. This is my job.”"
2879,"Anyone on the M.T.A. board could have demanded alternatives. Mr. Cuomo appoints six of the 14 voting members, and by force of personality, he has driven a number of projects, including this one — at the last minute — and pushing construction of the Second Avenue line. "
2880,"You can find representatives of eight other public officials on the authority’s board, including the mayor of New York. Even more power is held by a virtually unknown committee of four, any one of whom can veto the entire capital budget. On this committee are the speaker of the State Assembly, the State Senate majority leader, the mayor and the governor."
2881,"Typically, that awesome power has not been used for actual oversight — asking questions! — but for horse trading. So one legislator hinted at a veto if political cronies were not given state judgeships. And in an infamous episode, an Assembly speaker, Sheldon N. Silver, demanded that a pet project be funded to a satisfactorily boondoggle-ish level,  pointedly mentioning that he would soon be looking at the capital budget."
2882,"“I will expect to see the Fulton Street Transit Center fully funded, complete and at a scale that at least resembles what was repeatedly promised,” Mr. Silver wrote in 2008. He got his way. The price for fixing that one station hit $1.4 billion, more than the entire annual budget of the Chicago transit system at the time."
2883,"There are legislative oversight committees for mass transit in the City Council, the State Senate and the State Assembly. No one asked the fundamental question about finding another way. "
2884,The price of all these people being in charge is that no one owns the work.
2885,"In all walks of life — engineering, politics, transportation — there is a fine line between the earned wisdom of experience and the toxic self-regard of a credentialed rut. (That goes for journalism, too. For most of the time the L train shutdown was in the air, I was writing a column in the New York section of The Times. No one stopped me from asking questions. I just didn’t.) "
2886,"The L train's East River tunnel — “still pretty darned good at 100 years old,” Mr. Jannetti said — was built under the supervision of the master engineer Clifford Holland starting in 1916. It was part of the surge of transit construction during the first decades of the 20th century that shaped modern New York into the nation's largest city."
2887,"New York’s mass transit system stopped expanding in 1940, and it has even shrunk since then. The city’s population has grown by about 1.5 million since 1990 and may only be choked off by frail transportation. The M.T.A. has proved itself one of the world’s most effective garrotes."
2888," The agency was created a half-century ago to build, among other things, the Second Avenue subway (still unfinished) and a new tunnel for the Long Island Rail Road into Grand Central (the tunnel was finished in 1989 but the connection into Grand Central is years away). In 2002, the chairman of the agency announced a series of streamlining reforms. Today, there are about 10,000 more employees and less actual service. The Regional Plan Association proposed dismantling pieces of the agency. Maybe it should go into the portfolio of the governor or the mayor. To some one, at least — not everyone."
2889,"Mrs. Morris landed on an operating table for a procedure that she didn’t want or need, and that no one had ordered for her. New York City wound up being prepped for a different kind of surgery that it surely did not want or need. This organizational accident took a lot more than 17 errors."

2892,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board makes decisions that affect the lives of millions of commuters in New York City and the region. Yet most people have no idea who is actually on the panel.
2893,"On Thursday, the board delayed a vote on whether to raise fares and tolls for people who rely on the authority’s sprawling network of subways, buses, commuter railroads, bridges and tunnels. The board could vote on several fare proposals in February."
2894,"The board, a coterie of prominent New Yorkers, is in a power struggle with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has taken near total control of the transit agency. "
2895,"The board includes wealthy business leaders and the city’s transportation commissioner. One former member, Nancy Shevell, even married a Beatle (Paul McCartney) in 2011 while serving on the board."
2896,Here’s what New Yorkers should know about the board:
2897,"The board votes on major issues like fare increases, service changes and capital improvement projects. The board typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. There are several vacancies, and the board has only 13 voting members right now."
2898,"The management of the M.T.A. also exerts significant power. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership. "
2899,"Mr. Cuomo has used his influence over the agency’s leaders to set priorities for the system, an approach that some board members say has favored aesthetics over maintenance. Mr. Cuomo recently called off the L train shutdown and proposed a new way to repair the subway tunnel that carries the line between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Transit leaders say they do not need the board to sign off on Mr. Cuomo’s plan."
2900,"But a watchdog group, Reinvent Albany, said the board should vote on the L train plan, citing the state public authorities law, which states that the board must approve “fundamental financial and business strategies and major actions.”"
2901,Most board members are not household names. But each one has at least a few friends in politics.
2902,"In addition to the members nominated by the governor and the mayor, there are three delegates from Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. There are four suburban members from Orange, Dutchess, Rockland and Putnam Counties — a group known condescendingly as “quarter-pounders” because they share one vote."
2903,There are also several nonvoting members who represent workers and riders. 
2904,Here are a few of the board’s notable members:
2905,"Mr. Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president, is a co-chairman at Mercury, a public strategy firm. (He has taken an unpaid leave of absence while he is chairman.) He rose to the top job in November when the previous chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, resigned. Mr. Ferrer, a friendly Cuomo loyalist, acts as a pinch-hitter of sorts: He has served as acting chairman twice before. Mr. Cuomo’s office said it would appoint a new chairman, which requires confirmation by the State Senate, in “the coming weeks.”"
2906,"Mr. Jones, who was recommended by Mayor Bill de Blasio, is president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit. He has been a fierce champion for the “Fair Fares” program to offer discount MetroCards to poor New Yorkers. "
2907,"Mr. Moerdler, a Cuomo appointee, is a partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. Perhaps the most quotable board member, Mr. Moerdler has spawned the moniker “First Degree Moerdler” on Twitter for his fiery screeds. He has decried “fake news.” He recently declared, “We are not empty suits.” Mr. Lhota once challenged him to “be a man” during a tense exchange, and Mr. Moerdler responded by saying, “Bring it on.”"
2908,"Mr. Schwartz, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo, is an executive at OTG, an airport concessions company. He is known as being Mr. Cuomo’s enforcer on the board and wants to present his own fare proposals aiming to tie higher fares to service improvements. "
2909,"Ms. Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, was recommended by Mr. de Blasio. She raised concerns about Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan, which has been criticized as a temporary fix and possibly dangerous for riders. Ms. Trottenberg had a tense exchange with Mr. Ferrer at a recent meeting, asking him: “Is the decision made? Do we have any actual role here?”"
2910,"The other voting members are Susan G. Metzger, Mitchell H. Pally, Scott Rechler, Andrew Saul, Veronica Vanterpool, Peter Ward, Carl Weisbrod and Neal Zuckerman."
2911,M.T.A. board members are not paid. Some accept a MetroCard to use when they ride the subway or bus — or an E-ZPass to cross bridges and tunnels — when on official business.
2912,"The board once had access to an unlimited E-ZPass account, though that perk was revoked in 2008 in response to pressure from Mr. Cuomo, who was then the state attorney general. (One former board member, David S. Mack, a wealthy real estate executive, racked up more than $2,000 a year in E-ZPass transactions.)"
2913,"Having a spot on the board is viewed as public service and a high-profile role in the life of the city. Ms. Shevell, its most glamorous member, stepped down after her wedding to Mr. McCartney. "
2914,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
2915,"The key to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s surprise decision this month to call off the L-train shutdown is a new repair plan that relies on a less disruptive approach to fixing the tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn, allowing work to be done on nights and weekends."
2916,"But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority considered a similar idea nearly five years ago and determined that it raised serious safety concerns, including the potential for the spread of cancer-causing dust that could harm commuters and workers, according to documents obtained by The New York Times."
2917,"Both plans call for mounting heavy cables to the wall of a nearly century-old tunnel under the East River, rather than burying the cables in the wall."
2918,"But engineers warned in 2014 that the technique could harm the wall’s lining, according to the documents obtained by The Times."
2919,"“Excessive anchor bolt penetrations for installing critical cables may damage the concrete lining and induce leakages,” according to a report by the transit agency and Parsons Brinckerhoff, an engineering consultant now known as WSP that is leading planning for Mr. Cuomo’s alternate plan."
2920,"Instead of closing the subway tunnel for 15 months, the new plan would limit construction work to one tube at a time on nights and weekends over a longer period of time."
2921,"But the earlier report raised concerns that the construction work could create silica dust, a hazardous mineral that would be difficult to remove during a short weekend closing. Exposure to silica dust can damage the lungs."
2922,"Parsons Brinckerhofff, an engineering consultant now known as WSP, issued this report with the MTA in May 2014. (PDF, 27 pages, 27.2 MB)"
2923,The engineers also said there was a “high risk” of not being able to restore train service on time every Monday morning.
2924,"On Tuesday, the authority’s board was briefed on the new repair plan by WSP — a meeting that turned into a lively debate over its merits. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, had called for the “emergency meeting.”"
2925,"A spokesman for the authority, Shams Tarek, defended the new repair plan and said it was “significantly different” from the 2014 approach. The new plan would hang the cables on racks, instead of affixing them directly to the tunnel wall, requiring 60 percent fewer bolts to hang the cables."
2926,"“The M.T.A. and WSP would never recommend a project that poses any risk to public safety,” Mr. Tarek said in a statement."
2927,"Jerry Jannetti, a senior vice president at WSP, said the firm stood behind its new approach."
2928,"“We are confident that the frequency and depth of the bolt penetration will pose no risk to the tunnel lining,” Mr. Jannetti said in a statement."
2929,"The new plan also removes a smaller amount of the concrete bench walls that can release silica dust, Mr. Jannetti said."
2930,"“Any issues related to silica dust will be managed by the contractor and overseen by an independent consultant, and will be safe for both workers and riders,” he said."
2931,"Some board members have criticized Mr. Cuomo’s secrecy in announcing the new approach without their input. The board must eventually approve the new plan, though no vote was taken on Tuesday."
2932,"A spokeswoman for the governor, Dani Lever, said in a statement: “The same consultant studied both options and said again today at a public hearing that this is a different design than the first option they studied, and hence they have a different opinion, just like an apple is not an orange.”"
2933,"At the board meeting, Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, asked how the agency would handle silica dust and how long the construction work would last. Leaders on the project said efforts to contain the silica dust would depend on how much concrete is removed. The work could last 15 to 20 months, though the schedule is still being determined."
2934,"Ms. Trottenberg, who is also a board member, criticized the agency’s decision to announce “shutdown averted” before talking to the board."
2935,“Is the decision made?” she asked. “Do we have any actual role here?”
2936,"The authority’s chairman, Fernando Ferrer, dared board members to express support for a full shutdown — an option that has outraged L-train riders."
2937,"“Look, if you’re for inconveniencing 275,000 people, say so!” Mr. Ferrer said."
2938,"The M.T.A. has become a punching bag over the last two weeks. Mr. Cuomo, complaining of its stodgy bureaucracy, said he wanted to “blow up the M.T.A.” A piece on New York Magazine’s website asked: “Is the Metropolitan Transportation Authority staffed by idiots?”"
2939,"But the documents show that the agency, which had come under intense criticism for not thinking of the approach sooner, had considered other options and determined that a full shutdown was best."
2940,"In February 2015, a report by Jacobs, an engineering consultant, warned that “weekend construction is not acceptable,” listing concerns over silica dust control and reliability. A chart showed the downsides of weekend closures, including higher labor costs and a longer construction period."
2941,A final version of the Jacobs report released the next year changed how “silica dust control” during weekend work was rated from “not desirable” to “satisfactory.”
2942,"Former subway leaders have criticized Mr. Cuomo’s plan as being just a temporary fix for the tunnel, which was built in 1924 and damaged by floodwaters during Hurricane Sandy in 2012."
2943,"The new plan, developed by a team of engineers from Columbia and Cornell Universities, would hang the cables from the wall, instead of encasing them in a structure known as a bench wall."
2944,"Workers would remove damaged parts of the bench wall and secure other parts with a substance known as fiber reinforced polymer that could last 40 years. Rebuilding the bench walls, as the original plan called for, could last more than 80 years."
2945,"In February 2015, the MTA considered a report by Jacobs, an engineering consultant. (PDF, 53 pages, 55.62 MB)"
2946,"Carmen Bianco, the former president of New York City Transit, said he recalled attending meetings to discuss different approaches for the repairs, but the idea of hanging the cables was ruled out “very quickly” because of the tunnel’s age. Mr. Bianco did not provide the documents to The Times."
2947,"“We all knew the worst thing we could do was a complete shutdown,” Mr. Bianco said. “We knew what that would do to the neighborhoods and to the economy and to people trying to get to work. We couldn’t find another scenario that was really safe and made sense.”"
2948,"Mr. Bianco, who argued in an Op-Ed in The Times last week that the revised plan had not been properly vetted, said Mr. Cuomo’s plan could still be very disruptive since the L train is popular on nights and weekends. Trains would run every 20 minutes."
2949,"“If people continue to use it as normal, then it’s going to be very crowded,” he said."
2950,"The shutdown was set to begin on April 27. It is not clear when the work will begin now. Andy Byford, the subway’s leader, supports Mr. Cuomo’s plan, but called for an independent review and said he would not be “steamrolled” if that process takes a while."
2951,"Silica dust has emerged as a central concern. Removing parts of the concrete bench wall could create silica, a mineral that can cause an incurable lung disease or lung cancer if inhaled, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration."
2952,"The transit agency learned how to contain silica from rebuilding the Montague tunnel in 2014, according to the 2014 report on the L train. It requires “isolation of the work area,” which is difficult during a weekend closing, the report said. One approach of wetting the dust to remove it was not foolproof, the report said."
2953,"“Mister and water-spray systems reduce airborne dust by about 50 percent” but do “not eliminate the hazard,” the report said."
2954,"The debate over the L train also comes at a critical time for the transit agency. Mr. Byford introduced a plan to save the subway last May, but he needs Mr. Cuomo’s help to pay for it. Mr. Cuomo has urged state lawmakers to pay for it by approving congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan."
2955,"Switching to a less ambitious plan in order to avoid having to shut down the L train would be a missed opportunity to fix the tunnel for the long haul, said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University."
2956,"“This is like delaying open-heart surgery,” Mr. Moss said. “We don’t know how long the stent is going to last.”"

2959,"Weather: Today is sunny, but the wind chill may make it feel as if it’s in the mid-20s or mid-30s. Thursday may be in the 50s. Friday may be in the 60s."
2960,Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday).
2961,"New York is poised to put in place the country’s first congestion pricing plan, which would charge drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan."
2962,"Many supporters and critics rely on neat, simple talking points when debating the proposal, which would help pay for repairs to the city’s subway system."
2963,[Here’s what else you need to know about congestion pricing.] 
2964,"So we spoke to two state lawmakers with more nuanced views: Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Long Island Democrat, and Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, a Democrat representing an area northwest of New York City."
2965,Mr. Kaminsky:
2966, A Newsday article said you oppose the current bill.
2967,The current version. I think we’ll be able to get to a good version that both helps the region and helps Long Islanders.
2968,"What I’ve asked for, and what the Long Island senators have asked for, is a dedicated revenue stream outside of congestion pricing to fund infrastructure improvements to the Long Island Rail Road."
2969,"You’re asking people to get out of their cars, then the mass transit needs to work better. The railroads had its worst on-time record in nearly two decades. It’s a mess."
2970, Is congestion pricing a tax on low-income and working-class people?
2971,"Long Island people driving into the city, who are already paying a good amount to live on Long Island and commute, would certainly not see it favorably. I don’t know if they use the “tax” word. I don’t think anyone’s asking for this on Long Island. The question is, can there be a commensurate benefit to balance it?"
2972, Someone suggested an exemption for New York City residents. 
2973,[Laughs] I think different people have different regional needs.
2974, Is there a way to make congestion pricing just for the rich? Can only luxury vehicles be charged?
2975,The only specific on vehicles that has been brought up is an exemption for motorcycles.
2976, I’m sure the motorcycle lobby is happy about that.
2977,I was trying to think of a joke about popping a wheelie.
2978,"When people reflect in five years, what will this look like?"
2979,I think this is going to be commonplace in a lot of cities.
2980,Ms. Gunther:
2981, I wanted to talk to a critic of congestion pricing.
2982,"I’m not going to be very long-winded, because I represent Orange and Sullivan Counties. In Sullivan County, we have no mass transit at all. And we have a Short Line bus system that, if you worked in New York City, you have to leave at 4 o’clock in the morning or you’d be late for work."
2983,"We also already pay M.T.A. taxes in Orange County. And for the service, it’s pretty pathetic."
2984,No mass transit at all?
2985,"We do have a train that leaves at certain times of the day. And if there’s a problem on the track, you’re out of luck. There’s another word I could put in there, but I’m not going to."
2986, You could.
2987,I’m not going to. [Mocking voice] It’s so darn unladylike.
2988,"I care greatly about the environment. But at this point, we have to really go back and think about upstate, downstate. You can’t do mass transit in a piecemeal manner. We’re all taxpayers."
2989, How does congestion pricing affect your constituents?
2990,Orange County is the last county you can live in if you’re on the New York Police Department or the Fire Department of New York. We’re not talking about the richy Wall Street people. We’re not talking about those.
2991,"There are a lot of folks that are commuting and at crazy hours, but the frequency of the trains aren’t there."
2992,"Anyway, I got to go, ‘cause we’re working on this stupid bu — I shouldn’t say stupid budget. But we’re working on this impossible budget!"
2993, Do you consider congestion pricing a tax on the working class?
2994,It definitely impacts working-class people the most.

3010,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
3011,"At the first newspaper that hired me, I wrote restaurant reviews. My editor offered a legitimate-sounding piece of advice: Because I wasn’t a food expert, I should skip writing about what the food exactly tasted like. Instead, she said, focus on the ambience, the setting and, heck, even the bathroom."
3012,"Thus began my nearly three years of inadequate restaurant reviews, in which I factually described the food, without saying much by way of recommendations. The food was never the main story; it was always the restaurant itself."
3013,"This came to mind when I was reading about John Donohue, who is attempting to draw sketches of every restaurant in New York City. A book of his sketches will be published in May."
3014,"As my colleague John Leland wrote, Mr. Donohue “rarely eats at restaurants, and has tried very few of the 102 included in his book or the ongoing array on his website.” The sketchbook is more of a time capsule of a quickly changing landscape. Restaurants come and go, but New York’s appetite is forever."
3015,"By the time Mr. Donohue put together his sketches for a book, Mr. Leland continued, “at least six of the restaurants were gone.” Some were replaced by other eateries, waiting to be sketched."

3023,"Later that week, I brought my 8-year-old daughter to a play date in Washington Heights. It was going to be our first time in the neighborhood. As we rode uptown on the subway, I told my daughter about meeting the blind woman earlier in the week."
3024,"We left the subway at 168th Street and started toward our destination. Within two blocks, I spotted Shirley."

3031,"A plan to tax the rich on multimillion-dollar second homes in New York City has rapidly moved closer to reality, as legislative leaders in Albany and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have all signed off on the idea as a funding stream for the city’s beleaguered subway system."
3032,"Mr. Cuomo said on Monday there was a consensus among the state’s leaders, all Democrats, that a so-called pied-à-terre tax was a good idea, calling it the “only agreed-to new money” for a state facing a significant drop in tax revenue."
3033,"The purchase of a $238 million apartment on Central Park South by Kenneth C. Griffin, a hedge fund billionaire with an estimated net worth of $10 billion, may have helped make the legislation more feasible, proponents said."
3034,"“I think we have a mass transit system that is in crisis, public housing that is falling down around its residents and a yawning gap between the very wealthy and ordinary New Yorkers that is driving this conversation,” said Senator Brad Hoylman, a sponsor of his chamber’s pied-à-terre bill."
3035,"The $238 million record purchase was a visceral reminder that when wealthy buyers like Mr. Griffin purchase expensive apartments as second homes or investments, New York City and the state get less financial benefit than if the home were owned as a primary residence. If the buyers live out of state, they are not subject to state or city income taxes, and do not pay New York sales tax while outside the state."
3036,"Under the Senate’s bill, a pied-à-terre tax would institute a yearly tax on homes worth $5 million or more, and would apply to homes that do not serve as the buyer’s primary residence."
3037,"It was not immediately clear how much money the tax would raise; the office of the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, estimated that a pied-à-terre tax would bring in a minimum of $650 million annually if enacted today. And based on the expected revenue stream, Mr. Cuomo estimated that the state could then raise $9 billion in bonds, backed by the expected taxes paid by pied-à-terre owners."
3038,"The State Senate and Assembly were expected to include a version of the tax in budget proposals that are set to be released this week, although the exact details were still to be ironed out. And given the often-tumultuous process of negotiating the state budget, which is due April 1, it remains possible that the tax may not get approved this year."
3039,"But according to Senate leaders, the tax is long overdue."
3040,"“It is great that with a united Democratic Legislature and support from the governor, we can finally get this done,” said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Democratic majority in the Senate, adding that a tax on “ultrarich second homeowners in New York City is common sense and something we have supported for years.”"
3041,"Mr. Cuomo said on Monday that with other potential sources of revenue in question — the possible legalization of marijuana, for example, has been slowed by political and practical concerns — other sources are now needed."
3042,"“If we did have marijuana passed, we wouldn’t have needed to substitute the pied-à-terre,” Mr. Cuomo said in remarks to reporters in Albany. “It’s a very tight box this year.”"
3043,"Mr. Hoylman said there were many pressing needs that could use an influx of recurring funds, and was agnostic about whether the money be placed in a dedicated revenue stream for something such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
3044,"His bill would create a sliding tax surcharge. For properties valued between $5 million and $6 million, a 0.5 percent surcharge would be added on the value over $5 million. Fees and a higher surcharge would apply to homes that sold for more than $6 million, topping out at a $370,000 fee and a 4 percent surcharge for homes valued at more than $25 million."
3045,"Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, said there is “wide support” among members for a pied-à-terre tax because of the condition of the city’s vital infrastructure such as the subways and public housing. The city may have to pass legislation creating the tax should the Legislature authorize it."
3046,"In 2017, New York City had 75,000 pieds-à-terre, up from 55,000 such units since 2014, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. The share of vacant apartments that are classified as pieds-à-terre has held steady during that time at about 30 percent."
3047,"Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said the tax would not be well received within the business community. She suggested that such a tax — combined with President Trump’s move to cap the amount of state and local income taxes that can be deducted on federal income taxes — could further push the wealthy to reconsider living here."
3048,"“A broad-based tax like the sales tax or the gas tax would be better received in the business community,” Ms. Wylde said."
3049,"But Moses Gates, a vice president at the Regional Plan Association, disputed the notion that New Yorkers would leave the city. The association believes that most wealthy pied-à-terre owners would pay the tax. If they chose to sell, then the property has the chance of being purchased by a full-time city resident, who would then be subject to income and sales tax."
3050,"“Either the housing is put back on the market for a full-time resident of New York City,” said Mr. Gates, “or folks who own extremely valuable residences contribute their fair share to making sure New York is the kind of city that provides a safe investment for high-end property.”"

3052,"Under different circumstances, Kelly Tieger might have stayed in New York City forever."
3053,"She liked her job teaching at a school in Chelsea and the rent-stabilized apartment she and her husband shared in Bushwick, the Brooklyn neighborhood they found affordable enough to move to in 2012. The cherry on top: her 25-minute commute to Manhattan."
3054,"The stars had aligned. And then, in 2016, the L train shutdown was announced."
3055,"“We hadn’t thought about leaving, and then we heard about the L train,” Ms. Tieger said. “It sort of became this thing of, like, what kind of life do we want to live?”"
3056,She began looking for jobs somewhere she and her husband could afford with a commute she could tolerate. They ended up moving two and a half hours away — to Connecticut — this past August.
3057,"When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said it would shut down the Canarsie Tunnel, which the L train travels through between Manhattan and Brooklyn, for repairs, many other L train riders asked the same question. Some responded by moving apartments and offices; all of them steeled themselves for longer commutes."
3058,"So when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced a subway shutdown about-face on Thursday, the reaction of those who had already seen their lives upended was mixed, but visceral."
3059,"“It just felt, personally, like a punch in the gut,” said Brad Dulay, 33, who left Williamsburg for Hoboken, N.J., in October. “After we went through all that.”"
3060,[The L train shutdown plan was three years in the making. It unraveled in three weeks.]
3061,"While Mr. Dulay works from home, his wife works as a nurse on the Upper East Side. It was an easy commute from the apartment they owned, Mr. Dulay said. But without the L, it would have been much harder."
3062,"Under Mr. Cuomo’s new plan, service on the L line would run on a limited schedule on nights and weekends, when one of the tunnel’s tubes would be shut down. The transit authority said on Thursday that it would offset the impact by beefing up service on the G, M and 7 trains as it had previously planned, but it did not provide details."
3063,"But this past summer, the L train shutdown seemed certain, and so “it became a mad dash” for Mr. Dulay and his wife to relocate, he said. The couple put their apartment on the market, selling it for about $24,000 less than they were asking, because they were determined to leave the neighborhood before the train stopped running."
3064,"They were not the only people to compromise. Landlords in Williamsburg were giving concessions to renters, offering them reduced rates or a free month’s rent, according to Andrew Barrocas, the chief executive of MNS, a real estate firm."
3065,"With the shutdown averted, Mr. Barrocas said, some of the landlords now regret it."
3066,"“They wish they wouldn’t have given the concessions,” he said. “But my response was, you know, ‘If you buy life insurance and you don’t die, are you upset about it?’”"
3067,"Overall, parts of the rapidly gentrifying neighborhoods along the L line became somewhat more affordable for renters before the reversal on Thursday, said Grant Long, an economist at StreetEasy, the New York City real estate site."
3068,"Rents in north Brooklyn have fallen 1.5 percent since the shutdown was first announced, Mr. Long said, while rents in the rest of the borough rose by 3.3 percent."
3069,"In general, the supply of apartment rentals in north Brooklyn was also outpacing demand, Mr. Long said. In Bushwick, available apartment listings more than doubled from October 2017 to October 2018, according to data from StreetEasy. In Williamsburg, the supply of apartments was near record highs."
3070,Mr. Long predicted rents would rise sharply in the near future as landlords looked to recover some of their lost revenue.
3071,"Anyone who decided to suffer through the shutdown and signed a lease last week, he said, should be feeling pretty lucky."
3072,"That was of little comfort to the people who they replaced, like Fay El Klahi, 32, who left her Brooklyn apartment for Manhattan just two weeks ago. She and her fiancé didn’t want to leave Williamsburg but felt the shutdown gave them little choice."
3073,"While she wanted to move back to Brooklyn, it was out of the question. “That would cost us another fortune to get back,” she said. “And we’d have to break our lease.”"
3074,[The L train isn’t shutting down after all. What exactly does that mean?]
3075,The changing fate of the L train has also affected those who lacked the financial means to move.
3076,"“I am perplexed, excited and angry, all at the same time,” said James Dier, who planned to remain in the Williamsburg apartment he has lived in since 2012. “But I really do hope for the best.”"
3077,"Many people like Mr. Dier, who works evenings and weekends at a theater in Midtown Manhattan, said some subway service was better than no subway service. But the timing of Mr. Cuomo’s announcement and lack of specifics surrounding it left them frustrated."
3078,"Delilah Martinez, who commutes from Canarsie to her job at a waxing salon in Manhattan, was aggravated by the idea of night and weekend work stretching on. She said that in the past, when the L train has not run properly on the weekends, she has spent $60 taking a car service to get to work on time."
3079,"“I would rather they do it quickly and just get it over with,” she said."
3080,"Roch Kiki, 34, a deliveryman who lives in East New York and works in Manhattan, said he was not looking forward to the hassles of night and weekend travel for an extended amount of time."
3081,"“It will not be easy,” said Mr. Kiki, who immigrated in 2016 from Benin. “But I am not able to move. I don’t have the money. What choice do I have?”"

3083,"The first phase of what was to be a sweeping plan to provide half-priced subway and bus rides to the poorest New Yorkers arrived on Friday, a few days late and many people short."
3084,"If the plan had been presented last year as a major change in the lives of those struggling to make ends meet in New York City, the reality, announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio and Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, is far less than anticipated: Only 30,000 New Yorkers — those who already receive cash assistance from the city and are employed — will be eligible for the cards starting this month."
3085,"The pool of eligible New Yorkers would expand in April to about 130,000 people who receive federal food stamps and are working, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Johnson said — still a far cry from the 800,000 New Yorkers estimated by advocates to live below the federal poverty line of $25,000 a year for a family of four."
3086,The city has no mechanism for people to apply for the discounts; only those who receive cash benefits or food stamps can get the half-priced MetroCards.
3087,"Appearing at a news conference at a Harlem subway station on Friday, Mr. de Blasio chose to characterize the rollout as “a major step to a fair and just society,” even as he and Mr. Johnson faced repeated questions about the program’s initial limited scope."
3088,"“This is a good start,” Mr. Johnson said. “Could things be done in a more perfect way? The mayor and I can always Monday-morning quarterback and figure out ways that we could get it done in a better way.”"
3089,"A sticking point had been both logistical and ideological: Could the city, which would administer the program, provide the discount for pay-per-ride MetroCards, or just for those that provide unlimited use for a week or 30 days? Antipoverty advocates argued that the program would be much more useful to low-income riders if the pay-per-ride card was included."
3090,"The initial launch will include only the half-priced unlimited cards, which are priced at $16 for a week, or $60.50 for the 30 days and look like ordinary MetroCards. City officials were working with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to add the pay-per-ride option in April, Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Johnson said."
3091,"Originally planned for a start date of Jan. 1, the program officially began on Friday, a blown deadline that Mr. de Blasio seemed to casually dismiss in a radio interview earlier in the day."
3092,"“It’s January 4 today. I am precisely three days late. I apologize for that three-day delay,” the mayor said."
3093,"But many who cheered its adoption into the city budget last year criticized the limited scope as well as the lack of a timeline beyond April or of any public messaging by the city about the program so far, saying it appeared that some at City Hall were not taking the issue seriously. Some critics were more pointed."
3094,"“That was NOT the deal,” Councilman Francisco Moya of Queens wrote on Twitter to the mayor. “We did our job, now it’s time for you to do yours.”"
3095,"Punctuated by the shouts of hecklers and the constant chime of riders swiping into the system, Mr. de Blasio, who struggled to swipe an ordinary MetroCard at the station, defended the program’s rollout, comparing it to a trial run. “We’re trying to use the first 30,000 to make sure the whole system works,” Mr. de Blasio said."
3096,"The mayor suggested at one point that constructing the bureaucracy for reduced-fare MetroCards had been more challenging than creating a universal prekindergarten system — something he accomplished during his first year as mayor. “Pre-K had an existing application process,” the mayor said; fair fares, by contrast, “was creating a brand-new initiative that never existed before.”"
3097,"For eligible New Yorkers, getting the discounted MetroCards will be a two-step process at first: They must go to designated offices to pick up the special cards. Then, they must add money to them at MetroCard vending machines, which will be programmed to charge half-price. By April, city officials hope to be able to have eligible New Yorkers sign up online for the cards to be mailed to their homes."
3098,"Some antipoverty advocates, invited to participate in the news conference, offered praise for the two leaders for getting the plan started, even as they criticized its slow start. David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, expressed concern at who was left out of the initial rollout."
3099,"“Now it is up to the mayor to make good on his side of the bargain,” he said, and deliver the program. “Progressive rhetoric, that all of us use, always has to meet the rubber to the road of getting it done.”"
3100,"The city budgeted $106 million to cover the expense of the first fiscal year of the program, though Mr. de Blasio has promised to fully fund the program to meet demand. Any leftover funds would be rolled over to cover costs next year, he said."
3101,"Mr. de Blasio originally did not support using city funds to pay for the subsidized rides, saying he preferred instead a dedicated tax on high-income earners to fund the program. Such a tax would need to be approved by the state, which controls the subway and bus system. Ultimately, he came around to the idea after being pressed by Mr. Johnson and others on the City Council."
3102,"“This one was real slog with no understanding of why it became a slog,” Mr. Jones, the antipoverty advocate, said after the news conference. “I think the mayor feels that maybe we’ve dragged him kicking and screaming into something he didn’t want to do on this scale.”"
3103,"And so exits Amazon, pursued by the angry crowds of Queens. "
3104,"As a native of Queens, I watched the battle over Amazon’s plans to build a headquarters in Long Island City with a sense of awe. Look — people not wanting Queens to change! Growing up there, I wanted Queens to change as much as possible. Preferably into Manhattan."
3105,I just didn’t believe it could. 
3106,"When I lived there in the 1960s and ’70s, Queens branded you as pure bridge-and-tunnel crowd. Queens, the embarrassment you cursed as you slunk back to Bayside after a concert at the Fillmore East. Queens, the humiliating asterisk after “I’m from New York.”"
3107,"But look what it has become: Queens, the ultra-happening multicultural mecca! Queens, the darling of artists, creatives and foodies! Queens, the unrequited object of desire of a trillion-dollar tech company!"
3108,"I’ve watched slack-mouthed with wonder and envy. When I was a kid there, the thought that Queens could become cool was so ridiculous that no one ever thought it. And now that it has, how I wish it had happened in time for me."
3109,"Oh, my childhood playing with friends in then-forested Bayside was idyllic. But when I became a teenager, the social disadvantages of outer-boroughhood was clear. My Queens was basically a suburb. My Queens was the place where if you wanted excitement, you had to take the bus and subway. A long way."
3110,"A multicultural wonderland proud of its status as the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world? Back then, it was the home of Archie Bunker, which for years was the first thing people said when they heard you were from Queens. Queens was whiter then, and though there were certainly different ethnic groups in the borough, most of us were too isolated in our own enclaves to know it. My own neighborhood was so homogeneous that my friends and I could have traced our families back to neighboring shtetls."
3111,"Cool people did occasionally emerge from Queens. The Ramones met in Forest Hills. Cyndi Lauper grew up in Ozone Park. Robert Mapplethorpe was born in Floral Park, of which he said, “It was a good place to come from in that it was a good place to leave.”"
3112,I also found it a good place to leave. I moved to Chicago after graduating from Queens College and over the years regularly found myself dancing the Queens-finessing quadrille.
3113,"“Oh, you’re from New York?” someone would say, clearly impressed. Then came the dreaded follow-up: “The city?”"
3114,"The Queenster knew where this was heading. Was I from the city? Well, strictly speaking, yes. Queens is one of the five boroughs. It is officially, factually, part of New York City."
3115,"But who was I kidding? I knew what was being asked. Was I a cool, artsy, possibly wealthy, definitely interesting, genuine New Yorker?"
3116,"No, I was from Queens."
3117,"I sometimes rose to its, and my, defense: Queens hosted the 1964-65 World’s Fair and still has that neat Unisphere. Queens has a genuine Civil War fortress, Fort Totten. Queens gave me a great education, from P.S. 169 to Queens College, where, by the way, tuition then was free."
3118,"But in my heart, I knew it was still Queens."
3119,"Until, to my amazement, it wasn’t."
3120,"I have watched in disbelief as Flushing, where the big excitement used to be Alexander’s department store, became a destination for worldly foodies. As Astoria, whose streets I once used as free parking near the subway, blossomed with upscale restaurants and shops. As Long Island City, which had bizarrely seemed doomed to eternal grubbiness despite its boffo view of the skyline, got MoMA PS1, Silvercup Studios and rents of $4,000 a month."
3121,My Bayside mind boggled. Co-working spaces in Sunnyside! Craft breweries in Ditmars! Yoga in the new Hunters Point South Park!
3122,"Then, a year ago, my millennial daughter relocated to New York. After I had spent decades of my life trying to avoid admitting I was from Queens, she proudly moved to Ridgewood."
3123,"And now the final triumph: Queens has taken on Amazon, and won. "
3124,"A new day has dawned over the Throgs Neck Bridge. Sure, potshots are still lobbed at the Queens of old, which periodically gets blamed for native sons Harvey Weinstein and Donald Trump. And admittedly, I’m not exactly putting the outer-borough inferiority complex notion to rest here."
3125,"But today I can step into the light and claim my now-honorable heritage, which apparently gives my daughter major street cred, and say with pride the words I once muttered under my breath: "

3136,Hudson Yards officially opened on Friday. Want to visit? Here’s everything you’ll need to know:
3137,Where is it?
3138,Hudson Yards was built above the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.
3139,What buildings are there?
3140,"There’s a shopping mall between two office towers, 10 and 30 Hudson Yards. 50 Hudson Yards is to the north and under construction. Another office building is at 55 Hudson Yards."
3141,"Then there’s 35 Hudson Yards, which is 1,000 feet high and includes shops, offices, a hotel and apartments. And over at 15 Hudson Yards, a residential building, there are separate entrances for the wealthy condo owners and the subsidized renters."
3142,"The most eye-catching buildings are the Shed, a $500 million city-sponsored arts center, and the Vessel, a 150-foot-high, $200 million structure with 2,500 climbable steps."
3143,"There’s also a major dining complex, with restaurants run by celebrity chefs like Thomas Keller, David Chang, Michael Lomonaco, Costas Spiliadis and José Andrés."
3144,Half a dozen buildings are slated for construction west of 12th Avenue.
3145,Who built all of this? 
3146,"Mainly Stephen Ross, a billionaire developer who will move into a penthouse at Hudson Yards."
3147,How much did it cost?
3148,"The tax breaks and other government assistance for Hudson Yards have reached nearly $6 billion, according to public records and an analysis by the New School, my colleague Matthew Haag reported."
3149,That number is bigger than the $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that were part of the failed attempt to entice Amazon to open a campus in Queens.
3150,The Hudson Yards package included:
3151,• $2.4 billion to extend the No. 7 subway line
3152,• $1.2 billion for about four acres of parks and open space
3153,• $359 million in interest payments on bonds when revenue from the development fell short
3154,Some companies in New York City that planned to relocate to Hudson Yards were eligible for tax breaks:
3155,• $25 million for BlackRock
3156,• $5.5 million for L’Oréal USA
3157,• $14 million for WarnerMedia
3158,"Supporters of the project point out that the subway line and the park space benefit not only Hudson Yards, but also the neighborhood in general."
3159,[Read about the tax breaks and incentives behind Hudson Yards.]
3160,"Is Hudson Yards any good, architecturally speaking?"
3161,"The Times’s architecture critic, Michael Kimmelman, called the development a “relic of dated 2000s thinking, nearly devoid of urban design,” and akin to “glass shards on top of a wall.”"
3162,"“Hudson Yards glorifies a kind of surface spectacle — as if the peak ambitions of city life were consuming luxury goods and enjoying a smooth, seductive, mindless materialism,” he said."
3163,"The open space, he continued, “looks like it may end up being mostly a fancy drive-through drop-off for the shopping mall, a landscaped plaza overshadowed by office towers.”"
3164,[Read Mr. Kimmelman’s review.]
3165,"What does Mr. Ross, the Hudson Yards developer, say about the project?"
3166,"Mr. Kimmelman asked, half-jokingly, “Do you imagine this as a museum of architecture?”"
3167,"“Yes, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Mr. Ross said. “We are creating a museum of architecture and a whole new way of life.”"
3168,"He added, “This is New York as it should be, with everything you want at your doorstep.”"

3189,"Iranian holidays can be particularly difficult to celebrate in this country, as one Times op-ed contributor wrote last year: “While Chinese-Americans had Bruce Lee and Italian-Americans had Rocky Balboa, I had Ayatollah Khomeini and the hostage crisis.”"
3190,Awkward.
3191,"(Non-Iranians sometimes celebrate Nowruz, too, including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.)"
3192,"On Friday, I spoke with Dr. Rosa Nouvini, who, like me, was born and raised in New York and is of Persian descent. She has been celebrating Persian holidays all her life and is steeped in the traditions."
3193,"Compared with New Year’s Eve, “Nowruz has a deeper meaning for me,” Dr. Nouvini said. “It’s more togetherness, about roots.” She grew up on Long Island, recalling that her mother “would start spring cleaning a couple of weeks before” the occasion."
3194,The cleaning isn’t just symbolic: Nowruz is often celebrated by visiting family members at their homes.

3196,"First, offer food. (New York Times Cooking has 22 easy-to-make recipes for the Persian New Year.)"

3234,"DURHAM, N.C. — Political leaders in one of the most progressive parts of the South have dreamed for two decades about an ambitious plan for a transit line connecting Durham, the home of Duke University, with nearby Chapel Hill. Funds were pledged and renderings were drawn."
3235,"But in recent days, Duke, which has labored to turn around its reputation as a privileged cloister, has brought the plan to a shrieking halt. It unilaterally rejected the proposed light-rail route, which would have cut across its property. And the resulting moral outrage has felt strong enough to power a train."
3236,"Representative G.K. Butterfield, a North Carolina Democrat, said he was “appalled” by the university’s decision. Wib Gulley, a former mayor of Durham, compared it to the moment when Duke called in the police “to gas and beat students” amid civil rights protests in 1969."
3237,"And Kevin Primus, a former manager of the Duke men’s basketball team, said the rejection of the light-rail plan justified the school’s reputation among some African-Americans like him, who still occasionally refer to it as “the plantation.”"
3238,"“You have poor and working-class black people who would like to get to better employment in another location, and a whole community collaborating to make this happen, and you have Duke with veto power,” said Mr. Primus, 45, a member of a local transit and affordable housing group headed by Mr. Gulley."
3239,"So goes one of the more bitter and impassioned transportation battles in a country that appears to be of two minds about rail transit and its future role in a culture largely dominated by cars. While some American cities, like Seattle, Denver and Los Angeles, have embraced new transit plans that make extensive use of trains, other recent efforts have been stymied by clumsy politics, high price tags, and resistance of both the strictly ideological and the not-in-my-backyard varieties."
3240,"Last May, voters in the increasingly congested city of Nashville voted down a $5.2 billion transit plan that would have included light rail. And California has struggled to realize its ambitions for a high-speed train connecting Los Angeles and San Francisco, despite statewide Democratic Party hegemony."
3241,"In the South, another closely watched decision on rail transit will come on Tuesday, when voters in the populous Atlanta suburbs of Gwinnett County — a former Republican stronghold that is trending Democratic — will decide whether to tax themselves to expand Marta, the regional rail and transit system, into the county for the first time. Similar plans have been rejected by Gwinnett voters in the past."
3242,"Duke officials have said they are not opposed to light rail in general, only to this specific project. But the school’s liberal critics, many of them proud Duke graduates, sounded almost betrayed by the university’s opposition, seeing it as anathema to Duke’s call to “use knowledge in the service of society.”"
3243,"How, these critics wondered, could one of the world’s greatest universities — one that produced so many of the liberal intelligentsia who run the region — be so dead set against a big, bold, green idea like a light-rail line?"
3244,"Advocates for the train insist that the proposed 17.7-mile service could combat gridlock by linking Durham and Chapel Hill, home to the University of North Carolina, and would provide access to three major hospitals, as well as the historically black North Carolina Central University in Durham."
3245,"They also envision the train as a social justice engine, offering cheap, reliable transportation to the working people who scrape by, cooking and cleaning for the legions of college students in the Research Triangle, the area that includes the two college towns and Raleigh, the state capital."
3246,"Indeed, in recent days, as the regional transit authority, GoTriangle, tried unsuccessfully to persuade Duke to donate land for the project, proponents emphasized the history of town-gown tensions between working people in Durham County — a majority-nonwhite community where 27 percent of children live in poverty — and an elite private institution that did not admit a black student until the early 1960s."
3247,"“Given the long history of fraught relations between many low-income Durham residents and Duke University, supporting the project would be a brilliant way for Duke to reassert its good will to the community,” said a letter to Vincent Price, the president of the university, that was signed by more than two dozen members of the university’s Nicholas School of the Environment faculty."
3248,"But Duke officials are adamant that their objections to the project are serious and insurmountable. They said construction vibration and electromagnetic interference from the trains might affect sensitive research equipment at Duke’s sprawling medical campus, which the train line would skirt. And they are concerned about the project’s impact on the underground utilities that serve the medical center — and the threat of new lawsuits."
3249,"In their official rejection, administrators said the project, as proposed, would “jeopardize community health, public safety and the future viability of our enterprise.”"
3250,"At a packed campus meeting recently, most people in the audience appeared to be in favor of the train, snapping their fingers in assent as speakers questioned Duke’s wisdom. Drew Shindell, an earth science professor, noted that taxpayers in Durham and Orange counties had approved a transit sales tax, and that the train had the support of the major local government bodies."
3251,"Outside the meeting, Claire Wang, 20, an environmental studies major, Rhodes scholar and co-president of the Duke Climate Coalition, was passing out an information sheet. If Duke killed the plan, she said, it could thwart Durham officials’ broader progressive vision for a growing and rapidly gentrifying city."
3252,"“Many of the city plans surrounding sustainable development, poverty alleviation, and affordable housing are all centered on this light-rail project,” she said."
3253,"Duke officials bristled at suggestions that the school is insensitive to the needs of its neighbors. They pointed to an increasingly diverse student body, the university’s embrace of a $15 minimum wage, and major programs supporting Durham’s neighborhoods, public schools and public health."
3254,"Still, some critics wondered whether Duke was using its stated concerns as an excuse for other, hidden worries about the train. Like many rail projects before it, this one is imperfect, and there are a number of opponents besides the university."
3255,"The proposed line would not go to the regional airport, for example, nor to Raleigh, although there are future plans for a heavy-rail connection to the capital. The cost of the light-rail line — to be borne by local, state and federal taxpayers — has ballooned beyond $3 billion."
3256,"John Morris, a member of a Chapel Hill residents’ group that opposes the train, said that new buses would be cheaper, and quicker to put in place."
3257,"“This light-rail project won’t even be on the ground for 10 years, and is gobbling up the lion’s share of our dedicated sales tax revenue that would be used for transit,” he said."
3258,"Duke’s firm rejection has put the future of the entire project in limbo. The transit authority could choose a different route for the train, which would probably necessitate years of new planning and review, or it could stick to the current route and take the Duke property it needs by eminent domain."
3259,"Mark-Anthony Middleton, a Durham City Council member who is African-American, is among those who think the transit authority should consider the eminent domain option, calling it “the unsexy part of the work of racial equality.” A big selling point for the project, he said, was that it would serve predominantly black Durham neighborhoods that were badly hobbled in decades past by urban renewal projects and highway construction."
3260,"It is not a question of punishing Duke, said Mr. Middleton, a former student of the Duke Divinity School."
3261,"“Duke created this problem in many ways,” he said. “They created the voices and thinkers that are leading this pushback against them.”"

3304,"On Sunday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio appeared as himself — in animated form — on “The Simpsons,” his second time on the show. "
3305,"Mr. de Blasio does not pop up frequently in television shows or films, although he has made cameos on “The Good Wife,” a favorite of the mayor and his wife, Chirlane McCray. He also appeared, as he may now regret, on “Horace and Pete,” a niche barroom comedy created by Louis C.K., whose political support Mr. de Blasio had embraced until the comedian admitted to sexual misconduct last year."
3306,"The mayor’s second appearance on “The Simpsons,” however, is part of a longer-standing personal relationship with the show. He loves it. (His first appearance was a live-action cameo for the 2017 mock-documentary episode, “Springfield of Dreams: Legend of Homer Simpson.”) "
3307,"Before Sunday’s episode aired, Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, talked by phone about why he thinks “The Simpsons” is an “amazing American institution,” the role it played in the antinuclear power movement and why he is not bothered that it airs on Fox."
3308,The interview has been condensed and edited.
3309,Q. How did this appearance on the show tonight come about? I hear you’re carrying Grandpa Simpson.
3310,"A. They originally came to me around an episode that referenced New York, this was a while back. Then they came back and said they had this episode where Grandpa comes to New York City and they wanted to do an encounter with me. I was like: Anything “Simpsons,” I’m into. "
3311,"When you get invited into something that you truly love and truly admire, it’s like an otherworldly feeling — like crossing over into a new realm. The line between fact and fiction gets a little blurred. Are we real and the show is fake, or the other way around?"
3312,Do you have a line in the show?
3313,"I’m not sure I remember it perfectly, but it was basically a height joke."
3314,What’s your favorite episode? 
3315,I love “The Simpsons” because it’s subversive. It’s incredibly funny and constantly smart and insightful about this country.
3316,I think the episode where Sideshow Bob runs for mayor is sort of the ultimate critique — obviously that one is all about the Willie Horton ad and the 1988 presidential election — and it lays bare so much hypocrisy in one episode. That’s probably my all-time favorite.
3317,Which member of “The Simpsons” family do you most identify with?
3318,"Well, it’s kind of hard not to love Bart the most. I would say an honorable mention to Maggie. She’s often the voice of reason even though she can’t speak."
3319,So you see yourself in Bart and not in the more cerebral Lisa?
3320,"Look, you’ve got to admire Lisa’s earnestness and that she’s kind of the sane member of the ship of fools. But I think Bart, to me sort of heart and soul-wise, the spunk and the spirit and the willingness to disrupt — I’m more emotionally moved by Bart."
3321,Interesting. When did you start watching the show?
3322,Early on. When it started. From the beginning.
3323,"In the show, politicians are craven, corrupt and incompetent. What is it that resonates with you about the show’s vision?"
3324,"First of all, it totally parodies what’s wrong with the political system and what’s wrong with many politicians. Mayor Quimby is just an epic character because he is kind of the composite of everything wrong with traditional politics."
3325,"He’s a Democrat, don’t you think?"
3326,"Oh, I’m certain. It’s a Kennedy rip off, obviously. But it’s brilliant. "
3327,"There’s a rejection of a lot of status quo in there that I appreciate. And, of course, there’s a beautiful humanist element to the show. They figured out how to tell a lot of truth in a way that was light enough for people to get it, but still really edgy."
3328,"I was very involved in the movement against nuclear power early on. I marched at Three Mile Island after the incident in 1979. The portrayal of nuclear power in “The Simpsons” literally was one of the most important elements of changing America’s trajectory on nuclear power. There’s lots of things that happened, don’t get me wrong — I’m not trying to say “Simpsons” first — but they were actually a part of it. "
3329,Mayor Quimby agrees to build a monorail after a huckster sells him on it. Could a monorail solve New York City’s transit problems?
3330,"If Mayor Quimby likes it, I don’t like it. That’s my rule of thumb in life."
3331,"Some people see the BQX, a proposed light rail line to link Brooklyn and Queens, as a kind of monorail."
3332,"I think it’s a very different reality, to say the least. And look, we’ll veer into seriousness for a moment, the BQX is based on a national movement to light rail that’s been working — Oklahoma City, Salt Lake City, L.A. All over the country people are turning to light rail for good reason. "
3333,"That was part of the argument for the monorail: “Look, it worked in the towns of Brockway, Ogdenville and North Haverbrook. It could work in Springfield too!”"
3334,I love that. You’ve done your research.
3335,"Homer really didn’t like New York City and called it a place where “once the sun goes down, all the weirdos turn crazy.”"
3336,I thought that was one of the few moments where I disagreed with “The Simpsons.” But remember that episode — which I happened to see again recently — everyone else in the family loves New York. They’re all having an amazing time. It’s like a love letter to New York in so many other ways. It’s reverent toward New York for everyone but Homer.
3337,"If you could take Homer anywhere in New York City to change his mind, where would it be?"
3338,Oh wow. That’s one of those questions that will have me thinking all day long.
3339,Homer needs to see the beauty of our people so I would take him to my barbershop. I would take him to Astor haircutters to see all the different peoples of the world getting along. 
3340,"By going on “The Simpsons,” do you worry about appearing to lend support to Fox, given your longstanding critique of Fox News?"
3341,"No, I don’t. I think on the news side that Rupert Murdoch has very systematically worked to move America rightward and to create a lot of division. I’ve said quite openly that I don’t think there would be a Donald Trump as president without Rupert Murdoch."
3342,"But on the entertainment side, I have to acknowledge they have done some extraordinary work that doesn’t seem to conform with the ideology of the news side: “Sleepy Hollow,” which Chirlane and I love, an extraordinary show and obviously beautiful portrayal of an interracial couple. That was Fox. "
3343,I don’t know if you saw “Pitch” last year?
3344,No.
3345,"It actually was produced by an old friend of ours Eli Attie, who was a speechwriter for Dinkins with Chirlane back when. If I see something that I think is really moving and meaningful I’m not going to hold it against everyone involved that they happen to work for Fox."
3346,I was once a big fan of “The Simpsons” but basically stopped watching 15 years ago. Do you still watch and is it still relevant?
3347,"Oh yeah, I think it’s totally relevant. Certainly when the kids were into it, we would watch more. Dante in particular is a huge “Simpsons” fan. "
3348,"I still watch it sometimes because, you know, I see an episode I find particularly interesting. Like I saw one the other day which, I don’t know when it’s from, but it was the New Springfield versus the Old Springfield — which is like the ultimate tale of two cities episode. It was a brilliant breakdown of class division."
3349,How did you come upon it?
3350,"I just saw it. Sometimes I’ll channel surf and I just saw it and I said, “I’ve got to check this out."""
3351,I don’t picture you as a channel surfer.
3352,"I don’t get a lot of downtime, so one of the things that happens is, I have a plan with Chirlane, like we’re going to watch TV at this particular hour, we know what we want to watch together."
3353,"But if it’s just like a little break time in an evening, I’ll just randomly check out what’s on. "
3354,"What was your reaction to the controversy around the character of Apu, the convenience store owner voiced by Hank Azaria?"
3355,"I fundamentally believe that the people behind the show did not mean to offend. But what they should do is give other actors a chance to play a role like that. I think the character is pretty intrinsic to the show, but let an Indian-American actor have the opportunity to play that voice."
3356,Is your trip to Springfield part of a 2020 run?
3357,"Very clever. Unless I’m crazy, I’m not in Springfield in it. I thought I was in New York City."
3358,"Oh, are you? I haven’t seen the episode yet so I assumed you’d gone traveling."
3359,"What I would say for anyone who wants to be president of the United States, Springfield is an obvious stop. "
3360,"We could talk about this for much longer, but I know you’ve got to run."
3361,I guess I’d better get back to governing.
3362,Will you be watching the episode in Gracie tonight?
3363,Oh yes indeed. This is the high point of 2019 already for me.
3364,SUNDAY BUSINESS
3365,"An article in last Sunday’s special section on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds about the investing strategies of three mutual funds that outperformed the market in the fourth quarter of 2018 misstated the process for allocating the assets of the MFS Diversified Income Fund. The fund starts with allocations of 25 percent of assets to high-yield bonds and 15 percent to emerging-markets bonds, not with allocations of 20 percent to both those categories."
3366,TRAVEL
3367,"An article last Sunday about Puglia, Italy, as part of the 52 Places to Go in 2019 misstated who has been attracted to the region and its winemaking. It is the Antinori family, which operates the Tormaresca bistro in Lecce, not the owners of the London restaurant Bocca di Lupo."
3368,•
3369,An article on Jan. 6 about Jada Yuan’s experiences traveling the world for The New York Times described incorrectly the status of Puerto Rico. It is a territory of the United States; it is not its own country.

3371,"An article on Dec. 23 about hotels that have music events planned this year misstated who will be promoting the Beat Hotel festival in Marrakesh. The promoters are the group behind the Beat Hotel at Glastonbury, England, festival, not the promoters of the entire Glastonbury festival."
3372,•
3373,"The 36 Hours column on Nov. 25, about Denver, referred incorrectly to the train line connecting downtown to the airport. It is a commuter line, not a light-rail line. This correction was delayed because it was only recently brought to the editor’s attention."
3374,BOOK REVIEW
3375,"A review on Dec. 30 about “Tell Them of Battles, Kings, and Elephants,” by Mathias Énard, described incorrectly the terminal points of a bridge in that novel. Michelangelo designs the bridge to cross the Golden Horn in Constantinople; it is not “a bridge that will join Asia to Europe.” The review also misspelled the surname of the book’s translator; she is Charlotte Mandell, not Mandel. These errors were repeated in the Editors’ Choice column on Jan. 6."
3376,MAGAZINE

3382,"When I was 25, I lived on the edge of the Tenderloin in San Francisco, four blocks down from a towering gray cathedral. I knew at the time I could never be Catholic — too much patriarchy, too much guilt — but I also knew that the church up the hill was Episcopal, not Catholic. I wasn’t quite sure what the people there believed. But I’d been hounding my boyfriend, Bill, for a marriage proposal for more than a year, and after another 4 a.m. fight, we both needed relief."
3383,"“It’s Easter,” I said. “Let’s check out that church on the hill.”"
3384,"Six months later I was baptized. Bill wasn’t thrilled. Raised Catholic, he rejected all things religious in his teens, and part of our initial bond had been a mutual atheism. He teased: Didn’t I see that Episcopalians were wishy-washy relativists? If I was going to join ranks with Jesus freaks, I should choose a denomination with backbone! But at the cathedral, I liked what I saw: ritual without coercion. So Bill and I broke up for at least the sixth time. I moved and didn’t give him the address."
3385,"Come February, Bill was back, and he was desperate enough to propose marriage. By March I was Bill’s betrothed, sitting in the park across from the cathedral, listening to its tolling bells and nauseated without understanding why."
3386,"Also by March, it was Lent. The idea of Lent was new to me. These 40 days were modeled on Christ’s 40 days in the desert, a season for self-searching. Though the Bible readings through this period warn against performing dourness for the sake of impressing people with your piety, the church itself goes stark: rough, burlaplike vestments instead of shiny finery; no “alleluias.” What odd theater, I thought. It seemed peculiar that a church of such positivity would still make a 40-day space for what our post-pop-psychology culture seemed to declare Americans should reject: guilt."
3387,"What I didn’t understand yet is that Lent concentrates guilt, then cathartically explodes it — it’s a kind of intermissionless Bergman matinee that leads you stumbling back across the parking lot beneath the newly blinding sun. By depriving you of just one vanity, just one of the many little distractions you’ve unthinkingly accumulated, Lent provides space for your guilt. This is not about cultivating bad feelings, but slowly disrobing them, letting them reveal their true nature. But this requires curiosity, and surrender."
3388,"Through the four Lents of my engagement and marriage, I participated with the casualness you might expect of the denomination that came from Henry VIII’s wanting a divorce. I fasted from chocolate and rubbed the black smudge off my forehead as soon as I left the pew on Ash Wednesday. Go to confession? How melodramatic."
3389,"Then came my divorce. Somehow through four years of spousal commitment and existential crisis, I went to the cathedral every Sunday. Divorced, I found myself clinging to the structure desperately. But given the circumstances, weren’t modifications reasonable? The divorce wasn’t my fault. I had to leave! And hadn’t the shame of divorce inflicted enough darkness? What luck then to meet a hot guy on OkCupid just before Ash Wednesday. “Remember that you are dust, and to dust you shall return,” the priest whispered, as he wiped the ashen cross on my forehead, but I could not suppress a smile."
3390,"Holy Week begins on Palm Sunday and continues through Maundy Thursday, the evening service that re-enacts Christ’s creating the first communion and washing his friends’ feet. The organ echoes. Here and there people rise from the pews to sit at the altar rail and remove their shoes and socks, to let a robed near-stranger pour water and rub their calluses. When the washing is over, the priests turn to the altar, stripping it of its cloth. In the cathedral’s recesses, one light after another is extinguished. The crucifix behind the pulpit stands shrouded. The clergy exit. Then: a silent, empty cavern."
3391,"The second Lent after the divorce, I wondered why I’d begun to feel a nagging guilt about Bill, but only watched all the rituals from the pews. All through the next year that unnameable guilt dogged me, until I longed for Lent to come. That Lent, I reread all my journals detailing our courtship. I remembered how earnestly and wholeheartedly he proposed, and I remembered my first reaction, the one I’d redacted from my memory: It’s too late."
3392,"That third Lent, on Maundy Thursday, I watched the priests and servers walk out, leaving in my line of vision an empty concrete wall. I collapsed in the pew, sobbing. A verger came and held me. He took me to the chapter house. I said I needed a priest. And so there I was, on Good Friday, with a priest at the rail. She said I had to name the sin. Three Lents had prepared me. I realized, that spring, that I had loved Bill, but by the time he proposed, I had started to change. But I was 25 and scared and lonely. I buckled. I married Bill for the security; I married him selfishly."
3393,"I told the priest, “I betrayed him.”"
3394,"She said that once we said the words from the Book of Common Prayer together, I had to leave the sin behind. I walked out of the cathedral a different person."
3395,"Guilt, in stasis, becomes pathology. Lent, openly entered, gives guilt space, nakedness and, most important, narrative progression. The season is a passage, moving us from paranoia to metanoia, from being literally out of our own minds to being reconciled with our true minds through repentance. Deprivation itself can be a gift."
3396,"When you’re designing a home, it’s easy to get carried away dreaming about pricey sofas, rugs and art. But big-ticket items aren’t as important as they seem, and plunking down the money to buy them is no guarantee you’ll end up with a home you love. "
3397,Often it’s the small touches that make a space feel truly inviting and memorable.
3398,"“Style is in the mix of things,” said Cliff Fong, founder of the Los Angeles interior design firm Matt Blacke. “It doesn’t take any imagination, or any level of taste, to go to a big-box store or an Italian design store and buy everything. That just takes deep pockets.”"
3399,"If you’re willing to take your time — hunting for special yet affordable pieces and doing the work yourself — he said, “There’s a way to approach design at any budget.”"
3400,"To help, we asked Mr. Fong and other interior designers for ideas about how to make a big impact on a small budget."
3401,"“We all know that the biggest bargain in the world is a gallon of paint,” said Jeffrey Bilhuber, an interior designer whose upscale clients include Anna Wintour and Iman, but whose new book from Rizzoli, “Everyday Decorating,” offers punchy decorating tips for everyone."
3402,"A fresh coat of paint on walls that have become smudged over the years will immediately renew a room, and a change of color can transform it. “Color connotes confidence,” Mr. Bilhuber said, and painting the walls a bold one “means that you’re confident in the place that you live.”"
3403,"Paint can be used to cover more than drywall. Will Cooper, a partner and the chief creative officer at the New York firm ASH NYC, said that a quick fix for lackluster wood floors is to paint them."
3404,"In his own East Village apartment, he said, “The floors were cheap strip oak that I sanded and painted the same color as the walls and ceiling,” using an oil-based floor paint. "
3405,"“It made a huge difference and changed the whole atmosphere,” he said, by making the space seem bigger and brighter."
3406,"In smaller rooms, he recommended painting brick walls after giving them a light skim-coat of plaster to reduce surface irregularities. Although many people prize exposed brick, he said, “it can suck energy and light from a room.” Painting it lightens things up, while leaving an appealing texture."
3407,"Mr. Fong suggested using a contrasting paint color to play up attractive molding, or even to create a wainscot effect. “Painting a line of color that’s about three feet high and goes to the ground is a really nice, interesting way to add a visual vector,” he said. “If you want to get fancy with it, put a chair rail at the top.”"
3408,"Changing a room by swapping out throw pillows is such a well-worn concept, Mr. Bilhuber said, that “if somebody says ‘change your pillows’ one more time, I’m going to change my job.” But, he admitted, that doesn’t make the strategy any less effective."
3409,"Adding pillows and a throw in a bright color to a sofa can make a statement in a living room, Mr. Bilhuber said, and you can do the same in a bedroom with minimal expense."
3410,"“You can change your bedding in a flash by just changing the pillowcases. They could be daffodil yellow, garnet or sapphire blue — boom,” he said. “Keep everything else straightforward.”"
3411,"Another easy, affordable way to bring color into a space, Mr. Bilhuber suggested, is with new lampshades. “Buy yellow instead of white,” he said — or choose aubergine, as he did for his home in Locust Valley, N.Y."
3412,"Mr. Cooper offered similar advice. “You can get off-the-shelf shades in all different shapes, sizes and colors, which will change the look of a lamp super easily,” he said. For a client in TriBeCa, Mr. Cooper installed black shades on vintage 1970s Pierre Cardin lamps, which gave them “a whole new point of view and a little glamour.” "
3413,"Or try painting white lampshades with stripes, as Mr. Cooper sometimes does, to make them a striking visual feature."
3414,"“Change your light bulbs — it can be that fast and economical,” Mr. Bilhuber said. “I walk home at night and see some of the most egregious mistakes when I look up into apartment houses.”"
3415,"Specifically, Mr. Bilhuber said, he sees too much bright bluish-white light. “You should always use warm light, whether it’s incandescent or LED,” he advised, which typically means installing bulbs with a color temperature of 3,000 Kelvin or lower."
3416,"Next, he said, “Bring down the wattage. You do not need to be cutting diamonds in your apartment. Low levels of lighting improve the mood.” "
3417,"This can be accomplished with lower-wattage bulbs, three-way bulbs or dimmers."
3418,"“If you want to take it a little bit further, add picture lights,” Mr. Bilhuber continued, either over paintings or behind pottery on tables. “You’re controlling how you visually navigate your way through the apartment by turning spots of light on certain objects and highlighting their beauty.”"
3419,Not every piece of furniture and accessory needs to be a showstopper. A single distinctive object can create a focal point and enhance the appearance of a larger space. 
3420,"“One special thing can elevate a whole room,” said Vanessa Alexander, the founder of Alexander Design, in Santa Monica, Calif. “We always try to include something vintage or one of a kind in every room. It’s something that can’t be easily replicated and has a story.”"
3421,"In one Malibu, Calif., home, Ms. Alexander added a 1950s chair by Osvaldo Borsani to a corner of the living room. It is as much a sculptural element, she noted, as a place to sit."
3422,"For her own home in Malibu, she found a perforated, brass-globe pendant lamp at a flea market and had it rewired as a statement piece for a sunroom. “It adds a textural moment,” she said. “And at night, it gives off a pattern” when illuminated."
3423,"These pieces needn’t be expensive, said Mr. Fong, who is known for creating interiors filled with vintage treasures, including a home he designed with Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi that featured a room with a beaten-up wooden ring on one wall and a collection of vintage mirrors on another."
3424,"“A lot of those mirrors came from flea markets and thrift stores,” Mr. Fong said. “You go to the flea market and find an amazing tray, interesting tabletop items or interesting art, and it can really do a lot for an environment.”"
3425,"In his new book, Mr. Bilhuber writes that “art can animate a room even if it isn’t trophy art.” Expanding on that idea, he explained that you don’t need to spend thousands of dollars to put art to work in an interior."
3426,"“Some of the chicest projects I’ve ever worked on had masterworks next to framed posters,” he said. “Go to MoMA and get a $100 masterwork in poster format, and make no excuses. It’s human, it’s real, it’s humble.”"
3427,Or buy pieces by lesser-known or unknown artists simply because they appeal to you.
3428,"Better yet, Mr. Bilhuber said, work with what you already have. “You’re always going to have those five pictures you’ve had since your first apartment,” he said. “Take them down and start fresh. Lay them all out on the floor and look at them together. Just rehanging them in a way that is more uniform, or like a collage, can make the difference.”"
3429,"While the things you see and touch get the most attention when designing a home, scent can also play a role."
3430,"“Find a room scent you love,” said Mr. Bilhuber, who prefers home-fragrance sprays over scented candles. “There can be a difference between your apartment and everyone else’s. There can be a difference between what’s happening in the hallway and your living room.”"
3431,"His favorite, he said, is Amber & Smoke from Paddywax’s Apothecary collection."
3432,"“I use it every night before I go to bed,” he said. “Two or three spritzes and you’re transported to a completely different place than where you were two seconds before.”"

3434,"An unusual group of storm systems battering the Pacific Northwest has halted dozens of flights and knocked out power for thousands, hitting Seattle with as much snowfall in one day as it usually receives in a year, according to the National Weather Service."
3435,Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington declared a state of emergency on Friday.
3436,"“Everyone in our state needs to focus on preparing for the snow and staying safe,” he said in a statement. “Weather forecasters predict this may be a storm unlike one we’ve seen in many years. I encourage everyone to stay off the roads if possible and plan ahead if you must travel.”"
3437,"In one day, 7.2 inches of snow were recorded at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. “Our average snowfall is around seven inches for the season,” said Jeff Michalski, a meteorologist with the weather service."
3438,"“It is a lot of snow at once to deal with across the region,” Mr. Michalski said. “There is another system that is going to come in tomorrow.”"
3439,"More than 200 flights have been canceled at the Seattle airport on Saturday, according to Flight Aware, the flight-tracking website. Power failures have affected over 60,000 customers in Washington, according to Puget Sound Energy."
3440,"Washingtonians will get a brief break from the snow during the day on Sunday before the storm resumes heading into Monday, producing another four inches or so of snow across the state overnight, according to Mr. Michalski."
3441,Seattle has made more resources available for residents and the city’s sizable homeless population.
3442,"“The city continues to work to limit the impact of this winter storm on residents and access to services,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said on Saturday. “The city is preparing for additional 1-3 inches of snow throughout today, and monitoring forecasts for the potential of additional snow ahead of Monday morning’s commute.”"
3443,"On Thursday, a 59-year-old man was found dead of exposure at a light-rail station in Seattle, The Seattle Times reported."
3444,The Seattle Police Department announced additional efforts to get people out of the cold.
3445,"“We are adding additional emergency services to care for our vulnerable homeless community,” including dedicating Police Department vans to transport people to shelters, the department said on Twitter on Friday."
3446,"Rex Hohlbein, the founder of Facing Homelessness, a nonprofit organization that provides homeless people in Seattle with things they may need, has been handing out fuel, heaters, tents and tarps to those who are at risk in the frigid weather."
3447,"“People that are living in tents right now, outside, when you get a cold snap like this they often don’t want to leave their tents and go to a shelter because if they do their stuff can be stolen,” Mr. Hohlbein said in a phone interview."
3448,"Last year, Facing Homelessness counted 8,500 homeless people in the streets of Seattle, some in shelters and some living in tents or under bridges. Mr. Hohlbein said the number might have climbed up to 10,000."
3449,"“We know we are not going to be able to help everyone, but to the people we do give help to, it makes a difference,” he said."
3450,"Early Saturday, Mr. Hohlbein handed a small tank of fuel and a heater to a man who had spent the previous night under a bridge."
3451,"“You could see they are happy to get this stuff,” Mr. Hohlbein said. “He told me, ‘God, it was cold last night, I could barely stand it,’ when I gave him the heater.”"
3452,"Celine’s new Madison Avenue flagship is where Hedi Slimane’s debut collection for the house is now for sale. In October, critics incinerated these clothes, so brokenhearted were fans of Phoebe Philo’s vision for Celine when they saw the 96 looks that seemed to say only: “Yeah, I party.” "
3453,"Then, on March 1, Mr. Slimane showed his second collection: a litany of archive-sourced culottes, horse-laden hardware and trim jeans. It was old-old Celine, a collection from the source. The response was positive. Was this shift proof of the power of discourse, or merely a company hitting a target somewhere between Chloé and Hermès? "
3454,"But in store, before the second collection was shown, all I had was the first impression, the first non-Philo collection hanging from large rails above the lava stone floor. Grouped together on the center rail were basics: a peacoat, blazers and shirting, hung apart from the mini metallic dresses they were styled with on the runway. "
3455,"You can see them from the sidewalk, along with the wood seats and even the register. In fact, the photographs accompanying this column were taken through the store’s large windows because Celine declined requests to shoot in the store. I call this high-visibility, low-transparency move “shoptics.” "
3456,"My friend, a Philo-phile and “old Celine” regular, was drawn to a calf-length black cashmere coat ($4,850) with a leather belt. The salesman opened a mirrored door in the dressing area so she could observe the back. His invitation? “Let’s have a party.”"
3457,"I was told that all of the clothes are unisex (I was only the second person to try on a $26,400 metal shirtdress made of fine knitted chain; a male salesperson braved it first), but also that the men’s wear is selling well. “Men have been repeat customers already,” a salesman told me."
3458,"They sure have. To dedicated Slimane customers, this “new” Celine hardly needs introduction. They’ve bought it all before: pants so tight it takes a jump to unwedge an Adderall from the pocket; a densely sequined blazer that reflects specks of phone light in a dark club; and a leather jacket to throw on whenever it’s time to suck nicotine between now and dawn. "
3459,"Perhaps Mr. Slimane’s magic is that he soothes his spend-ready audience: Wherever he goes, he promises things won’t change too much. Rock ’n’ roll. Forever."
3460,"In the dressing area, the “party” was on. The salesman pointed to the beautiful seams that bound the back of my friend’s coat, details that, I appreciated, wouldn’t be visible at night. “The lines that make the drape echo the lines of the Brutalist modernity of the store,” he said. "
3461,"The coat’s construction was a celebration, but instead my friend left the store with one of the last bags in stock designed by Ms. Philo, a blue-green leather tote. “The reason that I would choose to go to Celine is because of her depth,” she told me. “It’s not the lines or craftsmanship. It’s feeling understood.”"
3462,"As I clicked through photos of Mr. Slimane’s first Celine collection, I felt like raw pork in a bag of dry bread crumbs: contextless, shaken and coated in stale. Celine was wiped clean! Ms. Philo’s ode to aspirational womanhood was gagged with a puff sleeve and tossed into a leather canyon!"
3463,"Now, I feel nothing. The shock of new Celine was a reminder that brands are not culture. They’re companies. The design spoke to you; the house charged you. The culture has no set boundary, while brands are defined by their territories."
3464,"With this realization, the party really started. Perhaps it was all the beautiful marble. I made party conversation, asking about a red rock in the back of the store that was part of an art installation. I was told to make sure I didn’t miss the “semi-distressed cube” that is also art in the store, so I went and looked at that cube. "
3465,"It was there that I ran into someone I knew but did not expect to see, just like at a real party: a salesman from Balenciaga uptown who knows I am an author of this column. The most “party” moment: When he walked away, I hoped he wasn’t going to talk about me. "
3466,"I think it’s really smart that the new Celine store sells single earrings. LVMH, the luxury group that owns the label, will make a lot of money. The earring I liked was $1,800. I don’t have that money. I never even shopped at “old Celine.” The bag I eBay-ed when Ms. Philo took over in 2010 was by Michael Kors, who designed the label from 1997 to 2003, but people assumed it was Ms. Philo’s design. I have no idea what, if anything, this means."
3467,"When I asked to look at the earring, the salesman put on black gloves and passed it over the lighted glass case. The bags were handled with black gloves, too. As shoppers, we were allowed to touch these things with our hands. "
3468,"We also touched a black-and-white-checkered pony-hair coat ($17,900), which a salesperson described as “substantial.” It fit my girlfriend, who guessed the price exactly. When I asked how, she said she imagined what she would theoretically pay for it and doubled it. Then doubled that."
3469,"I tried on a leather jacket with a “V” of rhinestones down the front, a set of migrating birds sparkling in the sky ($7,600). In the mirror, I felt that if I were a party animal, this is what I’d be."
3470,"A week later, I woke up to the silence of exciting news on the internet. I opened my phone and saw Hedi Slimane’s new old-old collection for Celine, right in the middle of Celine’s brand territory. See it in stores this summer."

3497,"• The Times also reported that a prominent critic of the plan, State Senator Michael Gianaris, is no longer set to join an obscure state panel that could have given him veto power over the deal. Leroy Comrie, a Queens state senator, recently replaced Mr. Gianaris as the nominee to the panel, known as the Public Authorities Control Board."
3498,"• The day after that news broke, a full-page ad appeared in The Times, signed by more than 70 prominent supporters, urging Mr. Bezos to reconsider. The ad said Mr. Cuomo would “take personal responsibility for the project’s state approval.”"
3499,"• On the day the ad appeared, Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview that Mr. Gianaris and another prominent critic of the deal, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, were “irrelevant because there are other ways the state can get it done.”"
3500,"• As one Albany reporter humorously noted, Mr. Cuomo’s latest push seemed to resemble an article from the satirical news outlet The Onion, which pictured the governor furiously chasing down a limousine carrying Mr. Bezos."
3501,"The takeaway: This is not all about Amazon. The company hasn’t commented, and Mr. Cuomo said he had no reason to believe the deal was back on. But Mr. Cuomo is signaling to other businesses: New York is still primed for deals that create jobs."

3547,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration, setting the stage to move forward with one of its most consequential climate-policy rollbacks, announced Thursday that it had decided to scrap negotiations with California over the president’s plan to undo Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks."
3548,The move makes a protracted legal battle almost certain. At the heart of the talks was California’s longstanding right to opt out of national auto emissions rules and set its own tailpipe standards. State officials have vowed to sue to protect that authority if the administration tries to impose weaker federal standards on California and the dozen states that follow its lead.
3549,"Xavier Becerra, the California attorney general, said Thursday the state was “prepared to defend our national Clean Car standards even if the Trump administration intends to go AWOL.”"
3550,"Under rules established by President Barack Obama’s administration to cut planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions from tailpipes, national fuel economy standards would nearly double by 2025. The Trump administration said in August that it intended to freeze that measure after 2021, when new cars must average around 30 miles a gallon. It also said it would challenge the right of California and the states that follow its lead to set their own rules."
3551,"There appears to have been very little movement in the negotiations since they began almost a year ago, and both sides on Thursday accused the other of negotiating in bad faith."
3552,"“Despite the administration’s best efforts to reach a common-sense solution, it is time to acknowledge that CARB has failed to put forward a productive alternative,” a White House statement said, referring to the California Air Resources Board, the state’s clean air regulator. “Accordingly, the administration is moving forward to finalize a rule later this year with the goal of promoting safer, cleaner and more affordable vehicles.”"
3553,"Stanley Young, a spokesman for the air resources board, said meetings between the sides had been held but “were always at a superficial level, with no effort to engage in a conversation.”"
3554,"Mandy Gunasekara, who served as principal deputy assistant administrator in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Air and Radiation before leaving this month to start a private consulting business, and who was involved in the talks, said that California had put forward only one counterproposal: a plan to delay implementation of the fuel economy rules by one year. Trump officials saw that as a nonstarter."
3555,"“Looking at it now, it seems they were more interested in stalling the progress of the conversation than actually working to make a deal,” Ms. Gunasekara said."
3556,"The decision to abandon talks does not necessarily mean that a final proposal from the administration is imminent. The E.P.A. had planned to complete the rollback proposal by the end of March, but the partial government shutdown early this year set that target back to May or June, agency officials said."
3557,"Automakers, who fear that competing rules will bring chaos to the domestic auto industry, called for continued talks."
3558,"“We continue to believe there is a middle-ground solution that supports the goals of the administration, state of California, as well as automakers,” said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, which represents automakers and parts suppliers with operations in the United States."
3559,"“We always knew achieving one national program would be challenging,” said Gloria Bergquist, a vice president at the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which represents the country’s biggest automakers. But a compromise “is worth striving for,” she said. “We encourage everyone to keep focusing on how we get there.”"
3560,The announcement comes amid fast-deteriorating relations between Washington and California.
3561,"In recent weeks the Trump administration has said it was terminating a $929 million federal grant for the state’s struggling high-speed rail project, and the Transportation Department said it was exploring legal options to claw back $2.5 billion that had already been spent. President Trump has also threatened to cut off federal funding for wildfire relief after devastating blazes that killed 89 people."
3562,"Mr. Trump also lashed out on Twitter when 16 states sued over his decision to declare a national emergency in order to obtain funding for a border wall, writing that California, “the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!”"

3565,"Entering the newest train station in Miami is a bit like walking into another world. With natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, the modern building is bright, sleek and full of thoughtful amenities. Outlets and USB ports are at every seat, free Wi-Fi is available at the entranceway, and the entire structure smells lovely, thanks to a signature scent wafting through the corridors (grapefruit, orange and lemongrass with a touch of vanilla)."
3566,"The multibillion-dollar Brightline train that stops at this station offers the only private intercity passenger train service in the country. The diesel-electric system currently connects Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. In 2021, it will expand to Orlando, with groundbreaking scheduled for later this year. Brightline partnered with Virgin last November, and will soon be rebranded Virgin Trains USA. "
3567,"As fewer people in the United States apply for driver’s licenses and more take ride-sharing services, the team behind Virgin Trains believes that this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit. And they are starting with top urban areas in Florida."
3568,"“We recognized this major mobility problem that was starting to present itself between densely populated too-short-to-fly but too-long-to-drive areas, and we saw it as an opportunity,” said Patrick Goddard, president of Brightline. "
3569,"An alluring promise to passengers is a shorter trip. In Florida, the train stops at stations along Interstate 95, but compared to that stretch of highway, where speeds average around 34 miles per hour, the train chugs along at up to 79 miles per hour. That cuts the hour-long drive from Fort Lauderdale to Miami in half; the hour and a half drive between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach is cut to 45 minutes. The train has mostly been used by commuters, but company officials hope that it will appeal to more tourists. "
3570,"The MiamiCentral station will soon be home to Central Fare, a new food hall, and is a 10-minute drive from Port Miami, the busiest cruise port in the world. That station also connects to public transit options like the Metrorail and the Tri-Rail. In Orlando, stations will be located at Walt Disney World and at Orlando International Airport, to entice travelers to hop onboard. "
3571,"In December, Doug Maesk and his husband took the train from their home in Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach for a day trip. The journey by car would have been annoying, he said, while the train ride was very smooth and quiet."
3572,"“The seats were so comfortable, there was an attendant offering snacks and drinks,” Mr. Maesk said, noting that they didn’t travel first class. “Just being on the train was a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon and it was a really nice way to travel.” "
3573,"He said that he and his husband are likely to use the train to Orlando to avoid the three-and-a-half to four-hour drive, and would spend the time working instead of sitting in traffic. "
3574,"“We just wanted to try the train once,” Mr. Maesk said. “But now we’re really looking forward to them expanding to Orlando, so we can save time and be productive at the same time.” "
3575," Brightline’s Mr. Goddard said that the company, to set itself apart, has invested deeply into the details in its stations and on its trains."
3576,"“The transportation business is rife with stories of bad experiences, whether it is airplanes or public transit or even a bad Uber driver,” Mr. Goddard said. “We wanted to be the antithesis of that.”"
3577,"Along with its signature scent (scented candles are also available for purchase), the Miami station offers a gourmet coffee shop, a play area for children and electric scooters to rent. The station and the train are A.D.A. compliant and accessible to people in wheelchairs, and train bathrooms are touchless. A deal with Lyft allows passengers to pay for train tickets and a ride under the same tab, and the free Wi-Fi is available from the instant you enter the station to the time you depart the train at your destination."
3578,"Smart, Smart Plus and Select are the three class options. Tickets cost between $10 and $30 each way. Smart is the main class, which the company says is equivalent to business class and which it suggests commuters, families and groups take. Smart Plus costs a bit extra and includes one complimentary snack and beverage on each trip. Select is the train’s first-class experience, which provides access to station lounges that offer wine and charcuterie, and scented cold hand towels. "
3579,"All passengers, regardless of their class, are allowed up to two carry-on bags for no extra fee, with an option also to check luggage. They can also bring up to one cat or dog on the train, and the company is working on allowing passengers to book seats for their pets. "
3580,"President Trump was right to walk away from his summit with Kim Jong-un rather than accept a bad nuclear agreement, but the outcome underscores that he was bamboozled last year at his first summit with Kim. Whatever genius Trump sees in the mirror, “the art of the deal” is not his thing."
3581,"At this meeting, Kim apparently sought a full end to sanctions on North Korea in exchange for closing only some nuclear sites. That was not a good deal, and Trump was right to walk rather than accept it."
3582,"“Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, but we couldn’t do that,” Trump said, adding: “Sometimes you have to walk.”"
3583,"President Reagan famously marched out of a 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, rather than accept an arms control agreement with Russia that he regarded as flawed. A year later the Russians returned with better terms and a deal was made — and we can all hope that something similar will happen this time."
3584,"[Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]"
3585,"Still, there are significant risks ahead. The most important is that North Korea may return to testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, for that would mark a huge escalation of tensions and renewed concerns about brinkmanship and war."
3586,"Unfortunately, North Korea is an otherwise unimportant country that gets attention only when it behaves provocatively. So its leaders have learned that their best leverage is to fire missiles, detonate warheads, or start up nuclear complexes."
3587,"While Trump was right to walk in this case, he also seems to have played his hand poorly in the run-up to the summit. In particular, he signaled that he eagerly wanted a deal and that “fantastic success” was likely, all of which probably led Kim to raise demands in the belief that Trump would fold."
3588,"With normal presidents, summit deals are largely agreed upon ahead of time. As one veteran diplomat put it, presidents pull rabbits out of hats, after diplomats have worked diligently ahead of time to stuff the rabbits into the hats. But Trump has never had much patience for that meticulous diplomatic process, instead placing excessive faith in breakthroughs arising from personal relationships — and his faith was clearly misplaced this time."
3589,"The North Korean side had refused to hash out the summit outcome in advance with the highly regarded U.S. special envoy, Stephen Biegun, presumably because Kim thought that he could outfox Trump in person in Hanoi the way he had in Singapore nine months ago."
3590,"The collapse of the latest talks also underscores how misguided Trump was at that earlier meeting. He didn’t understand that Kim uses “denuclearization” to mean something different than the meaning in the United States, and he gave Kim the enormous gift of legitimacy that comes with a summit, without getting anything comparable in return."
3591,"It is also distasteful to see Trump praising Kim and referring to him as “my friend” and a “great leader,” and, last year, asserting that Kim had sent him “beautiful letters” and that “we fell in love.” It’s perfectly appropriate to engage with ruthless dictators, but fawning over them is a betrayal of our values."
3592,"In Vietnam, Trump might also have shown Kim what freedom of the press looks like. Instead, the White House barred four American reporters from a dinner after two of them had shouted questions for Trump."
3593,"Still, if the risk is of a return to high tensions ahead, it’s also possible to foresee a path that over time does make progress with North Korea. I tend to agree with skeptics who believe that Kim has zero intention of ever giving up his nuclear weapons stockpile — that’s what North Koreans told me on my last visit to the country in 2017 — but there is still room for diplomacy that leaves the world better off."
3594,"In particular, Kim seems willing to reach a bargain on continuing his moratorium on testing warheads and missiles and on freezing production of nuclear fuel at his complex on Yongbyon, and those are worthy goals if the price is not too high. A reasonable price would be relaxation of sanctions on inter-Korean projects, such as South Korean manufacturing, tourism and rail projects in North Korea."
3595,"Those inter-Korean initiatives also have value in that they may over time help normalize North Korea, give it a stake in the outside world, and undermine the regime’s authority."
3596,"That kind of limited deal should be an aim of diplomacy going forward, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in — who helped start the peace process between North Korea and the West — is well placed to pursue it, with American backing."
3597,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
3598,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
3599,"Land where there was none before. A careful ratio of places to live, work, eat and recline on lawns. A sense of being in New York, but not quite of it."
3600,"At first blush, Hudson Yards and Battery Park City, cities-within-a-city on the western edge of Manhattan, would seem kindred spirits."
3601,"But Hudson Yards, which is to wrap up by 2026, will have taken 18 years to complete its gleaming clump along 10th Avenue — and it remains to be seen how quickly the rest of the neighborhood will develop. Battery Park City, which lumbered across the finish line in 2011, took 45 years to fully form."
3602,"Battery Park City stretches across more space along the Hudson River in the financial district, but a similar number of buildings make up the two master-planned, mixed-use communities, which have both also enjoyed tax breaks and other public benefits."
3603,"Why Hudson Yards was able to come together quickly, relatively speaking, has a lot do with how the approach to creating whole-cloth neighborhoods has changed over the years, as the private sector has stepped in to fill voids left by the government, according to city officials, brokers and developers."
3604,"But also, vibes have changed. What was architecturally appealing a few decades ago now seems staid. Planners say that if the past was about fitting in, the present is all about standing out. In the end, they add, Battery Park City and Hudson Yards represent very different theories about development."
3605,"“Hudson Yards represents the 21st century, and Battery Park City represents the end of the 20th century,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “They are just totally different.”"
3606,Both Hudson Yards and Battery Park City hatched from efforts to remake once-industrial areas that were not living up to their potential. 
3607,"Dirt unearthed during the construction of the first World Trade Center in the mid-1960s, plus sandier fill, allowed Battery Park City to essentially be sewn onto the edge of Manhattan, creating a bumped-out shoreline where rotting piers for fruit and vegetable shipments had stood before. "
3608,"But to make the 92-acre swath more than just a park required a huge investment: in sea walls, water pipes and electrical lines. And constructing that infrastructure fell to the state, which had to borrow a lot of money to make it happen. In 1972, the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority, the neighborhood’s quasi-public governing body, had to sell $200 million in state-guaranteed bonds — considering inflation, about $1.2 billion in 2019 dollars — to set the table for development."
3609,"But by 1979, there was still almost nothing to show for it. (The barren and beachy terrain drew sunbathers for years.)"
3610,"With payments on those bonds coming due, and little in revenue to pay its debt, the Authority had to sell even more bonds, $65 million worth, to avoid default. Doubling down on their bet, officials were buying time until rent-producing structures went up. It wasn’t until 1982 that the first building, the Gateway apartment complex, with 1,712 units, opened."
3611,"Hoping to avoid another dragged-out process, the city took a different tack with Hudson Yards, a 28-acre parcel being developed by the Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group at the heart of the neighborhood of the same name, where other projects are also underway."
3612,"Most of the Hudson Yards site is ribbed with railroad tracks, by way of the John D. Caemmerer West Side Storage Yard, where Long Island Rail Road trains rest before heading back to Nassau County."
3613,"To create the development site, the tracks had to be covered. But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the property, wisely avoided building that platform itself, said Tom Wright, the president and chief executive of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research group."
3614,"By punting to Related and Oxford, which paid $1 billion for the rights to the site and built the deck, the M.T.A. made sure taxpayers wouldn’t be on the hook, said Mr. Wright, whose group supports the project."
3615,"“Battery Park City required the public to take on a lot more risk,” he said. But with the Hudson Yards model, “whether Related goes belly up, or not, is not our problem.”"
3616,"As a private entity, Related, the lead developer, was also able to work relatively quickly and avoid being subjected to shifts in public opinion. If the M.T.A. had been responsible for building the platform, for example, a subway crisis might easily have diverted its attention and stalled the project."
3617,"A bit of forethought also worked in the project’s favor. In the 1980s, when the Transportation Authority was undertaking a $196 million project to turn a defunct freight depot into the 30-track Hudson Yards rail yard, Richard Ravitch, who was then the chairman, realized the air above the new yard had great potential."
3618,"So he added enough space between the tracks to allow columns to stand between them, while also fortifying the ground to support huge weights. The groundwork for Hudson Yards was laid."
3619,"In 2008, the state received six proposals to develop the site and initially awarded development rights to Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center. But as the Great Recession gathered steam, Tishman, which lost a key anchor tenant, Morgan Stanley, soon backed out, and Related took over."
3620,"Having fewer people calling the shots may also have helped. Battery Park City was constructed by a parade of companies, including Milstein Properties, LeFrak Organization and Zeckendorf, plus commercial builders."
3621,"But Hudson Yards is the result of a single company, which is a huge advantage, said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor under Michael Bloomberg who pushed hard for the rezoning that created Hudson Yards as part of the city’s unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics. "
3622,"“What’s very different is that one developer built the commercial and residential and retail space,” said Mr. Doctoroff, who has firsthand knowledge of both places. Early in his career, he worked at 200 Vesey Street in Battery Park City for Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that was one of the neighborhood’s first office tenants. He is now chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, a city-focused technology company headquartered at 10 Hudson Yards, the area’s first commercial tower."
3623,"As part of the Olympics proposal, a football stadium that would have become the home of the New York Jets would have been built on the western half of the train yards, but state officials spiked the plan in 2005 in the face of community opposition."
3624,"Mr. Doctoroff said he is still proud that the rezoning of the broader Hudson Yards neighborhood has allowed warehouses, parking lots and billboards to give way to stylish modern towers."
3625,"While Battery Park City may embody the lessons of the urbanist Jane Jacobs, who favored short blocks, Hudson Yards can feel derived from her opposite, master builder Robert Moses, whose approach was often big and muscular."
3626,The fits-and-starts history of Battery Park City is also evident in its varied designs.
3627,"Plans for Battery Park City went through multiple iterations. It started with a 1966 “towers in the park” plan for apartment buildings to house World Trade Center employees that Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic for The New York Times, called “sterile high-rise towers in vacuous open space.” The plan estimated about 90,000 residents, a far cry from the 16,000 there today. "
3628,"By 1969, the Authority had scrapped that plan in favor of a more architecturally ambitious one, from Philip Johnson and other architects, that featured a mix of six-sided towers and smaller buildings with walls that sloped like pyramids. A third version in the 1970s added more offices, but was revised again in 1979 because corporations had started migrating to the suburbs to escape a crime-troubled metropolis."
3629,"“I think the original designers were people that didn’t like the city very much, because they kept giving a cleaned-up view of what the city could be,” said Stan Eckstut, the architect who, along with Alexander Cooper, was tapped for that fourth version."
3630,"Aiming for a traditional extension of Manhattan, Mr. Eckstut aligned streets with existing ones in the financial district, while creating small blocks, in a Jacobs-type gesture."
3631,"Today, Battery Park City is probably best known for its brick-and-stone buildings, many from the 1980s, after developers finally came around, although there are exceptions, like the parabolic Visionaire, a condo high-rise built in 2008. The last two apartment buildings to go up, in 2011, were the rentals Liberty Luxe and Liberty Green. "
3632,"Many blocks have an unvarying appearance, the urban equivalent of a subdivision, and critics have pounced on that conformity."
3633,"Rent-regulated housing is a modest percentage of the total. But a portion of payments collected by the Authority — residents don’t pay property taxes, but fees that are similar — goes to New York City to be spent on affordable housing development elsewhere in the city, though it has been tapped for other purposes. Last year, the city took in $197 million, according to the Authority."
3634,"People who work in Battery Park City are clustered in Brookfield Place, a warren of interconnected office buildings interspersed with shops formerly known as the World Financial Center, whose enclosed, climate-controlled walkways evoke, in a sense, Johnson’s vision. Also inside is the Winter Garden, an airy, skylighted space with 16 palm trees that holds events like Best Brews, a New York-focused craft-beer tasting."
3635,"In 2015, after a four-year, $300 million effort, landlord Brookfield Properties revealed a renovation of the retail spaces, including Le District, a 30,000-square-foot French-style market and Hudson Eats, a food hall dedicated to New York-only restaurants."
3636,"Brookfield also installed high-end shops, but the mall’s anchor tenant, a multilevel Saks Fifth Avenue department store, closed this winter after less than two years. Competition for upscale shoppers is stiff because Westfield, a sprawling mall in the nearby Oculus transportation hub, is a quick walk away."
3637,"Outdoor green spaces include Teardrop Park, whose rocky walls recall the Catskills, and Rockefeller Park, whose wide-open lawns offer Hudson views."
3638,"“The sentiment seems the same between us and Hudson Yards. It’s ‘I want to be in a Manhattan that doesn’t feel like Manhattan,’” said Wesley Stanton, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate."
3639,"“But from a sales perspective, it’s very different,” Mr. Stanton said. While apartments at 15 Hudson Yards, a condo that opened this winter, average $3,300 a square foot, he noted, prices in Battery Park City are lower, as at the Ritz-Carlton condo, where units average $2,300 a square foot."
3640,"The blocks at Hudson Yards, by contrast, don’t feel as plugged into the street grid. The view ahead when walking west on West 31st Street, which ends at the development, is of the site’s soaring seven-story mall and the tall logo of its most prominent tenant, Neiman Marcus."
3641,"Streets like West 33rd will eventually bisect the site, and there are other ways in. But the site poses an inconvenient hindrance, in the form of that platform, which in places is the equivalent of three stories in the air, Mr. Doctoroff said. If parts of the site feel like a Moses-style superblock akin to Lincoln Center, that’s likely the explanation, he added."
3642,"Since 2012, when Related broke ground, buildings have been slow to arrive. But last month, much of the first phase, between 10th and 11th Avenues and West 30th and West 32nd Streets, opened to the public. The second phase stretches west to the West Side Highway, and the platform over that portion of the rail yards has yet to be built."
3643,"Inside the mall, upscale shops like Cartier, Rolex and Molton Brown line conventional-looking corridors. Dining options seem light years ahead of the food courts of old, including Thomas Keller’s TAK Room, David Chang’s Kawi and the Drug Store, a “nonalcoholic bar.” There is also a compact outpost of Citarella, the gourmet grocery chain, while Battery Park City leans on a pair of Gristedes."
3644,"Trees and greenery, for now, are limited. But public spaces that recently opened include Vessel, a shiny sculpture that encourages climbing, and the Shed, an all-purpose and telescoping arts center. "
3645,"There was hardly free rein at the site, said Marianne Kwok, a director of the architecture firm KPF, which has worked from the get-go on the platform, site plan and buildings. Designers had to sift through “two telephone-book-size books of rules and regulations,” said Ms. Kwok, who analyzed Battery Park City, among other neighborhoods, for inspiration."
3646,"Unlike in Battery Park City, each Hudson Yards building had to have a singular appearance; some towers angle and others curve. Every corporate tenant “wants to have brand,” Ms. Kwok said. Indeed, Hudson Yards is also a far cry from the homogeneous Rockefeller Center, the 1930s complex considered a master-planning pinnacle. “Individuality is now what’s desired,” she said."
3647,"It may be working. A hefty 82 percent of the office spaces in the eastern half of the site, which is mostly commercial buildings, has been spoken for, even though some of the buildings are not yet open, according to Related."
3648,"Tackling mostly offices first was an important decision, Mr. Moss said. “The game plan is genius,” he said, adding that an office tower can be filled with a handful of tenants, unlike an apartment building, which needs hundreds of them and can take much longer to fill."

3828,*The Hudson Yards development site compared to the Battery Park City neighborhood | **Projected | ***Includes about an acre of city park between Hudson Yards Nos. 50 and 55
3829,By The New York Times
3830,"Now Related has a nice critical mass to publicize the residential buildings on the unbuilt western half, he said, dismissing criticisms that the affluent enclave is not for everyday New Yorkers: “They took a rail yard and made it a productive part of the city’s economy.” "
3831,"Overall, Related will have to build 1,300 units of housing that are affordable, or reserved for those in certain income brackets. Those units can be built on site or elsewhere."
3832,"Less public money has flowed to Hudson Yards, the development, than to Battery Park City, but the amount spent in the neighborhood has not been insignificant. The city has had to pay $359 million in interest on bonds for infrastructure projects, although property taxes are supposed to start covering that debt now that buildings are open."
3833,"Assessing the success of the condos is tougher. The first building, 15 Hudson Yards, went on the market two and a half years ago, and is only 60 percent sold. And 35 Hudson Yards began selling its units, which start at $5 million, in March."
3834,"Battery Park City has a ferry stop, but no subway service. But at Hudson Yards, a four-year-old 7 train stop is on site. Brokers remain confident that the subway service will be key to the project’s success, even as critics have called the $2.4 billion transit project, which sits near several Related buildings, a pricey subsidy."
3835,"Criticism of change doesn’t surprise Roger Del Valle, a prop stylist who has lived in Manhattan since 1995 and owns a studio in the Flatiron district, but is hunting for a home in Hudson Yards."
3836,"“I know people have mixed feelings about Hudson Yards,” said Mr. Del Valle, who has visited the mall and enjoys its “spark.” “But it’s a part of New York City now. And ignoring it is not going to make it go away.”"

3838,"WASHINGTON — President Trump boasted recently that he has been “FAR tougher” on Russia than other American presidents. But while the Trump administration has cracked down on Russian diplomats, government officials and oligarchs, Mr. Trump himself largely has taken a far more generous stance toward Moscow."
3839,"The contradiction has taken on new meaning in light of several recent reports, including one on an F.B.I. counterintelligence investigation that was opened in 2017 into whether Mr. Trump had secretly acted on Russia’s behalf — one facet of the Justice Department’s investigation into Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election. "
3840,Here are five key ways in which Mr. Trump has been at odds with his own administration over Russia in the past year.
3841,"Mr. Trump’s go-it-alone decision in December to pull 2,000 American troops from Syria set up a dramatic clash with top officials in his administration and prompted protest resignations by Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, and Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State."
3842,"Just weeks later, the White House national security adviser, John R. Bolton, directly contradicted Mr. Trump’s proposed timeline, putting conditions on the withdrawal of forces and suggesting a significant delay."
3843,"The president’s order also drew concern and criticism from some of Mr. Trump’s supporters, including Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican, who met with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey over the weekend and called for a slower withdrawal to avoid setting off a broader war."
3844,"Also in December, Mr. Trump announced the removal of 7,000 troops from Afghanistan, an abrupt decision that stunned American and Afghan officials."
3845,"When Russian forces took 24 Ukrainian sailors captive late last year, senior officials in the Trump administration gave the president options for responding. They included new sanctions or increasing NATO’s naval presence in the Black Sea. But Mr. Trump has not yet taken action, even as administration officials insist options are still being considered and as Europe coordinates a response."
3846,"In November, responding to the standoff, Mr. Trump canceled a meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia at a forum of the Group of 20 industrialized economies. At a dinner on the sidelines of the meeting, however, Mr. Trump told Mr. Putin that a resolution was needed. Yet he has sought to blame both sides in the conflict, saying merely that he did not “like what is happening.”"
3847,Russia has extended the detention of the sailors and demanded a trial on charges of border violations.
3848,"Privately, Mr. Trump was irritated by his administration’s response to the 2018 poisoning of a former Russian spy living in England that the British authorities have said was carried out by Russian agents. He was initially upset that 60 Russian diplomats and intelligence officers were expelled from the United States in response to the attack, given that European nations were not expelling the same number."
3849,"Later, Mr. Trump opted against new sanctions against Russia for its support of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria after a chemical attack near Damascus that killed more than 40 people. Mr. Trump believed the sanctions, which had been announced by Nikki R. Haley, then the United Nations ambassador, were unnecessary in light of a missile strike against Syrian targets."
3850,"And when the Trump administration began imposing a series of sanctions against Russian individuals and organizations in retaliation for cyberattacks and interference in the 2016 election, the president appeared out of line with his own cabinet."
3851,"In July, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  overstated the Trump administration’s push for the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which the president signed into law in 2017 after it passed the Senate with a veto-proof majority. Mr. Trump approved it only hesitantly, first attempting to weaken it and criticizing it as “seriously flawed.”"
3852,"During a news conference in July in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. His comments — with Mr. Putin at his side — generated a sharp backlash from Mr. Trump’s aides and congressional allies."
3853,Those tensions flared again this month after The Washington Post and others reported that Mr. Trump attempted to hide notes from one of his meetings with Mr. Putin in 2017 from his own advisers.
3854,"Since then, the president has largely stopped expressing public confidence in Mr. Putin. Yet Mr. Trump has continued to downplay Russia’s election interference, even as the investigation led by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, has repeatedly showed how extensive it was."
3855,"In October, the Justice Department brought its first charges against Russia for interfering in the 2018 midterm elections, releasing a joint statement from several of Mr. Trump’s top cabinet officials decrying the attempts. Mr. Trump, however, was mostly silent on the indictment, and instead sought to paint himself as a protector of elections while also blaming the Obama administration for keeping quiet about election meddling during the 2016 presidential campaign."
3856,"Senior administration officials have told The New York Times that Mr. Trump has privately, and repeatedly, said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which would buttress Mr. Putin’s eagerness to weaken the group."
3857,"Mr. Trump, countering the formal position of his administration, has railed against NATO. He has said that the alliance was “going out of business,” and that its member nations were not paying their fair share of costs. After visiting NATO headquarters in Brussels in July, Mr. Trump claimed inaccurately that NATO spending was increasing “because of me,” misrepresenting how the alliance functions."
3858,"Other administration officials, particularly in the military, are continuing to strengthen ties with NATO allies. Over the weekend, the United States Navy sent an American destroyer to the Black Sea, a move that Russia quickly denounced."
3859,So Donald Trump is a champion of women. Who knew?
3860,"He’d been hiding that facet of himself diabolically well all these years, as he grabbed them by parts of their bodies that newspapers try not to mention and showed them special derision on Twitter, comparing Stormy Daniels to a horse and Omarosa Manigault to a dog. A shallow, casual observer might rush to judgment and conclude that he didn’t fully respect the opposite sex."
3861,But his remarks and bearing during his State of the Union address on Tuesday night surely corrected that impression.
3862,"He beamed at the rows of women in white, female House members who were seated together and dressed in a single hue to make a statement about their progress and their strength."
3863,"It was to them that he targeted his assertion that “no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year.”"
3864,"He then addressed them even more directly: “Exactly one century after Congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than at any time before.”"
3865,"Indeed we do. There are 102 in the House. But here’s the thing: That group includes 89 Democrats and just 13 Republicans. History was made courtesy of the party that he worked hard in the midterms to defeat, that he works hard all the time to diminish and that he repeatedly trolled in the rest of his remarks on Tuesday night. If he’d had his way and sway, those rows of white would have been sparser. But he neither exhibited any awareness of that nor made any resolution to improve his party’s stubbornly miserable record of recruiting and promoting female candidates."
3866,"Instead he basked in the women’s — and the Democratic Party’s — accomplishment as if it were his own. “That’s great,” he told them. “Really great. And congratulations.”"
3867,"It’s nice to be Trump. His bragging is unencumbered by his past. His self-satisfaction crowds out any self-examination. What he needs isn’t a fact check. It’s a reality check, because his worst fictions aren’t statistical. They’re spiritual."
3868,"He pretends to care about matters that don’t move him in the least. He feigns blamelessness in situations where he’s entirely culpable and takes credit in circumstances where he has more to apologize for. He presents himself in a positive light, as one kind of person, when his actions paint him in a negative light, as a different character altogether. Many of his biggest lies are to himself."
3869,"The State of the Union address was a herky-jerky testament to that. I say herky-jerky because it was six or eight or maybe 10 speeches in one, caroming without warning from a plea for unity to a tirade about the border; from some boast about American glory under Trump to some reverie about American glory before Trump (yes, it existed!); from a hurried legislative wish list to a final stretch of ersatz poetry that read like lines from a batch of defective or remaindered Hallmark cards. As much as Trump needed modesty, his paragraphs needed transitions."
3870,"But there was a leitmotif running through the disparate patches, and it was Trump’s readiness to reassemble recent history and reinvent himself."
3871,"If you didn’t know that he was a champion of women, then you probably also didn’t know that he saved us from war with North Korea. He alone can fix it! And according to him, he did fix it, or is fixing it, never mind what his intelligence chiefs told the Senate Intelligence Committee just last week. They had doubts about his supposed success on that front. He doesn’t. So he’ll cling to his version. It’s the one that flatters him."
3872,"On Tuesday night Trump suddenly cared about diversity and minorities, and abandoned much of the divisive lexicon that he had used over the first two years of his presidency, most memorably when he attached a fecal epithet to countries with largely black populations."
3873,"On Tuesday night he ached for Americans with H.I.V. or AIDS. I can’t recall them being on his radar much before, but I do recall that he or other members of his administration worked to expel transgender people from the military, appoint homophobic judges and argue against civil rights protections for L.G.B.T. Americans."
3874,"On Tuesday night he excoriated wealthy Americans who benefit from undocumented immigrants even as those immigrants (supposedly) diminish less wealthy Americans. He made no acknowledgment of his own use of undocumented immigrants at the Trump golf resort in Bedminster, N.J. Two of them, in fact, were invited by Democrats to the speech."
3875,"On Tuesday night he said that we Americans “must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism or those who spread its venomous creed.” And he himself has not ignored those who spread it; rather, he has defended and encouraged them — by accepting their support during his campaign, by re-tweeting them, by insisting that some of the white nationalists who marched in Charlottesville, Va., and railed against Jews were good people."
3876,"On Tuesday night he called for comity. He yearned for bipartisanship, at least when he wasn’t modeling the opposite. “We must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution,” he said, and it was like an alliterative butcher declaring that we must reject red beef. He urged that we “rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors.” Might he try out some of that rekindling on his Twitter account, which, even in the hours before his speech, was a font less of love than of spite? President, heal thyself."
3877,"But most incongruous of all was his feminism, closeted until Tuesday night. He framed his concerns about illegal immigration in terms of migrant women being sexually assaulted on the way north to our border with Mexico or sold into prostitution by traffickers."
3878,"And then there was the shout-out to women in the workforce. During it, female House members stood, and some pumped their fists in the air. He registered surprise at first, followed by satisfaction, as he seemed to realize that their moment could also be his moment; that he could, for this one instant, hallucinate mutual respect and pantomime common cause; that he could just slough off all his sins and latch on to a spurious grace."
3879,"“Don’t sit yet,” he told them when he feared that they would end their celebration too soon, before his next great pronouncement. “You’re going to like this.”"
3880,"Even the newly, briefly, falsely sensitive version of Trump couldn’t lose his bossy streak — or stop hungering for, and predicting, the next round of applause."

3883,"From about 359 Canadian dollars, or about $272 at current exchange rates."
3884,"All hotel openings involve some drama, but the St. Regis Toronto — the brand’s first property in Canada — comes with an epic back story. Born in 2012 as the Trump International Hotel and Tower, the mixed-use project endured a litany of well-publicized problems, from flying glass building panels to political protests. After new owners deleted the Trump name last year, Marriott International took control of the property, temporarily rechristened it the Adelaide, and undertook a swift, stealthy St. Regis rebrand. The “new” St. Regis opened in late November. I was there in late December and, surprisingly, Trump-era décor hadn’t been updated in most guest rooms; instead, Marriott splurged on an extravagantly modernist lobby, a $5 million restaurant, and two splashy ultraluxury suites."
3885,"The hotel’s location, within the concrete canyons of the Financial District, makes up in convenience what it lacks in glamour. Attractions like St. Lawrence Market, Scotiabank Arena, and Bell Lightbox — a cultural center that is the home of the Toronto International Film Festival — are less than 15 minutes away on foot. The Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport downtown can take just a quarter-hour by cab; five minutes gets you to Union Station, Toronto’s grand rail hub. But this stretch of Bay Street can hollow out on evenings and weekends, and you’ll need a car or public transit to reach more intriguing neighborhoods — or for dining options sexier than nearby chains."
3886,"My rather cheerless 22nd-floor superior king room boasted beige wallpaper, an armchair in chocolate-brown damask, and a TV atop a functional-looking dresser of ash-gray veneer. There was no art on the walls; a monochromatic nature print above the headboard provided the sole decorative touch. Painted silver, a desk at the window offered some whimsy, until I noticed extensive peeling along its sides. An iHome docking clock radio sat on one nightstand. Panels on both sides of the bed allowed full control of lighting and drapes — a thoughtful touch. Cotton sateen Frette bed linens, crisp but soft, felt like heaven. The overall mood was mid-2000s corporate affluence; the front desk told me guest rooms are slated for minor tweaks, but not major upgrades."
3887,"With white-marble floors, double black-marble sinks, a soaking tub and a separate rain shower stall, the spacious bathroom proved the highlight of my stay. Frette also makes the plush, diamond-embossed towels exclusively for St. Regis. The toilet sits behind an actual door, lending some privacy, but its white plastic seat cover was so heavily scratched it appeared vandalized. A faux-leather garbage can under the double sink was peeling badly. A built-in television illuminates the bathroom mirror; if the volume is turned up while the guest room television is on, the sounds cancel each other out. "
3888,"A content-free check-in — small talk, keys, “Enjoy your stay” — left me unaware of vaunted St. Regis amenities like butler service, which is included in the room rate and apparently includes packing/unpacking and “coffee or tea service upon arrival.” When I inquired, an attendant told me that only Starwood Preferred Guest members “with certain status levels” had access (a spokesman told me butler service has since been rolled out property wide). Likewise, a St. Regis-branded BMW, used to chauffeur guests around town, sat idle in the hotel driveway; “it’s for local trips on weekdays,” the front desk informed me. Canadian goodies — Naked Snacks nuts from Vancouver, Spudnik’s potato chips from Toronto — dominated the in-room minibar, along with soft drinks and top-shelf liquor like Bombay Sapphire gin and Grey Goose vodka. I found room-service menus in my room but no guides to hotel facilities. The compact 31st-floor fitness room requires two elevator rides and a saunter past smartly dressed throngs outside the hotel’s glam restaurant —- slightly awkward for me in a tank top and shorts. The worn-looking spa, called The Spa for now, is due for a face-lift this year, a receptionist told me."
3889,"Louix Louis, the St. Regis’s glossy, buzzy new restaurant, feels transplanted from another hotel. An Art-Nouveau-in-outer-space ambience, courtesy of Toronto-based DesignAgency, complements the chef Guillaume Robin’s precise, Canadian-accented creations, like cold-smoked BC scallops and seared Quebec duck breast, along with 320-dollar Osetra caviar and a 75-dollar whole chicken. Dinner felt too much like a scene for a solo diner, so I opted for breakfast, when the gold-and-rose-hued room felt like a bar after closing time. My trout avocado toast (18 dollars) included mottled avocado atop bright-orange fish, and its “tomato compote” resembled supermarket salsa. Coffee (5 dollars) was potent, at least. DesignAgency also transformed the southern end of the dowdy former Trump lobby into the Astor Lounge, a sleek, neutral-toned spot for light snacks and drinks."
3890,"The ghost of a Trump hotel lingers. Generically luxurious, the St. Regis still feels like a work in progress — not really acceptable at this price point. High-rolling Marriott/Starwood loyalists might enjoy some coddling; in the meantime, Toronto is now home to a plethora of luxury properties with stronger personalities."

3894,"If you’ve heard a lot recently about the Green New Deal but still aren’t quite sure what it is, you are not alone. After all, it has been trumpeted by its supporters as the way to avoid planetary destruction, and vilified by opponents as a socialist plot to take away your ice cream. So it’s bound to be somewhat confusing. We’re here to help."
3895,[A Green New Deal is Technologically Possible. Its Political Prospects Are Another Question.]
3896,The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change. 
3897,"Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries."
3898,"The resolution is nonbinding, so even if Congress approves it, nothing in the proposal would become law."
3899,"Variations of the proposal have been around for years. Think tanks, the Green Party and even the New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman all have had plans for tackling climate change that they labeled a Green New Deal. But after the 2018 midterm elections, a youth activist group called the Sunrise Movement popularized the name by laying out a strategy and holding a sit-in outside the office of Nancy Pelosi, the soon-to-be-speaker of the House of Representatives, to demand action on climate change. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez joined the protesters, lending her support to their proposal and setting the groundwork for what ultimately became the joint resolution."
3900,Yes.
3901,"Republicans have cast the Green New Deal as a socialist takeover and say it is evidence that Democrats are far from the mainstream on energy issues. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, plans to bring the plan to the floor as early as next week. Democrats say that the vote would be a stunt because Republican Senate leaders do not want to have a sincere debate about climate change."
3902,The goal of the Green New Deal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the worst consequences of climate change while also trying to fix societal problems like economic inequality and racial injustice.
3903,"[You can get updates on the Green New Deal, and all our climate coverage, in our weekly climate newsletter. Subscribe today for free.]"
3904,"The resolution uses as its guide two major reports issued last year by the United Nations and by federal scientists who warned that if global temperatures continue to rise, the world is headed for more intense heat waves, wildfires and droughts. The research shows that the United States economy could lose billions of dollars by the end of the century because of climate change. Currently, carbon emissions are rising, by 3.4 percent last year in the United States and by 2.7 percent globally, according to early estimates."
3905,"Supporters of the Green New Deal also believe that change can’t just be a technological feat, and say it must also tackle poverty, income inequality and racial discrimination."
3906,"You can read it for yourself here, but here are the essential elements: It says the entire world needs to get to net-zero emissions by 2050 — meaning as much carbon would have to be absorbed as released into the atmosphere — and the United States must take a “leading role” in achieving that. "
3907,"The Green New Deal calls on the federal government to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create high-paying jobs, ensure that clean air, clean water and healthy food are basic human rights, and end all forms of oppression."
3908,"To achieve those goals, the plan calls for the launch of a “10-year mobilization” to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. It envisions sourcing 100 percent of the country’s electricity from renewable and zero-emissions power, digitizing the nation’s power grid, upgrading every building in the country to be more energy-efficient, and overhauling the nation’s transportation system by investing in electric vehicles and high-speed rail. "
3909,"To address social justice, the resolution says it is the duty of the government to provide job training and new economic development, particularly to communities that currently rely on jobs in fossil fuel industries."
3910,"President Trump has claimed the Green New Deal will take away your “airplane rights.” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, told Hugh Hewitt, the conservative radio host, that the proposal would confiscate cars and require Americans to “ride around on high-speed light rail, supposedly powered by unicorn tears.” And Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming and chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, warned that ice cream, cheeseburgers and milkshakes would be a thing of the past because under the Green New Deal, “livestock will be banned.”"
3911,The resolution doesn’t do any of those things.
3912,"To be sure, there is some confusion about what the Green New Deal does and doesn’t say. That’s partially the fault of its sponsors, who botched the resolution’s initial rollout."
3913,"Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s office initially sent to reporters, but later disavowed, a fact sheet that included some controversial ideas, like guaranteeing economic security including to those “unwilling to work.”"
3914,"The resolution does call on the federal government to make investments in policies and projects that would eventually change the way we design buildings, travel and eat. For example: cows. To reduce methane, a powerful greenhouse gas that cows and other livestock emit, the resolution proposes “working collaboratively with farmers and ranchers in the United States to eliminate pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector as much as is technologically feasible.”"
3915,"The resolution itself also steers clear of endorsing or rejecting specific technologies or sources of energy, something that Mr. Markey said was done purposefully to encourage broader support for the plan."
3916,"The Green New Deal takes its name and inspiration from the major government makeover, known as the New Deal, launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to help the United States recover from the Great Depression."
3917,"That series of public-works programs and financial reforms included the Civilian Conservation Corps (which put people to work in manual labor jobs like planting trees and constructing park trails) and the creation of the Public Works Administration to work on the construction of bridges, dams, schools and more. "
3918,"Like the original New Deal, the Green New Deal is not a single project or piece of legislation. "
3919,That’s not clear yet.
3920,President Trump claimed it would cost $100 trillion. Supporters of the Green New Deal say climate change could be equally costly to the American economy. For now it’s impossible to pin down dollar figures on the plan.
3921,Some examples of why: 
3922,"One conservative think tank has pegged the cost to the federal government of providing Medicare-to-all at $32 trillion over 10 years, but supporters claimed it would actually save taxpayers $2 trillion over 10 years. "
3923,"Converting the country to 100 percent clean power? In Vermont alone, which has a goal of achieving 90 percent renewable energy by midcentury, the cost is estimated at $33 billion. Yet the state is seeing job growth in clean energy sectors and expects the transition will spur cost savings for consumers. "
3924,"Modernizing the electrical grid across the United States could cost as much as $476 billion, yet reap $2 trillion in benefits, according to a 2011 study issued by the Electric Power Research Institute."
3925,"Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has acknowledged that the Green New Deal is going to be expensive, but contends the plan will pay for itself through economic growth."
3926,"Some Republicans have called for a technology-oriented solution to climate change, but so far no critic has come out with an alternative that matches the scale or scope of the Green New Deal."
3927,"There is going to be a lot more political jockeying around the Green New Deal in coming weeks and months. Republicans have already launched video ads trying to tie Democrats to the proposal, which they have described as “radical.”"
3928,"And Mr. McConnell’s vote is directly aimed at making life uncomfortable for Democratic presidential contenders like Kirsten Gillibrand, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris. Those senators have all co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution but in some cases have avoided specifics. Ms. Klobuchar, for example, told CNN she saw the Green New Deal as an “aspiration” and “something that we need to move toward.”"
3929,"At the same time, all of the attention on the Green New Deal has put new pressure on Republican critics to come up with their own plan for cutting greenhouse gases."
3930,It is likely that the Green New Deal will remain a lightning rod throughout the 2020 presidential campaign.
3931,"For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter."
3932,John Hickenlooper’s boots weren’t made for hiking.
3933,"Were they even boots? We couldn’t decide. They occupied some limbo between boots and shoes and were all wrong for the trek that our group of six was taking: seven hours, about 10 miles, over a 12,500-foot-high pass  in Colorado’s Rocky Mountains."
3934,"Just a few hours in, he briefly took them off. Dear God. Blisters, blood: Just looking at his feet hurt. But he waved away our concerns, did some crude bandaging, switched into a pair of ordinary sneakers that he happened to have in his backpack and insisted that we press on. He walked more slowly, sure. But he smiled to the end."
3935,"That episode, from August 2015, captured Hickenlooper at his best: upbeat, affable and allergic to drama. For November 2020, could that kind of disposition be the ticket?"
3936,"So much analysis of the Democratic presidential hopefuls characterizes them in ideological terms: left versus center, idealism or pragmatism, the revolutionaries and the incrementalists. So much is about gender, race and age."
3937,"But we should also look at these candidates in terms of the fierceness of their rhetoric and the sharpness of their edges. Do we want a livid warrior or a happy one? Someone eager to name and shame enemies, the way Donald Trump does, or someone with a less Manichaean outlook? Someone poised to reciprocate Trump’s nastiness or someone incapable of it?"
3938,"[Get a more personal, less conventional take on political developments, newsmakers, cultural milestones and more with Frank Bruni’s exclusive commentary every week. Sign up for his newsletter.]"
3939,I’m not entirely sure which type is more likely to defeat him. But I know which gives us a better chance at healing America — if that’s even possible — and moving us past a juncture of crippling animosity. It’s the type that Hickenlooper represents and maybe even exemplifies.
3940,"He jumped into the race on Monday as a long shot with limited name recognition. But he has a biography and a résumé that warrant attention. He didn’t enter politics until his early 50s, after a hugely successful career in beer — in brew pubs, to be exact. And he talks, persuasively, about what a customer-service business like that taught him about courting people rather than confronting them, about pacifying instead of inflaming."
3941,"As the mayor of Denver from 2003 to 2011 and then the governor of Colorado from 2011 until the start of this year, when he left office because of term limits, he was known for swearing off negative political ads, for gravitating away from divisive issues and toward whatever common ground he could find, and for a style with substantial measures of goofiness and geekiness but barely a pinch of truculence. That said, he marshaled toughness and persistence — as he did on that hike — to build a light rail system in Denver, expand Medicaid in Colorado, enact gun control and tug the state from recession to boom times that were the envy of other governors. "
3942,"He has detractors, who say that he can be more self-consumed and prickly in private than in public. And it’s unclear whether he can project the authority and sense of purpose on the national stage that are crucial for a successful presidential campaign and presidency. It’s unclear, too, whether a Democrat with a record as moderate as his has a chance in the party’s primaries."
3943,"I’ve known him since late 2010, when I traveled to Denver to do an in-depth profile of him for The Times Magazine. Afterward we became friendly, which isn’t surprising. In contrast to Trump’s demonization of the media as the “enemy of the people,” Hickenlooper usually takes the view that if he’s open to and trusting of journalists, he’ll be treated fairly more often than burned. There’s an endearing generosity of spirit in that."
3944,"Hickenlooper and his first wife, the journalist Helen Thorpe, divorced during his first term as governor, but did so with such grace and good will that she dedicated her 2014 book, “Soldier Girls,” to him. At her big Denver reading, he sat in the front row."
3945,"And I remember a dinner years later at the Denver home belonging to him and his second wife, Robin Pringle, when he happened to spike a fever shortly before we eight guests arrived. He nonetheless hung in there, bantering with us for hours as if nothing was wrong."
3946,"Optimism, warmth and joy matter. They propelled Ronald Reagan to the presidency. I think they’re even a small part of the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez phenomenon — the part that leavens the stridency and purity tests. She has a wide, dazzling smile. In a video that went viral, she dances."
3947,"Some of the Democrats who are pursuing or seriously considering presidential bids are better at dancing, metaphorically speaking, than others. It doesn’t come easily to Bernie Sanders, which is why he added all that poignant family history to his big speech on Saturday, or to Elizabeth Warren, which is why she sipped a beer in an Instagram video that was part of her rollout. It’s effortless for Beto O’Rourke. It’s present in Cory Booker. It comes and goes with Kamala Harris, who’s still calibrating her temperature."
3948,"Hickenlooper sees a sunny approach — one that emphasizes aspirations over grievances — as the necessary balm for a grossly divided country and the most potent antidote to Trump. In a phone conversation on Tuesday morning, he said that when the president pursues “these relentless accusations against all manner of people, he’s not just attacking those individuals. He’s also attacking all the people who admire those individuals and feel those individuals represent them.”"
3949,"“It’s early in the campaign, so it’s hard to assess whether it’s going to be something that I have to work around or something that really attracts people — the fact that I focus on trying to create a context that’s less adversarial,” he told me. “I’m not trying to prove why I’m right or the other side is wrong. I’m trying to really listen to people.”"
3950,"I’ll dance to that, whether I have the right footwear or not."
3951,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
3952,I invite you to sign up for my free weekly email newsletter. You can follow me on Twitter (@FrankBruni). 
3953,This article contains spoilers for “True Detective” Season 2. Agree with the writer’s defense? Couldn’t disagree more? Let us know in the comments. 
3954,"The first season of HBO’s “True Detective,” which aired in 2014, ended with Rust Cohle (Matthew McConaughey) and Marty Hart (Woody Harrelson) looking up at the night sky, lamenting the darkness."
3955,"Still, Rust was optimistic: “You ask me, the light’s winning,” he said."
3956,"Season 2 upended that optimism by transporting the series from Louisiana to Los Angeles, a place where the stars are smothered by smog. People hated it, complaining in particular about convoluted plotting, questionable casting and an unrelentingly bleak tone. The season was so widely considered a failure, that the fate of “True Detective” seemed to hang in the balance for almost two years before a third outing was confirmed. It debuts Sunday on HBO."
3957,But was Season 2 really that bad? This suspect was wrongfully convicted.
3958,"With the third season already receiving positive buzz, Season 2 of “True Detective” is likely to disappear into the history books of prestige TV. But it doesn’t deserve that fate. It was ambitious, complex television, anchored by strong performances and expert direction. (You heard right.) And its tableau of political corruption feels even more relevant today than it did in 2015."
3959,[Read the review of Season 3 by our TV critic James Poniewozik.]
3960,"Season 2 stars Colin Farrell as Ray Velcoro, a cop in a fictional California city named Vinci (modeled after Vernon). Ray has close ties to the career criminal Frank Semyon (Vince Vaughn), and their lives are upended by the murder of a double-dealing city manager named Ben Caspere — a case that also ensnares the highway patrol officer Paul Woodrugh (Taylor Kitsch) and criminal investigator Antigone Bezzerides (Rachel McAdams) within a tangled web that also involved a high-speed rail boondoggle, a deadly shootout at a meth lab and secret sex parties of the political elite."
3961,"Assessing the show’s second season is easier if you put aside the expectations set by the first. It is, first of all, wildly, ambitiously different: While it once again explores the failures of modern masculinity, it does so through a different lens, de-emphasizing the murder-mystery conventions in favor of a multicharacter urban drama."
3962,"The first season is driven by two strong protagonists — a pair of unforgettable detectives obsessed with the same case. Season 2 supplants that relationship with a broader portrait of a corrupted city, as seen through the eyes of four characters who in some cases barely interact. By the time Caspere’s murder was solved, most viewers had lost the plot and no longer cared, unwilling to accept that the season was never really about who killed Ben Caspere."
3963,"But in hindsight, it is clear that the central mystery in Season 2 was always just a backdrop for the show’s thematic undercurrents."
3964,[Read The Times’s original review of Season 2 of “True Detective.”]
3965,"For the second season, the series’s creator, Nic Pizzolatto, presented viewers with a world in which everyone is shaped by trauma: Semyon’s childhood, Woodrugh’s combat experiences, Bezzerides’s dark past, Velcoro’s murder of his wife’s rapist. Much of the criticism aimed at Season 2 was focused on the lack of a compelling mystery, but Pizzolatto was attempting something more ambitious than a straightforward whodunit."
3966,"Season 2 is full of gorgeous overhead shots of Los Angeles freeways, but those freeways aren’t so much linking people meaningfully as spreading poison. It’s a vision of Los Angeles in which pain and desperation are everywhere, pressing people until they break, and the murder of Caspere is merely a catalyst. Loyalties are fleeting, the dots don’t always connect, and justice is often deferred, if it comes at all."
3967,"Vaughn’s clenched-jaw performance received the most ridicule, much of it unearned. He embraces the pulpy tone of Pizzolatto’s dialogue, and his scenes with Farrell are some of the series’s best. Both characters are incapable of escaping their pasts, especially as their futures become increasingly dire. They are men with less and less to hold onto, and Vaughn and Farrell become avatars of the crumbling masculinity central to much of Pizzolatto’s work."
3968,"Woodrugh could have been defined purely by his issues — post-traumatic stress, closeted homosexuality, a false accusation — but Kitsch finds subtlety in his body language. The tension in his jaw and body shows a man forcing himself to be outwardly strong in order to hide what he perceives as internal weakness."
3969,"Bezzerides demands to be perceived in the same tough manner as her male colleagues, a defense mechanism against her trauma. But as admittedly clichéd as the “overcompensating female cop” role can be, McAdams elevates it into something heartbreakingly genuine. She finds the truth in it by refusing to succumb to type, adding depth to her line readings and subtlety to her physical performance that reveal instead the emotional core her character over-protects."
3970,"The technical achievements of Season 2 got lost in the bad press as well. Yes, gone was the singular voice of Cary Joji Fukunaga, who directed all of Season 1. But he was replaced by a murderer’s row of film and television directors — including Justin Lin, John Crowley and Miguel Sapochnik — all of whom brought undeniable craftsmanship, enhanced by sharp editing as well as a pulsing score from the music director T Bone Burnett. Almost every critic simply dismissed those qualities, obsessed with the ways in which Season 2 differed from Season 1."
3971,"And sure, Season 1 was better. But the second season wasn’t bad — it just couldn’t escape the long shadow of the first. Like its characters, it got trapped in the darkness."
3972,"BRUSSELS — On his first international trip as Pentagon head, Patrick M. Shanahan entered NATO headquarters on Wednesday with a key question hanging over him: Would he be the stalwart ally and buffer against President Trump’s whims that the former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, had been?"
3973,He departed the NATO conference in Brussels on Thursday with the same question still lingering in the air.
3974,"When asked by reporters during a press briefing about his commitment to NATO, in light of Mr. Trump’s ambivalence toward the alliance, Mr. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary since Jan. 1, said that he did not see a divergence."
3975,"“As Mr. Trump said last month, we’re going to be with NATO 100 percent,” Mr. Shanahan said."
3976,"But the president’s habit of lashing out at allies and alliances, and uncertainty about what he might do or tweet next, complicate the job of addressing a long list of security issues facing NATO, including the nearly 18-year-old war in Afghanistan, the fate of a Cold War missile treaty, Russian aggression online and on the ground in Ukraine, and an increasingly assertive and powerful China."
3977,"So far, NATO leaders have not received from Mr. Shanahan the kind of reassurance Mr. Mattis provided for two years; in fact, they cannot be sure he will be the United States military chief much longer."
3978,"Last year, Mr. Trump discussed withdrawing completely from the nearly 70-year-old alliance, and he told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of NATO."
3979,"The president has railed publicly against allies for not meeting the NATO goal of spending 2 percent of their economic output on defense, though they remain five years away from the target date for reaching that level."
3980,"With American prodding, some member nations have increased their military spending, but on Thursday, Mr. Shanahan chided Germany for not making the 2 percent goal. The country has settled on reaching roughly 1.5 percent by 2024."
3981,"“It has to be more,” he said."
3982,"Mr. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, is stuck between President Trump’s rhetoric and the long shadow of Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general who resigned from his position in December."
3983,"In his resignation letter, Mr. Mattis wrote of his firm belief that “our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,” and pointed to the divide between him and Mr. Trump on that score as a reason for stepping down."
3984,"“Mattis’s departure was an earthquake,” said Jim Townsend, who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense for European and NATO policy under former President Barack Obama. Now NATO is looking to see whether Mr. Shanahan is “going to be someone closer to the mold of Mattis or be more like what comes out of the White House.”"
3985,"On Thursday, after meeting with defense ministers about the NATO training mission in Afghanistan, Mr. Shanahan said there would be “no unilateral troop reduction,” when asked by reporters about allied concerns about a rapid withdrawal."
3986,"Even before he flew to Brussels, his trip this week tested his skill in international affairs, starting with a stop in Afghanistan to meet with President Ashraf Ghani, who objects to being excluded from peace talks involving the Trump administration and the resurgent Taliban. He traveled to Iraq and met with Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, days after Iraqi politicians reacted angrily to Mr. Trump’s talk of keeping American troops in that country to “watch Iran.”"
3987,"Mr. Trump has praised Mr. Shanahan, the deputy secretary under Mr. Mattis, and said that he could be running the Pentagon “for a long time.” But the president has not nominated him — or anyone else — to be defense secretary, and Mr. Shanahan has started to draw fire from some lawmakers who consider him to be out of his element."
3988,"On Tuesday, Senator James M. Inhofe, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he did not think Mr. Shanahan would be nominated and that he lacked the “humility” of Mr. Mattis."
3989,"Later that day, Mr. Shanahan told reporters in Brussels that “whether there is ‘acting’ next to your name or not, it’s the same job. I’ll do the job the same way.”"
3990,"“Being thrown into the spotlight while expected to reassure European allies as the top person in charge of the Defense Department is a lot to deal with and uphold and I think European allies are going to expect him to handle that,” said Rachel Rizzo, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security’s Transatlantic Security Program."
3991,"But two former American ambassadors to NATO judge that in its 70th year, NATO is “an alliance in crisis,” facing a multitude of crises with an out-of-date strategic vision. In a report that will be published on Friday, the former ambassadors Nicholas Burns and Douglas Lute, who is also a retired Army lieutenant general, describe the alliance as largely unprepared for new kinds of digital warfare and new challenges from China and Russia."
3992,"NATO is also challenged by an American president who, “for the first time in history, is not supplying leadership, strategy or support to an alliance that serves American interests,” Mr. Burns said. “There’s hardly been a time when the alliance has been tested on so many fronts with such weak American leadership.”"
3993,"The report, which praises Mr. Trump’s focus on military spending, also urges Congress to pass legislation to prevent an American withdrawal from NATO."
3994,"But Mr. Trump has also produced a nascent European pushback, with countries like France and Germany talking about creating some sort of European army, able to defend European interests without so much reliance on Washington."
3995,"The report identifies other key problems ripping at NATO, including “a potentially cancerous threat from within” from the increasingly undemocratic governments of its members Hungary, Poland and Turkey. Controversially, the authors recommend that NATO, which prefers to ignore internal politics, take measures to respond — through political pressure but also, if necessary, by suspending official visits to those countries or their participation in NATO exercises."
3996,"NATO’s last strategic review, in 2010, was written before Russian aggression in Ukraine and interference in Western democracies, China’s newly assertive military posture, the rise of the Islamic State, and several new types of cyberwarfare. A new review is badly needed, but that might best come after the Trump presidency, the authors say."
3997,"The report is the work of six months and involved discussions with more than 60 diplomats, military officers and analysts in both the United States and Europe."
3998,"“We’re trying to ring the village bell on both sides of the Atlantic,” Mr. Burns said."
3999,"Hello, Canada Letter readers. This is Catherine Porter, filling in for Ian Austen. Like many Canadians, I have China on my mind this week."
4000,"A little more than a year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was traveling to Beijing, hoping for a free trade deal. How things have changed. Since Canada carried out an American warrant and arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in the Vancouver airport last month, Canada seems to have become enemy No. 1 of the Chinese government. The price has been steep for three Canadians in particular: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both detained in China and accused of threatening national security, as well as Robert Schellenberg, who was hastily retried this week for drug smuggling. His original sentence of 15 years in prison was replaced with the death penalty."
4001,[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]
4002,"In Canada, the sentence has been viewed as a kind of international ransom. But I wondered how the détente has been perceived in China. I reached out to my colleague Chris Buckley. An Australian by birth, Chris has lived in China for more than two decades and studied Chinese Communist Party history at Renmin University in Beijing. He joined The Times in 2012."
4003,What is public opinion of Canada like in China now?
4004,"It’s not simple. When I walk home from work at night, I pass close by the newly opened Canada Goose store in Beijing, and there have been long lines of people waiting to go in. On the other hand, I think that most Chinese people accept their government’s view that Huawei is being victimized in the West and that Meng Wanzhou was unfairly arrested in Canada."
4005,How has the Schellenberg case been reported in Chinese media?
4006,"It’s been getting attention here in China, too, though not on the same level as it has received in Canada. The cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were reported in the Chinese media, mostly accounts of their arrests and the Chinese foreign ministry’s pushback against criticism. Robert Schellenberg’s appeal hearing and detention attracted more media attention, using the court’s account of the trial. Throughout all this, the Global Times, which is a brashly nationalist newspaper and website, has led the way in criticizing the Canadian government."
4007,Reporters were invited to observe the trial. Why would China do that?
4008,"It’s very unusual for foreign reporters to be allowed in to watch criminal trials. I’ve never been inside a Chinese criminal trial. The court hasn’t said exactly why it made an exception in Mr. Schellenberg’s case. But I suspect two reasons. First, the court and government wanted to show that he received what counts for a proper hearing in China. Second, if Mr. Schellenberg is being used as a bargaining chip, it makes sense for the Chinese government to publicize the trial."
4009,How unusual is it in China for a pending execution to be publicized?
4010,"In heinous murders and crimes like that, the government often publicizes executions. In a case like this — a drug smuggling case involving a foreigner — it is much less common. This might be the Chinese government sending a warning to potential drug traffickers, or maybe a way of putting pressure on Canada."
4011,What is the feeling among foreigners inside China now?
4012,"Foreigners from Western countries, especially Canada, have been a bit spooked by the arrests. There is certainly not a mass exit of Westerners from China. But I think there is a subsection of people who, like Michael Kovrig — a former diplomat who worked for a policy NGO — have a government job background and talk to Chinese academics and officials for their work. For them, especially, his arrest seems to have been unnerving."
4013,Where do you see this going?
4014,"Ms. Meng’s fight against possible extradition to the United States could take many months, even longer. How long it takes for Mr. Schellenberg to work through his appeal and other means for seeking clemency depends very much on how slow or fast the Chinese government wants to go. So for Mr. Schellenberg this could be a long, agonizing wait. Meanwhile, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor remain in detention and haven’t even been formally charged with specific crimes. So I think this story will be in the news for many months to come, and maybe longer."

4025,"—Most of the couples in the young penguin colony weren’t very promising parents — with two exceptions. Sphen and Magic, the gay penguins of Sydney’s aquarium, are now raising a chick of their own."
4026,"President Trump’s family business has employed undocumented workers more broadly than it was previously believed, with multiple workers losing their jobs last month at a Trump golf club in southern New Jersey."
4027,"The club in Pine Hill, N.J., known as the Trump National Golf Club Philadelphia, was the third Trump property where undocumented workers have been fired since The New York Times reported in December that the Trump club in Bedminster, N.J., for years employed immigrants who were in the country unlawfully."
4028,"The president’s company terminated about a dozen undocumented workers at the Bedminster property after the article was published, as well as a dozen workers at the Trump National Golf Club Westchester, in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y."
4029,"People familiar with the terminations at Pine Hill said that about five workers at that property were fired or told not to report to work again, including two seasonal employees who were not scheduled to work until the spring. One of the people familiar with the matter said that many other seasonal workers expected to be told not to return in the coming weeks."
4030,"The revelations about the undocumented workers has been an embarrassment for the Trump Organization, coming to light as Mr. Trump has railed against illegal immigration, blamed undocumented immigrants for crime and pledged to build a wall along the Mexican border to keep more people from entering the country unlawfully."
4031,The company has said it was duped by employees who used false identification to get their jobs. But some of the workers in Bedminster told The Times they were kept on the payroll despite the fact that management was aware of the false documents.
4032,A spokesperson for the company declined to comment on Friday.
4033,"The workers at the Pine Hill property said their terminations, which occurred in January, came abruptly."
4034,"“Just like that, I got fired,” said Victor Reyes, who is from Mexico and worked in the kitchen alongside the chef."
4035,"“The manager called me and asked, ‘Victor, are you legal?’ I said, ‘No, I am not legal.’ It surprised me because I knew he knew that I was illegal. I have worked for him 16 years and then he asks me,” said Mr. Reyes, who added that it was his first job since crossing the border."
4036,"Mr. Reyes had worked up from a dishwasher to grilling steaks and preparing a la carte orders, he said, and acquired many cooking skills along the way."
4037,"The firings at the Pine Hill golf club were the result of a broader audit that the Trump Organization is conducting at its properties across the country, according to people briefed on the review. Although the organization has conducted similar reviews in prior years, this is the largest effort yet to ensure that the company’s employees are authorized to work in the country."
4038,The review has presented yet another legal and public relations headache for company executives who are trying to contain the fallout from the revelations. It comes as the Trump Organization is facing wider scrutiny from congressional Democrats examining the company’s business practices.
4039,"At this point in the review, the issues appear to have been largely concentrated in the Bedminster and Westchester golf clubs, the people said, though the discovery of undocumented workers at the southern New Jersey property show that the matter is more widespread than initially believed. The terminations at the Westchester club were first reported by The Washington Post."
4040,"The Trump Organization announced on Tuesday that it was using a system — known as E-verify — to prevent undocumented workers from getting jobs at its properties. For the last several years, the company had utilized that system in many of its hotel properties, though it did not adopt it at most of the golf courses."
4041,"“I must say, for me personally, this whole thing is truly heartbreaking,” Eric Trump, an executive vice president with the Trump Organization, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Our employees are like family, but when presented with fake documents, an employer has little choice.”"
4042,"He said that hiring undocumented immigrants was not a problem unique to the Trump Organization, and that it “demonstrates that our immigration system is severely broken and needs to be fixed immediately.”"
4043,"About eight million undocumented workers participate in the United States labor force, and it is an open secret that they use fake documents to get hired, typically made-up social security numbers and permanent residency cards."
4044,"The Pine Hill club has an 18-hole golf course surrounded by maple and pine trees on 365 acres. Members enjoy putting greens and a 43,000-square-foot clubhouse where weddings and other events take place. Sitting atop a hill, it boasts a view of the Philadelphia skyline."
4045,"The golf club employs 100 to 200 people, many of them in seasonal jobs. Immigrants employed there were charged with watering, mowing and manicuring the greens; the upkeep of the banquet hall, which has a 300-person capacity; and preparing food in the club’s restaurant."
4046,"Because the workers do not have lawyers and remain in the country illegally, two of those who described the firings, as well as their family members, declined to be named."
4047,"Workers said that those who were terminated were summoned to a meeting with Eric Quinn, the general manager, and a human-resources executive who they believed was from the Trump Organization. Each was told that their documents did not pass inspection after an audit and that they should leave the premises immediately, leaving some of the workers who lacked driver’s licenses to scramble to find rides home."
4048,"“People were getting fired on the spot, no warning, no nothing. No time to find a job,” said one worker, who declined to be named."
4049,"The worker said that the immigrants had been treated well by the club’s management and that some of them had broken down when they were fired. “It’s not easy to find a job if you don’t have papers, after you worked there,” the worker said. The general manager, according to several accounts, was said to have lamented the terminations."
4050,Executives at the Pine Hill club declined to comment.
4051,"The problem of undocumented workers at Trump properties came to light in December, when The Times wrote about Victorina Morales of Guatemala, a housekeeper at the Bedminster property who made the president’s bed, washed his clothes and dusted his golf trophies for five years. After Mr. Trump was elected, a manager told her that her fake documents had expired and helped her acquire new ones."
4052,"Ms. Morales said that on the advice of her lawyer, she stopped going to work on Dec. 4, two days before The Times article was published. The lawyer, Anibal Romero, has said that neither he nor his client had been notified that she was fired, and that her employment status was not clear."
4053,"Ms. Morales, who is protected from deportation because she applied for asylum, was invited by her Democratic congresswoman, Bonnie Watson Coleman, to attend the State of the Union address on Tuesday. Also attending will be Sandra Diaz, a native of Costa Rica and a legal resident of the United States who said she was undocumented when she worked at the Trump resort. She will be the guest of Representative Jimmy Gomez, a California Democrat."
4054,"Another undocumented worker, Emma Torres, told The Times that someone in human resources at the Bedminster club had removed her name and other undocumented workers’ names from a list of employees submitted to the Secret Service in 2017. Ms. Torres quit shortly after on her own volition."
4055,"At Pine Hill, Mr. Reyes said that he was treated well by Mr. Quinn, the general manager, and expressed gratitude for the opportunity to grow professionally during his years at the golf club, where his hard work was recognized, he said. Over the years, on the job his repertoire of dishes grew and he learned English."
4056,"“I had too many raises,” said the immigrant from Puebla, who said that he earned $18 an hour. The money enabled him to pay his rent and send money to his family back in Mexico."
4057,"He received his first bonus in all his years working at the club, he said, in late December. In hindsight, Mr. Reyes wonders whether that was because management knew that he would not be welcome back after the winter hiatus."
4058,"Now, he said, he is seething with a sense of betrayal."
4059,"“I loved my job. I learned to cook everything. They helped me grow,” he said, erupting in tears. “Now I feel bad. I don’t trust nobody.”"
4060,"Mr. Trump, who during his campaign called Mexicans “rapists” and “criminals,” has made border security and protecting jobs for Americans cornerstones of his presidency. His commitment to erecting a border wall resulted in the recent partial government shutdown."
4061,"He has deemed illegal immigration “a major, major problem,” and his administration has intensified workplace raids and payroll audits at companies suspected of employing undocumented workers."
4062,WASHINGTON — Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida came to Washington in 2017 with a reputation for bipartisan deal-cutting in the State Legislature — then spent a year idling behind the slow-moving minivans in the House Republican Conference like a Mustang stuck in traffic.
4063,"So he decided to go the full Trump. With a near-constant presence on the president’s favorite network and a penchant for own-the-libs outrageousness, Mr. Gaetz has, in short order, become the lawmaker Democrats love to loathe. It is all part of the plan."
4064,"“In a world where the body politic has the attention span at times of a goldfish, yep, you’ve got to have the ability to reinvent yourself in this game many times,” said Mr. Gaetz, who in his second term representing Florida’s western Panhandle has emerged as one of President Trump’s fiercest and most frequent defenders on Fox News, CNN and MSNBC."
4065,"“I did one cable news hit during my first 10 months in Congress,” he said during an interview in his Capitol Hill office last week. “Yeah. And now it’s only a couple of years later and The New York Times is sitting in my office asking me about my life. The only thing that’s changed is a little bit of time and a whole hell of a lot of cable.”"
4066,"Many Republicans in Congress stick close to Mr. Trump’s feed-the-base strategy, but few are more naturally inclined to adopt the president’s brass-knuckles brand of politics than Mr. Gaetz, 36, the ambitious son of a former Florida State Senate president, Don Gaetz."
4067,"“Matt feeds off disruption; it’s just this big adrenaline rush for him,” said Christian Ulvert, a Miami-based Democratic political consultant who met Mr. Gaetz at Florida State University in the early 2000s. “But it puts a ceiling on him, because it wears thin after a while, and it puts so many people off.”"
4068,"Steve Schale, a friend of Mr. Gaetz from Tallahassee who ran Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign in Florida, said he viewed it essentially as a game and “is adjusting as the rules shift.”"
4069,"There are not too many rules these days. Early last year, Mr. Gaetz brought Chuck Johnson, a right-wing activist who has questioned whether six million Jews really died in the Holocaust, to the State of the Union address. (This year Mr. Gaetz denounced anti-Semitism on the House floor.)"
4070,He tried to expel two fathers who lost children to a gunman at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School from a hearing after they stood up to object to his claim that a wall on the Mexican border would save more lives than gun control.
4071,"He has feuded with Rick Scott, the newly elected senator and former Republican governor of Florida, over Mr. Scott’s frosty relationship with his successor, Ron DeSantis, and Mr. Scott’s decision to block the elder Mr. Gaetz from garnering a plum university presidency."
4072,"A month ago, on the eve of testimony by Mr. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, he dashed off a Twitter post that brought him his biggest headlines and accusations of witness intimidation. “Hey @MichaelCohen212,” he wrote. “Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat. I wonder if she’ll remain faithful when you’re in prison. She’s about to learn a lot…”"
4073,"Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny J. Davis, said Mr. Gaetz had peddled “despicable lies and personal smears.” Mr. Scott called it “disgusting.” The Florida Bar opened an investigation, still continuing, into whether the tweet should affect his ability to practice law in the state."
4074,"He deleted it and issued a follow-up claiming that “it was NOT my intent to threaten.” The president loved it, and Mr. Gaetz has been less than contrite about the incident with Mr. Trump, according to an administration official who spoke to the president recently."
4075,"“I wanted to cast him in a bad light,” Mr. Gaetz said of Mr. Cohen."
4076,But Mr. Gaetz is quick to say he is no one-dimensional Trump wingman.
4077,"“I’m on the pro-science side of the Republican Party,” he added. “I mean, like, marijuana can help people live better lives as medicine, the earth is warming and nobody chooses to be gay.”"
4078,"Indeed, Mr. Gaetz — known as Baby Gaetz in Tallahassee to differentiate him from his more powerful father — made his reputation back home as a serious, if combative, legislator who played an instrumental role helping Mr. Scott, then the governor, kill efforts to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act."
4079,"He also joined with Democratic lawmakers to push marijuana legalization, and he persuaded his father in 2015 to join Democrats to pass a law that removed Florida’s ban on adoptions by same-sex couples. He initially supported Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, for president in 2016 before jumping over to Mr. Trump. His father was a Bush supporter, and his younger sister worked on the Bush campaign as a video producer."
4080,"Mr. Gaetz is also a passionate champion of animal rights. On the day of the Cohen tweet, he sent text messages to offer condolences to Mr. Schale after his dog died. When he served in the Florida House, he pushed to end greyhound racing."
4081,"“Matt has played both the hero and the villain,” said Ryan Wiggins, a Republican political consultant who worked on his first congressional campaign. “I suspect he probably enjoys the reactions he gets when he makes people’s heads explode on the national stage.”"
4082,"With a promontory chin and crooked grin, Mr. Gaetz cultivates an air of genial menace, like a netherworld Jay Leno. His email handle in college was Gaetzofhell, a classmate recalled."
4083,"His transition to Washington was bumpy. In early 2017, at a lunch for the incoming freshman class at the Capitol, he complained to table mates about how tough it was to be a backbencher and railed, in four-letter fashion, against the House Freedom Caucus — now his allies — for being “a bunch of obstructionists,” according to a person sitting nearby."
4084,"“I would end my days exhausted,” Mr. Gaetz recalled. “I was unable to rationalize what I had done to make progress. If you can’t impact an outcome in this town you are an extra in the movie, and I do not want to do that.”"
4085,"He started tracking his Fox News appearances more carefully, and turned up the volume on his defenses of Mr. Trump, in part, he said, to gain more sway with the White House on local issues. He said he has used his private access to the president to help block drilling off the Gulf Coast — even if Mr. Trump just wants to critique his television appearances and mock his fashion choices."
4086,"“What are the things you can do to impact an outcome?” he asked. “Well, the most valuable real estate in the world lies between the president’s ears. And if I can be a good friend and ally and influencer in calling to the president, then I can impact outcomes without having to be a whore for special interests.”"
4087,"He threw himself into the governor’s campaign of Mr. DeSantis in 2018, and sees Mr. DeSantis as the key to his post-Trump political fortunes."
4088,"The day after Mr. DeSantis was elected, Mr. Gaetz reached out to the governor-elect’s team and asked if there was any way Ashley Moody, the new state attorney general, could be persuaded to take another job — to clear the way for his appointment, according to two Republican operatives."
4089,"No way, he was told."
4090,"He is also open, friends said, to another bank-shot DeSantis appointment. If Kansas Republicans sell Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on a run for then Senate next year and if Mr. Trump then nominates Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, to replace Mr. Pompeo, maybe Mr. DeSantis would pick him to fill out Mr. Rubio’s term."
4091,"When asked about that possibility, Mr. Gaetz grinned and said, “Marco would be a historic pick” for the cabinet job."
4092,"HONG KONG — Before she went on holiday with her boyfriend, the young woman from Hong Kong told friends about his pledge to her. “He said I am his first and last girlfriend,” the woman, Poon Hiu-wing, 20, wrote on Facebook. It would be her last Facebook post."
4093,"After their trip to Taiwan in February 2018, the boyfriend, Chan Tong-kai, returned alone. Her family grew worried and called the police. One week later, investigators found her body in the bushes near a light rail station in northern Taiwan. An autopsy determined that she had been four to five months pregnant."
4094,"The police in Hong Kong arrested Mr. Chan, and last year he was charged over possession of his girlfriend’s cellphone, digital camera and $3,000 in cash."
4095,But he was not charged with killing Ms. Poon.
4096,"Under Hong Kong law, Mr. Chan must face charges related to her death where it happened, in Taiwan. But Hong Kong does not have an extradition agreement with Taiwan, so Mr. Chan has remained in Hong Kong."
4097,"To break the logjam, Hong Kong has proposed easing renditions to and from Taiwan — and also to mainland China, touching off concerns that Hong Kong residents would be exposed to China’s harsh legal system while losing the singular legal protections they enjoy at home."
4098,"Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to China under a framework of “one country, two systems,” which allowed the territory to maintain its own political, legal and economic systems. Opposition lawmakers have accused the Hong Kong government of taking advantage of the desire for justice for Ms. Poon to push a broader agenda of promoting Hong Kong’s integration with the rest of China."
4099,"“I think the whole thing is a political maneuver more than anything else,” said Claudia Mo, a lawmaker who leads the pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong’s legislature. “Ever since the handover, it’s been stipulated in the law that we do not hand over fugitives to mainland China. Now they are taking advantage of this particular Taiwan case and pretend it is for compassion and humanity.”"
4100,Hong Kong officials say the suspect may avoid more serious charges if the government does not act quickly. Ms. Poon’s mother publicly implored lawmakers to help bring her daughter’s accused killer to trial.
4101,"“We must do everything to help,” Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, said last month. “But if we argue with each other, slowly consult the public or issue some consultation documents, I fear we will not be able to help in this particular case.”"
4102,"The proposed changes to Hong Kong’s extradition law set up a mechanism for handling jurisdictions with which the territory does not have formal agreements. The most significant among those are Taiwan, mainland China and Macau, a former Portuguese territory that returned to Chinese rule in 1999. The proposal considers all three parts of the People’s Republic of China, although the Communist Party-run central government has never controlled Taiwan."
4103,"The obstacles to formal extradition agreements differ. With Taiwan, the issue has primarily been political, legal experts say. China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be part of its territory, and does not recognize its government."
4104,"In 2009, when Taiwan had a president who sought closer ties with China, the two sides reached an agreement on transferring criminal suspects. But Taiwan’s present administration is much more wary of Beijing. An official with Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice said it would not agree to any extradition deal that considered Taiwan as part of China."
4105,"“Although Taiwan has been seeking mutual judicial assistance with different jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, the government will not accept an extradition agreement that erodes Taiwan’s dignity and sovereignty,” the official, Liu Yi-chun, said last week, according to Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency."
4106,"In Hong Kong, the chief concern about an agreement with mainland China is doubts about the quality of justice in a place where defendants have little access to legal representation and courts are subordinate to the Communist Party."
4107,"“If we now extend this arrangement to allow in particular the mainland to make requests for rendition, then the simple point is we are accepting that currently mainland China’s criminal justice system meet basic requirements for fair trials,” said Eric Cheung, a legal scholar at the University of Hong Kong."
4108,"“If we are not satisfied with that,” he added, “why are we introducing an amendment of such far-reaching effect?”"
4109,"In 2017, Australia backed out of a proposed extradition treaty with China after lawmakers expressed concerns about China’s legal system."
4110,"In recent years, several people from Hong Kong have been ensnared in the mainland legal system by questionable means. Five Hong Kong booksellers involved in the publication of gossipy books about China’s political leadership disappeared into mainland custody in late 2015. They were later shown on state-run television broadcasts giving confessions that one later said was coerced."
4111,"In 2017, Xiao Jianhua, a Chinese billionaire, was taken out of a Hong Kong luxury hotel in a wheelchair and transported back to the mainland without passing through border controls. His abduction has not been officially explained, but he is believed to be assisting investigations into the financial industry."
4112,"The opening of a new train station in Hong Kong last year has also caused worries about encroachment of the mainland’s legal system. The station, in Hong Kong’s West Kowloon district, is the terminus of a high-speed line to the neighboring mainland province of Guangdong, and was built to hold border-crossing facilities as well. So once travelers cross through immigration, they are under mainland jurisdiction."
4113,"A Hong Kong resident was detained in the mainland side of the terminal in October because he was wanted by a court in the neighboring mainland city of Shenzhen for owing money in a home sale, the mainland news outlet Nanfang Plus reported."
4114,"John Lee, Hong Kong’s secretary for security, said the proposed changes to the law would leave in place protections for human rights, including assurances that those extradited will not face the death penalty. Suspects would not be extradited for political crimes or other matters that are not considered crimes in Hong Kong, he said."
4115,"The possible political intentions behind charges like corruption and tax evasion could be hard to sort out, Hong Kong legal experts say. And legislators representing pro-business parties in Hong Kong have expressed concern about executives becoming ensnared in mainland criminal cases over commercial disputes that would be civil matters in Hong Kong."
4116,"Pro-government lawmakers have the vote to push through the proposed changes, Ms. Mo acknowledged. But her side is still looking toward a more limited proposal that would exclude renditions to the mainland."
4117,"The legislature could also approve Mr. Chan’s extradition to Taiwan under the existing framework, undermining the need for new rules, Mr. Cheung said."
4118,"Mr. Lee has said that the Taiwan case exposed weaknesses in the current system, under which Hong Kong lacks long-term agreements with more than 100 countries."
4119,"“This is a loophole that we must address,” he said. “If I only deal with a single case now, this loophole will continue to exist. That would mean we will repeat the same problem.”"
4120,"MUDURNU, Turkey — Looking for a castle on a cul-de-sac in the Black Sea region of Turkey?"
4121,You might even be able to get a deal on it.
4122,"The Yerdelen brothers, construction entrepreneurs from Istanbul riding a real estate boom, had plans to build more than 700 minicastles, with turrets and breezy rooftop terraces overlooking the forest, aiming to draw in Arabs from the Gulf countries who love to come to Turkey for its lush nature and Mediterranean climate."
4123,"At first, business was brisk: Half the castles were sold, they said, and building was going apace. Then oil prices slumped, hitting the buyers. Meanwhile, between terrorist attacks, a failed coup attempt and what many experts say was unsustainable borrowing, cronyism and huge public works projects with little economic return, Turkey’s economy ground to a halt."
4124,"Now, the development is almost at a standstill as the partners work their way through bankruptcy court but are still allowed to trade, their futures debated regularly in the news media."
4125,"Turkey was feted as the place to invest in the early 2000s, its largest city dubbed “Cool Istanbul: Europe’s Hippest City.” Under the business-friendly leadership of Recep Tayyip Erdogan, first as mayor of Istanbul, then prime minister and now president, the economy boomed and real estate prices soared."
4126,The country was busy catching up with Europe in many ways. The government introduced mortgages in 2001 and reformed conditions for foreign buyers to increase investment in the sector. Rich Arabs and Russians joined European customers lining up to buy summer villas on the Aegean coast and luxury apartments and waterside palaces in Istanbul.
4127,"Mr. Erdogan made sure that foreigners could buy property relatively easily and dangled citizenship, if the investment in real estate was above $250,000. Developers began all manner of schemes to meet the burgeoning demand."
4128,"The Sarot group, run by the Yerdelen brothers and their partner, Bulent Yilmaz, decided to move away from their base in Istanbul, where they mostly worked on water and drainage projects to develop sites around the Roman spa town of Mudurnu in central Turkey, which is famous for its hot springs and healing waters."
4129,"The group bought land in several locations and began a hotel and spa complex, Harry Potter-style forest cottages and, in a secluded valley out of town, an entire suburb of minicastles, like a full-size Legoland display."
4130,It was Mr. Yilmaz who first sketched out the idea on paper.
4131,"“He drew it, and we made it happen on the ground,” said Mehmet Emin Yerdelen, 56, the coordinator of the project."
4132,"For inspiration, they drew on landmark buildings in Istanbul, the Italianate Galata tower and the medieval Maiden’s tower, as well as British and American architecture, said his brother Mezher Yerdelen, 39, the chief executive officer of the Sarot group’s projects."
4133,"The result is rows of Disney-style chateaus, with gray-roofed turrets, circular balconies and balustrades, stretching over a million square meters, or 250 acres. A central shopping mall resembles the American Capitol, and lakes and gardens will link the whole."
4134,"The development straddles the region’s hot springs, and each minicastle will have under-floor heating and Jacuzzis on every level, with an option for an indoor pool, the brothers promise."
4135,"“The thermal water can be used for drinking and steam therapy; it is first class in the world,” said Mezher Yerdelen. “You can drink the waters, and it cures stomach ailments and kidney stones. If you bathe in it, it heals skin problems, rheumatism and slipped disks.”"
4136,"The company has done geological surveys and already drilled and capped the hot water 200 meters underground. The temperature is 68 degrees Celsius, or 154 degrees Fahrenheit, and the water is plentiful enough to supply and heat the entire complex, he said."
4137,"Aiming for the Arab market, the partners named the development the Burj al-Babas Thermal Tourism Company and began marketing the houses through their real estate agency in Kuwait. They broke ground in 2014 and built quickly, with 2,500 workers, aiming to complete the project in just four years."
4138,"Buyers snapped up more than 350 of the houses, which are priced between $370,000 and $500,000, depending on location, Mezher Yerdelen said. By last year, half the buildings were underway."
4139,"Then world events intervened. And the Yerdelen brothers, like many other developers, began to feel the fallout."
4140,"“Our sales dried up,” Mezher Yerdelen said. Some customers canceled their agreements, some stopped their payments. The company applied for bankruptcy but on appeal won the right to continue trading so they can complete the contracted houses."
4141,Mezher Yerdelen remains optimistic that the real estate market in Turkey will bounce back in 2019.
4142,"According to figures published by the Association of Real Estate Investment Companies in Turkey, foreign buyers have been returning since 2018. Roughly a third are from Arab Gulf countries."
4143,"On a recent tour, the castles looked like a vision out of a fairy tale under a light covering of snow, but up close they were largely empty shells. Construction was stopped for the coldest period of the winter and only a few gardens have been landscaped."
4144,"The mayor of Mudurnu, Mehmet Inegol, is an energetic supporter of the development and says the construction complies with all regulations. “Not one single tree was cut for the development,” he said. “In fact the investors chose the valley for its forests.”"
4145,"Critics of the development include Orhan Sarialtun, president of the Chamber of Urban Planners in Ankara, Turkey’s capital, who complains that the architecture is not in harmony with Mudurnu’s traditional architecture."
4146,"He also objects to the concept of such development, saying that the extensive project would inevitably damage the forest and that the sale of secondary holiday homes that lie empty much of the year will not benefit the region as much as a hotel project might."
4147,"In the meantime the Yerdelen brothers are absorbed in dealing with the demands of the clients — all from the Gulf — they have secured so far. All the minicastles are identical on the outside, but clients have a choice among three different layouts and décor inside."
4148,"An elevator can be installed, as can cupboards in the bedrooms, an open-plan kitchen and bathrooms on every floor. And the indoor pool is optional."
4149,"Each mansion has its own garden, but there is little space between the buildings. Mezher Yerdelen said that most Arab customers already have lived in the United States and the West and are used to living in detached or semidetached housing, in proximity with their neighbors. “They don’t mind,” he said."
4150,"Some clients do want more privacy, and ask to enclose the property, Mehmet Emin Yerdelen said. “They ask for walls,” he said, “but I say no, there will be trees instead.” He has planted evergreen shrubs to create a natural screen around some of the gardens."
4151,"Some buyers remain optimistic about the project. Imad Yousef, a real estate broker in Kuwait, is one of them. “I hope to make some money, and I will use it myself,” he said. “When the project is finished, God willing, it will be amazing.”"
4152,"For the unsold castles the brothers hope to develop timeshare agreements and divide them into apartments, with payment in installments. And as the Turkish lira has fallen, prices could fall."
4153,"Some have criticized the architecture and others the extensive development, but the mayor says it will bring much-needed employment. The government has promised road, rail and air links to the region, including a high-speed train passing through the area and connecting Ankara and Istanbul. The season for visiting Mudurnu runs all year, as the hot springs never lose their appeal, Mezher Yerdelen said."
4154,"“Those today who criticize the architecture, tomorrow they are going to pay to come and see them,” Mr. Inegol said."
4155,"TRIESTE, Italy — For centuries, this cosmopolitan port city at the northern tip of Italy’s Adriatic coast acted as a geographic pivot point between empires. Then, for nearly 70 years, Trieste’s geopolitical star dimmed and its old world mishmash of central European cultures grew stale, like an old strudel in one of its elegant cafes."
4156,"Now, courtesy of a rising China, Trieste appears ready to return to the center of a realigning world."
4157,"This week, President Xi Jinping of China arrives in Rome for a state visit in which Italy is expected to become the first Group of 7 nation to participate in China’s vast One Belt, One Road infrastructure project. The symbolism is striking — a powerful China drives a crack in the economic alliance that once dominated the globe and delivers a major blow to a Trump administration that has been critical of the Belt and Road Initiative."
4158,"For Italy, the deal would open the country to greater Chinese infrastructure investment, particularly in ports like Trieste. Officials here say they expect Beijing-backed conglomerates, such as the China Communications Construction Company, to bid hundreds of millions of euros for infrastructure concessions."
4159,"For China, having a toehold in one of Europe’s historic ports would bring favorable customs conditions, a faster trade route to the heart of the Continent and direct access to railroads for moving its goods into the European Union."
4160,"“Fundamentally, what’s happening is that the port of Trieste is returning to the logistical role for Europe that it had for the old Austro-Hungarian empire,” said Zeno D’Agostino, the president of the Trieste port authority, whose office is sprinkled with gifts from Chinese delegations and a book about European-Chinese cultural relations."
4161,"To walk through Trieste is to witness how the city has already opened to China. Chinese tourists shop for the city’s trademark Illy coffee and take pictures with their Huawei phones of the elegant Caffè Degli Specchi. A brand-new cruise ship, built in nearby shipyards expressly for Chinese passengers, is docked in the central waterfront piazza, preparing to set sail on Marco Polo’s path to the Far East."
4162,"Most significant, construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site where a new pier is expected to become China’s home in the industrial port. In the years after World War II, the Americans held great sway in Trieste, and Washington has now sought, so far unsuccessfully, to stop Italy’s deal with Mr. Xi, characterizing the Belt and Road Initiative as an economic and potentially military threat."
4163,"While other members of the European Union, including France and Germany, have also expressed reservations about the deal with China, supporters in Italy say that there is nothing to worry about and that the critics are merely upset that Trieste — and other Italian ports, like Genoa and Palermo — are going to cut in on their business. They reject comparisons to the port of Piraeus in Greece, which China essentially bought, and say Italian law makes such an acquisition or the laying of Chinese debt traps impossible."
4164,"Michele Geraci, an Italian economic development minister who is running the negotiations with Beijing, said in an interview that Chinese ships carrying materials from home or its vast network of interests in Africa through the Suez Canal simply needed to get their goods to central European markets as quickly as possible."
4165,"“Trieste meets that requirement swiftly,” he said."
4166,"Italian officials say their American counterparts initially seemed disinterested in the deal. Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the Five Star Movement, has made several trips to China in recent months, nearly signing the accord during a November visit to Beijing, they said. After the fact, American diplomats began making their case, but the Italians said the deal was noticeably not on the American radar during recent high-level meetings in Washington."
4167,"But this month, Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the American national security adviser, John R. Bolton, sharply attacked the deal in a Twitter post and in several interviews, while the National Security Council’s official Twitter account also issued a reproach on March 9."
4168,"“Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to China’s predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people,” the tweet stated, referring to the Belt and Road Initiative."
4169,"The Americans have also tried to pressure leaders of the nationalist League party, which is part of the governing coalition in Italy. This month, Trump administration officials and, separately, the former White House official Stephen K. Bannon, met with party leaders; Mr. Bannon said that he had warned his Italian allies in the League against what he called China’s “British East India Company model of predatory capitalism.”"
4170,"Awakened to the growing Chinese influence, American officials have had more success pushing Italy to avoid using the new 5G networks of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei, which Washington warns could be used by Beijing to disrupt and spy on communications networks. In recent days, the Italians have excised any mention of technology and communications from the Belt and Road agreement, people familiar with the negotiations said."
4171,"In Trieste, city leaders are focused on the economic benefits to the port."
4172,"Beyond its convenient location, the city on Monday celebrated the 300th anniversary of Emperor Charles VI of Austria declaring it a “free port.” That status still confers special privileges, with no customs charges or time limits on storage for goods."
4173,"If the deal goes through, proponents say they envision Chinese companies working with Italian counterparts, hiring local laborers to assemble imported goods before putting them on trains to the rest of Europe or on ships back to China. If the amount of work and components used measure up to customs requirements, those products could be labeled Made in Italy."
4174,But some business leaders say that fully embracing the Belt and Road program would bring risks and could complicate efforts to bring other investment to Trieste.
4175,"Vittorio Petrucco, chairman of I.CO.P, a construction company doing work in the port, said he and a former Microsoft consultant in Trieste, which has a vibrant research sector, had begun exploring his “dream” of building an underwater data center that would cool the servers of American tech giants."
4176,"“I prefer to look West instead of East,” Mr. Petrucco said of his project, planned for an area near an old ironworks factory that looms above the pier envisioned for use by the Chinese. He added that both projects would take years to build and worried that all the American opposition and controversy surrounding the Belt and Road agreement would poison the waters for his proposal."
4177,"“It’s sad,” he said, “but there’s nothing I can do about it.”"
4178,"Roberto Dipiazza, the mayor of Trieste, said that the United States could scuttle the deal if it really wanted to. He said that his city had much to gain from closer ties to China, but that the Chinese had even more to gain from his port’s deep harbors, customs benefits and rail yards."
4179,"“We will find a point of agreement between China and the U.S.,” he said, showing off a Make America Great Again cap signed by President Trump that he had received as a gift. Italy, he noted, was caught “in the middle.”"
4180,Some of Trieste’s most entrenched political players think Italy is compromised by such a position.
4181,"Giulio Camber, a veteran lawmaker considered by many to be the political boss of Trieste, said he no longer had any interests in the port, and that his opposition to the deal was motivated by his distrust of what he called China’s Communist dictatorship."
4182,"As light sliced in through the closed curtains of his office, illuminating his cigarette smoke, gilded furniture and oil paintings, Mr. Camber said the Chinese were behind many of the Turkish businesses exporting goods into the port. Beijing, he said, would feast on the Italians just as they did on the Greeks before them."
4183,"“They are the weakest,” he said of the Mediterranean countries."
4184,"Mr. Camber dismissed the local and national assurances about Chinese expansion, saying that Beijing would easily outmaneuver officials in Rome."
4185,"“It’s like the world champion in chess playing with a couple of guys who play for fun at the Caffè Degli Specchi,” he said, referring to the famous cafe in Trieste’s main square, the Piazza Unità d’Italia. “You can’t imagine what the world’s best chess player is up to.”"
4186,This article was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. 
4187,"WASHINGTON — Seven years ago, when a former C.I.A. prisoner, Majid Khan, pleaded guilty at Guantánamo to being a courier for Al Qaeda, his lawyers were warned that any mention of the word “torture” would lead a court security officer to trigger a mute button so the public, listening on a 40-second delay, would not hear it."
4188,"This week the question of his treatment was front and center, this time in a pre-sentencing hearing. Mr. Khan’s lawyers asked a military judge on Monday to order prosecutors to produce evidence and witnesses about the secret prison network where the intelligence agency kept Mr. Khan incommunicado from March 2003 to September 2006."
4189,"“The material we seek, that is uniquely in the possession of the government, concerns Mr. Khan’s torture,” one of his lawyers, Katya Jestin, told the judge. “The C.I.A. torture program in this case, your honor, appears to be the third rail.”"
4190,No security officer hit the mute button. A red light on the judge’s bench used to signal a security breach never lit up.
4191,"Seventeen-and-a-half years after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks, and a decade after President Barack Obama ordered the C.I.A. to dismantle any remnants of its global prison network, the military commission system is still wrestling with how to handle evidence of what the United States did to the Qaeda suspects it held at C.I.A. black sites. While the topic of torture can now be discussed in open court, there is still a dispute about how evidence of it can be gathered and used in the proceedings at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba."
4192,"By law, prosecutors cannot use evidence gained through torture — or any other involuntary statements — at the war court, where eight of Guantánamo’s 40 prisoners are accused of being complicit in terrorist attacks. Prosecutors have made clear that nothing the defendants said at the black sites will be used as evidence."
4193,"But defense lawyers have continued to press for details of what happened to their clients and to be able to use the information either to fight the charges or to win more lenient sentencing. And they have been aided by changing circumstances, not least the government’s declassification of some details of how the prisoners were interrogated by the C.I.A."
4194,"The issue has been most intensely debated in Guantánamo’s two death-penalty cases: the 9/11 terror attacks that killed 2,976 people and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000 in which 17 American sailors died."
4195,"Defense lawyers in those cases have sought for years to get access to eyewitnesses and graphic details from the C.I.A. sites. The lawyers want to use descriptions of torture to ask the judge to exclude some of the defendants’ own statements after they left the black sites. The defense lawyers also have said they would cite torture to seek dismissal of the charges on grounds of outrageous government conduct, an extraordinary legal defense that is used in civilian courts but is seldom granted."
4196,"If the men are convicted, the lawyers want the details of how the defendants were treated to argue that the United States has lost the moral authority to execute men it has tortured."
4197,"The fight over access to evidence and witnesses from the black sites is one of the factors that has slowed progress in the cases. In the process, it has illustrated how fundamental legal issues about the rights of Guantánamo defendants remain unresolved — and how the passage of time is altering how some of them are handled."
4198,"The conflict is not limited to the death penalty cases, as Mr. Khan’s proceedings show."
4199,"The topic of his torture was strictly taboo on Feb. 29, 2012, when he made his first court appearance since disappearing from his native Pakistan in 2003 at age 23. At that first hearing, Mr. Khan, who lived in suburban Baltimore for seven years and graduated from high school there in 1999, admitted to volunteering to work for Al Qaeda after Sept. 11 and plotting with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the accused architect of the attacks."
4200,"But in the intervening years, the Obama administration declassified details of what Mr. Khan said the C.I.A. did to him. By his account, he was beaten, hung naked from a wooden beam for three days with no food, kept for months in darkness, and submerged, shackled and hooded, into a tub of ice and water."
4201,"Additional details of his treatment were revealed in the partly declassified introduction to a Senate study of the George W. Bush administration’s black site program. In his second year of C.I.A. detention, according to a cable cited in the study, the agency “infused” a purée of pasta, sauce, nuts, raisins and hummus up Mr. Khan’s rectum, because he went on a hunger strike."
4202,The C.I.A. calls this “rectal feeding.” Defense lawyers call it rape.
4203,Mr. Khan’s lawyers now want to call witnesses and gather evidence to show his sentencing jury what happened to him.
4204,"The litigation over black site evidence has gone on for years, to the dismay of some family members who lost loved ones to Al Qaeda terrorists, particularly families of those killed on Sept. 11, 2001, when hijackers crashed four passenger planes into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and a Pennsylvania field."
4205,"“What our family members endured during the attacks on the airplanes and in the building was beyond torture,” said Terry Strada, whose husband Thomas was killed in the World Trade Center."
4206,She has campaigned for more transparency about what happened on Sept. 11. But she sees the focus in the Guantánamo hearings on what happened to the defendants in the black sites as “stalling and stonewalling the process.”
4207,"In Mr. Khan’s case, he has pleaded guilty to delivering $50,000 of Qaeda money to a Southeast Asian affiliate that was used to finance the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 2003 that killed 11 people. He also admitted to agreeing to assassinate Pervez Musharraf, then the president of Pakistan, a plot that was never pulled off."
4208,"Under a plea agreement, he became what his military attorney, Lt. Cmdr. Jared Hernandez of the Navy, called “Guantánamo’s sole high-value cooperator” and can be sentenced to 25 years of confinement. He is being credited with time served since his plea deal, meaning he could get out in 2037."
4209,His lawyers say testimony about his years in C.I.A. custody could strengthen a post-sentencing clemency petition. They also may ask the judge to grant him credit for those years in the C.I.A. prisons as pretrial punishment and reduce his sentence.
4210,"In the military tribunal system, prosecutors are the gatekeepers of classified trial evidence. They have forbidden defense team members from independently contacting or investigating most former black site workers. The C.I.A. is shielding their identities as well as the nations that hosted the black sites, invoking national security, though most if not all the nations have already been identified publicly."
4211,"“The C.I.A. is not on trial,” Jeffrey Groharing, a case prosecutor, told the judge at a hearing at Guantánamo on Nov. 15. That same day, in a bid to persuade the judge that the prosecution had met its responsibility to provide information to the defense, Mr. Groharing stood at the war court and read aloud from documents the defense lawyers can use from a C.I.A. inspector general’s investigation."
4212,"One described how, during an interrogation, Mr. Mohammed refused an interrogator’s order to drink water. According to the document read by Mr. Groharing, Mr. Mohammed “was taken back to the bathing room, placed on a plastic sheet and a medical officer rehydrated Mohammed rectally. Mohammed clearly hated the procedure. When he was returned to the interrogation room, he then complied and drank water.”"
4213,"In another document Mr. Groharing read, an unnamed senior interrogator described an unidentified black site as “good for interrogations” because it was “the closest thing he has seen to a dungeon, facilitating the displacement of detainee explanations.”"
4214,"Spectators heard the audio on a 40-second delay from the gallery at the back of court, separated by triple-pane glass. “It’s hard to imagine a more rich and vivid description than those statements,” Mr. Groharing said."
4215,Defense lawyers called the written accounts sanitized versions of the eyewitness testimony they sought.
4216,"Mr. Mohammed’s lawyer, David Nevin, said the term rectal rehydration “is a polite way of saying rape with the insertion of a foreign object into the rectum. But how is it done? I’d like to know, how is it done?”"
4217,"One small detail can change a juror’s mind about whether to vote for capital punishment, Mr. Nevin has said."
4218,"Eugene R. Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said a showdown over black site evidence was foreseeable."
4219,"“The defense lawyers have to have the tools with which to perform their duty, especially in capital cases. No question,” Mr. Fidell said. “Somebody should have thought about that before they started torturing these people.”"
4220,He added: “This was an accident waiting to happen. The only thing that surprises me is this is 2019 and the problem remains unresolved.”
4221,"Los Angeles’s downtown was little more than a sleepy office district not too long ago, where tens of thousands of suburbanites would clear out by the end of the workday and scores of classic Beaux-Arts and Art Deco buildings sat vacant or underutilized."
4222,"“It didn’t even have a grocery store until Ralphs opened about 10 years ago,” said Andrew D. Tashjian, a Los Angeles native and commercial real estate broker. “Downtown was dead.”"
4223,"Today, cranes dot the skyline and construction routinely diverts traffic as Downtown Los Angeles — a neighborhood known as DTLA — undergoes the biggest development boom since the Roaring Twenties, when the area was then the center of the entertainment industry. "
4224,"As the city prepares for the 2028 Summer Olympics, a spate of new apartments, hotel rooms and retail and office space is steadily coming online throughout the 5.84-square-mile downtown area. Existing structures are being recycled, and the city’s public transit system is being expanded and improved. But as development grows, city officials are facing criticism over a lack of affordable housing. "
4225,"“Downtown was L.A. in the early 20th century until the suburbanization and auto culture hit L.A.,” after World War II, said Nick Griffin, the executive director of the Downtown Center Business Improvement District. (The district encompasses a dozen or so neighborhoods and is bounded by the Los Angeles River to the east, the Hollywood Freeway to the north, the Santa Monica Freeway to the south and the Harbor Freeway to the west.)"
4226,"The business improvement district was formed in the late 1990s just as a resurgent interest in urban life was taking shape across the country. Looking to meet a growing demand for housing and commercial expansion, local planners and businesses set out to revive the district and its celebrated past, maintaining that a strong core would benefit all of Los Angeles as well as the entire region."
4227,"“There’s been a move within cities to enjoy the urban experience,” said Mr. Tashjian, who is a managing director in the Los Angeles office of Cushman & Wakefield. “The newer generation are more urban-minded and appreciate that way of living and not having to commute to work.”"
4228,"Downtown construction projects will add more than 7,000 residential units, according to the business improvement district’s year-end market report, and more than 35,000 are in the pipeline. Nearly three million square feet of office space is under construction, the report said, and an additional 3.3 million square feet has been proposed. "
4229,"The redevelopment extends to civic and cultural projects, including the Metro Regional Connector, a 1.9-mile light rail extension through the heart of downtown, and the replacement of the arched Sixth Street Viaduct. The Los Angeles Convention Center is getting an overhaul, too."
4230,"Older buildings are also being repurposed at a rapid clip, enticing many businesses and institutions to plant roots downtown. The Warner Music Group is relocating to the old Ford Factory, and Arizona State University is leasing 80,000 square feet in the Herald Examiner Building, built in 1914 and designed by Julia Morgan, the architect of Hearst Castle. And technology companies like Spotify and the online coupon company Honey have opened office space."
4231,"“We’re in the heart of the building boom right now — momentum has not let up since 2014,” said Steve Basham, a senior market analyst in the San Diego office of the research firm the CoStar Group. “All this development has been independent of the Olympic selection. But obviously that’s going to dictate the pace of the development and construction over the next decade.”"
4232,"The start of the renaissance, most local observers say, can be traced to the opening of the Staples Center in 1999. That year, the city passed the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance, making it easier for developers to convert old buildings into multifamily or creative spaces, including a notable number of Beaux-Arts towers."
4233,"Mapping out the city’s long-term vision is a set of extensive rezoning plans, which project 125,000 residents, 70,000 housing units and 55,000 jobs downtown by 2040."
4234,"“Our goal is to really bring people and density to the downtown area as it was originally envisioned and intended,” said Shana M.M. Bonstin, the deputy director for the community planning bureau at the Los Angeles City Planning Department."
4235,"But housing advocacy groups claim that the revitalization plan does not fully address a shortage of affordable housing. A report released last spring by the California Housing Partnership and the Southern California Association of Nonprofit Housing said that to satisfy the demand of lower-income renters in Los Angeles County, 568,255 new units were needed. "
4236,"Aware of the rising rents, Ms. Bonstin said affordable housing was a priority for the city. “Many projects have a component of affordable housing,” she said, noting that the Weingart Center for the Homeless was putting up two towers that would classify all units as affordable. "
4237,"Mr. Griffin believes that the growth projections will easily be surpassed, and that downtown could become a city within a city, with as many 200,000 residents in the next 21 years. Already, he said, there are an estimated 70,000, up from 18,000 20 years ago."
4238,"“The catalyst for the transformation of Downtown L.A. is the residential development,” said Bert Dezzutti, the executive vice president for the Western region of Brookfield Properties, the district’s largest real estate owner. “Once it establishes itself as a residential destination, it drives the other uses.”"
4239,"Brookfield has a few developments in the works, including a residential tower next to its Figat7th shopping center, as well as a $170 million overhaul and modernization of the California Market Center in the downtown’s fashion district."
4240,"Mr. Dezzutti believes he’ll have little trouble renting out the 780 residential units planned for the high-rise at 755 South Figueroa Street, where construction is set to commence in the second quarter. “The demand is extremely strong, and really there is virtually no appreciable vacancy today.” (By the downtown center BID’s account, it’s under 10 percent.)"
4241,A significant portion of the new DTLA development has been driven by foreign investment.
4242,"“There’s a high concentration of high-profile property that is foreign owned or developed,” said Michael Soto, the research manager for the Southern California district of the Transwestern Development Company. Mr. Soto, who has been tracking downtown development for more than a decade, said foreign entities “look at L.A. as an attractive place to invest and a gateway city with a diversified economy.”"
4243,"Duncan Wlodarczak, the chief of staff for the Onni Group of Vancouver, British Columbia, said his company saw untapped value in the downtown when it began looking for potential investments about a decade ago."
4244,"“It’s one of the most famous cities in the world — it gets tons of tourists, has an educated population and a strong job market — but the downtown lacked what you’d expect to see in a large urban core,” Mr. Wlodarczak said. “You had surface parking lots and office buildings.”"
4245,"Onni has since become one of the most active developers downtown, with projects ranging from the Studio House, a residential development with micro units, to the renovation of Times Mirror Square, the downtown campus that housed The Los Angeles Times. "
4246,"“We’re not slowing down,” Mr. Wlodarczak said. “We’re continuing to look for more opportunities.”"
4247,Other foreign-owned developments in the works include massive mixed-use developments. 
4248,"Work continues at the Metropolis by the Greenland Group of Shanghai, a complex in the South Park neighborhood with three residential towers with 1,600 condominium units, a 350-room hotel and 70,000 square feet of retail space."
4249,"Tower 1, which opened in 2017, is nearly sold out, according to Donald Stanek, the sales and marketing director for the Los Angeles office of Greenland USA. Sales have been going well for Tower 2 since they began in June, he said, and the third tower should be completed in 2020, with sales opening later this year. "
4250,"Foreigners dominated the buying pool initially, Mr. Stanek added, but lately there have been more regional purchasers looking for housing closer to work that fit their budgets. The average monthly rent for an apartment in Los Angeles was $2,371 in February, a 7 percent rise from a year earlier, according to RentCafe. "
4251,"“Our demographic is evolving over time,” he said. “Rents are expensive.” "
4252,"SEATTLE — The Seattle area, home to both Microsoft and Amazon, is a potent symbol of the affordable housing crisis that has followed the explosive growth of tech hubs. Now Microsoft, arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom, is putting up $500 million to help address the problem."
4253,"Microsoft’s money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated, particularly on the West Coast. It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the company’s own non-tech workers, but also for teachers, firefighters and other middle- and low-income residents."
4254,"Microsoft’s move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a per-employee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing. The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs. Microsoft, which is based in nearby Redmond, Wash., and has few employees who work in the city, did not take a position on the tax."
4255,"The debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country, particularly as Amazon, with billions of taxpayer subsidies, announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City, Queens, and Arlington, Va., that would employ a total of at least 50,000 people. In New York, elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housing."
4256,"Microsoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology, like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence. Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its lead."
4257,"“We believe everybody has a role to play, and everybody needs to play their role,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer."
4258,"The company’s strong finances, a sign of its resurgence under Satya Nadella as chief executive, have given it resources to deploy, Mr. Smith said. In October, the company reported net income of $8.8 billion in its most recent quarter, up 34 percent, and it had almost $136 billion in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The company’s stock has risen steadily under Mr. Nadella, and Microsoft is now valued at over $800 billion."
4259,"A number of other tech businesses have tried to address the homeless crisis. Amazon’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos, has supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation, and the Salesforce chief executive, Marc Benioff, helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services. Voters approved the tax in November, rejecting opposition from some tech leaders, including Twitter’s chief executive, Jack Dorsey."
4260,"Others plan to build housing for their own employees. Such housing may help with demand, but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyards."
4261,"“This is long-range thinking by a company that has been around for a long time, and plans to be around for a long time,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companies."
4262,"Microsoft began researching the region’s housing last summer, after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market. The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work. The area’s home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years, and Mr. Smith said he learned that “the region has counterintuitively done less to build middle-income housing than low-income housing, especially in the suburbs.”"
4263,"That squeeze hits a range of workers. “Of course, we have lots of software engineers, but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft. Cafeteria workers, shuttle drivers,” Mr. Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the company’s headquarters. “It is a supply problem, a market failure.”"
4264,Microsoft plans to lend $225 million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middle-income housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters. It will put an additional $250 million into low-income housing across the region. Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for low-income housing.
4265,"The company plans to invest the money within three years, and expects most of it to go to Seattle’s suburbs."
4266,"The loans could go to private or nonprofit developers, or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority. As the loans are repaid, Mr. Smith said, Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projects."
4267,"The remaining $25 million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless, including legal aid for people fighting eviction. The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that if the $500 million were put into one project, it would create only about 1,000 units, so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build “tens of thousands of units.”"
4268,The initial reaction to the company’s announcement was positive.
4269,"“There is almost no level of housing that isn’t direly needed,” said Claudia Balducci, a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task Force."
4270,"A report in December by the task force said that the region needs 156,000 more affordable housing units, and will need 88,000 more units by 2040 to accommodate future growth."
4271,"A growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness. A December study from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent. The New York, Boston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle regions — the country’s largest tech hubs — have all already crossed that threshold."
4272,"“The idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just doesn’t work anymore,” said Steve Schwartz, head of public affairs at Tableau Software, which is based in Seattle."
4273,"Amazon in recent years has worked closely with Mary’s Place, a homeless shelter for women and children in Seattle, and is integrating a shelter for about 65 families into one of its new buildings. Amazon has paid tens of millions of dollars to the city’s affordable housing trust fund as fees to build in the core of Seattle."
4274,Amazon declined to comment.
4275,"Google supported the City of Mountain View’s plan to add 10,000 housing units in an area it’s developing, with 20 percent designated for lower-income residents. And Facebook has planned to build 1,500 apartments near its Menlo Park headquarters, with 15 percent to be affordable."
4276,"Microsoft has begun a major overhaul of its main campus in Redmond, committing billions of dollars in renovations and connecting it to a light rail station under construction. The company helped finance a successful campaign for voters to approve more property taxes to pay for transportation. This new investment in housing takes its commitments a step further."
4277,"“This is where Microsoft is going to be, and the region needs to work,” Ms. Balducci said. “I don’t think this is wholly altruism.”"
4278,"When Asics America, the athletic-shoe maker, decided to diversify its United States presence beyond its headquarters in Irvine, Calif., a few years ago, Boston beckoned."
4279,"Massachusetts has a centuries-old tradition of shoemaking, and when it comes to athletics, Boston is a sports town through and through, said Gene McCarthy, the company’s chief executive at the time."
4280,"“It’s a city of champions,” he said during an interview at Asics’s downtown Boston location this month as the surrounding streets teemed with fans awaiting a parade celebrating the New England Patriots’ sixth Super Bowl win."
4281,But the overarching reason for opening an East Coast design center in the heart of Boston was far more practical: Asics was following the talent.
4282,"Like other industries competing for highly skilled workers, athletic shoe companies are heading to Boston to lure young, urban-centric employees with pleasant, energizing work spaces near public transit. The city is bursting with tech, education, design and creative hubs generating that talent, said Roy Hirshland, the chief executive of T3 Advisors, a real estate consulting and brokerage firm that worked with Asics on finding a Boston location."
4283,"New Balance and Converse were founded in the Boston area, and Reebok has had a presence there for years, but since 2015, all three have opened dazzling headquarters in separate corners of the city, as they compete for the most creative shoe and apparel designers."
4284,"Puma recently announced that it, too, would open a new North American headquarters, this one in Somerville, a city bordering Boston. Other shoe companies that have recently moved into new spaces just outside Boston include Rockport, in Newton, and Wolverine Worldwide, owner of Saucony, Sperry, Keds and Stride Rite, in Waltham."
4285,"Asics America, part of a Japanese sporting goods conglomerate, arrived last year. It now employs about 100 workers in a 19,000-square-foot, open-concept design studio in an office tower adjacent to South Station, the city’s main transit hub. As Mr. McCarthy put it, “It’s better to be among the bunch that are scrapping it out.”"
4286,"(That fierce competition among sneaker makers dealt a blow to Mr. McCarthy himself just a week later. Asics announced last Wednesday that the chief executive would be replaced by Koichiro Kodama, as the company shifts its strategy for driving growth in the brand’s performance running category.)"
4287,"According to data provided by T3, the Boston area has the country’s second-highest concentration of labor in shoe fashion design services, wholesalers and manufacturing. Greater Portland, Ore., home to Nike and Adidas, is No. 1."
4288,"“The reason these businesses are clustered is talent,” said Matthew Powell, a sports industry adviser for NPD Group, a market research firm. “Brands tend to poach good people from other brands — we see a lot of people moving from one company to another. Work space can play a role in that.”"
4289,"Some brands have chosen to broadcast their Boston presence in highly visible locations. New Balance’s 250,000-square-foot world headquarters, which opened in 2015 in the Allston-Brighton section, resembles a glass cruise liner skimming alongside the Massachusetts Turnpike. The new headquarters for Converse, a Nike subsidiary formerly based in the suburb of North Andover, is in a reconfigured brick factory building overlooking the Charles River, just around the corner from the TD Garden sports arena."
4290,"Asics chose a subtler presence, bringing sales, marketing and product creation staff to a single floor in an office tower on Summer Street. The only hint of the company’s presence from the outside is a ceiling light fixture in the spiral shape of the Asics logo installed within view of passers-by."
4291,"In a nod to the company’s Japanese ownership, the office has a minimalist vibe. Walls are shaped by stacked, three-dimensional undulating lines meant to evoke rake marks in the sand of a Zen garden. Lighting is soothing in the employee break bar, which includes a living wall that reinforces the connection to nature, a concept known as biophilia."
4292,"Throughout the space, employees work at shared tables spaced generously apart amid colorful sneaker displays. Teams meet in conference rooms of varying sizes, and brainstorm with dry erase paint on the white walls."
4293,"Asics is teaming up with the building manager, Oxford Properties Group, to open a small gym on the ground floor with space for fitness classes. The partnership gives Asics an opportunity to brand the space, including bringing in fitness trainers who appear on the Asics Studio app, Mr. McCarthy said."
4294,"Reebok made a company gym a major highlight of its new 220,000-square-foot headquarters, which opened in 2017 in the Innovation and Design Building, a massive complex that was originally a military storehouse in the Seaport District. The company’s 35,000-square-foot employee fitness center stretches to two floors, and includes a boxing ring and an area dedicated to training for the fitness regimen CrossFit, a licensing partner with Reebok."
4295,"“We didn’t do it for altruistic reasons,” said Matt O’Toole, Reebok’s president. “We did it because we really do think our employees are better at their jobs when they have a chance to work out during the day.”"
4296,"The work areas in the industrial-style space are all open, with no assigned seating and no private offices, not even for Mr. O’Toole. That’s been a big adjustment from the company’s former suburban office campus in Canton, Mass., where cubicles were the norm. The goal is to give people the flexibility to sit alongside whomever they need to be working with at any particular moment, Mr. O’Toole said."
4297,"“It’s an agile work environment meant to support a wide variety of work styles,” said Arlyn Vogelmann, a principal in the Boston office of Gensler, which designed the space. “Employees have access to focus rooms, lounge areas, huddle rooms, a cafe and touchdown spaces near the windows.”"
4298,"An extensive archive of older products is available to designers who want to dig through them in search of inspiration. At the old campus, such resources were “buried and distant,” Ms. Vogelmann said. Designers can also play around with low-tech and high-tech equipment in a maker lab."
4299,"Office spaces with a variety of seating arrangements and access to workout facilities or outdoor terraces are part of a larger trend in commercial real estate, as even conventional corporations like I.B.M. and General Electric adopt more collaborative work styles. Highly designed spaces in dynamic urban settings can act as a magnet for young talent, Ms. Vogelmann said. But athletic shoe companies, she noted, also want their space to be “amazingly branded.”"
4300,"“They are going after partnerships with athletes and celebrities, and they bring them in to kind of pitch them before they’re contracted,” she said. “They want their space to be the brand beacon.”"
4301,"These companies recognize that office design is “the most physical expression of your brand,” Mr. Hirshland said."
4302,"Puma is still selecting an architecture firm to design its North American headquarters in Somerville. Scheduled to open in 2021, the 150,000-square-foot space, expected to employ about 550 people, will be in an office building going up in Assembly Row, a development on the Mystic River with apartments, dining, shopping and its own commuter rail stop."
4303,"“We are still working on how to structure a matrix for the organization that enables people to come together effortlessly,” Adam Petrick, the company’s global director of brand and marketing, said from his Boston office at the company’s existing Congress Street location, near City Hall. Puma also has offices in Westford, and will consolidate both operations in Somerville."
4304,"One problem Mr. Petrick is determined to remedy is the chronic clutter around the existing office. Boxes, sneakers and fabric samples are scattered on the floor and piled on desks. The new space should be a “reset” for greater efficiency, he said."
4305,"The space will also be “inspirational” in its reflection of the Puma brand, he said. The company has recently returned to wooing N.B.A. players to endorsement deals, as part of a strategy to link Puma to the broader culture that flows from basketball, including fashion and music."
4306,"“We want to embody sports and sports culture,” Mr. Petrick said. “We’re trying to reground in sports, but we still love that fashion edge.”"

4311,"When Amazon announced last month that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens, the company did not directly blame any one person or group."
4312,But others have.
4313,"Governor Cuomo, who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private, blamed the State Senate, where crucial leaders opposed the plan."
4314,"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who opposed the campus, blamed Amazon for seeking $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere."
4315,"Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal’s collapse. Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters."
4316,"Here’s what else you need to know about the poll, which was released yesterday:"
4317,The deal was popular across the state: Two-thirds of voters said Amazon’s withdrawal was bad for New York.
4318,Sixty-three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self-identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York.
4319,Sixty-four percent of New York City voters agreed with them.
4320,"Blame fell on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez: Thirty-eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal’s demise, identifying her as a “villain.” “Local activists in Queens” were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters."
4321,"In the New York City suburbs, 50 percent of voters blamed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Upstate, the number was 40 percent; in the five boroughs, it was 29 percent."
4322,A spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on the poll results.
4323,What about the governor and mayor? Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio were each seen as a villain by fewer than 30 percent of voters.
4324,What about Amazon? The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters.
4325,The takeaways:
4326,• The progressive base that cheered Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters.
4327,"“Those closest to a project don’t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience,” said Steven Greenberg, a pollster with Siena College. (I asked Mr. Greenberg if by “closest” he meant physical proximity, and he replied, “Yes.”)"
4328,"• “Local activists in Queens” were blamed more often for the plan’s demise than the State Senate was. In the suburbs, 39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains, but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such."
4329,This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority.

4349,Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 for being Soviet spies. It’s a case that some people are still debating and that others have never heard of.
4350,"And it’s “a New York story,” Richard H. Weisberg, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, said."
4351,"The couple were tried in the Southern District of New York and buried on Long Island. New Yorkers “had connections to the case — parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents,” Professor Weisberg said."
4352,"“It’s a story of how a couple that owns a ma-and-pa electronic fix-it store becomes swept up in the web of an investigation,” Professor Weisberg said. “And there are so many unresolved issues, even the guilt and innocence of both Julius and Ethel — who should be seen separately, really in a way — is unclear at the moment.”"
4353,"The case is more than 60 years old, but some at Cardozo say it shouldn’t be forgotten. Today at 4 p.m., the law school will screen a movie about the Rosenbergs called “Daniel,” which the executive producers have described as “inspired” by the case."
4354,"At 6:30 p.m., an actress in the film, Lindsay Crouse, will participate in a discussion with one of the Rosenbergs’ sons, Robert Meeropol. The discussion will be moderated by Professor Weisberg."
4355,Ms. Crouse said the case was long overdue for a re-examination.
4356,"“One of the reasons I think it’s important for students to know what went on in the Rosenberg case is that this country has almost shunned the case,” she said in an interview. “It’s very upsetting on many levels, and we need to look at it square in the face to learn its lessons.”"
4357,"Barbara Kolson, the co-director of the Fashion, Arts, Media and Entertainment Center at Cardozo, who helped organize the event, said the school’s students “did not know who the Rosenbergs were.”"
4358,"“They also did not know who Roy Cohn was,” she said, referring to one of the prosecutors who was instrumental in the convictions."
4359,"Mr. Cohn, who died in 1986, had mentored a cadre of influential people, including President Trump and Roger Stone."

4362,"I was walking down York Avenue after a discouraging second day at my first job. Feeling overwhelmed, I was holding back tears as I trudged home through the rain."
4363,"A few blocks from my apartment, I slowed to a stop in front of a fruit cart. I pretended to scan the contents as I replayed the previous eight hours in my head."
4364,"The vendor tried to tempt me with cherries and tangerines, but I was lost in my own thoughts."
4365,I heard a voice whispering from behind me: “Get the grapes.”

4373,"The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang."
4374,"He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music."
4375,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

4379,"SAN JOSE, Calif. — Silicon Valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been: embattled."
4380,"Lawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech, for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius, has too much power. Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it."
4381,"In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash — Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank — to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny."
4382,That is not the path the companies are taking.
4383,"“The tech companies are not flinching,” said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. “Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They’re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.”"
4384,"There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud — to become, in essence, the internet’s landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend."
4385,"These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them."
4386,"To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn’t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country."
4387,"Big Tech’s push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating."
4388,"Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News."
4389,"Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company’s total employment in 2009."
4390,"But Diridon Station is just a part of Google’s Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million."
4391,"Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber."
4392,"In total, Google’s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook’s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs."
4393,"Amazon’s head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people — and that is not counting its contractors."
4394,The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.
4395,"“For all intents and purposes, we’re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,” said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. “The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.”"
4396,"That’s evident in how robust Big Tech’s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion."
4397,"EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google’s digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast."
4398,"The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives."
4399,"Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone — up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion."
4400,"“Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,” said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
4401,"Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government."
4402,"“The government doesn’t have a good clue,” said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. “They’re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.”"
4403,"Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition."
4404,"“For Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail."
4405,"All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech’s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about."
4406,"During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon’s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct."
4407,"With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything."
4408,"“They’re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,” said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. “There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.”"
4409,"Suzanne Lynn Grossman and JB Sugar met in May 2011 on an airplane that was about to leave New York for Florida. When Ms. Grossman, who is 5 feet 3 inches, arrived at her designated seat, she realized it was located between two tall men who were already seated, one of whom was Mr. Sugar, who is 6 feet 3 inches."
4410,"“How lucky are you that a 5-foot-3-inch woman is sitting next to you instead of another tall guy,” Ms. Grossman playfully said to Mr. Sugar, who was on his way to a digital media convention in Fort Myers, Fla."
4411,"Mr. Sugar looked up from the newspaper he was reading, laughed and said he thought to himself, “Huh, she’s pretty cute.”"
4412,"Moments later, Ms. Grossman floored Mr. Sugar by asking him, “Who won that fight last night?” She was referring to a light-heavyweight championship bout between Jean Pascal and Bernard Hopkins, who, at 46, was attempting to become the oldest world champion in history."
4413,“Did you really just ask me that?” Mr. Sugar said.
4414,"After telling her that Mr. Hopkins had won, Mr. Sugar added that his father, Bert Sugar, was a boxing authority and raconteur. (Bert Sugar died the following year.)"
4415,"Ms. Grossman, a boxing fan who grew up watching sports with her three older brothers, texted one of them, asking if he had ever heard of the name Bert Sugar. Within seconds he texted her back: “Bert Sugar is the king.”"
4416,"Their conversation continued, and as it turned out, Ms. Grossman and Mr. Sugar, who were both living in Manhattan and working in the digital advertising industry, were heading to the same conference."
4417,"“I was thrilled to hear that,” Mr. Sugar said."
4418,"During their chat above the clouds, Ms. Grossman told Mr. Sugar that the sport of boxing was also in her blood. Her great-uncle, the late Leonard Rodman, a pharmacist who owned Rodman Discount Drugs in Bethesda, Md., had gone to the University of Maryland on a boxing scholarship, and later invested money that went toward the training of professional fighters, the most notable of them the former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe."

4421,"After getting acquainted through long letters exchanged via email, Dr. Greene, who normally shipped his car by rail to and from Palm Beach, boarded an airplane for the first time in 27 years, as he was eager to return to New York, where he had arranged to meet Ms. Roy."
4422,"“I could feel we had this great chemistry together,” said Dr. Greene, who is known as Bob."
4423,"They met on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on an early morning in May 2016, Dr. Greene arriving with a box of chocolates."
4424,"“We had shared so much in our emails about our lives, that we felt we already knew a lot about each other,” said Ms. Roy, who has 11 children, six of whom are adopted. (Dr. Greene has no children.)"
4425,"As they shared their first conversation, Dr. Greene leaned over and gave Ms. Roy a kiss on the cheek, “which felt so natural” she said. They proceeded to walk to Central Park, where they sat by the lake, as strangers began taking photos of them."
4426,"“One couple came up to us and asked how long we had been married,” Dr. Greene said."
4427,"They went to a nearby restaurant and chatted the rest of the day away, and the following day Dr. Greene picked up Ms. Roy at a Midtown hotel and they went to his Riverdale apartment."
4428,"“I knew everything was going to work out great between us,” she said, “everything just clicked.”"

4474,A potential rival to Tesla in electric cars just got a big boost from Amazon.
4475,"The online retail giant is leading a $700 million investment in Rivian, a Michigan company that is developing a battery-powered pickup truck and an electric sport utility vehicle. The automaker announced the new round of investment on Friday, offering few details but saying it would remain independent."
4476,"Founded in 2009 by an M.I.T.-trained engineer, R. J. Scaringe, Rivian first showed its truck and S.U.V. at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. The key feature of each is a chassis that is shaped like a skateboard and includes all the components that propel the vehicles — a large battery pack, axles, suspension, cooling system and four electric motors. The company says its pickup will be able to go up to 400 miles on a full charge."
4477,"The deal is the latest example of how the auto industry is being reshaped by new technologies and nimble companies that have raced ahead of many traditional carmakers. While General Motors, Ford Motor and others are scrambling to introduce new electric vehicles, Tesla has become by far the leading seller of electric cars in the United States. Waymo, a division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, is considered by some analysts to be the leading developer of autonomous vehicles."
4478,"“We’re inspired by Rivian’s vision for the future of electric transportation,” Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s chief executive for worldwide consumer, said in a statement. “R. J. has built an impressive organization, with a product portfolio and technology to match. We’re thrilled to invest in such an innovative company.”"
4479,An Amazon spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the thinking behind the Rivian investment.
4480,"Since 2015, Amazon has been building out its own logistics network, one that is a “global, end-to-end network covering all transportation modalities,” Morgan Stanley said in a research note last month. It owns dozens of planes and has a transoceanic shipping operation, not to mention trucks, rail and other ways to deliver products and packages. The company spent more than $27 billion on worldwide shipping last year."
4481,"Amazon relies on contract drivers in passenger cars and trucks to make many last-minute deliveries quicker than it can through delivery partners like the United States Postal Service. Last month, the company said it was testing a delivery device called Scout, which is the size of a large ice chest that can “roll along sidewalks at a walking pace.” The company says it is using the devices to deliver packages to customers in a suburb near Amazon’s Seattle headquarters."
4482,"The company ordered 20,000 Mercedes-Benz vans last year for its delivery partners to shuttle Amazon products to consumers, but those vans run on diesel, a fossil fuel. The company has also been facing pressure from employees looking to reduce its environmental impact, particularly in its logistics operations."
4483,"And last week, Amazon made a “significant” investment in Aurora, a California start-up that is developing self-driving technology. Aurora is led by Chris Urmson, who previously headed Alphabet’s autonomous car effort."
4484,"“For Amazon, this small investment is a good way to enlarge their bet on the E.V. automotive market without having to tool up a plant to find out if it will fly,” said Matt DeLorenzo, senior managing editor of Kelley Blue Book. “Over time, the Rivian investment could give Amazon a starting point to own and operate an in-house package delivery business.”"
4485,"Rivian previously raised about $500 million from Sumitomo, a Japanese conglomerate known for its tire division, and Abdul Latif Jameel, a Saudi industrial group. Those earlier investors also took part in the new investment round, though the companies did not say how much money they put in."
4486,"At the Los Angeles show, Mr. Scaringe described the company's pickup, the R1T, and its S.U.V., the R1S, as upscale vehicles that could be used for off-road adventures. They are intended to compete for motorists who buy pricey Land Rovers and Porsche S.U.V.s. Rivian’s vehicles are expected to sell for $68,000 or more."
4487,"“This is a vehicle you can use,” Mr. Scaringe said. “You can get it dirty, but it’s still a very thoughtful, intelligent design.”"
4488,"Both vehicles may end up competing directly with Tesla models. Tesla already offers an S.U.V., the Model X, and is working on a pickup truck and a smaller S.U.V. Rivian has said it aims to sell about 20,000 vehicles in 2021 and double that in 2022. Last year, Tesla sold about 245,000 cars."
4489,Analysts said Rivian’s success was by no means assured.
4490,"“They still face all the hurdles,” said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. “They have to produce the vehicles. They have to deliver the vehicles. Tesla has been around longer, but it’s still struggling to set up a dealer network and is struggling with high-volume production.”"
4491,"Rivian has kept a low profile, especially compared with Tesla and its flamboyant chief executive, Elon Musk. Until recently, to keep its operations secret, Rivian did not display its name on its buildings. While Mr. Scaringe has a Twitter account, he has posted only 87 tweets — a small fraction of Mr. Musk’s nearly 7,000."
4492,"And while Tesla and Mr. Musk regularly make headlines, relatively little is known about Mr. Scaringe, who is 36. He grew up near Melbourne, Fla.; studied at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and earned a doctorate in mechanical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
4493,"He then created a company, Mainstream Motors, in Florida, intending to produce an affordable sports car that could go 60 miles on a gallon of gas. In 2011, the company was renamed Rivian, and its focus shifted to electric vehicles."
4494,"Rivian employs 600 people, with its main office in Plymouth, Mich., about 30 miles west of Detroit. In 2016, it bought a mothballed auto plant in Normal, Ill., previously owned by Mitsubishi Motors."
4495,"Chris Koos, the mayor of Normal, where Rivian plans to produce its vehicles, described Mr. Scaringe as a “broad thinker” who seems immersed in operational details."
4496,"“When you ask him a technical question, you can expect about a 10-minute answer,” Mr. Koos said."
4497,"GENOA, Italy — Long before the Morandi Bridge collapsed in Genoa, Italy, last year, killing 43 people, an economics professor named Marco Ponti took aim at the private company that managed the structure, raising two fundamental concerns."
4498,"One was money. Mr. Ponti argued that Autostrade per l’Italia, or Highways for Italy, which managed the bridge and more than half of Italy’s 4,000 miles of toll roads, made “abnormal” profits."
4499,"The other was the lopsided power balance between Autostrade and the Italian government. Mr. Ponti, who served on an expert panel advising the government, said ministries did too little to regulate the company."
4500,"Taxpayers were being shorn “like flocks of sheep,” Mr. Ponti said in a newspaper interview in 2003."
4501,"It was a pointed dig. The Benettons, the Italian family famous for wool sweaters and a global clothing empire, controlled Autostrade. If Mr. Ponti hoped to shame them, it didn’t work: He says he was forced to resign from the panel and the Benettons later threatened him with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit before backing off."
4502,"The calamity in Genoa is now the subject of a criminal inquiry, with 21 people under investigation, including nine employees of Autostrade and three officials from the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport. The authorities are sorting through years of email exchanges and documents, plus the contents of a few dozen mobile phones, to try to determine who is to blame."
4503,"But beyond potential negligence, the case has exposed what critics say are deep systemic failings in how Italy privatized roadways. Autostrade reaped huge profits and acquired so much power that the state became a largely passive regulator."
4504,"While no evidence has emerged that inspection findings were manipulated, the company effectively regulated itself — because Autostrade’s parent company owned the inspection company responsible for safety checks on the Morandi Bridge."
4505,"“The government was happy to leave the system to exploit drivers and share in the bounty produced by tolls,” Mr. Ponti said in a recent phone interview, having just headed a commission to assess the viability of a high-speed rail link with France."
4506,"“And because it’s a long concession, nobody is really looking at it, except bureaucrats and the superpower that is Autostrade,” he added. “And they became close friends.”"
4507,There is no doubt that Autostrade’s contract is extraordinarily favorable — and profitable — to the Benettons. It lasts until 2038 and allows Autostrade to raise tolls annually. Experts say that the inspection arrangement is unusual and that other governments require more oversight of privatized bridges and highways.
4508,"Autostrade officials have declined to discuss what caused the collapse but say the company spared no expense for safety. In the last three and a half years alone, the company reported spending more than $10 million maintaining and repairing the bridge. Crews worked on it five out of every seven days in that same period, the company said."
4509,"As for profiteering, an Autostrade spokesman said that the company had long abided by price caps and never raised tolls by more than 1 percent a year. Members of the Benetton family, none of whom are under investigation, declined to comment for this story."
4510,"The bridge collapse has become an explosive political issue in Italy, seized on by the Five Star Movement, one of the two populist parties that formed a coalition national government only months before the accident. Five Star has long denounced Italy’s spate of privatizations, most of which occurred in the 1990s, as sweetheart deals between politicians and their friends."
4511,"In that regard, the life and death of the Morandi Bridge is a parable of Italy’s current economic and political mess, and how it got there."
4512,"The structure was built during the flush, postwar era as a symbol of Italian engineering prowess and aesthetic style. It was then privatized when Italy was clawing its way out of debt and needed money to qualify for membership in the eurozone. And it has collapsed as Italy’s economy is stagnating and the politics that produced privatization are the object of populist scorn."
4513,"Now, the Benettons are suffering through their first encounter with national infamy. For years, the family has courted controversy through a series of provocative, socially progressive ads for their clothing brand, one of which featured President Barack Obama kissing his Chinese counterpart under the word “Unhate.”"
4514,"Far from damaging the family, the ads shaped their image as skillful manipulators of the mass media. But when the Morandi Bridge collapsed, that narrative was upended. Three days later, the anti-establishment newspaper, Il Fatto Quotidiano, ran photographs of the Benettons on the front page."
4515,"The headline read, “We pay, bridges collapse, and they cash in.”"
4516,"Today, some of the remains of the Morandi Bridge are taped off like a crime scene. Access is mostly blocked by armed soldiers. Workers started demolishing the western section, but much of the bridge is intact and as magisterial as ever, soaring 150 feet over a dry riverbed and parking lots. The missing span lends the tableau an eeriness that seems almost cinematic."
4517,"Autostrade is so synonymous with the Benettons — brothers Carlo, Luciano and Gilberto, and a sister, Giuliana — that when the bridge collapsed, Italians awaited their reaction to the tragedy. There were two days of silence before a statement was issued, expressing “deep sympathy” for the victims, and it came through Edizione, the family holding company."
4518,"In the last interview he gave before dying, in late October, 77-year-old Gilberto Benetton explained that the silence was a sign of respect."
4519,"But the muted response stirred outrage. It marked a sharp break from the Benettons’ reputation when Italy decided to privatize Autostrade in the late ’90s. Then, the family was considered the nation’s fresh new face of entrepreneurial energy."
4520,"“It’s quite ironic that they are now being painted as bloodsuckers,” said Andrea Colli, a professor of economic history at Bocconi University in Milan, “because through the ’90s and onward, they had a very positive image.”"
4521,"The New York Times has reconstructed how the disaster happened, from beginning to end."
4522,"Unlike most of Italy’s network of insiders and capitalists, none of the Benetton siblings attended college. They started with a single yellow sweater, which was hand-knit by Giuliana when she worked as an assistant at a fabric shop. Carlo Benetton died last July at 74."
4523,"Today, there are roughly 5,000 Benetton stores around the world, with nearly 8,000 employees and annual revenue of more than $1.7 billion. The name became a global brand, albeit with some notable bumps along the way."
4524,"In the late ’90s, Benetton was struggling against low-cost retailers, like Zara, and looking to diversify into businesses with steadier income streams. A natural monopoly like toll roads looked ideal."
4525,"It was the start of a hugely profitable venture. Though still linked in the public imagination with cashmere crew necks and velvet chinos, today just five percent of the Benetton’s $14 billion portfolio comes from textiles."
4526,Fifty percent comes from infrastructure.
4527,The family’s first step into this new realm was perfectly timed. Italy was still emerging from a brush with bankruptcy and it badly needed cash to reduce debt to swap the lira for the euro.
4528,"An ambitious push was underway to privatize a variety of industries. Seventy different transactions would ultimately net more than $100 billion. Founded in 1950, Autostrade was one of the last major state properties put up for sale."
4529,"The Benettons led a consortium of investors that paid 2.8 billion euros, worth about $4.5 billion in inflation-adjusted terms, for a 30 percent stake in the company. The rest was sold to the public, through the Italian Stock Exchange."
4530,"Far from winning through connections, as Five Star politicians have claimed, the Benettons easily beat out the lone rival bid, led by an Australian bank, which sought a mere 10 percent of the company."
4531,"There simply was not much interest in Autostrade, scholars say, largely because the regulatory framework looked daunting. The Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport had clear control over both inspections and toll rates. At least on paper."
4532,"“Any investor would have been worried about bidding,” said Carlo Scarpa, a professor of economics at the University of Brescia, in northern Italy. “The Benettons, though, knew the system and they understood that the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, which was supposed to supervise the whole thing, was weak. They were able to calculate the weight the company would have in the political arena.”"
4533,"Italy was so desperate for cash that it was ready to strike a deal on very generous terms. There were price caps on tolls, but they were derived using a system described by Giorgio Ragazzi, a retired professor of economic science at Bergamo University, as “highly discretional.” And the contract lasted until 2018, later extended to 2038."
4534,"Autostrade had been highly profitable when it was owned by the state, and it grew more so in private hands. By 2003, the Benettons had increased their stake, leading another consortium to purchase a majority share."
4535,"One of Italy’s biggest clothing retailers and its partners had become, as Professor Ragazzi put it, “lords of the motorway.”"
4536,"If the Benettons benefited, so did the Italian Treasury. Autostrade has poured billions of euros into state coffers, paying nearly 600 million euros a year in corporate taxes, V.A.T. and license fees. Autostrade became an indirect way for the government to continue taxing drivers for a system that, by the time it was privatized, had very nearly been paid for in full."
4537,"“The government,” said Giuliano Fonderico, professor of administrative law at Luiss Guido Carli University in Rome, “has always thought of Autostrade as an A.T.M.”"
4538,"But the Morandi Bridge was showing signs of wear. It had already been through two rounds of maintenance — or “extraordinary works” — on the decks and some of its stays. It was a critical junction in the company’s network of toll roads in northern Italy, and local officials considered building a bypass to reduce the heavy traffic."
4539,But a lot of Genoa residents did not like the idea of all that construction or a bypass that ran near their homes. The plans were put on hold.
4540,"Autostrade became a political powerhouse, acquiring clout that the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport, perpetually underfunded and employing a small fraction of the staff, could not match."
4541,"The Benettons made occasional, bipartisan political donations but those did not explain the company’s influence. Autostrade could perform perfectly legal favors for politicians, like modernizing a stretch of local highway."
4542,"Several scholars say the skewed relationship resulted in a case of “regulatory capture,” the political scientists’ term for the situation when a watchdog bends to the interests of a company it is supposed to supervise."
4543,"When a center-left government took power in 2006, Autostrade’s contract came under scrutiny. The government blocked the company from selling itself to Abertis, a Spanish toll road operator, then signaled that Autostrade needed to be reined in."
4544,"“The problem was not the merger itself,” Antonio Di Pietro, then the minister of infrastructure and transport, said in a statement, “but concession rules that are too favorable toward the motorway operator, so much so that they led to the bad habit of automatic tariff hikes.”"
4545,"The government approved a new law to encourage efficiency and lower tolls, except it never took effect. In 2008, the center-left government fell. The new conservative government of Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon, took power and amended the new law to stipulate annual increases in tolls right through to the end of the contract."
4546,"Though it aided all of Italy’s toll road operators, Autostrade, the biggest, was the biggest beneficiary."
4547,It was labeled “Save Benetton” by critics.
4548,"Beyond fixing blame for the bridge collapse, a central question of the Morandi tragedy is what happened to safety inspections. The answer is that the inspectors worked for Autostrade more than for the state."
4549,"For decades, Spea Engineering, a Milan-based company, has performed inspections on the bridge. If nominally independent, Spea is owned by Autostrade’s parent company, Atlantia, and Autostrade is also Spea’s largest customer. Spea’s offices in Rome and elsewhere are housed inside Autostrade."
4550,"One former bridge design engineer for Spea, Giulio Rambelli, described Autostrade’s control over Spea as “absolute.”"
4551,"“They even approve promotions inside of Spea,” Mr. Rambelli said."
4552,Requests for interviews with Spea representatives went answered by Autostrade’s public relations team. Three Spea employees are now under investigation.
4553,Experts in the field said the relationship opened the potential for conflicts of interest.
4554,"“The engineers inspecting the bridge would have their own professional liabilities to worry about, including the profits of the company that was paying them,” said Linwood Howell, an engineer who conducts bridge inspections in Texas through his firm, XR Structural."
4555,"Such potential conflicts are prohibited in other countries where Autostrade operates. In Chile, for instance, regulations block a private toll operator from hiring a company it owns to conduct inspections, according to Mariana Rocha, a spokeswoman at the country’s Ministry of Public Works."
4556,"In Poland, toll road operators can choose their own inspectors but the work is essentially double-checked."
4557,"“There will always be two kinds of inspections,” said Adrian Furgalski, an infrastructure expert from TOR Transport Consultants Group in Warsaw. “The first one is ordered by that company, but the second one is carried out by the state-owned General Directorate for National Roads and Highways.”"
4558,"In Italy, the Infrastructure and Transport Ministry rarely conducted its own inspections of Autostrade properties. Instead, it reviewed documents provided by Spea."
4559,"Asked about the arrangement, a ministry spokesman, Ulisse Spinnato Vega, blamed the Autostrade contract, saying in a statement that “for too many years the ministry had its hands tied by a totally unbalanced highway concession, in favor of the concessionaire.”"
4560,"“Controls, as well as responsibility for construction, were transferred to the operator, considered the ‘owner’ as per the contract,” he added."
4561,"Not true, Autostrade countered. The contract refers to ceding the management of the motorways, not their ownership. And the terms explicitly give the ministry powers to perform checks and inspections."
4562,"Mr. Fonderico, the administrative law professor from Luiss Guido Carli University, said the ministry actually lacked the expertise to carry out its oversight role, particularly on a bridge as vexing as the Morandi. Over time, he said, the government behaved more like its first priority was cooperating with Autostrade, rather than regulating it."
4563,"“All this,” he said, “suggests a system failure.”"
4564,"In the weeks after the Morandi collapsed, Five Star’s political leader, Luigi Di Maio, called for the revoking of Autostrade’s contracts and renationalizing the management of the roadways. But that talk has quieted down. Though the relationship between Autostrade and the government is now defined by pure hostility, a divorce is unlikely."
4565,"The reason? If the company’s contract were terminated early, the state would need to pay Autostrade the remaining value of the contract, a sum that could exceed $17 billion."
4566,"“The company would take the state to court,” Mr. Ponti said, “and it would win.”"

4568,"In his 82-minute address last night, President Trump cited U.S. economic growth and his efforts to keep it up, while attacking opponents in a speech that ostensibly called for unity in Washington. Here are the highlights for the business world:"
4569,"Mr. Trump defended his economic record. He took credit for America’s robust economic health — a key message for his 2020 re-election campaign — and assailed critiques of his administration’s efforts, including tax cuts and loosened regulations. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States — and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said."
4570,"He kept pressure on China. Mr. Trump promoted his administration’s trade battle with Beijing, saying, “We are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.” Talks between Washington and Beijing over a compromise are continuing."
4571,"And he painted his potential rivals as socialists. As Democratic presidential contenders promote policies like Medicare for all, Mr. Trump tried to paint them as peddlers of dangerous ideas. “Here in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,” he said."
4572,"What didn’t he talk about? “Trump’s speech was notable for what he did not mention, including the ballooning federal debt, once a centerpiece of the Republican agenda; nor did he talk about Social Security, Medicare or other entitlements,” Philip Rucker and Toluse Olorunnipa of the WaPo write."
4573," Democrats fought back. Stacey Abrams, the party’s nominee for Georgia’s governorship last year, focused on “outlining the party’s vision for lower health care costs and a more inclusive immigration policy, and pressing her case that access to the voting booth should be easier, not harder.”"
4574,"Steep cuts could hit Goldman Sachs’s commodities arm, which once generated huge profits for the firm, Liz Hoffman of the WSJ reports, citing unnamed sources."
4575,"What may happen: “Executives are discussing pulling back from trading iron ore, platinum and other metals, and are ordering cost cuts to the sprawling logistics network that handles the transport and storage of physical commodities,” Ms. Hoffman writes."
4576,"The context: The business was once one of Wall Street’s most envied money makers. But such trading has suffered in recent years, thanks to changing markets and tighter regulations. And Goldman’s current C.E.O., David Solomon, cut his teeth as an investment banker and is focused on operations like lending and asset management."
4577,"The symbolism: “By taking a knife to the business, Mr. Solomon is sending a message down the ranks that nothing is sacred,” Ms. Hoffman writes."
4578,"In recent weeks, several companies — including Ford, G.E., JPMorgan Chase and Wynn Resorts — have missed Wall Street forecasts, only to see their stock prices rise. It’s a classic relief rally, writes Matt Phillips of the NYT:"
4579,"• “Stocks of companies that have reported their results have risen by an average of 1.1 percent, the largest post-earnings jump in a decade.”"
4580,"• “With the Federal Reserve backing off plans to aggressively hike interest rates, more investors view the market’s downturn last year as overdone. And they are giving rousing ovations to corporate results just because they’re not as bad as they could have been.”"
4581,• “Analysts said that the current tendency in the markets to see the glass as half-full reflects widespread relief among investors that a recession and a sharp slump in earnings are not in the cards any time soon.”
4582,• “Some analysts said that stocks could keep climbing as the market’s rock-bottom expectations keep getting surpassed.”
4583,"• “At the same time, there is a danger that the stock market’s rise could paper over the genuine problems for the economy that are popping up in fourth-quarter results.”"
4584,"When the Chinese electronics manufacturer Foxconn decided to set up shop in the Midwest, President Trump hailed the move as “one of the great deals ever.” But Bloomberg Businessweek, which interviewed 49 people familiar with the project, reports how badly the effort has gone."
4585,"The plan was to create a high-tech manufacturing hub. It was to be led by a Mount Pleasant plant housing a large chunk of Foxconn’s LCD TV production. “As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire, and grow than right here in the U.S.,” Mr. Trump said at the time, promising that it would create as many as 13,000 jobs."
4586,"But manufacturing hasn’t taken off. “LCD components weren’t made in the U.S.A., according to sources familiar with the operation,” Austin Carr of Businessweek writes. “They were shipped from a Foxconn factory in Tijuana. The Wisconsin plant was only handling the last steps of assembly.” He adds that “during 2018, the company tried and failed to produce its own LCD materials at scale in Wisconsin so it wouldn’t have to import them from Mexico.”"
4587,"Nor has pay or recruitment. “Pay at the factory started at about $14 an hour with no benefits, much less than the $23 average Foxconn promised. Many people weren’t hired full time,” Mr. Carr writes. “Last fall, the company’s hiring targets began dropping internally,” he adds, with Foxconn importing foreign staff for some roles."
4588,"Keeping hold of the title of most valuable American company is proving to be difficult, Stephen Grocer of the NYT writes:"
4589,"• “The positions of Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon have been flip-flopping since the wipeout in the iPhone maker’s stock price late last year.”"
4590,• “The mantle has changed hands seven times among the three companies. Three of those switches have taken place over the past week as the big tech companies reported quarterly results.”
4591,"• “The competition reflects the global economic concerns hanging over the markets as well as the changing technology landscape, and it’s a shift from past years.”"
4592,A bill introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders to limit companies’ ability to buy back stock drew outrage from many in the corporate world — and tempted Goldman Sachs’s former C.E.O. Lloyd Blankfein to tweet for the first time in nearly seven months.
4593,"Mr. Blankfein’s take: “A company used to be encouraged to return money to shareholders when it couldn’t reinvest in itself for a good return,” he tweeted. “The money doesn’t vanish, it gets reinvested in higher growth businesses that boost the economy and jobs. Is that bad?”"
4594,"Mr. Sanders’s retort: The senator shot back that a buyback, “increases the wealth of billionaires” like Mr. Blankfein. “Instead of making the very rich even richer, how about increasing wages for American workers. Is that a bad idea?”"
4595,More buyback news: SoftBank of Japan plans to spend $5.5 billion of proceeds from the listing of its telecommunications arm to repurchase stock.
4596,"The Government Accountability Office has published a report of the president’s travel expenses, which show the cost of his visits to his Florida holiday home:"
4597,"• From Feb. 3 to March 5 in 2017, Mr. Trump spent portions of 14 days at the holiday home. The G.A.O. said that those trips had cost a total of $13.6 million, or just less than $1 million per day."
4598,"• The costs included travel and accommodations, Secret Service expenses and bomb detection. Almost $60,000 was paid directly to Mar-a-Lago."
4599,"• The Democratic senators Dianne Feinstein and Gary Peters, who requested the report, said the findings provide “a snapshot of the tens of millions of dollars President Trump spends to travel to his Palm Beach resort — all at taxpayer expense — including government funds that are paid directly to a business in which the president himself has a financial interest.”"
4600,"Angela Ahrendts will step down as Apple’s retail chief in April after a five-year run. She’ll be succeeded by Deirdre O’Brien, the company’s head of human resources."
4601,"SeaWorld Entertainment said it would hire Gus Antorcha, who was most recently Carniva Cruise Line’s chief operating officer, as its new C.E.O."

4641,"As Western nations and companies continue to pull back from interactions with Saudi Arabia for the killing of Jamal Khashoggi last year, the country’s crown prince is trying to shore up relations with neighbors to the east. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman spent much of last week touring Pakistan, India and China, hoping to build warmer relations and closer trading partnerships. Leaders from all three countries welcomed the Saudi ruler with open arms (and, in one case, golden arms). "
4642,"Karl Lagerfeld, who was an influential force in the fashion world for years and made fusty legacy brands Chanel and Fendi trendy again, died on Tuesday. His precise age is up for debate, but that seems immaterial for a person who essentially described himself as an alien. He was famous for his enigmatic persona and acerbic wit, and for building a broader audience for Chanel’s distinctive products — like its No. 5 perfume, black bouclé jackets, two-tone ballet pumps and quilted handbags."
4643,"Talk about a wardrobe malfunction. Zion Williamson, a star basketball player at Duke University, was only seconds into a game Wednesday when one of his Nike sneakers tore apart. He sat out the rest of the game with a knee injury, and may not play again this season. The incident set off a broader debate about safety and the influence that shoe companies hold over big-time college basketball. Even the shoe chimed in on Twitter."

4645,"Techies love a good gathering. MWC Barcelona, formerly the Mobile World Congress, runs Monday through Thursday, and tech leaders will be presenting their visions for the future of the industry. Sure to be a topic of discussion is the role of the Chinese telecommunications equipment maker Huawei in the construction of the next generation of the world’s wireless networks. The company just announced that it was expanding in Canada, and Britain indicated last week that it will probably use the company’s equipment as it builds its new networks, even as the United States warns that the Chinese government is using the company for spying. "
4646,"American and Chinese trade negotiators seemed to be making some progress on a deal and have extended their talks into the weekend. But President Trump suggested that a final trade agreement wouldn’t be reached until he met with China’s president, Xi Jinping, next month. The White House had previously said it would raise tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion in Chinese goods after Friday if a deal was not reached, and the two sides have been racing toward that deadline. That said, the trade war has been unpredictable from the start, so who knows?"
4647,"Ready for Round 2? Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, are set to meet again on Wednesday and Thursday in Hanoi, Vietnam, as the United States continues its efforts to make North Korea give up its nuclear program. One other possible topic: an official end to the nearly seven-decade Korean War. Mr. Kim will also spend time visiting Vietnamese manufacturing and tourist sites while he’s there. Both American and South Korean officials hope the North Korean leader will see communist Vietnam as a model for integration with the rest of the global economy. In the years since the United States pulled out of the country, Vietnam has developed closer relations and stronger economic ties to the West, and is one of the fastest-growing economies in Asia. "
4648,"Samsung thinks making your phone smaller on command is going to be the next big thing. Its folding smartphones — which aren’t for sale yet — mean you won’t have to strain your eyes when you’re streaming. What luxury! Speaking of that, it turns out you may want to think twice about buying a luxury car. It’s likely to be less reliable than a regular workhorse vehicle (though probably more reliable than an actual work horse). If you’re going to spend money, though, cities and states around the country want to make sure you can pay with cash, even as some retailers move to a credit- or e-payment-only model. "

4650,"On April 27, 2015, Shantay Guy was driving her 13-year-old son home across Baltimore from a doctor’s appointment when something — a rock, a brick, she wasn’t sure what — hit her car. Her phone was turned off, so she had not realized that protests and violence had broken out in the city that afternoon, following the funeral of Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man who drew national attention eight days earlier when he died after suffering injuries in police custody."
4651,"As she saw what was happening — fires being set, young people and police officers converging on the nearby vortex of the disorder — she pushed her son, Brandon, down in his seat and sped home. “Mom, are we home yet?” Brandon asked when they pulled up at their house just inside the city line, where they lived with Guy’s husband, her grown daughter and her husband’s late-teenage son, brother and sister-in-law."
4652,"“Yeah,” she told him."
4653,"“You’re still holding my head down,” he said."
4654,"Guy grew up in an impoverished, highly segregated part of West Baltimore near what was now the focal point of the street clashes, but she had long since climbed into a different stratum of the city’s society; she was working as an information-technology project manager for T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore-based mutual-fund giant. Seeing her old neighborhood erupt changed her life. After long discussions with her husband, who manages the office of a local trucking company, she quit her job and went to work for a community mediation organization. “It just felt like it was the work I was supposed to be doing,” she said."
4655,"In Baltimore, you can tell a lot about the politics of the person you’re talking with by the word he or she uses to describe the events of April 27, 2015. Some people, and most media outlets, call them the “riots”; some the “unrest.” Guy was among those who always referred to them as the “uprising,” a word that connoted something justifiable and positive: the first step, however tumultuous, toward a freer and fairer city. Policing in Baltimore, Guy and many other residents believed, was broken, with officers serving as an occupying army in enemy territory — harassing African-American residents without cause, breeding distrust and hostility."
4656,"In 2016, the United States Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division concurred, releasing a report accusing the city’s Police Department of racial discrimination and excessive force. The city agreed to a “consent decree” with the federal government, a set of policing reforms that would be enforced by a federal judge. When an independent monitoring team was selected to oversee the decree, Guy was hired as its community liaison. This was where she wanted to be: at the forefront of the effort to make her city a better place."
4657,[Read Alec MacGillis’s investigative article on Jared Kushner’s apartment complexes in the Baltimore area.]
4658,"But in the years that followed, Baltimore, by most standards, became a worse place. In 2017, it recorded 342 murders — its highest per-capita rate ever, more than double Chicago’s, far higher than any other city of 500,000 or more residents and, astonishingly, a larger absolute number of killings than in New York, a city 14 times as populous. Other elected officials, from the governor to the mayor to the state’s attorney, struggled to respond to the rise in disorder, leaving residents with the unsettling feeling that there was no one in charge. With every passing year, it was getting harder to see what gains, exactly, were delivered by the uprising."
4659,"One night last October, after Guy and her husband, Da’mon, had gone to bed, Da’mon’s brother banged on the bedroom door. “Yo, yo, get up!” he shouted."
4660,"It was around 11:30 p.m. Da’mon’s 21-year-old son, Da’mon Jr., whom Shantay had helped raise, would ordinarily have been home by then, after his bus ride across town from his evening shift working as a supply coordinator at Johns Hopkins Hospital. But he was nowhere to be seen. Da’mon Sr. rushed to the door and asked what was going on."
4661,"“Dame’s been shot,” his brother said."
4662,"Four months later, I met Guy and Da’mon Jr. at a cafe near my office in the center of the city. Da’mon had recently been released after spending 47 days in the hospital, with 20 surgical procedures. His inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower body to the heart, no longer functioned; he had to rely on collateral veins instead. He was trying to go back to work, but swelling in his legs and shortness of breath were making it hard."
4663,"Da’mon told me he had no idea who was behind the shooting, which he surmised was either an attempted robbery or a gang initiation. It was unnerving, he said, knowing the shooter was still out there somewhere. “I don’t like it when cars slow down to me or people are staring at me too long at stop signs,” he said. “Any one of y’all could be that person. You never know.”"
4664,"But Guy, somehow, had come through the experience even more committed to the cause she had signed on for. “Our city needs restoration,” she told me."
4665,"It takes remarkable fortitude to remain an optimist about Baltimore today. I have lived in the city for 11 of the past 18 years, and for the last few I have struggled to describe its unraveling to friends and colleagues elsewhere. If you live in, say, New York or Boston, you are familiar with a certain story of urban America. Several decades ago, disorder and dysfunction were common across American cities. Then came the great urban rebirth: a wave of reinvestment coupled with a plunge in crime rates that has left many major cities to enjoy a sort of post-fear existence."
4666,"Until 2015, Baltimore seemed to be enjoying its own, more modest version of this upswing. Though it is often lumped in with Rust Belt economic casualties like Cleveland, St. Louis and Detroit, Baltimore in fact fared better than these postindustrial peers. Because of the Johns Hopkins biomedical empire, the city’s busy port and its proximity to Washington, metro Baltimore enjoyed higher levels of wealth and income — including among its black population — than many former manufacturing hubs."
4667,"The city still had its ills — its blight, suburban flight, segregation, drugs, racial inequality, concentrated poverty. But as recently as 2014, Baltimore’s population, which is 63 percent African-American, was increasing, up slightly to 623,000 after decades of decline. Office buildings downtown were being converted to apartments, and a new business-and-residential district was rising east of the Inner Harbor. The city was even attracting those ultimate imprimaturs of urban revival, a couple of food halls."
4668,"The subsequent regression has been swift and demoralizing. Redevelopment continues in some parts of town, but nearly four years after Freddie Gray’s death, the surge in crime has once again become the context of daily life in the city, as it was in the early 1990s. I have grown accustomed to scanning the briefs column in The Baltimore Sun in the morning for news of the latest homicides; to taking note of the location of the latest killings as I drive around town for my baseball coaching and volunteering obligations. In 2017, the church I attend started naming the victims of the violence at Sunday services and hanging a purple ribbon for each on a long cord outside. By year’s end, the ribbons crowded for space, like shirts on a tenement clothesline."
4669,"The violence and disorder have fed broader setbacks. Gov. Larry Hogan canceled a $2.9 billion rail transit line for West Baltimore, defending the disinvestment in the troubled neighborhood partly by noting that the state had spent $14 million responding to the riots. Target closed its store in West Baltimore, a blow to a part of town short of retail options. The civic compact has so frayed that one acquaintance admitted to me recently that he had stopped waiting at red lights when driving late at night. Why should he, he argued, when he saw young men on dirt bikes flying through intersections while police officers sat in cruisers doing nothing?"
4670,"Explaining all this to people outside Baltimore is difficult, not only because the experience is alien to those even in cities just up or down the Interstate from us (though a handful of cities elsewhere, like Chicago and St. Louis, have experienced their own waves of recent violence, albeit less dramatically than Baltimore). It’s also because the national political discourse lacks a vocabulary for the city’s ills. On right-wing talk radio, one of the few sectors of the media to take much interest in Baltimore’s crime surge, there are old tropes of urban mayhem — Trump’s “American carnage.” Typically lacking from these schadenfreude-laced discussions is any sense of the historical forces and societal abandonment that the city has for decades struggled to overcome."
4671,"On the left, in contrast, Baltimore’s recent woes have been largely overlooked, partly because they present a challenge to those who start from the assumption that policing is inherently suspect. The national progressive story of Baltimore during this era of criminal-justice reform has been the story of the police excesses that led to Gray’s death and the uprising, not the surge of violence that has overtaken the city ever since. As a result, Baltimore has been left mostly on its own to contend with what has been happening, which has amounted to nothing less than a failure of order and governance the likes of which few American cities have seen in years."
4672,"To understand how things in Baltimore have gotten so bad, you need to first understand how, not so long ago, they got better. Violence was epidemic in Baltimore in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as it was in many other cities, as crack intruded into a drug market long dominated by heroin. In 1993, the city crossed the 350-homicide mark. These were the years that inspired “The Wire.” They also gave rise to Martin O’Malley, a city councilman who was elected mayor on an anti-crime platform in 1999."
4673,"O’Malley set about implementing what was then known as the New York model: zero tolerance for open-air drug markets, data-centric “CompStat” meetings to track crime and hold police commanders accountable and more resources for law enforcement paired with tougher discipline for officers who abused their power. By the time O’Malley, a Democrat, was elected governor of Maryland in 2006, crime rates, including murders, had fallen across the board, but at a cost. Arrests had jumped to 101,000 in 2005 from 81,000 in 1999 — leaving a city full of young men with criminal records and months and years away from jobs and families."
4674,"This perturbed a police detective named Tony Barksdale. At the time a colonel in his mid-30s, Barksdale, a bald, bearish man with a lugubrious manner, grew up in a rough section of West Baltimore. “I saw my first guy get shot at a football tryout at Franklin Square,” near his home, he told me when I met him for lunch last spring in the city’s Canton neighborhood. His own block was relatively safe, however, because a police officer lived on it. Barksdale was drifting through Coppin State College, “blowing Pell grants,” when he saw a bunch of young black cops on the street one day. The sight inspired him to sign up himself."
4675,"Early in 2007, he proposed a more targeted approach to policing to Sheila Dixon, the City Council president who finished O’Malley’s term as mayor after he was elected governor. Dixon, like Barksdale a product of the city’s black working class, agreed with Barksdale’s vision for reducing the murders without mass arrests. “She said, ‘How long will it take you?’ ” Barksdale recalls. “I said, ‘One day.’ ”"
4676,"Fred Bealefeld, Dixon’s new police commissioner, promoted Barksdale to deputy of operations — he was the youngest deputy commissioner in the city’s history — and Barksdale got to work. He developed plainclothes units with a more surgical approach to policing, which targeted the most violent corners and worked with homicide detectives to arrest the people whose names surfaced in connection with killings. He and Bealefeld met weekly with top-ranking staff members in the mayor’s office and sat down with top city officials every couple of weeks in CitiStat meetings — the municipal equivalent of CompStat — where Bealefeld was quizzed on overtime costs, recruiting and other markers of departmental health. Every couple of weeks, representatives of the police, the state’s attorney’s office and others met to review data on firearms prosecutions."
4677,"Arrests fell by a third from 2006 to 2011 — and homicides plummeted as well, to 197 in 2011, the city’s first time under 200 in almost four decades. A 2018 study by Johns Hopkins found that the new approach to policing was the city’s most effective in recent years. “Baltimore had it going on,” Barksdale told me."
4678,"But while Dixon had carried on O’Malley’s government-accountability practices, she proved less than ethical in her own affairs. A few years into Barksdale’s efforts, she was charged by the state prosecutor with theft and fraud. The prosecutor had scrutinized contracts and jobs her friends and relatives had received from the city — investigations that led to the discovery that she had personally used hundreds of dollars in gift cards solicited from developers and meant for poor children."
4679,"Dixon was convicted and resigned, and was replaced by the City Council’s president, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, an Oberlin- and University of Maryland School of Law-educated daughter of a powerful state legislator. Rawlings-Blake, a more reserved leader than Dixon, wanted Bealefeld to communicate with the public more often than he was inclined to but also less candidly; a white cop from a family full of them, Bealefeld was known for his blunt talk about “punks” and “knuckleheads.” In 2012, he retired, as did two of his closest City Hall allies, and Barksdale became interim commissioner."
4680,"Barksdale interviewed for the permanent job, but Rawlings-Blake instead hired Anthony Batts, the former police chief in Oakland, Calif. Batts had resigned in Oakland amid tensions with the mayor and federal court monitors, but he had a doctorate and spoke fluently about the need for community relations. Batts’s profile suited a city that wanted to believe that its most violent days were behind it. Barksdale didn’t find out he had been passed over until he got a call from Justin Fenton, The Sun’s lead police reporter."
4681,"When the Black Lives Matter movement transformed the debate about policing in 2014, Batts embraced an image as a reformer. He attended street festivals in full uniform. He reined in Barksdale’s plainclothes teams after a series in The Sun reported how much the city was spending to resolve lawsuits over rough arrests — more than $5 million since 2011. On Bealefeld and Barksdale’s watch, there had also been a rise in shootings by police officers, which roughly doubled between 2006 and 2007 before dropping to earlier levels — a fact Barksdale remains unapologetic about. “To hit the brakes on crime, there will be police-involved shootings,” he recalls telling Dixon and Bealefeld. “I know their mind-set. They’ll respect you if you’re willing to die just like them. And there are people who just don’t get that.”"
4682,"It was a controversial approach and one that Batts did not subscribe to. He replaced much of the command staff, and other people left on their own. Among them was Barksdale, who retired at age 42. “I like a commissioner who says, ‘Look, we have people in the community we have to arrest,’ ” Barksdale told me. “Not cops out here dancing in full uniform.”"
4683,"Political developments, meanwhile, had eroded foundations of the department’s recent successes, which depended heavily on coordination with City Hall and state and federal prosecutors, as well as with Maryland’s parole-and-probation office and other state agencies that might not have been as attentive to the city if the governor had not been a former Baltimore mayor. But in 2014, Maryland elected Larry Hogan, a Republican suburban real estate developer, as O’Malley’s successor for governor. Hogan put less pressure on state offices to work closely with the city’s police. And the new state’s attorney, after an upset victory in a low-turnout Democratic primary, was Marilyn Mosby, a 34-year-old former assistant prosecutor who had run with the apparent goal of shaking up the city’s law-enforcement bureaucracy. She jettisoned not only top deputies but also many prosecutors; more left of their own accord. Over time, senior members of her office became a less-frequent presence at CompStat and other meetings with law-enforcement partners. (Mosby’s office did not respond to requests for official comment.)"
4684,"In her campaign, Mosby called for diverting more nonviolent drug offenders into treatment. One halfway house used for this purpose was in West Baltimore, and drug dealers had zeroed in on its residents as a clientele, according to a member of Mosby’s staff. On March 17, 2015, Mosby’s office asked a police commander to target a nearby intersection for “enhanced” drug enforcement. A few weeks later, two officers on bike patrol a couple of blocks south of that intersection encountered a man named Freddie Gray."
4685,"Among the deaths at police officers’ hands that animated the Black Lives Matter movement in its early stages, Gray’s was uniquely ambiguous. He was not shot, as were Laquan McDonald in Chicago, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., Tamir Rice in Cleveland and Walter Scott in North Charleston, S.C. All that is known for certain is this: When he encountered the police officers, Gray — who had engaged in low-level dealing over the years — ran. When the police gave chase and tackled him, they found a small knife in his pocket and placed him under arrest. Gray was put in the back of a police van shackled and unbuckled, in violation of a new department policy. When the van arrived at the Western District’s headquarters, Gray was unconscious with a nearly severed spinal cord. He died seven days later."
4686,"Protesters took to the streets after Gray’s death. Batts, who had canceled a European vacation he was scheduled to take the previous week, appealed to Hogan’s new state police chief for reinforcements, but he received an offer of only about 120 officers, far fewer than he hoped for. The demonstrations proceeded mostly peacefully for a week until Saturday, April 25, when rowdy baseball fans headed to Camden Yards — including out-of-town Red Sox fans — taunted a group of protesters who had marched into downtown. In the mayhem that ensued, some teenagers and young men smashed in police cruisers’ windshields and bar windows and looted a 7-Eleven."
4687,"The police held back, making only about a dozen arrests. It appeared as if Batts wanted to set himself apart from the heavy-handed tactics in Ferguson, where anti-riot police officers bristled with military hardware. That night, Batts, who declined to be interviewed on the record for this article, hailed his officers’ limited response to the disorderly crowd amassed downtown. “We’re taking our time to give them the opportunity to leave,” he told reporters."
4688,"Bealefeld, Batts’s predecessor, told me: “There were people inside police leadership circles that were being celebrated for their restraint. People were thinking, ‘Aha, we want to be seen in that light.’ ” But this hands-off response drew resentment within the department, where many were already disgruntled with the commissioner from California. “It would have been over that night if we’d been able to do our jobs,” one veteran officer who attended a command briefing that weekend told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters. “They let it fester.”"
4689,"The approach was notably different two days later, the day of Gray’s funeral. The police were on edge over two separate rumors — a social-media call for a youth “purge,” or rampage, into downtown after school let out, and talk of gangs uniting to attack police officers. The F.B.I. quickly determined that the second threat was baseless, but Batts responded heavily to the first rumor, sending 300 officers to confront students at a big west-side transit hub after school and stand guard outside the adjacent shopping mall. Someone in authority — to this day, officials won’t say who — ordered a shutdown of transit service. Some of the stranded teenagers started throwing rocks and bricks at the police, who lacked proper protective gear and had received little riot-response training. Before long, a CVS pharmacy a mile away was on fire."
4690,"In hindsight, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that the riot was probably avoidable — if Batts had had more officers at his disposal, if his officers had been better trained, if there hadn’t been the seeming overreaction to Monday’s swirling rumors. But within three hours it was out of his control. Governor Hogan dispatched National Guard troops and established a command center in West Baltimore. That Friday, Mosby — whose policing request may very well have led to Gray’s arrest — held a televised news conference announcing a long list of serious charges against six officers, including “depraved heart murder,” or causing death through indifference. “I have heard your call for ‘no justice, no peace,’ ” she declared."
4691,"Her announcement of charges — based on an investigation her own office conducted, not trusting the department’s — helped stanch further unrest, but it delivered a profound blow to morale among rank-and-file officers, who were already aggrieved over their leadership’s handling of the riot, in which 130 officers were injured. Officers bridled at the ringing, declamatory tone of her announcement. “It was the way she did it — the grandstanding,” the veteran officer told me."
4692,"“Cops don’t necessarily stop in their tracks because another cop is charged in a crime,” Kevin Davis, one of Batts’s deputies at the time, told me. “Typically it’s a bad cop, a crook, a drug dealer or a drunk or someone who abuses his wife. But when these cops got charged criminally and the probable cause was not easily understood by the rank and file — that gave them a sense of dread.”"
4693,"The department’s officers responded swiftly, by doing nothing. In Baltimore it came to be known as “the pullback”: a monthslong retreat from policing, a protest that was at once undeclared and unmistakably deliberate — encouraged, some top officials in the department at the time believe, by the local police union. Many officers responded to calls for service but refused to undertake any “officer-initiated” action. Cruisers rolled by trouble spots without stopping or didn’t roll by at all. Compounding the situation, some of the officers hospitalized in the riot remained out on medical leave. Arrests plunged by more than half from the same month a year before. The head of the police union, Lt. Gene Ryan, called the pullback justifiable: “Officers may be second-guessing themselves,” he told The Sun. “Questioning, if I make this stop or this arrest, will I be prosecuted?”"
4694,"Ray Kelly, a West Baltimore community activist, had achieved measured success in building relationships with officers along the drug-riddled Pennsylvania Avenue corridor, where his organization had an office. Suddenly, those officers were gone. “We saw a pullback in this community for over a month where it was up to the community to police the community,” Kelly told me. “And quite frankly, we were outgunned.” In the vacuum, crews took new corners and people settled old scores. Not a single person was killed on the day of the rioting. But the following month, May, would conclude with 41 homicides — the most the city had experienced in a month since the 1970s, and more than the city of Boston would have for the entire year."
4695,"Late that month, Batts admitted he was having trouble getting officers to do their job. “I talked to them again about character and what character means,” he told me and other reporters following a City Council hearing. He grew so mortified over the pullback that he started wearing suits instead of his uniform. By July’s end, 45 people had been killed during the month, and Rawlings-Blake had replaced Batts with Davis. The department was hemorrhaging officers now, at all ranks."
4696,[Read about the prosecution of six officers for the death of Freddie Gray.]
4697,"Amid the upheavals of 2015, Shantay Guy found herself recalling, as a girl on North Avenue in the 1980s, diving under a car during a shooting, getting oil on her favorite shirt. Her work at T. Rowe Price suddenly seemed unacceptably rarefied. “I’m not doing enough,” she thought. “I’m doing a lot to make rich people richer.”"
4698,"She approached a friend, Erricka Bridgeford, who is director of training at the Baltimore Community Mediation Center, a nonprofit group that helps settle personal and neighborhood conflicts. Bridgeford encouraged Guy to take her training course. Guy started volunteering as a mediator and was soon offered the job of leading the center. She took it, along with a two-thirds salary cut."
4699,"Across Baltimore, there was by then a mounting sense that whatever path there was to be found out of the city’s chaos, its residents were going to have to find it themselves — that the authorities were no longer up to the task. The lawlessness that followed the police pullback had persisted, and the city ended 2015 with 342 homicides, a 62 percent increase over the year before, within a dozen deaths of the worst year of the 1990s. Ninety-three percent of the victims were black. The rate at which detectives were able to close homicide cases fell from 50 percent in 2013 to 30 percent, as residents grew even warier of calling in tips or testifying."
4700,"In July 2016, Mosby’s office dropped all remaining charges against officers in the Gray case, after trials resulted in three acquittals and one hung jury. It was that August that the Department of Justice released its 163-page report on the Police Department, a result of a yearlong investigation it opened at the request of Rawlings-Blake after Gray’s death. The report concluded that the police had engaged in “a pattern or practice of conduct that violates the Constitution or federal law.” The police’s pedestrian stops were disproportionately focused on African-Americans. They frequently patted down or frisked people “without identifying necessary grounds to believe that the person is armed and dangerous.” Baltimore officers used “overly aggressive tactics that unnecessarily escalate encounters, increase tensions and lead to unnecessary force,” the report stated."
4701,"The report affirmed years’ worth of civilian complaints about the department. But it also essentially ignored Barksdale and Bealefeld’s largely successful efforts to move toward a more targeted policing approach. It suggested that mass arrests led inexorably to Gray’s death and the protests, when in fact by 2014, arrests had been halved from a decade earlier. Barksdale was especially livid about the report’s suggestion that the department, which is roughly 40 percent black, was prejudiced because it arrested mostly African-Americans in many parts of town. “Now a cop in a black community is wrong because he confronts black people?” he told me."
4702,"He was also confounded by the report’s mockery of the department’s crackdowns on dice games, a frequent target of robberies and shootings. “Dude, you can’t have [expletive] open-air dice games,” he said. Armed robbers “want to stick that up, and if they have a shotgun and buckshot, you’ll have six or seven victims.” The failure of the report’s authors to grasp this, he said, betrayed a fundamental ignorance of local realities. “They have no understanding of what these things mean in Baltimore,” he said."
4703,"By that point, Baltimore had elected yet another new mayor: Catherine Pugh, who won the Democratic primary that April — in Baltimore, the only election that matters — after Rawlings-Blake opted not to run for re-election. That December, Pugh came to her first meeting of CitiStat, the municipal accountability body started by O’Malley. The meetings were held on the sixth floor of City Hall, where top city officials sat around a curved table and put questions to whichever agency head had been called to the lectern that day to defend his or her agency’s performance."
4704,"Very few people knew what to expect from Pugh. A longtime state legislator, she had won mostly by virtue of not being Sheila Dixon, who, having served her community-service sentence, ran again for her old job and narrowly lost. Pugh’s inscrutability extended to her bearing — she spoke in muffled tones, and her bangs often hung so low as to almost cover her eyes."
4705,"At the CitiStat meeting, a major topic of discussion was a rise in carjackings. Earlier that month, an 80-year-old member of the City Council was attacked by two teenage boys while getting into her car in a parking garage, leaving her with a black eye. Davis, the commissioner, and his deputy said that the carjackings appeared to be the work of violent drug crews, who were deploying teenagers to steal cars as an initiation of sorts, and then often using the cars while committing homicides."
4706,"Pugh grew agitated. The carjackings weren’t a law-enforcement problem, she said; they were a problem of footloose youth. Why wasn’t the meeting instead focusing on how to get teenagers into jobs or after-school programs? She declared the meeting a waste of her time and left. It was the last CitiStat meeting she would attend for at least six months."
4707,"Pugh seemed overwhelmed by the continuing violence. It was not until August 2017 that she announced her plan to counter it. It would be built around daily meetings to focus city services in high-crime areas — which she dubbed the Violence Reduction Initiative — as well as the addition of a Boston-based program for at-risk young people called Roca, and the expansion of Safe Streets, which deploys ex-offenders as “violence interrupters.”"
4708,"At the core of Pugh’s plan was the notion that crime was driven by root causes. This was true, but it risked overlooking the most immediate dilemma: People inclined toward lawbreaking increasingly thought they could do so with impunity. Delivery of basic services to address root-cause problems was also undermined by the departure of key city officials, as word spread that Pugh was not easy to work for."
4709,"By this point, it was plain that the surge in violence was not simply going to abate. Robberies and burglaries had also risen sharply. The city’s population was falling again, nearing a 100-year low with less than 615,000 in a census estimate released in March 2017. There were other, more ambient signs of disorder: the dirt bikes, squeegee boys at intersections. The city’s bike-sharing program was so plagued with vandalism that it was eventually shut down."
4710,"That summer, Erricka Bridgeford, Shantay Guy’s friend at the mediation center, started Baltimore Ceasefire, an effort to get the city’s criminal element to put down their weapons for one weekend every three months. The group’s main slogan was straightforward: “Nobody Kill Anybody.” A second slogan was aimed at those inclined not toward violence but toward apathy: “Don’t Be Numb.” During the first cease-fire, that August, two men were killed. Bridgeford went to the scenes to mourn the victims."
4711,"The Justice Department’s report, meanwhile, had led to the federal “consent decree” that the city negotiated with the department — a sweeping set of reforms of the Police Department that set out new rules governing stops and searches, internal discipline and much more. Gene Ryan, the leader of the police union, complained that his organization had been shut out of the process of drafting it. Tony Barksdale, who had been retired for three years and now spent his days trading stocks online, attacked it incessantly on Twitter, accusing city leaders of “handcuffing your own cops while turning the city over to criminals.”"
4712,"One afternoon not long after Guy began her job as the consent-decree monitoring team’s community liaison, she strapped on a bulletproof vest and rode along with a city police officer to see the realities he and his colleagues faced. The officer started his shift at 9 a.m. and, because of the department’s shortage of officers, would work until 2:30 the next morning."
4713,"They cruised block after block of rowhouses in an especially drug-plagued area. The officer received a text message to disperse a cluster of young men — a frequent point of confrontation in the city. Young men often congregate in front of corner stores or liquor stores, sometimes just hanging out, other times selling drugs; the city would have a record 692 fatal opioid overdoses in 2017."
4714,"“I’m supposed to clear this corner,” the officer told Guy, showing her the address on the screen."
4715,“Can you do that?” she asked.
4716,"“No,” he said. As he understood it, the consent decree barred him from dispersing the young men. So he didn’t. But then his phone rang. “I guess when I ignore a call, then I get a phone call telling me I need to do my [expletive] job,” he said. Which was indeed what the call was."
4717,"He and Guy drove to the address, where half a dozen young men in their late teens or early 20s were standing outside. The officer got out of the car and told them to move along. “The kids are angry,” Guy recalled; they had already been booted from a nearby corner that afternoon. “Like, ‘What the [expletive], we’re just standing here. We’re not doing anything, what’s going on?’ ”"
4718,"For Guy, the moment affirmed her belief in the consent decree. This sort of rote policing seemed pointless; nothing was accomplished by confronting the young men beyond fomenting ill will. “The question for me becomes: What’s the intention for clearing the corners?” she told me. “Are you clearing the corners in white neighborhoods? The corners would not be so crowded if we actually became responsive to community needs.” This was, in essence, Pugh’s strategy — if only it could be made to work."
4719,"On Nov. 15, 2017, a veteran detective, Sean Suiter, drove with a partner to a blighted corner of West Baltimore to investigate a recent homicide. Suiter told his partner he had seen someone suspicious in a vacant lot and went to investigate. Shots rang out. His partner found Suiter bleeding from the head, his gun lying under his body. The 43-year-old father of five died the next day. His death was ruled a homicide, the 309th of the year."
4720,"The police locked down six square blocks around the scene for six days. Davis, the commissioner, pleaded with the community to offer tips to identify the “heartless, ruthless, soulless killer.” The death felt like the city’s reaching its nadir, in more ways than one. As the public learned in the week that followed, Suiter was scheduled to testify the next day before a grand jury in a vast corruption case that federal prosecutors filed earlier in the year: a conspiracy that painted a picture of a Police Department that, amid the lawlessness of the city, had descended into widespread lawlessness itself."
4721,"The accused were eight current and former members of an elite plainclothes unit called the Gun Trace Task Force, which, prosecutors said, had developed a penchant for robbing people, mostly but not exclusively drug dealers. Six of the officers pleaded guilty to racketeering and robbery."
4722,"The trial of the remaining two, when it started in January 2018, offered daily revelations of brazen amorality. There was the video shot by the unit to document “discovering” $100,000 in a drug dealer’s safe from which they had removed nearly twice that amount to divvy up. There was the bail bondsman describing how, over the course of many months, he sold $1 million in drugs funneled to him by Sgt. Wayne Jenkins, the group’s ringleader, including bags of pills looted from pharmacies during the April 2015 riots."
4723,"There was the wiretap of officers’ conspiring to lie to avoid detection for causing an accident during an improper high-speed chase, while doing nothing to help the victim lying in pain across the street. And there was the extremity of their fraudulent overtime, many tens of thousands of dollars for each — they were being paid while at the beach, while spending weeks doing exurban home renovations — all of it draining the treasury of a city where, as the trial was taking place, thousands of children were shivering in unheated classrooms."
4724,"The trial was an indictment of the string of police chiefs who had, despite some headline-making arrests of corrupt officers, presided over the decay of measures O’Malley pushed for as mayor, like reducing internal-affairs trial backlogs and expanding integrity stings. The court proceedings also illuminated how the surge in violence after Gray’s death abetted the corruption. Some officers had been lining their pockets for years, but their activities became a true conspiracy amid the chaos of 2015-16, as commanders were so desperate to stem the violence that they gave them free rein."
4725,"After the trial concluded, a dozen officers gathered at headquarters for a focus group, convened by the department to solicit their input on new policies stemming from the consent decree, on which they were to start receiving training in 2019. But the officers had no interest in talking about the decree, according to one participant. Instead, they vented about the impossibility of doing their job in a department in meltdown. They were bitter about being constantly “drafted” into mandatory overtime — departures and anemic recruiting had left the department with only 2,500 sworn officers, down 500 from five years earlier."
4726,"A change in how the department scheduled shifts — made during Batts’s tenure at the urging of the police union despite the warnings of Barksdale and Bealefeld — had helped cause the city to pay $47 million in overtime in 2017, three times overbudget; some days, 40 percent of patrol shifts were being staffed with mandatory overtime, wearing down officers. The officers were also angry about the lack of resources and equipment. They fumed over the conflicting orders they received. “It’s: ‘Go out and stop crime, but don’t hurt anyone’s feelings,’ ” the veteran officer told me. “ ‘Be aggressive — but not too aggressive.’ ”"
4727,"In January 2018, Pugh replaced Kevin Davis with a new commissioner, Darryl De Sousa, but De Sousa resigned five months later after federal prosecutors charged him with failing to file tax returns for three recent years. The interim commissioner, Gary Tuggle, had barely stepped into the revolving door of leadership when he found himself facing fresh crises: an officer who quit after being caught on video pummeling a man on the sidewalk, another found passed out drunk in his patrol car, a top commander who quit after throwing a chair against a wall during an argument at Police Headquarters."
4728,"And then there was the stunning conclusion of the independent review panel investigating the death of Detective Suiter: He had most likely committed suicide in the vacant lot and made it look like a cop-killing, the panel ruled in August. The investigators believed his suicide was possibly due to his ties to the corruption case."
4729,"On a hot day in mid-August, several dozen city officials, police officers and commanders gathered at a bedraggled shopping plaza in the Highlandtown section of southeast Baltimore for one of the regular neighborhood walks that Mayor Pugh was conducting in her effort to exude a sense of authority. The mass of suits and uniforms did a slow circuit of a few blocks of rowhouses, trailing behind Pugh. “Watch your step,” someone called out as the group neared a dead rat."
4730,"A neighborhood leader pointed out problem spots: a dark block where prostitutes congregated, a bus stop in front of a liquor store that allowed loiterers to claim they were waiting for the bus, piles of trash. It was far from the city’s roughest neighborhood, but Pugh was visibly taken aback by the disorder on display. She expressed particular displeasure over the trash bags that had been piled into containers in advance of pickup day. “You don’t see trash out front in Ashburton,” the middle-class black enclave where she lived, she said under her breath."
4731,"Two weeks later, I met Pugh in her office in City Hall. The month was on its way to ending with 30 homicides, almost one per day. But when I started to ask her about the surge in violence since 2015, she cut me off. “If you follow the trends lately, since November of last year we’re trending downward,” she said."
4732,"“They’ve trended down only so much,” I protested."
4733,"Pugh looked down at an iPad, swiping through crime-data summaries. “May, we had almost a 30 percent reduction in violence. In October of last year, when I created the Violence Reduction Initiative, the following month, November, we dropped by almost 18 percent. We dropped again in December, in January, in February.”"
4734,"“Year to date right now,” I replied, “we’re barely below where we were last year, and last year was our worst year ever.”"
4735,"“No,” she said."
4736,"“We just had more than one a day this past month,” I said."
4737,"“This has been one of the worst months, but we’re about 20 percent down in homicides this year thus far,” she said. “That’s tremendous in comparison with last year.”"
4738,"“We’re very likely to end up at 300 again this year,” I said."
4739,"“We’re very unlikely to get to 300 this year,” she said."
4740,"There were 17 homicides in a single week in late September. The year would end with 309 homicides — the fourth straight year above 300. It was the early 1990s all over again — or even worse, considering that the city was now registering comparable numbers despite having 100,000 fewer people living in it."
4741,"In mid-November, Pugh announced her choice for the next commissioner: Joel Fitzgerald, the police chief in Fort Worth, Tex. But reporters at The Sun discovered overstatements in his résumé; the City Council expressed doubts about confirming him; and he himself seemed ambivalent. Finally, after Christmas, with the city in its eighth month without a permanent commissioner, Pugh told reporters that she was considering bringing back Tony Barksdale, as head of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice."
4742,"It was an intriguing development, given how outspoken Barksdale had been in his criticisms of current department leadership and of the consent decree to which the city had committed itself. When I met with him a second time a couple of months earlier, in October, he told me he did not doubt the need for reform; he was mortified that some of the corrupt officers had come from the plainclothes teams he created. But he was worried that things had gone too far. “The criminals are so emboldened now,” he said."
4743,"The decree’s demands had made it too difficult for officers to clear drug corners, he said. He was hearing from his former colleagues that loiterers were already reciting the limits it imposed on the officers to them on patrol, mockingly. (I had heard similar reports from a community activist who favored the decree.) Its broadened definition of “use of force” — physical actions that officers had to document in reports, which went on their records and would be scrutinized — made officers less likely to bother engaging physically."
4744,"“What do you think happens when these guys see the cops not getting out of their car?” Barksdale said. “Years ago, if I pulled up and said ‘Let’s move,’ they moved. Now who has the control? They have control.” Citizens lose trust in the police not only if they abuse their authority but also if they do nothing about people wreaking havoc on their community. “Look at the number of bodies,” he said. “We’re losing horribly in Baltimore City.”"
4745,"It was two days later that Da’mon Guy Jr., Shantay Guy’s stepson, got off the bus in the northwestern part of the city. As he began his walk toward home, a purple Volvo S.U.V. pulled up with four or five people inside. He heard the locks click open. As he ran, he heard a shout, then a gunshot. It didn’t register that he was hit in the lower back, he said later, until he realized that he couldn’t get up. He called his own ambulance."
4746,"Mayor Pugh visited him in the hospital several times. She was in the room when Da’mon, unable to speak because he was intubated, texted his stepmother: “Am I going to die tomorrow? Do my legs work?”"
4747,"A couple of days later, he went into cardiac arrest. Doctors and nurses rushed in. Da’mon Sr. was in the hallway, out of his mind with panic, shaking and screaming. “He was just O.K.! I was just with him! He was just O.K.!” People were trying to restrain him. “Just let me see him!” he screamed."
4748,"As the blip of Da’mon’s heartbeat returned on the monitor, Guy tried to calm her husband: “Can you hear it?” she said. “Just focus on the sound.”"
4749,"As Guy recounted the story in the cafe, I asked what she thought had driven the surge in violence. It was the perception, she said, that “police officers are not doing their jobs, and folks out there doing dirt see that they’re not doing their jobs and whatever they’re doing they can get away with.”"
4750,"This was not so different from what I heard from Barksdale (who would learn in early March that he wasn’t getting the City Hall job), but she insisted the answer was not a return to tougher tactics. “Tony and I aren’t going to agree,” she told me. “I’m always going to be looking at what’s throwing the children in the street: What’s happening upstream to get them there?” That applied even to the person who shot her stepson, she said. “What happened to him or her that made this O.K. for them?” she said. “I believe they’re victims, too. I really do.”"
4751,"Guy had recently left her role with the consent-decree team to take a job at a civic-leadership organization, but she was still involved in police reform. She would be leading meetings around town in which yet another new commissioner would be introduced to residents: Michael Harrison, late of New Orleans. Pugh had settled on him after the Fort Worth chief pulled out in January. Harrison seemed a good fit, someone who knew what it was like to police a violent city. And he came from a department that had been in deep turmoil, after Hurricane Katrina, and was now operating under its own consent decree."
4752,"On nine occasions, Guy stood alongside Harrison as he listened to the crowd turning out to see him. A vast majority of questions were from residents, most of them African-American, asking for the department to provide their neighborhoods with more officers and a more energetic response to crowded corners and other signs of disorder."
4753,"One of the meetings was in a school auditorium in Edmondson Village, a section of southwest Baltimore that has been especially hard hit by the surge in violence. Last summer, just a few blocks from the school, a 7-year-old girl was fatally shot in a car off Edmondson Avenue, the thoroughfare that the transit rail line that Hogan canceled would have run along. A police officer had been sitting in his cruiser a block away with the windows up; residents rushed to alert him."
4754,"The meeting was standing room only. “We just want to feel safe, period,” Monique Washington, president of the Edmondson Village Community Association, told Harrison. “Our people are in fear, and we’re tired.”"
4755,"An hour into the forum, a neighborhood resident named Renee McCray stepped up to the microphone. She described how bewildering it had been to accompany a friend downtown, near the tourist-friendly Inner Harbor, one night a few months earlier. “The lighting was so bright. People had scooters. They had bikes. They had babies in strollers. And I said: ‘What city is this? This is not Baltimore City.’ Because if you go up to Martin Luther King Boulevard” — the demarcation between downtown and the west side — “we’re all bolted in our homes, we’re locked down.” She paused for a moment to deliver her point. “All any of us want is equal protection,” she said."
4756,"It was a striking echo of the language in the Department of Justice report and the activists’ condemnations of the police following Gray’s death. Back then, the claims were of overly aggressive policing; now residents were pleading for police officers to get out of their cars, to earn their pay — to protect them."
4757,"You could look at this evolution as demonstrating an irreconcilable conflict, a tension between Shantay Guy and Tony Barksdale never to be resolved. But the residents streaming into these sessions with Harrison weren’t suggesting that. They were not describing a trade-off between justice and order. They saw them as two parts of a whole and were daring to ask for both."
