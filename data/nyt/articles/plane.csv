0,The deadly crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines has led to a virtual worldwide grounding of the plane and raised urgent questions about why a brand-new aircraft would go down minutes after takeoff.
1,"President Trump said on Wednesday that the United States, one of the last holdouts in barring flights of the popular jet, would now do so “until further notice.” American and Canadian regulators said new satellite data showed similarities between the Ethiopian crash and another deadly one months earlier by a Max 8 operated by Lion Air in Indonesia, raising further questions about the safety of the aircraft."
2,"The investigation into the Ethiopian crash, which killed 157 people from 35 countries, is fast-moving, and far-reaching. There are still more questions than answers, but some possible explanations are emerging."
3,Here’s a guide to our coverage.
4,"• The captain of the Ethiopian plane reported “flight control problems” to air traffic controllers minutes before the plane crashed near Addis Ababa, the airline said."
5,"• Such problems generally suggest difficulties with the handling of the aircraft or the computerized flight control system, rather than other issues like a fire on board."
6,"• After the Lion Air crash, part of the flight control software known as MCAS came under scrutiny. Investigators will try to determine whether the Ethiopian Airlines flight experienced software problems. The Ethiopian airline has a tradition of high-quality training of its pilots."
7,[A reconstruction of the Lion Air crash from the perspective of the pilots.]
8,"• The flight data and voice recorders have been recovered and will be sent abroad for study. If they are in good condition, the data could be read quickly. If not, the process could take weeks."
9,"• All of the 371 Max 8 planes in service worldwide now appear to be grounded. The United States grounding will affect Southwest and American, heavy users of the planes and the only United States carriers that have them."
10,"• Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, called President Trump on Tuesday to express his confidence in the safety of the Max 8, and the Federal Aviation Administration had said until Mr. Trump’s announcement on Wednesday afternoon that the planes could keep flying while it conducted its review."
11,"• Norwegian Air, which has one of the largest Max 8 fleets outside the United States, said it would seek compensation from Boeing after European regulators grounded the aircraft."
12,"• Boeing shares fell 6 percent on Tuesday, after dropping 5 percent on Monday. They closed up slightly on Wednesday."
13,"• If the Ethiopian crash is linked to the MCAS system, the consequences for Boeing could be severe. It has already begun a costly redesign of the flight control software, an effort on which critics say Boeing has dragged its feet. It faces lawsuits from victims’ families and has suffered an incalculable blow to its reputation."
14,"CARACAS, Venezuela — A visit to Venezuela by two military airplanes from Russia, which landed in broad daylight at the international airport in Caracas, has set off alarms that the Kremlin might be acting more brazenly to protect President Nicolás Maduro from the uprising against him."
15,"Russian and Venezuelan officials have not disputed the arrival of the airplanes, which were first seen at the airport on Saturday. Such flights ordinarily would be sent to a protected military air base beyond the sight of the public."
16,[Why is Russia helping Venezuela?]
17,"The planes brought supplies and technical advisers to Caracas, Venezuela’s capital, according to a Russian state news agency and a Russian diplomat. The visit was related to military cooperation contracts signed years ago between Russia and Venezuela, said the news agency, Ria Novosti, suggesting it was routine."
18,"A Russian diplomat in Caracas, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the diplomat was not authorized to speak to the media, confirmed the Ria Novosti account and said there was nothing unusual."
19,"But opposition members said the visibility of the military planes was unusual and had been meant to send a message. The timing showed that both Russian and Venezuelan officials wanted to convert a routine technical stop into a show of strength, said Rocio San Miguel, a Venezuelan security analyst."
20,"“They want to make it as visible as possible,” said Ms. San Miguel. “This is a sort of bluff in a strategically important moment for Maduro.”"
21,Russia has emerged as Mr. Maduro’s main backer since opposition leader Juan Guaidó proclaimed himself interim president in late January with support of the United States and about 50 other states.
22,"Russia has maintenance contracts for weapons sold to Venezuela under late President Hugo Chávez, including air defense systems, fighter jets and tanks, that are worth billions of dollars."
23,"Flight tracking websites showed an Ilyushin IL-62 jet and an Antonov AN-124 cargo plane flew from Moscow’s military airport to Caracas’s international airport via Syria. The cargo plane flew back to Syria on Monday, according to flight tracking website bosphorusobserver.com."
24,"The arrival of the advisers came as Venezuela activated Russian-made S300 air defense systems last week, according to satellite imagery analysis firm ImageSat Intl. Russia has also recently deployed the S300 in Syria."
25,"Members of Venezuela’s opposition have accused Mr. Maduro of escalating the country’s deepening political crisis. They have pointed to widespread irregularities during the last election, consider Mr. Maduro’s government illegitimate and have asked him to step down and to allow them to call new elections."
26,"President Trump has repeatedly said that all options are on the table to remove Mr. Maduro, not ruling out military intervention."
27,State Secretary Michael Pompeo told his Russian counterpart in a phone call Monday that the United States will “not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela.”
28,"Last week, Venezuelan secret police detained Mr. Guaidó’s chief of staff on terrorism charges, a move that the Trump administration said would be punished."
29,One of Russia’s richest women died on Sunday when a private plane on which she was traveling crashed near an airport in Germany.
30,"Natalia Fileva, 55, a co-owner of a conglomerate behind the Russian company S7 Airlines, was among three people killed when the six-seater plane crashed into an asparagus field south of Frankfurt, the German news agency D.P.A. reported."
31,"The plane took off from Cannes, France, and crashed on Sunday afternoon while approaching the Frankfurt-Egelsbach Airport, which is south of the German city’s main international airport. The pilot was among the three victims, and the Russian news media reported that the other passenger was Ms. Fileva’s father."
32,"In a statement, the S7 Group described the accident as “an irreparable loss.” The company said the circumstances of the crash were so far unknown, and that Russian experts would assist an international investigation."
33,"Two people were also killed nearby when a vehicle they were traveling in collided head-on with a police car that had been racing to the site of the plane crash, D.P.A. reported. Three officers in the police car were injured."
34,"S7 Airlines, also known as Siberia Airlines, has a fleet of 96 aircraft and flies to destinations in Europe and Asia, according to its website."
35,News reports on Monday cited an earlier article by Forbes Magazine that estimated Ms. Fileva’s net worth at $600 million.
36,"• The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 and Max 9 models. President Trump announced the decision hours after Canada had grounded them, pointing to new satellite data suggesting similarities between the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday and a crash in Indonesia in October. The F.A.A. had been the holdout regulator in allowing the jetliners to keep flying."
37,• New disclosures point to what appears to have been a struggle by pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to control their new Max 8 aircraft minutes after takeoff.
38,"• Adding to pressure on Boeing, a major customer asked the company to compensate it financially for having to ground the aircraft."
39,• The company’s stock price fell on Mr. Trump’s announcement but rebounded to finish up slightly on Wall Street after two consecutive daily declines. Boeing shares are still down nearly 11 percent from last Friday.
40,• At least two pilots who flew United States routes on the Max 8 filed incident reports with the federal government that raised safety concerns and criticized a lack of training on the new plane.

42,"President Trump said the United States would ground the 737 Max, reversing a decision by American regulators to keep the jets flying after a second deadly crash involving one of them, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, on Sunday."
43,"For days, the Federal Aviation Administration had resisted calls to ground the plane, even as safety regulators in more than 40 countries banned flights by the aircraft."
44,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
45,"Mr. Trump spoke hours after Transport Minister Marc Garneau of Canada grounded all Max 8 and Max 9 planes registered in the country. He also banned any entry into Canada’s airspace by the aircraft, a move that would have affected operations of carriers based in the United States that operated the planes."
46,The Max models of the 737 are among the best-selling commercial jetliners manufactured by Boeing.
47,Mr. Garneau said at a news conference that the step had been taken after a review of newly available satellite tracking data — presumably available to aviation regulators elsewhere — that suggested similarities in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the crash last October of a Lion Air Max 8 in Indonesia.
48,"The F.A.A. said in a statement that the decision to temporarily ground the planes was based on “new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today,” but did not go into detail. “This evidence,” it said, “together with newly refined satellite data available to F.A.A. this morning, led to this decision.”"
49,"The reversal by the agency came a day after Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, spoke with Mr. Trump by phone to make the case that the plane was safe."
50,"In a statement Wednesday after Mr. Trump’s announcement, Mr. Muilenburg said, “Boeing continues to have full confidence in the safety of the 737 Max.” But, he said, “We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution.”"
51,"Shortly after takeoff from Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport, the captain of the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner reported “flight-control problems” to air traffic control. That suggests the cockpit crew was having trouble with the mechanical instruments used to handle the aircraft, the computerized systems that fly it, or both."
52,"The pilot’s alert was reported Wednesday by a spokesman for the airline, Asrat Begashaw; the airline’s chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, made similar remarks to CNN the day before."
53,"Mr. Begashaw said the control tower had granted the crew’s request to return to the airport, and three minutes later it crashed, killing all aboard."
54,"The disclosure added to suggestions that the plane had not responded to intended actions by the pilots. There has been no suggestion so far of terrorism or other outside interference in the functioning of the aircraft, which was only a few months old."
55,"In earlier evidence pointing to the possibility of an intrinsic problem with the Max 8 model, control issues were reported by the crew of the Lion Air Max 8 that crashed minutes after takeoff in Indonesia last October."
56,"Mr. Begashaw declined to specify what control problems may have led to the crash on Sunday, which killed all 157 people aboard."
57,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
58,"After the American government announcement grounding the Max planes, F.A.A. officials said the flight data and voice recorders recovered from the Ethiopian Airlines crash site, known as the black boxes, would be sent to France for analysis. Investigators believe they may be critical to determining the cause of the crash."
59,"Southwest Airlines, with 34 Max 8s, and American Airlines, with 24, are the largest operators of the aircraft in the United States. Both said they were working to rebook passengers and minimize schedule disruptions after the F.A.A. grounded the planes."
60,"At least two pilots who flew Boeing 737 Max 8 planes on routes in the United States had raised concerns in November about the noses of their planes suddenly dipping after engaging autopilot, according to a federal government database of incident reports."
61,"The problems the pilots experienced appeared similar to those preceding the October crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, in which 189 people were killed. The cause of that crash remains under investigation, but it is believed that inaccurate readings fed into the Max 8’s computerized system may have made the plane enter a sudden, automatic descent."
62,"In both of the American cases, the pilots safely resumed their climbs after turning off autopilot. One of the pilots said the descent began two to three seconds after turning on the automated system."
63,"“I reviewed in my mind our automation setup and flight profile but can’t think of any reason the aircraft would pitch nose down so aggressively,” the pilot wrote."
64,"A pilot on a separate flight reported in November a similar descent and hearing the same warnings in the cockpit, and said neither of the pilots on board was able to find an inappropriate setup."
65,"“With the concerns with the MAX 8 nose down stuff, we both thought it appropriate to bring it to your attention,” the pilot said."
66,"The complaints were listed in a public database maintained by NASA and filled with thousands of reports, which pilots file when they encounter errors or issues. The database does not include identifying information on the flights, including airline, the pilot’s name or the location."
67,"Another pilot wrote of having been given insufficient training to fly the Max 8, a new, more fuel-efficient version of Boeing’s best-selling 737."
68,"“I think it is unconscionable that a manufacturer, the F.A.A., and the airlines would have pilots flying an airplane without adequately training, or even providing available resources and sufficient documentation to understand the highly complex systems that differentiate this aircraft from prior models,” the pilot wrote."
69,The pilot continued: “I am left to wonder: what else don’t I know? The Flight Manual is inadequate and almost criminally insufficient.”
70,News of the incident reports was first reported by The Dallas Morning News and confirmed by The New York Times.
71,"Egypt, Vietnam and Kazakhstan banned flights by the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft on Wednesday. More than 41 countries have grounded the planes."
72,"Hong Kong, a Chinese territory with its own aviation authorities, also announced a ban in its airspace on Tuesday."
73,"Norwegian Air, a low-cost airline that has one of the largest Max 8 fleets outside the United States, said it would seek compensation from Boeing after European regulators had grounded the aircraft."
74,"“It is obvious that the costs incurred by the temporary grounding of brand-new aircraft should be covered by those who have made the airplane,” the company said."
75,"Belying its name, Norwegian flies routes all over Europe and beyond. According to the airline’s website, flights to European destinations were running with moderate delays and a handful of cancellations."
76,"In a message to passengers, the airline said that it had 18 Max 8 aircraft in its fleet of more than 160 planes."
77,"Norwegian had been operating the Max 8 from Providence, R.I. and Stewart Airport in New Windsor, N.Y. to Dublin. Norwegian announced Wednesday that it would now use a larger plane, the 787, for the flight from Stewart. Passengers from both airports will be rebooked on that flight, and Providence passengers will be bused to the other airport."
78,"For some Canadian travelers whose itineraries were upended by the decision to ground the Boeing Max planes, the reaction was not irritation but relief."
79,"Suzanne Waldman, returning home to Ottawa with her 11-year-old son after visiting her sister in Vancouver, had gone through airport security when WestJet informed them the flight had been canceled. Then she learned why: the plane was a 737 Max."
80,"“I didn’t want to look and see if we were on this aircraft today,” said Ms. Waldman, who knew one of the passengers on the Ethiopian Airlines flight that crashed. “I knew it was a little bit of an issue, and I didn’t want to worry.”"
81,"WestJet rebooked them with an overnight layover in Calgary, Alberta, and Ms. Waldman said she was very happy."
82,"Aaron Oram, returning home to Newfoundland from a family trip in Orlando, was stuck in Toronto because his connecting flight was canceled. When he learned the reason — the grounding order — Mr. Oram expressed approval."
83,"“I’m 100 percent for the safety aspect,” Mr. Oram said, “I’m a nervous flyer.”"
84,"Once known for deadly skies, China has doubled down on aviation safety as it grows in wealth and power. This week, as it took the lead among world governments in grounding the Max 8, China showed willingness to assert itself in airline safety."
85,"Chinese regulators acted swiftly, grounding 96 of the planes operated by Chinese carriers less than 20 hours after the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday. Many other countries followed, but it was not until Wednesday that the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States grounded the planes."
86,"That is a big shift from a generation ago, when Chinese regulators largely followed the F.A.A.’s lead. Today, Chinese airlines are among the safest in the world, according to industry statistics."
87,[We answered readers’ questions about the Boeing 737 Max 8.]
88,"While regulators in much of the world have ordered temporary groundings of the Max models, the United Nations civil aviation agency said it would await definitive findings about what went wrong on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302."
89,"“Once the final report into this accident is available we will have verified and official causes and recommendations to consider,” the agency, the International Civil Aviation Organization, said in a statement on Tuesday."
90,"The agency, based in Montreal, manages the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the agreement that ensures safe and orderly air travel around the world. According to its website, the agency works with United Nations member states and industry groups “in support of a safe, efficient, secure, economically sustainable and environmentally responsible civil aviation sector.”"
91,"Flying with an unhappy child is no fun for anyone, everyone knows that. But it wasn’t until I asked you for your tips, tricks and traumatic tales of babies on planes, that I realized I didn’t know exactly how many different victim groups were involved."
92,The kids are in misery. The parents are dying a thousand deaths from shame and frustration. The flight attendants suffer stress. And everyone else on the plane is either irritated or graciously pretending that they’re not.
93,"The stories you shared could fill a book, to be shelved under either humor or horror:"
94,"“I have a four-year-old, which is akin to having a monkey-cat hybrid,” wrote Wren West. During a departure delay, her son became a thrashing wild man. “If it didn’t cost $600, I would have just asked to be taken off the plane right then and there,” Ms. West noted. “I bet all 100 passengers would have pitched in.”"
95,"Matt Hubbard’s son was on his shoulders at baggage claim as he approached his parents, who had come to greet the flight. “Just as I was able to catch their eye,” he wrote, “my son threw up all over the top of my head, covering my glasses.”"
96,"On a recent flight, the woman sitting across from Roxann Steinberg “took a urine-soaked cloth diaper off her baby and wrung it out onto the carpeted aisle floor. She then put the ‘dry’ diaper back on the baby and resumed her magazine reading.”"
97,"Whether you’re a parent, a baby or someone trapped in the same flying metal tube with them, help is at hand."
98,"While you’re still in the airport, don’t break out the electronics, Lesley Golkin wrote. “Move around, talk, eat, play games. Don’t sit still until you have to!”"
99,"And hit the bathroom. “You want brand-new diapers and empty bladders all around,” she said."
100,"Many fliers board early, at the “traveling with small children” announcement. Brandon R. Cornuke, however, takes the opposite approach; why endure more time on the plane than necessary? “Wait until the last minute, overhead space be damned.”"
101,"Or, if you’re traveling with a fellow parent, steal Julie Murrell’s idea: “One parent boards early and stows baggage. The other parent boards last, giving the little ones maximum time to work off some energy.”"
102,Oh — and bring balloons.
103,"“Uninflated balloons don’t weigh anything and don’t take up any space,” noted Gwen Wong. During one delay at the airport, “we inflated the balloons, and instantly we had a fun game of knuckle volleyball. One of my better ideas.”"
104,"“A window seat is a must,” wrote Gina Sitaraman. (She undoubtedly means for your child.)"
105,"Jessie Keyt tries to get the bulkhead (front) seats, “so you can set up a little play area, with a blanket on the floor, out of the way of other passengers.”"
106,"When Debbie Ettington’s daughter was just old enough for her feet to reach the seat in front of her, “we chose seats that put one parent in front of her and one beside her. It was much easier to be the one whose seat was kicked than to deal with unsympathetic fellow travelers.”"
107,Ear pain from the changing cabin atmosphere is a frequent cause of crying or fussiness. Louise Joy’s best trick: “Have a bottle or drink ready — or breast feed — when you are taking off or landing. Drinking helps the baby or toddler clear their ears.”
108,"Carry lollipops; the sucking and swallowing relieves pressure problems, too. (And, as Alyson Cahill wrote: “They can also be used as bribes. Yup, I said it.”)"
109,"Some things to bring on board with babies are obvious, like plentiful snacks. And if your youngsters are explosion-prone, bring extra clothes (for them and for you)."
110,But here’s a frequently endorsed suggestion: A time-release goody bag.
111,"“I would always buy a few very small gifts, toys, etc. and wrap each one separately. Then I’d give one to my little boy every hour or two. Kept him entertained all the way,” recalled Chrissie Hill."
112,"For her two small sons’ gifts, Amy Howard used lots of tape, which, she wrote, “added time to the unwrapping.” (Upon reaching the destination, she’d rewrap the same items but swap recipient sons. Sneaky!)"
113,"What should these little gifts be? Puzzles, goldfish crackers (Ms. Howard); animal figures, books (Alexandra Matus); games, crayons (Jim and Ria Wallmann); dollar store items, Happy Meal toys (Katie Ryan-Anderson); and Matchbox cars and magnets (Beth Josolowitz) are all good suggestions."
114,"Plenty of passengers get peeved at parents when the kids are upset, but here’s a news flash: The parents already know."
115,"If you’re that parent, expressing your own self-awareness can work wonders. On a recent flight, a young couple handed, to my wife and other nearby passengers, a baggy containing apologetic tokens like candies and chocolates. A note read: “Hello! We’re twin baby boys on our first flight! We’d like to apologize in advance if we lose our cool, get scared or our ears hurt. We hope you have a great flight!”"
116,"Similarly, when her daughter was a baby, Amy Adams Harding handed out earplugs. “That simple gesture seemed to diffuse the dismay of those unlucky enough to get seated near a lap child.”"
117,"Most of your suggestions for surviving toddler transit terror involved supplying distractions. Of course, there are always phones or tablets, but electronics aren’t the only options:"
118,"Pipe cleaners. “They can be twisted around fingers, pens and other objects to make instant, unique toys that can be straightened and repeatedly recreated,” wrote Vicki Lee. “Fold under the wire ends to avoid sharp pokes.”"
119,Ms. Josolowitz brought Cheerios as well. “My son and I threaded the pipe cleaner through the Cheerios to make a (partially) edible bracelet.”
120,"Ice cubes. A flight attendant suggested this one to Deborah Fels: Put some ice cubes into a couple of airline cups. “Little kids are usually fascinated with the movement, sound and the visual of ice and clear plastic.”"
121,Sticky things. Many of you mentioned the miracle of mild adhesive.
122,"Ruth Martins: “Painter’s tape provides endless entertainment (stick it on your nose, make a bandage, create a road for a car), doesn’t leave residue and is disposable.”"
123,"Victoria Wilson: “Band-Aids.” Her two-year-old “spent at least an hour methodically taking each one out of the box, carefully unwrapping it and then moving onto the next. Worth every penny.’”"
124,"Lisa Bain: “Post-it notes. Tell your toddler it’s her job to decorate the window, the tray table, the seat back, your face, whatever. Have her scribble something on each note and stick it up.”"
125,Ramona Layne: “Bring a sticker book they’ve never seen before.”
126,"Soapy things. On one international flight, Megan Wyatt walked her almost-two-year-old to the bathroom. “He pumped the foamy soap, squealed with delight as he lathered up, rinsed and walked back. Walk, lather, rinse, walk back, repeat. For 11 hours.”"
127,Beth Martin went with shaving cream. “Hoist him onto the sink and let him finger-paint on the mirror. It worked like a charm and cleaned up easily.”
128,"(Speaking of the bathroom: Once Laurel Braun made it there with her hysterically crying son, the engine drone “calmed him right down. It was like magic.” It also makes a superb soundproof booth of last resort.)"
129,"You, dear readers, seem polarized on the topic of slipping your offspring a sleep-inducing medicine like Benadryl — even when your pediatricians made the recommendation."
130,"Apparently, the concern isn’t the moral principle of drugging your child; it’s that Benadryl sometimes makes kids wired, not tired. “Our 18-month-old ‘lap child’ spent the flight running up and down the aisle of the plane,” remembered Carrie Stewart."
131,"Dozens of you wrote not of pipe cleaners and shaving cream, but of understanding. “Being supportive to parents in their worst moments, when they have no control over their environment, should be the norm, not the exception,” noted Catherine Pearlman."
132,"Indeed, many readers described deriving pleasure from chatting with young seatmates (Dina A. Gamboni); exploring the pictures in the airline magazine with them (Sandra Wilde); playing peek-a-boo through the seat cracks (Barbara Mohon); or making puppets from the airsickness bags (Daria Gideos)."
133,"Ms. Joy goes even further. “Help the parents out. Watch one of the kids while the parent takes the other to the bathroom. Help with the overhead bin.” Less stressed parents, she notes, often leads to happier kids, too."
134,"Dozens of people wrote that they still remember these kindnesses years later. (Regina Ottman, in fact, wishes to post a personal ad here. “If you were on that flight from Vietnam/Korea to Newark Liberty International Airport in June 1999 and offered to hold a tired baby so her parents could rest: We have thought of you often over the years, and we wish you every blessing!”)"
135,"Finally, one last recommendation for harried parents, supplied by Ariane Le Chevallier: “Have one glass of wine or one cocktail. One takes the edge off. Two makes you leave things on the plane.”"
136,"In the next Crowdwise: What are some of the wisest — or worst — words of wisdom anyone’s ever told you? Passing along advice is a standard component of parenting, grandparenting and mentoring — but one person’s counsel doesn’t always work for the next. Let us know the circumstances, the aftermath, and whatever new advice you took away from the experience. Email us at crowdwise@nytimes.com by March 25."
137,"LONDON — Emiliano Sala, a soccer player who recently moved to the English Premier League, was aboard a small airplane that disappeared Monday night while crossing the English Channel, and he and the pilot are feared dead, the authorities said on Tuesday."
138,"John Fitzgerald, chief officer for Channel Islands Air Search, said that an air and sea operation would continue, but he did not expect to find either survivors or parts of the aircraft."
139,"“I think we’re sort of getting to that stage now that it would be difficult to find anyone alive,” Mr. Fitzgerald, 58, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “The cold would have taken effect. The tide flows so fast, there’s the wind and a lot of white water — it’s more and more unlikely for the chance of survival.”"
140,"France’s Civil Aviation Authority confirmed that Mr. Sala, 28, who was about to begin playing for the club Cardiff City, was on the plane along with the pilot. Edwige Leroy, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it was not yet sure whether anyone else was aboard."
141,"The police in Guernsey, an island in the Channel, said two people were on the plane."
142,"Mr. Fitzgerald said it was unclear why the aircraft had disappeared. “We don’t know whether it was system failure,” he said."
143,"The Piper Malibu plane — a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft — departed Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time — 7:15 in Britain — on Monday, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales."
144,"By 8:23 p.m. in Britain, it had disappeared from air traffic control radar, about 15 miles north of Guernsey, the Guernsey police said in a statement."
145,"“The aircraft on passing Guernsey requested descent,” the Guernsey police said."
146,"They did not say why the pilot would have wanted to descend so far short of the destination, but Mr. Fitzgerald speculated that it could have been to avoid freezing conditions and precipitation."
147,"“They were possibly trying to get underneath the weather,” he said."
148,"The plane was flying at an altitude of 2,300 feet when it lost contact."
149,"A search-and-rescue operation started Monday evening in heavy seas and continued on Tuesday, with British and French helicopters, airplanes and ships taking part. The search was suspended at dusk on Tuesday, with plans to resume on Wednesday morning, the Guernsey Police said."
150,"The plane’s disappearance could be the second air-related tragedy for the Premier League in a short span. Less than three months ago, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the owner of Leicester City, died when his helicopter crashed as it was leaving the stadium."
151,"Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward from Argentina, enjoyed a rapid rise to prominence relatively late in his career. At one point this season, playing for Nantes in the French league, he had scored more league goals than any other Argentine player in Europe’s major leagues — a list that includes the likes of Paulo Dybala of Juventus, Mauro Icardi of Inter Milan and Lionel Messi of Barcelona."
152,"Mr. Sala left his homeland for Europe at the age of 16. After attracting attention from several teams in England and Spain, he was initially recruited to join the youth development system at Girondins de Bordeaux, spending time on loan to Orleans, Niort and Caen as a teenager."
153,"In 2015, he signed with Nantes for 1 million euros, more than $1.1 million."
154,"He proved to be a reliable, if unspectacular, striker — the “sort you do not see much any more,” according to the Nantes team manager, Vahid Halilhodzic. But this season he had a run of 12 goals in 16 Ligue 1 games, which made him, for a while, the most prolific striker in the country."
155,"His form was sufficiently impressive for Cardiff City to pay 15 million pounds, or more than $19 million, to sign him — a record for the club. Desperate for some offensive power, the team ranked next-to-last in scoring among the 20 Premier League teams, and had played a converted defender as its main striker for much of the season. It was in danger of relegation."
156,"Mr. Sala was in Nantes on Monday to say goodbye to his teammates, according to The Guardian. He was scheduled to start training with Cardiff City on Tuesday morning."
157,"The Nantes team postponed a match that had been scheduled for Wednesday against L’Entente, a club in France’s third tier."
158,"DHAKA, Bangladesh — Special forces troops stormed a plane on the tarmac of a Bangladesh airport on Sunday, fatally shooting a passenger who sought to speak with the country’s prime minister, officials said on Monday."
159,"Biman Bangladesh Airlines Flight 147 had been traveling to Dubai from Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. The domestic passenger, identified by the police as Mohammed Polash Ahmed, tried to storm the cockpit about 15 minutes after takeoff on Sunday afternoon, forcing the pilot into making an emergency landing in Chittagong, where the plane had been scheduled to make a stop."
160,"A senior official with Biman Bangladesh Airlines, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven crew members and 143 passengers, including Mr. Ahmed, who was in his mid-30s, were aboard the plane."
161,"After landing at Shah Amanat International Airport on Sunday evening, all but one crew member — who was kept as a hostage but not harmed — were evacuated, the official said."
162,Military commandos then rushed the plane and shot Mr. Ahmed after he refused to surrender.
163,"Mohammad Mufti Mahmud Khan, a spokesman for the Rapid Action Battalion, a Bangladeshi police force comprised of military personnel, said in an interview that investigators had taken Mr. Ahmed’s fingerprint and matched it in a criminal database."
164,"Mr. Khan would not elaborate on the case against Mr. Ahmed, who lived in a district near Dhaka, the nation’s capital. But he said there was no evidence at this point that Mr. Ahmed had links to terrorist groups that have struck before in Bangladesh, a predominantly Muslim nation of about 160 million people."
165,"“We are trying to get more information abut his old case,” he said."
166,"In July 2016, a group of young men entered the upscale Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka with heavy bags of weaponry, including grenades. They sorted out non-Muslim and foreign diners and killed 20 hostages and two police officers using guns and machetes."
167,"The attack, which was claimed by the Islamic State, was the most ambitious by insurgents in the region in recent years, and evidence that Bangladesh’s militant networks may have internationalized."
168,"Passengers and officials initially told reporters that Mr. Ahmed had been carrying a pistol and had claimed to have a bomb on the aircraft. One passenger, Osman Gani, said Mr. Ahmed, who was sitting in the 17th row, had threatened to shoot people shortly after takeoff."
169,"“He also fired several rounds, leaving the passengers panicked,” Mr. Gani was quoted as saying by the Dhaka Tribune."
170,"But later, a local police commissioner, Mahabubor Rahman, said the pistol was a fake. And on Monday, Mohibul Haque, the secretary of Bangladesh’s civil aviation and tourism ministry, would not confirm that Mr. Ahmed was carrying a weapon — real or fake — of any kind."
171,"Officials said that during the standoff, the suspect told army officials that he wanted to speak with his wife and Bangladesh’s prime minister, Sheikh Hasina."
172,"Mrs. Hasina had been in Chittagong, a large port city officially known as Chattogram, earlier on Sunday, but returned to Dhaka, about 150 miles northwest, before the hijackinging attempt took place, the Dhaka Tribune said."
173,"M. Naim Hassan, the chairman of Bangladesh’s Civil Aviation Authority, told reporters that Mr. Ahmed appeared “mentally imbalanced” based on his behavior."
174,"Moniruzzaman, a police officer in Mr. Ahmed’s home district who goes by only one name, said in an interview that he was known locally “as a cheater.”"
175,"“He used to take money from people, making promises that he would send them abroad for work, or he would give them a job in the country,” Mr. Moniruzzaman said."
176,"Mr. Ahmed died before reaching a Chittagong hospital, officials said. It was unclear as of Monday how he had managed to board the flight, a Boeing 737-800, with what looked like a gun."
177,"In December, Bangladesh’s governing party handily won parliamentary elections, clinching a third consecutive term for Mrs. Hasina. But local and international rights organizations accused the party, the Awami League, of creating an intimidating atmosphere by arresting and harassing opposition candidates and preventing them from campaigning."
178,"Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the national flag carrier, was established in 1972, according to the Australia-based CAPA Center for Aviation. It operates domestic passenger service across Asia and Europe."
179,"A small plane crashed into a Southern California home on Sunday, killing five people, injuring two others and spraying debris across several residential blocks that temporarily became a site of chaos."
180,"The crash, which occurred around 2 p.m., killed four people inside the Yorba Linda home — two men and two women — as well as the plane’s male pilot, Lt. Cory Martino of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department said at a news conference on Sunday. Officials said the pilot had been the only person on the aircraft; the relationship between the four people inside the home was not clear."
181,"An investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, Eliott Simpson, said the plane left Fullerton Airport at 1:35 p.m. It traveled about 10 miles and had climbed to about 7,800 feet, he said, before making a “rapid descent” into Yorba Linda, a sleepy suburban city 10 miles northeast of Disneyland."
182,"On Monday, the authorities identified the pilot as Antonio Pastini, 75, of Gardnerville, Nev. — a retired Chicago police officer. They did not release the names of the four other people who were killed or disclose the exact cause of their deaths."
183,"Two other people were taken to a hospital Sunday with what the authorities described as “moderate injuries,” though they did not elaborate."
184,"Video posted on Twitter by a man who said he lives near the site of the crash showed several-foot-high flames knifing through the roof of a home on a winding street. In the video, there are occasional explosive pops, and neighbors urge each other to “get away” from the burning residence."
185,"The man, Joshua Nelson, later posted a photo of what appeared to be wreckage from a plane strewn across a neighbor’s driveway and lawn."
186,"“The plane blew up in the sky,” Jared Bocachica, who witnessed the crash, told the local news station KTLA."
187,"At the news conference, Mr. Simpson said debris from the plane, a 1981 Cessna, was scattered as far as four blocks from the crash site. Officials later said that more than a dozen homes had been littered with debris from the Cessna, adding that the fuselage ended up in someone’s yard."
188,"Nancy Mehl, another nearby resident, told The Los Angeles Times she was in her kitchen when she heard what sounded like the high-pitched whine of a plane preparing for takeoff."
189,"“And then it felt like a bomb went off through the front of the house,” Ms. Mehl told the newspaper, adding that pieces of the plane came rocketing through her home."
190,"“One of the first things I did when I saw the damage was get on my knees and thank God,” Ms. Mehl told The Times. “Talk about being spared.”"
191,"TEHRAN — A 39-year-old cargo plane operated by the Iranian Army crashed into a residential area near the capital, Tehran, on Monday, killing 15 of the people onboard, state news media reported. One crew member survived and was hospitalized."
192,"State television said the plane struck an area neighboring the Fath airfield, northwest of Tehran, and burst into flames. It was not clear whether there were any casualties among people on the ground."
193,"The plane, a Boeing 707 passenger jet outfitted for cargo, was transporting lamb meat to Iran from Kyrgyzstan, the semiofficial news agency Mehr reported."
194,"Iran is one of the last countries to fly the 707, which was produced between 1957 and 1979. Many airplanes in the country are old: United States sanctions prevent the military and civilian carriers in Iran from buying new airplanes, and make it very difficult to obtain parts for those they already have."
195,"American sanctions were eased under the 2015 nuclear agreement, but President Trump reimposed them after he withdrew the United States from the pact last May."
196,"Pictures of the crash site showed the plane’s burned and broken fuselage lying between buildings, its tail section rising from a garden. Images published by the semiofficial Fars news agency showed part of the nose crashed through a wall and into a game room, with a pile of lamb carcasses outside."
197,"State television reported that the plane was attempting to land in the wrong place — a military airfield, rather than its intended destination, Payam Airport about two miles away."
198,Mehr reported that two representatives of a meat-importing company were aboard the plane in addition to the crew.
199,"Iran has experienced dozens of fatal aviation accidents since the 1979 Islamic revolution. In February 2018, a commercial jet belonging to Iran Asseman, a domestic carrier, crashed in a mountainous region of the country, killing all 66 aboard."
200,"The plane crash on Monday comes as Boeing faces scrutiny in Indonesia over its role in the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 that plummeted into the Java Sea in late October, killing all 189 people on board."
201,"On Monday, Indonesian officials said Navy divers had recovered the flight’s cockpit voice recorder, raising hopes that the recordings could help explain precisely how the pilots fought to save the plane."
202,"Any airline disaster demands explanation, but the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday — the second in less than five months by the same new model of plane — raises more than the usual questions and fears."
203,"Shortly after the Boeing 737 Max 8 took off from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, bound for Nairobi, Kenya, the pilot sent a distress call and received permission to return to the airport. Six minutes after takeoff, the jet plunged to earth, killing all 157 people aboard."
204,Here is a look at what we know about the disaster — and what we still don’t.
205,[Read our latest updates on the Ethiopian Airlines crash.]
206,"It is much too soon to say why the plane went down, or to rule out possibilities like pilot error, mechanical breakdown, maintenance problems or terrorism."
207,"The “black box” flight data and voice recorders were recovered, the airline said on Monday, but the information in them can take weeks or months to analyze. Investigators still have not said what was learned from the recorders recovered after a previous 737 Max 8 crash, in Indonesia in October."
208,"In aviation disasters, early speculation often turns out to be misguided. The causes may end up being problems that were unexpected, perhaps because they had rarely been encountered."
209,Investigations sometimes take years.
210,"The investigation into the Lion Air crash has focused on the possibility that aircraft software put the plane into a dive, overriding the flight crew’s manual controls, based on incorrect data about the jet’s speed."
211,"That has raised questions about whether the computer system — which differs from earlier models of 737 — was flawed, or whether pilots have been adequately told about changes to it and trained. There are also questions about whether the plane’s instruments were properly maintained."
212,"But as yet, there is no evidence that the same issues recurred in the Ethiopian flight."
213,[Read more on the questions Boeing faces after the latest crash.]
214,"There are some obvious similarities between the disasters in Ethiopia and Indonesia, but significant differences, as well."
215,"The crews on both flights issued distress calls minutes after take off, before their aircraft plunged to the ground."
216,"But the civil war next door to Ethiopia, in Somalia, raises the possibility that terrorism, not mechanical failure, was to blame. The Shabab, the militant Islamist group affiliated with Al Qaeda, has mounted attacks on both Ethiopia and Kenya, and the United States has stepped up its airstrikes on the group."
217,"A witness has said that smoke was streaming from the jet while it was still aloft, though that could indicate any number of things."
218,"There are also big differences between the airlines involved in the two crashes. Ethiopian Airlines has a generally good safety record, while Lion Air’s is poor."
219,"The Lion Air flight had an experienced pilot and co-pilot, each with more than 5,000 hours of flying time. The pilot of the Ethiopian flight was highly experienced, too — but the co-pilot was remarkably inexperienced, with just 200 hours."
220,It is not clear who was at the controls when the jet went down.
221,"On Monday, China and Indonesia ordered their airlines to ground their 737 Max 8’s, at least temporarily. A handful of other airlines, including Ethiopian, have also suspended its use."
222,"But as of Monday, of the four dozen carriers that have the model in their fleets, about half continued to fly it. Those include the three largest users — Southwest Airlines, Air Canada and American Airlines — and other Western companies like WestJet, a Canadian carrier; TUI Group, a European line; and Norwegian Air."
223,"Two of the largest carriers based in the United States, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, do not have the Boeing model."
224,More than 350 Max 8’s have been delivered around the world.
225,"Boeing introduced the 737 more than 50 years ago, and more than 10,000 have been built, making it the most widely used airliner in the world. But it has undergone so many changes over the years that earlier models have little in common with newer ones."
226,"The Max 8 entered commercial service in 2017, the first model of a fourth generation of the 737 that is more technologically advanced and fuel-efficient than predecessors. The model’s newness makes it difficult to make meaningful comparisons with more established planes that have flown millions of times."
227,"Models from the 737’s second generation, introduced in the 1980s, and the third generation, first produced in the 1990s, are among the world’s most popular and safest airliners."
228,"The people killed in the Ethiopia crash came from more than 30 countries. They included at least 22 United Nations employees, some of them headed to a U.N. Environment Assembly meeting in Nairobi."
229,"Other victims included aid workers, professors, diplomats, entrepreneurs and consultants."
230,"As of Monday, 32 were identified as Kenyan and 18 as Canadian. Ethiopia and France each lost nine citizens; the United States, China and Italy each lost eight, and Britain lost seven."
231,"WASHINGTON — He prefers Sharpies over email. His aides cart around cardboard boxes of work papers — not laptops — for him to sift through on Air Force One. On pressing technology matters, including drones at the border, clean energy and, most recently, the evolution of airplane engineering, he prefers a nonscientific approach."
232,"In short, President Trump often operates on the theory that older is better."
233,"“Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Tuesday, sharing his views on the still-unconfirmed cause of an Ethiopian Airlines plane crash last weekend that killed all 157 people on board. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT. I see it all the time in many products. Always seeking to go one unnecessary step further, when often old and simpler is far better.”"
234,"At a time when experts are citing a serious need to bolster the nation’s infrastructure and science initiatives to remain globally competitive, Mr. Trump has long used partisan language to encourage his supporters to follow him in embracing a 1950s Rockwellian approach to technology."
235,"In his continuing crusade to build a wall along the country’s southwestern border, for instance, Mr. Trump dismissed the idea of drones to secure the border. He wanted a wall, an ancient technology he has said never fails, much like its Mesopotamian cousin, the wheel."
236,"“The fact is there is nothing else’s that will work,” Mr. Trump said on Twitter in December, “and that has been true for thousands of years. It’s like the wheel, there is nothing better.”"
237,"Mr. Trump added, “I know tech better than anyone.”"
238,"But it is a tactic that current and former administration officials said overshadowed efforts that in any other universe would look a lot like bipartisanship: Mr. Trump, they say, has privately committed to expansions of several technological initiatives that were hatched in the Obama White House, including revamping the government’s technology system and digitizing health care records."
239,"Not that this is evident when Mr. Trump addresses the public. He tends to frame the willingness to embrace technology as a partisan issue, which his fans lap up. His mocking examination of wind power led to laughter from a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference this month."
240,"“When the wind stops blowing, that’s the end of your electric,” Mr. Trump said before mimicking a man trying to watch TV: “‘Darling, is the wind blowing today? I’d like to watch television, darling.’”"
241,"His theatrical approach tends to dazzle fans, but it has alarmed experts who worry that the president’s analog behavior has failed to signal to Americans which technological ideas they should be excited about — or which they should be worried about — as global competitors, including China, pour money into technology initiatives like the race to master artificial intelligence."
242,"“It doesn’t put the best face forward for the United States to have a president talking that way,” Darrell West, the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution, said in an interview. “It makes us look like we’re not a scientifically literate country.”"
243,"Cristin Dorgelo, who was chief of staff in the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy under President Barack Obama, said a commander in chief was supposed to be the nation’s most effective intermediary between the public and the science and technology communities."
244,"Mr. Obama, she pointed out, edited an issue of Wired magazine and was notorious for imbibing detailed memorandums on technology policy."
245,"“I think that we have a problem where there are people doing good work inside of the building to advance policy on technology issues,” Ms. Dorgelo said, “but a president who at the same time does not ground his remarks about science and technology in fact and in evidence.”"
246,"It’s not as if Mr. Trump dismisses all technology in his public life. He likes hobnobbing with technology executives at the White House, like Tim Cook of Apple (although he called him “Tim Apple”), and has masterfully re-engineered the presidential Twitter account to serve as his e-bully pulpit. Aides say he is also adept at using his DVR systems to record television shows. Mr. Trump, after all, believes TiVo is “one of the great inventions of all time.” "
247,"Mr. Trump has also used an executive order to establish a national strategy for artificial intelligence and another to develop a strategy to lead the world in fifth-generation, or 5G, cellular networks. (Mr. Trump remarked recently on Twitter that 6G would be even better.)"
248,"“The Trump administration has been laser-focused on an ambitious national tech policy agenda that drives innovation and American leadership in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G networks and quantum computing,” Michael Kratsios, the deputy assistant to the president for technology policy, said in a statement. “The president cares deeply about ensuring these technologies are developed by American innovators, built by American workers and reflect American values and priorities.”"
249,"Some experts are concerned that the commitment is little more than lip service. Mr. West, from Brookings, said the White House established an A.I. policy a year and a half after China announced that it planned to create an A.I. industry worth $150 billion to its economy by 2030."
250,"“It’s too little, too late,” Mr. West said. “If you’re not funding a major initiative, agencies are not going to take it seriously.”"
251,"But Aneesh Chopra, who was Mr. Obama’s chief technology officer, said in an interview that in other matters there was a “surprising alignment on a number of key areas” where the Trump White House has worked to expand a blueprint left by predecessors."
252,"“I may strongly disagree with the president’s views of health care reform,” Mr. Chopra said, “but I am pleased with the president’s commitment to build on progress on the long-term technical foundation of what we refer to as a health care internet.”"
253,"Mr. Chopra and several of the president’s aides credited Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, with pushing Mr. Trump to recognize the importance of some of those efforts."
254,"A key to getting Mr. Trump to respond to technological efforts, several of his advisers said, is to frame the pitch in cost-saving and customer-service terms. During a 2017 meeting to get him on board with revamping government technology systems, a project Mr. Kushner championed after helping establish the Office of American Innovation, aides said they told Mr. Trump the effort could save billions."
255,"After asking his aides what Americans would see if the systems to apply for farming loans or veterans health care benefits were redesigned, Mr. Trump eventually approved the effort. But Mr. Trump said at the time that he knew he would never get credit for it, according to two people familiar with his remarks."
256,"After all, this is the same president who said the Navy should get rid of an electromagnetic catapult system on a new aircraft carrier and replace it with an old one that used steam."
257,"“They have digital,” Mr. Trump told Time magazine in 2017. “What is digital? And it’s very complicated; you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out.” The Navy, Mr. Trump said, told him it had to stay with digital. “I said, ‘No you’re not,’” Mr. Trump recounted. He added that the Navy had to switch to “goddamned steam; the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money, and it’s no good.”"
258,"LONDON — Before the plane carrying him vanished over the English Channel, an Argentine soccer player sent a chilling audio message from the flight in which he said “I’m so afraid” and warned that the aircraft “seems like it’s falling to pieces,” Argentine news outlets reported on Tuesday."
259,"Both Emiliano Sala, 28, who had just signed with Cardiff City of the English Premier League, and the pilot, whom officials have not identified, were feared dead after the disappearance of the plane Monday night."
260,"Officials have said that if the missing plane went down in the cold, rough waters, there was little chance that the two people aboard were still alive."
261,"A joint French and British search effort resumed on Wednesday with airplanes, helicopters and ships, but John Fitzgerald, chief officer of Channel Islands Air Search, said that it should no longer be considered a rescue operation."
262,"“It’s getting to that stage now,” he said in a telephone interview. “There’s a lot of people still on the hunt,” he added, but hopes of finding survivors are “very much plucking at straws.”"
263,"While in the air, as the plane was battered by harsh weather, Mr. Sala, speaking in Spanish, sent an audio WhatsApp message to a group of friends, said Diego Rolán, a Uruguayan player, who told a radio station in his home country that he was among the recipients of the message. Argentine news organizations obtained and posted on their websites what they said was Mr. Sala’s recorded message."
264,"The man speaking sounds calm, asking his friends how they are doing, looking forward to joining his new team, complaining of being tired, and even yawning. But he also returns several times to his concern about the flight."
265,"“If, in an hour and a half, you have no news from me, I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me, because they are not going to find me,” he says."
266,"Cardiff City officials said Wednesday that Mr. Sala had made his own travel arrangements to reach Cardiff, without the club’s involvement."
267,"Mr. Sala became a star playing for Nantes in the top French league, and the team’s fans gathered in his honor in the city’s Place Royale on Tuesday night, chanting and waving banners. He was recently sold to Cardiff City, and he was scheduled to join that team on Tuesday."
268,"Mr. Sala was flying to Cardiff from Nantes aboard a single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu, on a night when the region was hit by rain, snow and high winds. The plane took off at 8:15 p.m. local time and disappeared from air traffic control radar over the Channel 68 minutes later."
269,"French aviation officials have said that only two people were aboard, but there have been unconfirmed reports in the news media of another passenger."
270,"In a statement, the harbormaster for the island of Guernsey, Capt. David Barker, listed four theories about what happened. Two seemed especially remote possibilities: that the men on the plane had touched down safely on land somewhere, or that they were rescued from the sea by a passing ship, but had not gotten word out that they had survived."
271,"The other possibilities were less optimistic: that “they landed on water and made it into the life raft we know was on board,” or that “the aircraft broke up on contact with the water, leaving them in the sea,” Captain Barker said."
272,"“Our search area is prioritized on the life raft option,” he said."
273,Before reading the article: 
274,"On March 10, a jetliner bound for Nairobi, Kenya, crashed shortly after leaving Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, killing all 157 people on board — the second deadly crash in under five months involving the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft."
275,"First, read this excerpt from a Times article about the victims of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302:"
276,"The flight route from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, to Nairobi, Kenya, is sometimes referred to as a “U.N. shuttle” because of how often United Nations staff members take it."
277,"On Sunday, when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 plummeted to the ground shortly after takeoff, killing more than 150 people, the plane had a particularly high concentration of United Nations employees: At least 22 staff members died in the crash, a United Nations official said on Monday."
278,"The airline said the flight had passengers from at least 30 countries, some of whom were aid workers for other humanitarian organizations."
279,"The dead included at least 32 Kenyans; 18 Canadians; nine each from Ethiopia and France; eight each from the United States, China and Italy; and seven from Britain, according to the airline, officials and news accounts."
280,"Then watch this two-minute video, “Aftermath of Deadly Ethiopian Airlines Plane Crash.”"
281,• What facts are known about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302?
282,• Why are investigators looking into the model of the aircraft as a possible cause of the crash?
283,"Now, read the article, “What We Know and Don’t Know About the Ethiopian Plane Crash,” and answer the following questions: "
284,1. What are some initial possible causes for the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302?
285,2. What challenges do investigators face determining the cause of a crash? How long can investigations take?
286,"3. Why is early speculation about the cause of a crash often wrong, according to the author?"
287,4. In what ways are Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and the Lion Air crash in October similar? How are they different?
288,5. When was the Boeing 737 created and when was the Max 8 model introduced? What is unique about the new model?
289,6. What is the safety record of the 737?
290,"Finally, tell us more about what you think:"
291,"As public safety concerns have mounted, aviation regulators from countries around the world, including the United States, have grounded the use of the Boeing 737 Max 8. Take a look at the map “From 8,600 Flights to Zero” and answer these three questions:"
292,• What do you notice?
293,• What do you wonder?
294,• What might be going on in this graph?
295,Then read the following excerpt from the article “Boeing Planes Are Grounded in U.S. After Days of Pressure.”
296,"President Trump announced on Wednesday that the United States was grounding Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, reversing an earlier decision by American regulators to keep the jets flying after a second deadly crash in Ethiopia."
297,"The order came hours after Canada’s transport minister said that newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between the crash in Ethiopia and another accident last October. In a statement released after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the F.A.A. also cited “newly refined satellite data” as supporting the decision to ground the jets."
298,"The Federal Aviation Administration had for days resisted calls to ground the plane even as safety regulators in some 42 countries had banned flights by the jets. As recently as Tuesday, the agency said it had seen “no systemic performance issues” that would prompt it to halt flights of the jet."
299,"“The safety of the American people, of all people, is our paramount concern,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the White House."
300,What new information led the U.S. and Canada to ground the Boeing 737 Max 8? Do you think the Trump administration and the F.A.A. made the right decision? Or should they have waited for more information from the crash investigation?

305,"NEW DELHI — Lessors to Jet Airways Ltd are planning to ask India's aviation regulator to de-register many more planes leased to the airline, three sources said, signaling a planned bailout of the debt-laden carrier is failing to assuage their concerns."
306,"About six lessors are expected to apply to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to de-register up to 15 planes that have already been grounded, over the next 10 days, one of the sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters."
307,"This is in addition to the five planes that MC Aviation Partners, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp, applied on Friday to de-register, the source said."
308,"Once de-registered, lessors can take the plane out of the country and lease them to other airlines."
309,"While some lessors have already taken their planes out after a mutual agreement with Jet, sources say the latest applications to do so are on a non-consensual basis."
310,"This deepens the crisis for Jet that has had to ground more than three-quarters of its fleet of 119 planes, many due to non-payment to lessors, leading to hundreds of flight cancellations. "
311,It was not immediately clear which of its lessors were planning to apply for de-registration in the coming days.

326,"In theory, lessors have the option to file a complaint with the DGCA, which in turn can cancel a plane's registration within five working days. But this is subject to some conditions such as clearing dues owed to airport operators, fuel vendors, tax authorities and other private entities."
327,"The government also needs to revise some local laws that conflict with the full implementation of the convention, making it a more complicated process in India than in some other countries."

329,"HONG KONG — Indonesia has found the cockpit voice recorder of a Lion Air plane that crashed off the country’s coast last year, Indonesian officials said Monday, raising hopes that recordings could help explain how the pilots battled an apparent mechanical failure."
330,"Lion Air Flight 610 plummeted into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, in late October, killing all 189 people on board."
331,"Haryo Satmiko, deputy chief of the country’s transportation safety committee, confirmed in a text message on Monday that Navy divers had found the cockpit voice recorder on the seafloor, along with human remains, and that it would likely take two to three months to analyze the data."
332,"Mr. Haryo added that part of the recorder had been damaged, albeit not the part that contains the main data. “We have to handle it very carefully,” he said."
333,"The plane was a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8, the latest model of Boeing’s workhorse 737 fleet. Its so-called black box, which records flight data, was recovered in early November."
334,"The pilots fought to save the plane almost from the moment it took off, as its nose was repeatedly forced down. They managed to pull the nose back up over and over until finally losing control, leaving the plane to plummet into the ocean at 450 miles per hour."
335,"Data from the plane’s flight data recorder appears to support a theory among investigators that a computerized system Boeing installed on its latest generation of 737 jets to prevent them from stalling instead forced the nose down. The aircraft was recording errant data from one of the two angle-of-attack sensors on its nose, which are designed to record the pitch at which a plane is climbing or descending."
336,"Yet the precise cause of the crash remains unknown, and a preliminary report on the accident released by Indonesian crash investigators in November was notably lacking in significant details. Among other questions, it is still not clear whether the errant data, which was on the pilot’s side of the plane, was attributable to a problem with the angle-of-attack sensor or with the computer that processes the sensor’s information."
337,"The plane’s cockpit voice recorder, known as a C.V.R., could provide further insight into specific steps that the pilots took as the jet’s course became violently erratic. The flight crew requested permission to return to the Jakarta airport but never turned around."
338,"“With the C.V.R., we could see what the pilots experienced, their thinking patterns, why they made the decisions they made, why they took certain steps,” said Gerry Soejatman, an Indonesian aviation expert."
339,"Ruth Simatupang, a former investigator for Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, said hearing what the pilots said to each other could help investigators determine the extent to which human error may have been a factor in the crash."
340,"The recorder may also help investigators determine which specific problems could be attributed to Boeing, Lion Air or the Indonesian authorities."
341,"Despite Boeing’s insistence that the proper procedures were in the plane’s handbook, pilots have said since the accident that the company had not been clear about one potentially vital difference between the system on the new 737s and those of older models. In the older ones, pilots could help address the problem of the nose being forced down improperly by pulling back on the control column in front of them — a measure that does not work in the 737 Max 8."
342,"Another question is how Lion Air, a budget airline that has a spotty safety record, handled repeated failures with the plane’s data readings for days before the crash."
343,"Mr. Soejatman said he hoped the cockpit voice recorder would include a recording of the plane’s penultimate flight, in which Lion Air pilots successfully flew to Jakarta from the Indonesian resort island of Bali despite problems with an angle-of-attack sensor."
344,"“Was it a wild guess?” he said of the pilots’ ability to overcome the problems. “Did they have certain knowledge, or just instincts?”"
345,"Employees and experts say that long before the deadly crash, the Indonesian carrier prioritized rapid growth and political clout over safety."
346,"LONDON — Parts of seat cushions believed to be from the small plane carrying the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot that disappeared over the English Channel have been found on a French beach, the British authorities said on Wednesday."
347,"The cushions were discovered by the French authorities on Monday near Surtainville, a coastal area in northwestern France, Britain’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch said in a statement."
348,"British investigators have identified a search area of approximately four square miles based on the plane’s path and last known radar position. A specialist vessel will search the seabed for the wreckage at the end of this week, weather permitting, the statement added."
349,"“We are aware that a privately operated search is also being conducted in the area, and we are liaising closely with those involved to maximize the chance of locating any wreckage and ensure a safe search operation,” the statement said."
350,"Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City after emerging as a prolific goal scorer for Nantes, in the French league. The plane carrying him and the pilot, David Ibbotson, disappeared en route to Cardiff on the night of Jan. 21; Mr. Sala was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day."
351,"An underwater search conducted by a high-tech submarine is scheduled to start at the end of the week, in what will be a privately led attempt to find the Piper Malibu plane, a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft."
352,"The initiative to start the private operation was made by Mr. Sala’s family, after the authorities decided end the search on Thursday."
353,"But people from all over the world have chipped in to help support of the family’s search for answers about what happened. Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Friday that by Wednesday evening had raised more than 369,000 euros, about $422,000, to aid the search."
354,"The page has attracted a significant amount of attention, including donations by soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year, and Ilkay Gündogan, a German player with Manchester City in the Premier League."
355,"Cardiff City paid tribute to Mr. Sala on Tuesday, at its first match since he disappeared, against Arsenal in London. Players and staff wore daffodils in his honor, and his name was included in the team roster in the match-day program. Both Cardiff and Arsenal, which won the match, laid floral tributes to Mr. Sala at Emirates Stadium."
356,"At several English Premier League matches this week, the teams observed a moment of silence in memory of Mr. Sala."
357,"“It is very difficult to even describe how the players are feeling,” Sol Bamba, a Cardiff defender, told BBC Sport Wales."
358,"“We have all been affected by it — the lads, the city, the whole club.”"
359,"News reports have questioned whether Mr. Ibbotson should have been piloting the plane. He held a private pilot’s license in the United States, and his medical certification was up to date, according to records on the Federal Aviation Administration’s website."
360,"But to fly the plane in Britain with a paying passenger, Mr. Ibbotson needed a commercial pilot’s license, and to fly at night, he needed a so-called instrument rating. Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority would not comment on Mr. Ibbotson’s credentials, but the authorities said the investigation into the plane’s disappearance would cover personnel records."
361,"The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart."
362,"“This would not have posed a problem for a pilot with a current instrument rating, but difficult for a pilot without one,” David Learmount, a former flight instructor, said in an email."
363,"Shortly before the plane vanished from radar, Mr. Ibbotson requested and received permission from air traffic control to descend to 2,500 feet, possibly to go under the worst of the weather, or to avoid icing, which can cause a plane to crash."
364,"Willie McKay, Mr. Sala’s agent has told the BBC that he was involved in selecting the plane or the pilot and that he did not own the plane that flew Mr. Sala. He said the flight was organized through a man named David Henderson, “who has flown us and many of our players all over Europe on countless occasions.”"
365,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, echoed with the wailing of the bereaved on Sunday morning. Mourners dressed in black had streamed into the vast churchyard, waving pictures of loved ones who died in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 a week earlier."
366,But the mourners did not have bodies to bury.
367,"Many families do not expect ever to recover remains. The victims died in a fiery explosion when the plane hurtled to the ground minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people — crew and passengers — aboard. In lieu of remains, witnesses have said, officials gave relatives scorched earth from the crash site."
368,"On Sunday, empty coffins made their way into the churchyard on black vans while women beat their chests and screamed in anguish."
369,"“They fell from the sky,” one woman lamented of the crash victims when the vans inched by, trailed by somber airline employees in green uniforms. “Where will I go with my questions?”"
370,"An investigation is underway to determine the cause of the crash of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet near Addis Ababa last weekend. Over the weekend, French investigators said they had downloaded audio from the cockpit voice recorder and transferred it to their Ethiopian counterparts. On Sunday, Ethiopia’s Transport ministry said information from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed similarities to a crash of the same type of Boeing plane used by an Indonesian airline."
371,The crash in Ethiopia raised a host of questions about the safety of the aircraft and the training given to pilots around the world. It also prompted multiple nations to ground the Max 8 amid growing concern about what appears to have been a struggle by the pilots of Flight 302 to control the plane minutes after takeoff.
372,The passengers on board that day had come from more than 35 countries and included at least 22 employees of United Nations-affiliated agencies. Kenya suffered the single largest toll: at least 32 dead. Families of the Ethiopian victims have visited the site of the crash to see the wreckage for themselves.
373,"In Addis Ababa, mourners have sat in tents all week to receive visitors, in keeping with Ethiopian tradition. At the memorial, priests chanted a prayer for the departed. The patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, Abune Mathias, called out the names of the nine Ethiopian passengers and seven airline employees — including the captain, Yared Getachew, 29 — whose lives were being honored."
374,"“This is so the families and friends can accept the end, so they can move on,” said Samson Seyoum, 49, a humanitarian worker who had lost a friend of two decades, Getnet Alemayehu, in the crash. Mr. Getnet, who worked for the charity Christian Relief Services, had been flying to Nairobi, Kenya, for a training course when he died."
375,"A separate memorial was held at a Muslim burial site for the co-pilot, Ahmed Nur Mohammod Nur."
376,"Later, while the empty coffins were lowered into the ground at the church, the captain’s father, a dentist, muttered words of encouragement to other pilots who had come to offer their condolences. He looked dazed. His private grief had become a public fixture."
377,"“I’m still processing it,” said the captain’s brother, Meno Getachew, 39, a corporate lawyer from Toronto who had flown in a day earlier. The loss has been especially hard for his father, he said, because the older man had relied heavily on his younger son, who had been “his right arm.”"
378,"He added, “This is crushing.”"
379,"As Boeing faces global scrutiny about the plane, some relatives of the victims — 18 of whom were Ethiopian — have hesitated to blame the manufacturer for the tragedy."
380,"Mr. Seyoum, who is a frequent flier on Ethiopian Airlines, noted Boeing’s long record of safety and its decades-long partnership with the carrier, which is a source of fierce pride for the nation."
381,"“I imagine this could have happened with any type of plane,” he said. “It could have happened to any airline. I will continue to use the airline.”"
382,"Not everyone shared his views. Yonathan Menkir Kassa, a pilot and aviation writer who attended the memorial, said Boeing had departed from its ethos of safety when it resisted global calls to ground the Max 8 planes immediately after the Ethiopian crash."
383,"“Boeing should have admitted its fault and sided with passengers,” Mr. Yonathan said. “Instead, it chose to be stubborn.”"
384,"By noon, the memorial had wrapped up and the mourners were streaming out onto the busy street. In the sea of black, men and women wearing T-shirts with the pictures of the crash victims emblazoned on the front and Bible verses across the back stood out."
385,"“My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle, and they are spent without hope,” one T-shirt read."
386,"The philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy has been a fixture on French television screens for decades. His commentary has been mocked, criticized, supported and lauded. Whether in writing, performing or speaking, he has no intention of slowing down."
387,"B.H.L., as the French call him, published a new book, “The Empire and the Five Kings: America’s Abdication and the Fate of the World,” in February and now appears in a one-man play “Looking for Europe.” The play, an update of a show Mr. Lévy originally performed in Sarajevo more than a decade ago, will be performed in 22 cities across Europe. "
388,"Both the book and play assess the United States’s retreat as a global leader and examine the crumbling trans-Atlantic alliance between the United States and Europe. The tour ends in May, when the European Parliament elections begin. "
389,"All of them, but there is one that is particularly important to me: Gdansk, Poland. I chose it because of the mayor, who was assassinated there. Pawel Adamowicz is the one who invited me. I chose Gdansk over Warsaw and Krakow because of him. I knew him well. His assassination is a heartbreaking tragedy and the performance there, for me, will be more than a performance. It will be a night of mourning and celebration of him."
390,"I do not live very differently when I travel and when I don’t, which means I do my duty. My duty is to read, to write and to fight. These are the three things that are my duty. Traveling and not traveling, this is what I do."
391,"I like trains because I like the idea of feeling the distance. Plane abolishes distance. It destroys the physical sense of covering the distance, or devouring the distance. The train like the car helps you to have the physical feeling in your body of the materiality of the space. That is the most honest and exhilarating way to travel."
392,I’m annoyed by Wi-Fi. One of the few advantages of planes was that at last you were cut from this universal communication. Now with Wi-Fi even the space of freedom from social networks is taken from you. This is a disaster.
393,I travel with a lot of books. Too many. I broke so often my back with my bags full of books. I always bring a lot more than I can read.
394,"I have a Kindle, but I am old school. I like the physical contact with the paper. I like the smell of the paper. I like to be able to devour the book, to take notes in the margin. The physical sense of crossing the book is the same as traveling a landscape."
395,"Never a rolling suitcase. I have a feeling that the day someone will see me with rolling luggage it must mean that a bad period is starting for me. Anyone who would see me in the next weeks, months, years, decades, with a rolling suitcase should know that things are not going well for me. It’s self indulging. I have two big black leather bags of French design. Louis Vuitton. I can put my books in there and a few shirts in them. I am always dressed the same way — you know my white shirts — so it’s easy for me. And I travel with the current manuscript."
396,I never check my luggage. I always have two or three bags on me. At least two. I have them with me because I’ve not the patience to wait for them because my books are too precious. I would hate to lose them.
397,"The places I discover. I am really a traveler. I love to move. The biggest excitement for me is to discover a new place, a new country, a new rhythm in the air. The most exciting travel is always the travel of tomorrow."
398,"I went to Brazil after the election of Bolsonaro, who is to me, a fascist. I was happy to be there with the brave citizens of Brazil who were democratically protesting and lamenting against the election of the stupid, brutal man. "

401,"As the pilots of the doomed Boeing jets in Ethiopia and Indonesia fought to control their planes, they lacked two notable safety features in their cockpits."
402,One reason: Boeing charged extra for them.
403,"For Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers, the practice of charging to upgrade a standard plane can be lucrative. Top airlines around the world must pay handsomely to have the jets they order fitted with customized add-ons."
404,"Sometimes these optional features involve aesthetics or comfort, like premium seating, fancy lighting or extra bathrooms. But other features involve communication, navigation or safety systems, and are more fundamental to the plane’s operations."
405,"Many airlines, especially low-cost carriers like Indonesia’s Lion Air, have opted not to buy them — and regulators don’t require them."
406,"Now, in the wake of the two deadly crashes involving the same jet model, Boeing will make one of those safety features standard as part of a fix to get the planes in the air again."
407,"It is not yet known what caused the crashes of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10 and Lion Air Flight 610 five months earlier, both after erratic takeoffs. But investigators are looking at whether a new software system added to avoid stalls in Boeing’s 737 Max series may have been partly to blame. Faulty data from sensors on the Lion Air plane may have caused the system, known as MCAS, to malfunction, authorities investigating that crash suspect."
408,"Federal prosecutors are investigating the development of the Boeing 737 Max jet, according to a person briefed on the matter. As part of the federal investigation, the F.B.I. is also supporting the Department of Transportation’s inspector general in its inquiry, said another person with knowledge of the matter."
409,The Justice Department said that it does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigations. Boeing declined to comment on the inquiry.
410,"The jet’s software system takes readings from one of two vanelike devices called angle of attack sensors that determine how much the plane’s nose is pointing up or down relative to oncoming air. When MCAS detects that the plane is pointing up at a dangerous angle, it can automatically push down the nose of the plane in an effort to prevent the plane from stalling."
411,"Boeing’s optional safety features, in part, could have helped the pilots detect any erroneous readings. One of the optional upgrades, the angle of attack indicator, displays the readings of the two sensors. The other, called a disagree light, is activated if those sensors are at odds with one another."
412,"Boeing will soon update the MCAS software, and will also make the disagree light standard on all new 737 Max planes, according to a person familiar with the changes, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they have not been made public. Boeing started moving on the software fix and the equipment change before the crash in Ethiopia."
413,The angle of attack indicator will remain an option that airlines can buy. Neither feature was mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration. All 737 Max jets have been grounded.
414,"“They’re critical, and cost almost nothing for the airlines to install,” said Bjorn Fehrm, an analyst at the aviation consultancy Leeham. “Boeing charges for them because it can. But they’re vital for safety.”"
415,"[After a Lion Air 737 Max crashed in October, questions about the plane arose.]"
416,"Earlier this week, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said the company was working to make the 737 Max safer."
417,"“As part of our standard practice following any accident, we examine our aircraft design and operation, and when appropriate, institute product updates to further improve safety,” he said in a statement."
418,Add-on features can be big moneymakers for plane manufacturers.
419,"In 2013, around the time Boeing was starting to market its 737 Max 8, an airline would expect to spend about $800,000 to $2 million on various options for such a narrow-body aircraft, according to a report by Jackson Square Aviation, an aircraft leasing firm in San Francisco. That would be about 5 percent of the plane’s final price."
420,[The F.A.A.’s approval of the Boeing jet has come under scrutiny.]
421,"Boeing charges extra, for example, for a backup fire extinguisher in the cargo hold. Past incidents have shown that a single extinguishing system may not be enough to put out flames that spread rapidly through the plane. Regulators in Japan require airlines there to install backup fire extinguishing systems, but the F.A.A. does not."
422,"“There are so many things that should not be optional, and many airlines want the cheapest airplane you can get,” said Mark H. Goodrich, an aviation lawyer and former engineering test pilot. “And Boeing is able to say, ‘Hey, it was available.’”"
423,"But what Boeing doesn’t say, he added, is that it has become “a great profit center” for the manufacturer."
424,"Both Boeing and its airline customers have taken pains to keep these options, and prices, out of the public eye. Airlines frequently redact details of the features they opt to pay for — or exclude — from their filings with financial regulators. Boeing declined to disclose the full menu of safety features it offers as options on the 737 Max, or how much they cost."
425,"But one unredacted filing from 2003 for a previous version of the 737 shows that Gol Airlines, a Brazilian carrier, paid $6,700 extra for oxygen masks for its crew, and $11,900 for an advanced weather radar system control panel. Gol did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
426,The three American airlines that bought the 737 Max each took a different approach to outfitting the cockpits.
427,"American Airlines, which ordered 100 of the planes and has 24 in its fleet, bought both the angle of attack indicator and the disagree light, the company said."
428,"Southwest Airlines, which ordered 280 of the planes and counts 36 in its fleet so far, had already purchased the disagree alert option, and it also installed an angle of attack indicator in a display mounted above the pilots’ heads. After the Lion Air crash, Southwest said it would modify its 737 Max fleet to place the angle of attack indicator on the pilots’ main computer screens."
429,"United Airlines, which ordered 137 of the planes and has received 14, did not select the indicators or the disagree light. A United spokesman said the airline does not include the features because its pilots use other data to fly the plane."
430,Boeing is making other changes to the MCAS software.
431,"When it was rolled out, MCAS took readings from only one sensor on any given flight, leaving the system vulnerable to a single point of failure. One theory in the Lion Air crash is that MCAS was receiving faulty data from one of the sensors, prompting an unrecoverable nose dive."
432,"In the software update that Boeing says is coming soon, MCAS will be modified to take readings from both sensors. If there is a meaningful disagreement between the readings, MCAS will be disabled."
433,"Incorporating the disagree light and the angle of attack indicators on all planes would be a welcome move, safety experts said, and would alert pilots — as well as maintenance staff who service a plane after a problematic flight — to issues with the sensors."
434,"The alert, especially, would bring attention to a sensor malfunction, and warn pilots they should prepare to shut down the MCAS if it activated erroneously, said Peter Lemme, an avionics and satellite-communications consultant and former Boeing flight controls engineer."
435,"“In the heat of the moment, it certainly would help,” he said."
436,Boeing’s software update for its troubled 737 Max jetliners has been delayed after the company deemed further work was needed on the fix before it was submitted to the Federal Aviation Administration.
437,"The Max, Boeing’s newest plane, was grounded by regulators around the world in March after the crashes of two Max aircraft within five months."
438,"As part of its process to return the Max to the air, Boeing has been working on a software update to new anti-stall system, known as MCAS, that was included in the Max."
439,"Boeing had hoped to submit the update to the F.A.A., which must approve the new software and training procedures before the Max can return to commercial flight, as early as this week."
440,"But in recent days, the timeline was extended by several weeks."
441,"The delay came about through the workings of Boeing’s so-called non-advocate review, a process in which Boeing employees who are not working on the software fix vet the work before it is submitted to the F.A.A., according to people with knowledge of the process who were not authorized to speak publicly."
442,It is not clear what specific changes the Boeing employees believe needed to be made.
443,"On Monday, the F.A.A. made a statement acknowledging the timing had been pushed back."
444,"“The F.A.A. expects to receive Boeing’s final package of its software enhancement over the coming weeks for F.A.A. approval,” the agency said. “Time is needed for additional work by Boeing as the result of an ongoing review of the 737 Max Flight Control System to ensure that Boeing has identified and appropriately addressed all pertinent issues.”"
445,"After the F.A.A. released its statement on Monday, Boeing also acknowledged the delay."
446,"“Boeing continues to work with the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration and other regulatory agencies worldwide on the development and certification of the MCAS software update and training program,” it said. “We are working to demonstrate that we have identified and appropriately addressed all certification requirements and will be submitting for F.A.A. review once completed in the coming weeks.”"
447,"The 737 Max will remain grounded for at least several more weeks, prolonging a crisis that has engulfed Boeing."
448,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
449,"The Max is Boeing’s best-selling jet, and the company is racing to produce the planes at its factory in Renton, Wash. But with the planes grounded, the company has halted deliveries of new jets. As a result, it is stockpiling finished planes, which will have to be updated with the new software before they are handed over to customers."
450,"At the same time, business and regulatory pressures are mounting. Some airlines are demanding that Boeing compensate them for lost revenues as they cancel flights and their planes sit idle. At least one airline is seeking to cancel its deal to buy more Max jets."
451,"Families of passengers aboard the flights that crashed, Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, have hired lawyers to pursue legal claims against Boeing. And in Washington, the Justice Department and the Transportation Department’s inspector general are looking into the company’s rushed efforts to produce and certify the Max."
452,"“Safety is our first priority, and we will take a thorough and methodical approach to the development and testing of the update to ensure we take the time to get it right,” Boeing said in its statement on Monday."
453,"Once regulators have Boeing’s software update, it could take weeks longer for approval. “The F.A.A. will not approve the software for installation,” the statement said, “until the agency is satisfied with the submission.”"
454,"After days of mounting pressure, the United States grounded Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft on Wednesday, reversing an earlier decision in which American regulators said the planes could keep flying after a deadly crash in Ethiopia."
455,"The decision, announced by President Trump, followed determinations by safety regulators in some 42 countries to ban flights by the jets, which are now grounded worldwide. Pilots, flight attendants, consumers and politicians from both major parties had been agitating for the planes to be grounded in the United States. Despite the clamor, the Federal Aviation Administration had been resolute, saying on Tuesday that it had seen “no systemic performance issues” that would prompt it to halt flights of the jet."
456,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
457,"That changed Wednesday when, in relatively quick succession, Canadian and American aviation authorities said they were grounding the planes after newly available satellite-tracking data suggested similarities between Sunday’s crash in Ethiopia and one involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia in October."
458,"“The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,” Mr. Trump told reporters in the White House in making the announcement."
459,"[As planes become more automated, some worry pilots are losing flying skills.]"
460,"The crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 took place just minutes after takeoff and killed all 157 people on board the jetliner, a 737 Max 8. The circumstances echoed an October accident in which a 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air, an Indonesian carrier, crashed and killed 189 people."
461,"Marc Garneau, Canada’s transport minister, said that data on the vertical path of the Ethiopian jet at takeoff and comparable data from the Lion Air crash showed similar “vertical fluctuations” and “oscillations.” Hours later, the F.A.A. also said its decision came after the investigation “developed new information from the wreckage concerning the aircraft’s configuration just after takeoff.”"
462,"“Taken together with newly refined data from satellite-based tracking of the aircraft’s flight path,” the F.A.A. said, the information indicated similarities between the Ethiopian and Indonesian crashes “that warrant further investigation of the possibility of a shared cause for the two incidents that needs to be better understood and addressed.”"
463,"“Since this accident occurred, we were resolute in our position that we would not take action until we had data to support taking action,” said Daniel K. Elwell, the F.A.A.’s acting administrator. “That data coalesced today, and we made the call.”"
464,"[In a big shift, China was among the first to ground the jet.]"
465,"Earlier, Ethiopian Airlines said that one of two pilots on Sunday’s flight reported “flight-control problems” to air traffic controllers minutes before the plane crashed and told controllers that he wanted to turn back to Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa. The pilot was cleared to do so, three minutes before contact was lost with the cockpit, a spokesman for the airline said on Wednesday."
466,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
467,"That disclosure suggests that a problem with the handling of the aircraft or the computerized flight-control system could have been a factor. There has been no suggestion so far of terrorism or other outside interference in the functioning of the aircraft, which was only a few months old."
468,[Here’s what travelers should know.]
469,Officials examining the Lion Air crash have raised the possibility that a new flight-control system could have contributed to that earlier accident.
470,"Mr. Elwell at the F.A.A. cautioned that the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash was incomplete. No determination as to its cause has been made, nor has any final determination been released for the Indonesian crash. The flight data and voice recorders, known as black boxes, in the Ethiopia disaster have been recovered and will be analyzed in France."
471,"“We still have a lot to learn before we can say that they were the same cause and effect,” he said."
472,"The accidents have put Boeing on the defensive. The low-cost airline Norwegian Air, which has one of the largest Max 8 fleets outside the United States, said it would seek compensation from the company because of the groundings."
473,"The 737 Max is Boeing’s best-selling jet ever and is expected to be a major driver of profit, with more than 4,500 of the planes on order. The company’s shares have fallen about 11 percent this week."
474,"“We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,” Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said after the grounding was announced. “We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.”"
475,"After the Indonesian crash, pilots’ unions complained that pilots had not been made aware of a change to the flight-control system on the Max that could automatically push the plane’s nose down in certain situations. That software change is believed to have played a role in the Lion Air crash and may have been a factor in the Ethiopia accident as well. Boeing is now planning to roll out a software update that has been in the works since the Indonesian crash."
476,[Pilot’s tense messages show the Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 hit trouble right away.]
477,"The introduction of a consequential new flight-control feature without any requirement for pilot training is now drawing more scrutiny. Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House transportation committee, said in an interview that he planned to conduct an investigation into the F.A.A.’s certification of the 737 Max, with a focus on why the regulator did not require more substantial training for 737 pilots learning to fly the new version."
478,"Mr. DeFazio said he expected to seek all relevant communications between Boeing and the F.A.A., among other documents, and was willing to use subpoena power if necessary. “This warrants vigorous investigation,” he said. “We’re going to get anything in writing there is to get.”"
479,"Airlines in the United States stood behind the planes up until the F.A.A.’s order, and even expressed confidence in the jets afterward. Southwest Airlines said in a statement that it had been in “constant contact” with the F.A.A. and Boeing since the Ethiopian Airlines crash and that it remained confident in the 737 Max aircraft after flying the planes for more than 88,000 hours over 41,000 flights without incident. American said, “We continue to have the utmost confidence in our fleet.” The groundings in the United States and elsewhere also affected Boeing’s Max 9 model, which United Airlines flies."
480,"“I don’t want to hazard a guess,” Mr. Elwell said when asked how long the Boeing planes might be prohibited from flying. “My hope is that the F.A.A., the carriers, the manufacturer, that all parties will work very hard to make this grounding as short as possible so that these airplanes can get back up in the sky.”"
481,"On Tuesday morning, Boeing’s chief executive, Mr. Muilenburg, had called Mr. Trump to personally express his confidence in the safety of the jets, according to two people briefed on the conversation."
482,"The brief call had already been in the works, but it happened to come shortly after Mr. Trump raised concerns that airplanes were becoming too complex to fly and therefore endangering passengers. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,” he wrote on Twitter."
483,"On Wednesday, Mr. Trump expressed admiration for Boeing even while announcing that its planes could not fly."
484,"“Boeing is an incredible company,” he said. “They are working very, very hard right now and hopefully they’ll very quickly come up with the answer, but until they do, the planes are grounded.”"
485,"After its first spaceflight in December, Virgin Galactic sent the same vessel past the edge of the atmosphere for a second time on Friday. This time, the rocket plane went higher and faster than before — and it had three crew members on board instead of two."
486,The flight marked another step forward in a new kind of space race — one that aims to allow private citizens (who can afford the ticket) an opportunity to exit our atmosphere.
487,"It was the company’s fifth supersonic-powered test flight, and it reached an altitude of nearly 56 miles before returning safely to the Mojave Desert runway in California where it took off. Beth Moses, an astronaut trainer and microgravity research expert, was in the cabin as the company’s first test passenger in space."
488,"The SpaceShipTwo craft, a suborbital, rocket-fueled space plane called the VSS Unity, lifted off shortly after 8 a.m. local time. It was carried aloft under a larger  carrier plane for nearly an hour and then released. Next, its rocket ignited to propel the vessel, and its three crew members, up to where the sky turned black."
489,"Unity reached Mach 3 — three times the speed of sound — before the rocket motor was switched off shortly before 9 a.m. Then the vessel coasted to its highest altitude of 55.87 miles above sea level. Two tail booms rotated into a “feathered” position to create drag, allowing the vessel to fall gently back into the atmosphere and, ultimately, glide toward the runway."
490,"George T. Whitesides, the chief executive of Virgin Galactic, said the research conducted on the flight focused not only on the vessel’s trajectory, but also on the passenger experience."
491,"It went smoothly, he said. “The pilots did a great job.”"
492,"The flight was a success for Richard Branson, the British billionaire who started Virgin Galactic in 2004. (Other billionaires funding private spaceflight projects include Elon Musk, who runs SpaceX, and Jeff Bezos, who is behind Blue Origin.)"
493,"“Having Beth fly in the cabin today, starting to ensure that our customer journey is as flawless as the spaceship itself, brings a huge sense of anticipation and excitement to all of us here who are looking forward to experiencing space for ourselves,” Mr. Branson said in a statement on Friday."
494,"Ms. Moses’ job was to evaluate how passengers might experience a trip in the cabin. She observed the light, the temperature and the feeling of moving around in zero gravity. In an interview after the flight, she said it felt comfortable, and the view was beautiful."
495,"“It was intense and magical and serene and almost unlike anything anyone can imagine,” she said. “The earth below was super clear and bright, with a beautiful blue Pacific Ocean and snow on the mountaintops.”"
496,"Ventures like these are more useful for testing the limits of tourism than for advancing scientific research, said Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He said the Virgin flights could be used to conduct microgravity tests or equipment checks."
497,"“But at this stage, from a scientist’s point of view, it’s equivalent to what we call a sounding rocket,” he said. “And we’ve been doing those since the 1940s.”"
498,Sounding rockets are vessels that were sent by NASA to the upper reaches of the atmosphere to collect data and test instruments starting in 1945 — an important precursor to more advanced space travel.
499,"NASA did participate in Friday’s flight via its Flight Opportunities program, which pays Virgin Galactic for space to conduct research inside the Unity during its trip."
500,"And the three people on board — two pilots, David Mackay and Michael Masucci, and Ms. Moses — got the vantage point of a lifetime."
501,"Never miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world."
502,"In an interview after the flight, Mr. Mackay commented on how quickly the sky turned black once the atmosphere faded, and Mr. Masucci said he was astonished by the sight of a very bright moon. They said the flight was amazing, but not frightening."
503,"“If you’re fully prepared, you don’t feel scared,” Mr. Mackay said."
504,"There is some room for debate as to whether Virgin Galactic has actually sent people into space. On both of its space trips — the vessel reached an altitude of 51.4 miles last time — the Unity flew higher than the Federal Aviation Administration’s definition of where space begins, but lower than another widely accepted boundary between Earth and space, called the Kármán Line, which is about 62 miles above sea level."
505,"In any case, Unity has flown high enough that the pilots saw a black sky above them and a blue-brown Earth below as they crested at the edge of the atmosphere. (Dr. McDowell is skeptical about the Kármán Line and thinks it is fair to say that Unity reached proper space on both of its recent trips.)"
506,"Unity was the first Virgin Galactic craft to reach space, but it was not the first private spacecraft to get there. Another ship, operated by Mojave Aerospace Ventures, which later licensed its technology to Mr. Branson, soared to an altitude of 69.7 miles about 15 years ago."
507,"At the time, people predicted that it was the dawn of a new age of commercial human spaceflight. But the enthusiasm faded as years passed. Some non-astronauts were flown to the International Space Station, but commercial flights did not come to fruition. Then came a tragic setback: the fatal crash of a previous SpaceShipTwo craft in 2014. One pilot was killed after he released the lock on the booms too early and the vessel fell apart, investigators found."
508,"Virgin Galactic is expected to keep doing test flights and making improvements in terms of safety, altitude and weight capacity. It is still unclear when private citizens — including the more than 600 who have already bought tickets — will be allowed to take a ride."
509,"“It’s definitely not a decade,” Mr. Whitesides said. “We are really getting pretty close.”"

597,"Flight 302 — a two-hour shuttle between two of the busiest capitals in East Africa — was carrying passengers from at least four continents. The dead included 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, nine Ethiopians, eight each from the United States, China and Italy, and seven from Britain, the airline said. The French Foreign Ministry said nine of its citizens were aboard."
598,The passengers also reportedly included delegates traveling to Nairobi for a weeklong United Nations Environment Assembly that was scheduled to start on Monday.

600,"While the cause of the crash was unclear, the disaster is certain to raise more doubts about the safety of the 737 Max 8, one of Boeing’s fastest-selling airplanes."
601,"The plane, delivered to Ethiopian Airlines in November, was new, just like the Lion Air airplane that plunged nose down into the Java Sea last October, minutes after taking off from Jakarta, the Indonesian capital."
602,"Flight 302 took off in good weather, but its vertical speed became unstable right after takeoff, fluctuating wildly, according to data published by FlightRadar24 on Twitter. In the first three minutes of flight, the vertical speed varied from zero feet per minute per hour to 1,472 to minus 1,920 — unusual during ascent."
603,"“During takeoff, one would expect sustained positive vertical speed indications,” Ian Petchenik, a spokesman for FlightRadar24, said in an email on Sunday."
604,Crashes involving new planes in good weather are rare.
605,"The Lion Air accident also involved a plane that crashed minutes after takeoff and after the crew requested permission to return to the airport. The Lion Air pilots struggled to keep the plane ascending, with the jet’s nose forced dangerously downward over two dozen times during the 11-minute flight."
606,"The National Transportation Safety Board in the United States said it would send a four-person team to assist Ethiopian authorities investigating Sunday’s crash. The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement, “We are in contact with the State Department and plan to join the N.T.S.B. in its assistance with Ethiopian civil aviation authorities to investigate the crash.”"
607,Boeing said in a statement on Twitter that a technical team was ready to provide assistance at the request of the safety board.
608,"In the Lion Air crash, officials are investigating whether changes to the Max 8’s automatic controls might have sent that flight into an unrecoverable nose dive."
609,An investigation by Indonesian authorities determined that the Lion Air plane’s abrupt nose‐dive may have been caused by updated Boeing software that is meant to prevent a stall but that can send the plane into a fatal descent if the altitude and angle information being fed into the computer system is incorrect.
610,"The change in the flight control system, which can override manual actions taken in the Max model, was not explained to pilots, according to some pilots’ unions."

667,Global alerts were sent to notify pilots flying the Max about how to counter the anti‐stall system.
668,"Families of some of the victims of the Lion Air crash are suing Boeing, arguing that the company failed to properly inform pilots of the updated software."
669,[Read about the questions faced by Boeing after the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8.] ]
670,"Lynette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London, said that the Max model has a more efficient engine than the previous 737 aircraft, but that “it’s not revolutionary new.”"
671,"Boeing has delivered more than 350 Max 8 models to airlines around the world, including in the United States, Canada and Europe. The planes entered service in 2017, generally replacing older 737’s."
672,"While both of the Max 8 planes that crashed experienced similar dips and climbs during their ascents, the airlines flying them have notably different reputations. Even before the October crash, Lion Air had a notorious safety record."
673,"Ethiopian Airlines, Africa’s biggest carrier, is widely considered its best and has expanded rapidly in recent years, opening new routes all over the continent."
674,"The airline has ordered 30 of the Max 8 planes and already had five in its fleet, with the first being delivered last year, according to FlightRadar24."
675,"Boeing had promoted the model by minimizing the costs of upgrading, saying the 737 Max 8 required little additional training for pilots who had flown a previous version of the plane. That is believed to have been a key in winning orders from airlines that had also been considering an updated model, the Airbus A320, from Boeing’s archrival."
676,"There has not been a crash involving Ethiopian Airlines since January 2010, when a Boeing 737 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea shortly after it took off from Beirut, Lebanon. None of the 90 people onboard that flight — 82 passengers and eight crew members — survived."
677,"Ethiopian Airlines said on Sunday that the captain of the flight, Yared Getachew, 29, had more than 8,000 flying hours and a “commendable performance.”"
678,"The plane, which underwent a “rigorous first check maintenance” on Feb. 4, had flown back to the Ethiopian capital from Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sunday morning, according to the airline."
679,"“Ethiopian Airlines is very, very highly regarded; it’s part of the Star Alliance,” Graham Braithwaite, a professor of safety and accident investigation at Cranfield University in Britain, said by phone on Sunday."
680,"Professor Braithwaite was referring to the airline alliance that includes carriers like Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and United."
681,"The lead investigation will start in the country where the crash happened, Ethiopia, he said, but other countries will also be involved — Kenya and the United States, independently of Boeing, because the aircraft was made in the United States."
682,"“They’ll want to work quite swiftly,” Professor Braithwaite said. “It’s in nobody’s interest that a failure goes unknown.”"
683,"The priority will be to make sure there is no link between the crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia, and other countries and airlines will no doubt be watching closely, given the plane’s global popularity."
684,"At Nairobi’s Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, distraught family members and friends gathered at an emergency center established by the authorities. Another emergency center was set up at a nearby hotel within the airport to provide counseling."
685,"“I came to the airport to receive my brother but I have been told there is a problem,” one family member, Agnes Muilu, told The Associated Press. “I just pray that he is safe, or he was not on it.”"
686,Flight 302 was popular with aid workers based in Ethiopia who needed to exit and re-enter the country regularly so as not to violate work permits.
687,"The executive director of the World Food Program, a United Nations organization, said on Twitter that staff members from the group were among the dead. Aid workers from the United Nations, Catholic Relief Services and other organizations were also aboard the plane."
688,"Ethiopia, with about 100 million people, is the second‐most populous nation in Africa. Since elections in March, the new prime minister has been embarking on a series of political reforms, chiefly to officially end two decades of hostilities with Eritrea, a neighboring country and longtime rival."
689,"The country’s flagship carrier has undergone a major expansion, more than doubling its staff to 11,000 employees in the past decade, with the goal of easing air travel in a part of the world where flying is notoriously complicated."
690,"It added nonstop flights, for instance, from Newark to Lomé, Togo, a hub for the airline, that then continue on to Addis Ababa."
691,"In Africa, Ethiopian has a reputation for having a newer fleet than other airlines, for operating flights that are mostly on time and for having accommodating schedules."
692,Professor Braithwaite described Ethiopian Airways as “one of the best operators in Africa.”
693,LONDON — The authorities announced on Thursday that they had ended the search for the Argentine soccer player Emiliano Sala and his pilot after their aircraft vanished over the English Channel on Monday.
694,"“We reviewed all the information available to us, as well as knowing what emergency equipment was on board, and have taken the difficult decision to end the search,” David Barker, the harbormaster captain of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement posted by the police on Twitter."
695,"The search, which involved three planes, five helicopters, two lifeboats and the assistance of passing ships and fishing boats, covered an approximately 1,700-square-mile area, according to Mr. Barker."
696,"The police examined mobile phone data and satellite imagery, but no trace of the aircraft, Mr. Sala or the pilot, David Ibbotson, could be found."
697,"“The chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote,” Mr. Barker said in his statement."
698,"After the authorities’ announcement, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala’s sister, held a news conference in Cardiff and asked the authorities not to call off the search."
699,"“Please, please, please don’t stop the search,” Ms. Sala said in Spanish, fighting back tears."
700,She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.
701,"On Monday night, when his plane disappeared, Mr. Sala sent an  audio message to his family from the plane, in which he said, “I’m so afraid” and warned that the aircraft “seems like it’s falling to pieces.”"
702,"“If, in an hour and a half, you have no news from me,” he said, “I don’t know if they are going to send someone to look for me, because they are not going to find me.”"
703,"Mr. Ibbotson, whose identity was confirmed by the Humberside Police on Wednesday, used the Facebook check-in tool at the Nantes airport on Saturday afternoon. According to reports in the British news media, he had joked in Facebook comments that he was a “bit rusty with the ils,” referring to the Instrument Landing System."
704,"The Piper Malibu plane — a single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft — departed Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Monday, and was headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales."
705,"Mr. Sala, a 28-year-old forward from Argentina, had left his homeland for Europe at the age of 16. He became a star playing for Nantes in the top French league, and was recently sold to Cardiff City. He was scheduled to join that team on Tuesday."
706,"By 8:23 p.m. Monday in Britain, his plane had disappeared from air traffic control radar about 15 miles north of Guernsey."
707,"Mehmet Dalman, the chairman of Cardiff City, said on Wednesday that there were no plans to reschedule the team’s coming Premier League match, which is set to take place on Tuesday, according to the BBC."
708,"“I would be very surprised if there’s any change to the schedule,” Mr. Dalman said."
709,"The owner of Cardiff City, Tan Sri Vincent Tan, thanked those involved in the search operation in a statement on Thursday."
710,"“Monday evening’s news shook everyone at Cardiff City F.C. to the core,” he said. “We were looking forward to providing Emiliano with the next step in his life and career.”"
711,He added that the team continued to pray for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson.
712,"The search for the aircraft, Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson might have been called off, but the disappearance remained an open case, according to Mr. Barker, the harbormaster captain."
713,"“We will be broadcasting to all vessels and aircraft in the area to keep a look out for any trace of the aircraft,” he said in the statement. “This will continue indefinitely.”"
714,"In the brutally competitive jetliner business, the announcement in late 2010 that Airbus would introduce a more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling A320 amounted to a frontal assault on its archrival Boeing’s workhorse 737."
715,"Boeing scrambled to counterpunch. Within months, it came up with a plan for an upgrade of its own, the 737 Max, featuring engines that would yield similar fuel savings. And in the years that followed, Boeing pushed not just to design and build the new plane, but to persuade its airline customers and, crucially, the Federal Aviation Administration, that the new model would fly safely and handle enough like the existing model that 737 pilots would not have to undergo costly retraining."
716,"Boeing’s strategy set off a cascading series of engineering, business and regulatory decisions that years later would leave the company facing difficult questions about the crash in October of a Lion Air 737 Max off Indonesia."
717,"[Latest update: Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max Crashes Near Addis Ababa, Killing All Onboard]"
718,"The causes of the crash, which killed 189 people, are still under investigation. Indonesian authorities are studying the cockpit voice recorder for insights into how the pilots handled the emergency, and are examining Lion Air’s long history of maintenance problems."
719,"But the tragedy has become a focus of intense interest and debate in aviation circles because of another factor: the determination by Boeing and the F.A.A. that pilots did not need to be informed about a change introduced to the 737’s flight control system for the Max, some software coding intended to automatically offset the risk that the size and location of the new engines could lead the aircraft to stall under certain conditions."
720,"That judgment by Boeing and its regulator was at least in part a result of the company’s drive to minimize the costs of pilot retraining. And it appears to have left the Lion Air crew without a full understanding of how to address a malfunction that seems to have contributed to the crash: faulty data erroneously indicating that the plane was flying at a dangerous angle, leading the flight control system to repeatedly push the plane’s nose down."
721,"Understanding how the pilots could have been left largely uninformed leads back to choices made by Boeing as it developed the 737 Max more than seven years ago, according to statements from Boeing and interviews with engineers, former Boeing employees, pilots, regulators and congressional aides."
722,"Those decisions ultimately prompted the company, regulators and airlines to conclude that training or briefing pilots on the change to the flight control system was unnecessary for carrying out well-established emergency procedures."
723,"The story of the change to that system, and how it came to play a central role in the Lion Air crash, shows how safety on modern jetliners is shaped by a complex combination of factors, including fierce industry competition, technological advances and pilot training. It illustrates how, in the rare instances when things go awry, the interplay of those factors can create unintended and potentially fatal consequences."
724,"The crash has raised questions about whether Boeing played down or overlooked, largely for cost and competitive reasons, the potential dangers of keeping pilots uninformed about changes to a critical element of the plane’s software."
725,"And it has put a new focus on whether the F.A.A. has been aggressive enough in monitoring Boeing in an era when technology has made airliners both remarkably reliable and increasingly complicated. European regulators initially disagreed with the F.A.A.’s judgment about the need for additional training but ultimately went along, a pilot familiar with the certification process said, while regulators in Brazil broke with the F.A.A. and required that pilots be made familiar with the change."
726,"Boeing has taken the position that the pilots of the Lion Air flight should have known how to handle the emergency despite not knowing about the modification. The company has maintained that properly following established emergency procedures — essentially, a checklist — long familiar to pilots from its earlier 737s should have allowed the crew to handle a malfunction of the so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as M.C.A.S., whether they knew it was on the plane or not."
727,"Boeing said that various systems on both the Max and its previous generation 737 can push the nose down. “Regardless of cause,” the company said, the flight crew should go through the checklist, “which is contained in existing procedures.”"
728,"The company said that in developing training materials for the 737 Max, it followed long-established practices. “The process ensures flight crews have all the information to safely operate the airplane,” Boeing said, “and for maintenance and fleet chiefs to understand how to ensure the airplanes are serviceable.”"
729,"But in the aftermath of the crash, Boeing plans to release a software upgrade for the 737 Max, according to a person briefed on the matter, though it is not clear how the upgrade will affect M.C.A.S. Boeing said that it “continues to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.”"
730,The F.A.A. declined to comment about the crash but acknowledged that its own role was being examined.
731,"“The F.A.A.’s review of the 737 Max’s certification is a part of an ongoing investigation with the N.T.S.B. and Indonesian civil aviation authorities,” the agency said in a statement, referring to the National Transportation Safety Board. “We cannot provide details of that review until the investigation is complete.”"
732,Boeing’s position has left many pilots angry and concerned.
733,"“Any time a new system is introduced into an airplane, we are the people responsible for that airplane,” said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association."
734,"Referring to the addition of M.C.A.S., Mr. Weaks added, “We felt and we feel that we needed to know about that, and there’s just no other way to say it.”"
735,"John Barton, a 737 captain who spoke on the condition that the airline he flies for not be identified, said the blame started with Boeing and the F.A.A. but extended to airlines and pilot unions."
736,"“Many pilots feel the training was inadequate, and therefore it appears to me that Boeing, the F.A.A., the airline training centers and possibly the unions themselves are culpable for the incident that happened,” he said."
737,"In designing the 737 Max, Boeing was selling airlines on the aircraft’s fuel savings, operating cost reductions and other improvements. But at the same time, it was trying to avoid wholesale aerodynamic and handling changes that would spur the F.A.A. to determine that existing 737 pilots would need substantial new and time-consuming training."
738,"Internally, a primary requirement for the Max was that no design change could cause the F.A.A. to conclude that airline pilots must be trained on the system differences between the then-current version of the plane, the 737 NG, and the Max using simulators, said Rick Ludtke, a flight crew operations engineering analyst who was involved in devising some of the other new safety features on the 737 Max."
739,"By limiting the differences between the models, Boeing would save airlines time and money by not putting their 737 pilots in simulators for hours to train on the new aircraft, making a switch to the Max more appealing."
740,"“Part of what we wanted to accomplish was seamless training and introduction for our customers, so we purposely designed the airplane to behave in the same way,” Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said on CNBC in December in response to a question about whether the company wanted to hold down training costs. “So even though it’s a different airplane design, the control laws that fly the airplane are designed to make the airplane behave the same way in the hands of the pilot.”"
741,"But Boeing’s engineers had a problem. Because the new engines for the Max were larger than those on the older version, they needed to be mounted higher and farther forward on the wings to provide adequate ground clearance."
742,"Early analysis revealed that the bigger engines, mounted differently than on the previous version of the 737, would have a destabilizing effect on the airplane, especially at lower speeds during high-banked, tight-turn maneuvers, Mr. Ludtke said."
743,"The concern was that an increased risk of the nose being pushed up at low airspeeds could cause the plane to get closer to the angle at which it stalls, or loses lift, Mr. Ludtke said."
744,"After weighing many possibilities, Mr. Ludtke said, Boeing decided to add a new program — what engineers described as essentially some lines of code — to the aircraft’s existing flight control system to counter the destabilizing pitching forces from the new engines."
745,That program was M.C.A.S.
746,"M.C.A.S., according to an engineer familiar with the matter, was written into the so-called control law, the umbrella operating system that, among other things, keeps the plane in “trim,” or ensures that the nose is at the proper angle for the plane’s speed and trajectory. In effect, the system would automatically push the nose down if it sensed that the plane’s angle was creating the risk of a stall."
747,"Both M.C.A.S. and the so-called speed trim system — the automatic stabilizer controls used on the 737 NG and earlier versions — operate primarily via the horizontal section of the 737’s tail fin, which consists of a relatively narrow “elevator” in the back and a larger surface called a stabilizer in the front. In manual flight, pilots move the nose up and down by pulling or pushing on a control column, also called a yoke, to pivot the elevator one way or the other."
748,"Ordinarily, the stabilizers accomplish a more subtle task, making sure that the up or down forces on the tail keep the plane balanced around its center of gravity. Either pilot can control the stabilizers electrically using switches at the top of the yoke."
749,M.C.A.S. was written to use the stabilizers in a different way.
750,The modified system’s first task was to automatically offset the stall risk created by the change in the size and location of the engines.
751,"“M.C.A.S. was necessary then for the airplane to be certified by the F.A.A. to have met all of the regulatory design requirements for stability and control,” Mr. Ludtke said."
752,"In addition to addressing safety, M.C.A.S. also let the plane handle much like its predecessors from a pilot’s perspective. In assessing whether existing 737 pilots would need to spend hours training on simulators to fly the Max, the F.A.A. would take into account how similarly the two versions handled."
753,"Boeing said that the modification “improves aircraft handling characteristics” and decreases “pitch-up tendency” only in unusual circumstances. “It does not control the airplane in normal flight,” the company said."
754,"The F.A.A. would also determine what kind of training would be required for pilots on specific design changes to the Max compared with the previous version. Some changes would require training short of simulator time, such as computer-based instruction."
755,"“I would think this is one of those systems that the pilots should know it’s onboard and when it’s activated,” said Chuck Horning, the department chairman for aviation maintenance science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University."
756,That was not the choice that Boeing — or regulators — would make.
757,"Ultimately, the F.A.A. determined that there were not enough differences between the 737 Max and the prior iteration to require pilots to go through simulator training."
758,"While the agency did require pilots to be given less onerous training or information on a variety of other changes between the two versions of the plane, M.C.A.S. was not among those items either."
759,"The bottom line was that there was no regulatory requirement for Boeing or its airline customers to flag the changes in the flight control system for its pilots — and Boeing contended that there was no need, since, in the company’s view, the established emergency procedures would cover any problem regardless of whether it stemmed from the original system or the modification."
760,"At least as far as pilots knew, M.C.A.S. did not exist, even though it would play a key role in controlling the plane under certain circumstances."
761,"Boeing did not hide the modified system. It was documented in maintenance manuals for the plane, and airlines were informed about it during detailed briefings on differences between the Max and earlier versions of the 737."
762,But the F.A.A.’s determination that the system did not have to be flagged for pilots gave pause to some other regulators.
763,"Across the Atlantic, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Union’s equivalent of the F.A.A., had qualms, according to a pilot familiar with the European regulator’s certification process."
764,"At first, the agency was inclined to rule that M.C.A.S. needed to be included in the flight operations manual for the Max, which in turn would have required that pilots be made aware of the new system through a classroom or computer course, the pilot said. But ultimately, he said, the agency did not consider the issue important enough to hold its ground, and eventually it went along with Boeing and the F.A.A."
765,"When Brazilian regulators published their required training for pilots, they singled out M.C.A.S. as one of the changes that needed to be flagged."
766,The F.A.A. said that “other countries base their standards on conditions specific and unique to each nation.”
767,Among the many unanswered questions raised by the crash is the degree to which Boeing and the F.A.A. considered what would happen in the event that M.C.A.S. — or the sensors that fed the system information about the plane — were to malfunction.
768,"In the Lion Air crash, one of the primary theories is that the system was receiving faulty data about the angle of the plane from what is known as an angle of attack sensor, vanelike devices on either side of the fuselage that measure how much the plane’s nose is pointing up or down. Preliminary findings from the investigation suggested that the sensor on the pilot’s side of the plane was generating erroneous data."
769,"In designing the 737 Max, Boeing decided to feed M.C.A.S. with data from only one of the two angle of attack sensors at a time, depending on which of two, redundant flight control computers — one on the captain’s side, one on the first officer’s side — happened to be active on that flight."
770,"That decision kept the system simpler, but also left it vulnerable to a single malfunctioning sensor, or data improperly transferred from it — as appeared to occur on the day of the crash."
771,"There is no evidence that Boeing did flight-testing of M.C.A.S. with erroneous sensor data, and it is not clear whether the F.A.A. did so. European regulators flight-tested the new version of the plane with normal sensor data feeding into M.C.A.S. but not with bad data, the pilot familiar with the European certification process said."
772,"The stabilizers on older models could have moved in unpredictable and dangerous ways as well, because of factors like electrical shorts, bad sensor data or computer problems. Boeing reasoned, according to people the company has briefed, as well as a bulletin it sent airlines after the crash, that the emergency procedure for malfunctioning speed trim and other stabilizer problems on the earlier 737s would work on the Max for problems related to M.C.A.S., too."
773,"The centerpiece of that procedure is to switch off two “stabilizer trim cutout” switches on the central console of the cockpit, and then flip open the handles on wheels near the knees of the captain and first officer. By cranking those wheels, the pilots can adjust the stabilizers manually in an effort to keep the plane from pitching up or down."
774,At the heart of the debate is whether the pilots would have responded differently if they knew the plane’s nose was being forced down specifically by M.C.A.S.
775,"Information from the flight data recorder shows that the plane’s nose was pitched down more than two dozen times during the brief flight, resisting efforts by the pilots to keep it flying level. If M.C.A.S. was receiving faulty data indicating that the plane was pitched upward at an angle that risked a stall — and the preliminary results of the investigation suggest that it was — the system would have automatically pushed the nose down to avert the stall."
776,The standard checklist for dealing with that sort of emergency on the previous version of the 737 focuses on flipping the stabilizer trim cutout switches and using the manual wheels to adjust the stabilizers.
777,"Boeing has asserted the pilots on the next-to-last flight of the same Lion Air aircraft that crashed encountered a similar, if less severe, nose-down problem. They addressed it by flipping off the stabilizer cutout switches, in keeping with the emergency checklist. Still, Indonesian investigators found, the pilots broke from the checklist by flipping the switches back on again before turning them off for the rest of the flight. That flight, with different pilots from the flight that crashed, landed safely."
778,"Older 737s had another way of addressing certain problems with the stabilizers: Pulling back on the yoke, or control column, one of which sits immediately in front of both the captain and the first officer, would cut off electronic control of the stabilizers, allowing the pilots to control them manually."
779,"That feature was disabled on the Max when M.C.A.S. was activated — another change that pilots were unlikely to have been aware of. After the crash, Boeing told airlines that when M.C.A.S. is activated, as it appeared to have been on the Lion Air flight, pulling back on the control column will not stop so-called stabilizer runaway."
780,"The preliminary results of the investigation, based on information from the flight data recorder, suggested that the pilots of the doomed flight tried a number of ways to pull the nose back up as it lurched down more than two dozen times. That included activating switches on the control yoke that control the angle of the stabilizers on the plane’s tail — and when that failed to stop the problem, pulling back on the yoke."
781,"There is no indication that they tried to flip the stabilizer cutout switches, as the emergency checklist suggests they should have. Findings from the cockpit voice recorder could establish in more detail what culpability, if any, rests with the Lion Air pilots."
782,"Boeing’s position that following the established emergency checklist should have been sufficient understates the complexity of responding to a crisis in real time, pilots said."
783,"Referring to Boeing’s focus on the need for pilots to flip the stabilizer cutout switches, Dennis Tajer, the spokesman for the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 pilot, said, “They are absolutely correct: Turning those two switches off will stop that aggressive action against you.”"
784,"Still, Mr. Tajer added, a pilot needs to know what systems are aboard so that they become “a part of your fiber as you fly the aircraft.”"
785,"The pilot of the plane’s next-to-last flight, in his entry into an electronic log, noted a variety of problems he had encountered, and speculated that the plane’s speed trim system — the stabilizer functions used on the 737 NG and earlier versions — was not operating correctly. But no one involved in that next-to-last flight of the doomed plane flagged M.C.A.S. or seems to have recognized that it might have been the root of that flight’s problems."
786,"“It really tells you what professional pilots, having flown this very aircraft for the past 10 years, are feeling,” said Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical engineer and former fighter pilot for the Swedish air force, referring to the previous generation 737. “They have no idea Boeing has introduced something new.”"
787,"Like any major international flight, the plane was packed with passengers from across the world. This one had professors from Kenya, aid workers from Ethiopia, a career ambassador from Nigeria and a fisheries consultant from Britain."
788,"Some were heading to job training, others to an environmental conference. Some were simply going home."
789,"All were passengers on Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which crashed on Sunday shortly after takeoff, killing the 157 on board and raising questions about the safety of the aircraft model, the Boeing 737 Max 8."
790,"On Monday, as the identities of more victims were reported, heartache rippled through convention halls, classrooms and living rooms across the globe. Tributes flowed on social media. Colleagues observed moments of silence."
791,"The campus of Kenyatta University in Kenya mourned the death of Isaac Mwangi, a lecturer in the department of education, communication and technology, and Agnes Gathumbi, a director of teacher professional development."
792,Dr. Mwangi wrote dissertations on using technology in secondary education and worked on projects related to integrating images and graphics into the teaching of poetry.
793,"He was “diligent and proactive,” Olive Mugenda, a former vice chancellor at the university who worked with Dr. Mwangi, wrote on Twitter."
794,"Dr. Gathumbi published dozens of papers, including one on how administrators react differently to graffiti scrawled by girls instead of boys. She had received certifications in French, African storybook writing, computer studies and other areas from institutions across the world."
795,"Hussein Swaleh, the 52-year-old former head of the governing body for Kenyan soccer, was also among those who died on the flight, according to Barry Otieno, the federation’s head of communications."
796,"“It’s a sad day for football in Kenya, very sad day,” said Mr. Otieno. “We were looking to roll out a youth development football tournament for the future of youth and football in the country, we had a lot planned.”"
797,"Thirty-two Kenyans died on the flight, more than from any other country."
798,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
799,"James Macharia, the transport secretary, said the government was working to get the family members to Ethiopia so they could identify the bodies."

807,"A day after the crash, a somber mood engulfed the United Nations headquarters in Nairobi, as politicians, environmentalists and government officials gathered for a major United Nations meeting on the environment — the United Nations Environment Assembly — a destination for many people on the flight. The meeting focused sustainable development and environmental challenges related to poverty, natural resources and waste management."

836,"The plane was found using an underwater drone that recorded video of the wreckage, including the body of one of the victims, the British government said on Monday. The video showed the aircraft registration number on the fuselage, confirming that it was the missing plane."
837,"“The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by police,” David Mearns, the shipwreck hunter whose team had been searching for the Piper Malibu plane, said on Twitter."
838,The families of Emiliano Sala and David Ibbotson have been notified by Police. The AAIB will be making a statement tomorrow. Tonight our sole thoughts are with the families and friends of Emiliano and David. #EmilianoSalas #NoDejenDeBuscarAEmilianoSala
839,"The single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft  disappeared over the English Channel after departing Nantes, a city in western France, at 8:15 p.m. local time on Jan. 21, headed for Cardiff, the capital of Wales."
840,"Mr. Mearns, a maritime scientist, told the British broadcaster Sky News on Sunday evening that the vessel “was located earlier this morning by my crew onboard the Morven,” referring to the search ship FPV Morven. Mr. Mearns’s company, Blue Water Recoveries, had been collaborating with the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or A.A.I.B., scanning the sea floor using sonar."
841,"A ship commissioned by the air accidents agency, the Geo Ocean III, launched a remotely operated vehicle, or R.O.V., to view the discovery at close range, the agency said in a statement on Monday."
842,"“Based on analysis of R.O.V. video footage, the A.A.I.B. investigators on board the vessel concluded that the object is wreckage from the missing Piper Malibu aircraft, registration N264DB,” it said. The underwater drone “carried out a further search of the area overnight, but did not identify any additional pieces of wreckage.”"
843,"“Tragically, in video footage from the R.O.V., one occupant is visible amidst the wreckage,” the agency added, but it did not specify whether the body was Mr. Sala’s or Mr. Ibbotson’s. “The A.A.I.B. is now considering the next steps, in consultation with the families of the pilot and passenger, and the police.”"
844,"Mr. Sala’s family had commissioned a private search after the authorities ended their search of the Channel’s surface and small islands on Jan. 24. David Barker, the harbormaster of the island of Guernsey, a self-governing British dependency off the coast of France, said in a statement at the time, “The chances of survival at this stage are extremely remote.”"
845,"Mr. Sala, 28, a prolific goal scorer for Nantes in the French league, had recently been transferred to the Premier League club Cardiff City and was scheduled to practice with the Welsh team for the first time the next day."
846,"The flight went through rough, wintry weather over the Channel, and Mr. Sala left a voice message for friends and relatives saying that he was afraid that the plane would break apart."
847,"After the authorities ended their search, Romina Sala, Mr. Sala’s sister, pleaded with the authorities not to call it off."
848,"“Please, please, please don’t stop the search,” Ms. Sala said at a news conference in Cardiff, fighting back tears."
849,She said she knew in her heart that Mr. Sala was still alive somewhere in the Channel.
850,A Facebook message to Mr. Sala’s sister seeking comment was not immediately answered on Sunday night.
851,"People from all over the world — including soccer stars like Kylian Mbappé, a member of the French national team that won the World Cup last year — chipped in to help the family’s search."
852,"Sport Cover, a Paris-based soccer agency, started a GoFundMe page on Jan. 25 that by Sunday evening had raised more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000."

855,"KATHMANDU, Nepal — The captain of a Bangladeshi airplane that crashed in Nepal last year, killing 51 people on board, appeared to have experienced an “emotional breakdown” during the flight, a report has found."
856,"The findings, released on Sunday by a committee formed by the Nepalese government, concluded that the pilot’s “irritable, tensed, moody and aggressive” behavior during the flight might have contributed to a “loss of situational awareness” when trying to land."
857,"The plane, US-Bangla Airlines Flight 211, was landing at Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, on a flight from Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, when it crashed on March 12."
858,"Video showed a plane teetering over the runway. When it finally touched the ground, the plane skidded, hit a fence and erupted in a fireball, killing 49 of the 71 people on board. Two others later died from their injuries."
859,Among the dead were 12 Nepalis training to be doctors at a university in Bangladesh. They were returning home for vacation after finishing their final examinations.
860,Their families had stretched themselves as far as they could go to support their children’s attending medical school. Nepal suffers from a dire shortage of trained doctors.
861,"Urmila Pradhan, whose daughter, Shweta Thapa, was one of the students who died, was furious at the report’s findings."
862,"“She was my only ray of hope,” Ms. Pradhan said, sobbing through a telephone interview. “I was thinking good days were coming, but that pilot proved me wrong. I’m now totally helpless.”"
863,"In its report, the Nepalese commission found that the airplane’s Bangladeshi pilot, Abid Sultan, 52, who was also in charge of the flight, had been showing signs of problems even before the plane took off from Dhaka."
864,"The report said Captain Sultan had slept little the night before the flight and had been unaware of new rules in Bangladesh that required international flights to have air clearance before departing from Dhaka, leading to confusion when he prepared for takeoff."
865,"He was also considering whether to resign from US-Bangla Airlines over comments from a colleague who had questioned his competency. In the air, Captain Sultan seemed “very insecure,” the report said. He acted aggressively with other crew members, smoked in the cockpit and complained repeatedly about the colleague’s criticism. (She was not on board.)"
866,"Once in Nepalese airspace, Captain Sultan failed to follow standard procedures at a critical stage of the landing phase at Tribhuvan International Airport, the report said. This led to the loss of “situational awareness” that had prevented him from properly judging the angle of approach to the runway."
867,"The report also blamed air traffic controllers in Nepal for a “lack of assertiveness” in safely guiding the plane, a twin-engine turboprop that can carry up to 78 passengers, to the ground."
868,"“Landing was completed in a sheer desperation after sighting the runway, at very close proximity and very low altitude,” the report said."
869,"Captain Sultan, his co-pilot and the two other crew members on board were among those who died in the crash. The report was compiled using cockpit voice recordings, closed-circuit television footage, a flight data recorder and interviews with air traffic controllers and Nepali and Bangladeshi officials."
870,"Though an experienced pilot, Captain Sultan had struggled in the past. In 1993, he was let go from the Bangladesh Air Force in connection with his depression, the report said. He was later cleared to work again and flew planes for several airlines before joining US-Bangla Airlines in 2015, the year after it began operations."
871,"Dhaka-Kathmandu was US-Bangla Airlines’ first international route, according to the CAPA-Center for Aviation, a research group in Sydney, Australia. The airline is a subsidiary of the US-Bangla Group, a joint American-Bangladeshi company."
872,"In recent medical self-declaration forms, Captain Sultan, who was married with one son, did not disclose his mental health issues, the report found. He also claimed on some forms to have never been a smoker."
873,"Based on its findings, the Nepalese government recommended stricter and more regular physical and psychological evaluations for pilots before renewing their licenses."
874,"But Pranila Chitrakar, 38, whose husband died in the crash, circled back to Captain Sultan’s checkered history. She wondered why he had been allowed to helm Flight 211 in the first place."
875,"“My husband and many others wouldn’t have died if this mentally disturbed pilot was barred from leading the flight,” she said."
876,The plan was simple: Take the train to the ski slopes. 
877,"Why? Trains are romantic. Trains are relatively climate-friendly. And I had recently spent an hour and a half on a perfect powder day sitting in traffic, trying to drive up Little Cottonwood Canyon to Snowbird, near Salt Lake City."
878,So I decided to swear off car travel for a weekend of skiing and snowboarding via the rails. 
879,"Two developments in Denver made the scheme possible: In 2016 the city opened the A line train, which runs from Denver International Airport to Union Station, an exquisitely restored Beaux-Arts terminal and the city’s main transit hub, in 37 minutes. "
880,"The following year, Amtrak launched its service on the Winter Park Express, a snow-season train that leaves Union Station each weekend and delivers passengers to the base of the Winter Park Resort, a burly, 3,000-acre ski mountain about 70 miles outside Denver. "
881,"Getting to the mountain, and the other resorts west of Denver by car is increasingly an issue. On a snowy weekend, traffic on I-70, the main route to the mountains, can turn an hour-and-a-half drive to Winter Park into a four-hour ordeal. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the Winter Park Express’s trips sell out, with 400 passengers choosing to ride the rails each trip. "
882,"Or, as 8-year-old Sophia Sprinkle, who rode the train on a recent weekend with her mother and her mother’s boyfriend, said, “I like it a lot because it goes really fast.” "
883,"It was admittedly a harebrained exercise. I had to fly to Denver and back, and spend a night in a hotel there at either end of the ski weekend, making for an expensive two days on the slopes. But I decided to consider it as research for a possible longer trip. "
884,"The journey began on a Friday afternoon in New York City, which lacks what travel planners call a “one-seat ride” to the airport. I slalomed down the subways stairs with my skis and gear as commuters streamed up, then rode a urine-perfumed elevator to the platform to meet my friend Julie at Penn Station. A standing-room-only Long Island Rail Road train took us to Jamaica station, the terminus of the AirTrain, where we once again had to schlep our gear to a new platform to get to the terminal for our four-hour-and-47-minute flight (which sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half after our scheduled departure). "
885,"In Denver, things looked up: As we walked out of the airport with our gear, the train to Union Station was on the tracks, its countdown clock showing 0.0 minutes to departure. I broke into a run, but the helpful conductor held the door and we slipped on with no seconds to spare. "
886,"After a too-short night in the Hotel Indigo Denver Downtown, across the street from Union Station, we boarded the ski train a little before 7 a.m. It was already filling up with ski-pants-clad passengers, most of them headed to the mountain for the day. Skis and bags went into a luggage area, and a friendly volunteer from Colorail, the Colorado Rail Passenger Association, helped us find seats. "
887,"The original Colorado ski train was created by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1940 to carry members of the Eskimo Ski Club to the mountain. The tradition continued until 2009, when the DRGW, which had changed hands several times by then, was sold again, and the new owners shut it down, selling off the cars to a Canadian outfit, as if to put a spike in the idea that it might return. "
888,"But train enthusiasts do not give up easily. In the fall of 2014, a member of Colorail called for the ski train’s revival in the group’s newsletter. Brad Swartzwelter, an Amtrak conductor who, as a boy, had gone fishing and hiking in the woods not far from the train tracks in Granby, Colo., put together a business plan, which Colorail pitched to Amtrak. "
889,"Test runs began in March 2015 and by January 2017, after some improvements to the platform at the ski resort, the Winter Park Express was in business. "
890,"Its eight cars — double-decker Superliners — are usually used on overnight trains in the West, like the California Zephyr or the Southwest Chief, but in the winter, when rider numbers on the big trains decline, the cars can be lent to the ski train. Mr. Swartzwelter is the conductor, checking tickets and offering a running commentary over the train’s public address system. "
891,"After leaving Denver at 7 a.m. sharp, the Express rolled through the suburb of Arvada and across a wide grassland plain, where it climbed a series of 10 curves toward the mountains of the Front Range. As the terrain got steeper, the train wound through massive slabs of rock that seemed almost close enough to touch. In the lounge car, the bartender, Darrell Bennett, was playing Tracy Chapman and doing a brisk business in Bloody Marys. After a section along South Boulder Creek, the train reached the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel. For the day-trippers, that was the signal to put their ski boots on; in 10 minutes we were at the base of the mountain. Nine a.m., right on time. "
892,"We cheated on our anti-car resolve and rode a hotel shuttle bus to the front desk of the Zephyr Mountain Lodge, where we stowed our bags, since our room in a nearby condominium wouldn’t open up until the afternoon. Within half an hour we were in line for the gondola. The mountain seemed to fit into the theme of the trip, with runs named Trestle (an Expert bump run with one seriously steep section), Brakeman and Derailer. Winter Park has never had the cachet of mountains like Vail and Aspen, and its devotees seemed to have a bit of a chip on their shoulders: “Vail Sucks” stickers were plastered on many available surfaces in the lift lines. "
893,"Julie and I split up for a while. Did I notice, she asked when we got back together, that everyone here seemed to be talking about smoking weed? "
894,"That night we cheated again and took a shuttle bus into the nearby town of Winter Park for fish tacos at a bustling joint called Pepe Osaka’s, where we sat at the bar and watched motor sports on TV. As we waited in the falling snow for a shuttle home, the people next to us casually lit up a joint. "
895,The next day was a skier’s dream. It had snowed all night and just kept going. My skis floated through inches of powder as we danced down the bowls and tree-lined slopes off the Panoramic Express lift. The day was punctuated by cries of “yee-hah” from our fellow skiers — and maybe from me as well. 
896,"Around 3:30 p.m., I called it a day and went back to the condo to pick up our gear. Another quick shuttle ride took us back to the platform and the waiting train. Every seat was taken. There were numerous family groups — Emily Rice and her husband, from Chesapeake, Va., were visiting her parents, and her father, who had never been to Winter Park, had arranged the outing for them all. They hadn’t even skied. “I love taking the train,” she said. "
897,Another group was celebrating a birthday — they had a cooler of beer for the ride back. 
898,"John Blood was on the train with his family, including his two young children, and another couple and their children. Why had they taken the train? “I-70,” he said. Well, part of the appeal was “little kids who like trains,” he added, though at $200 for a family, the ride was not a viable alternative to the highway, he said. "
899,"As we rode out of the mountains, Mr. Swartzwelter talked about the train — how it got 400 passenger-miles per gallon of diesel fuel, what he does while the train is at Winter Park — “fix things” and rest, since he gets up at 4 a.m. to get the train rolling in the morning. "
900,"Then he pulled out his smartphone, tapped on Google Maps and traced his finger along the path of I-70 where traffic was backed up for miles. “See all the red?” he asked. I did. And I was happy to be on the train. "
901,"This ski season, the Winter Park Express ran every Saturday and Sunday, leaving Union Station at 7 a.m. on the way out, and returning from Winter Park at 4:30 p.m. The train also ran on the first two Fridays of each month, letting skiers spend a long weekend on the mountain. Tickets range from $29 to $59 per person each way, depending on how far in advance they are purchased. Children 2 through 12 are half-fare with an adult. The Winter Park Express runs this year through March 31. "
902,"The A Line from the airport to Union Station, Denver, takes 37 minutes and costs $10.50 per ride. Tickets can be purchased using the RTD app on your phone. "
903,"The Hotel Indigo Denver Downtown is just across the street from Union Station at 1801 Wewatta Street. A room with two queen beds was $153.95, including taxes, using the Booking.com app. "
904,"At Winter Park, a studio in the Founders Pointe condominium at the base area with one queen bed and a pull out couch was $280.12, including taxes. "
905,"The Crawford Hotel occupies what used to be office space within Union Station itself. You check in at a nook off the main waiting room. A double queen room recently cost about $278 a night booked through the hotel, $351.95 with taxes and fees. The hotel does not have its own bar or restaurants, but has access to those in the station, including the Cooper Lounge on the mezzanine, which offers a view over the waiting room along with craft cocktails.

908,"PARKLAND, Fla. — When I arrived at school on Feb. 14, 2018, like any junior, I was mostly caught up in Valentine’s Day chatter and events. But that all changed in the space of a few minutes that afternoon when a gunman opened fire on my classmates and my teachers, killing 17 of them and injuring just as many."
909,"Despite the countless tragedies you see on TV, nothing prepares you for the day it happens to your community."
910,"The familiar images of students fleeing their school as SWAT teams entered, of parents waiting by the perimeter desperately praying to get their kids back, were now my reality. They were my classmates and friends, too many of whom never came home."
911,"After the shooting, my friends at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and I decided we couldn’t sit by as school shootings and gun violence became a normal part of life in America. We were determined to turn an act of violence into a movement, to do everything we could to send a powerful message to the country and to Washington."
912,"There’s not a day that goes by that I’m not reminded of the shooting. When I hear the sound of sirens or fireworks, I’m taken back to that horrific afternoon. For me, Valentine’s Day will now forever be a reminder of loss."
913,"Yet our community isn’t alone in its tragedy. In 2017, nearly 40,000 Americans died as a result of guns, an average of 109 people a day.  And according to a tally from Education Week, there were 24 school shootings that resulted in gun-related deaths or injuries in 2018 alone. "
914,"While several states have taken positive legislative measures in response, there have been zero bipartisan investigations or new laws from Congress."
915,Not a single federal law has been passed since the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012 to address the crisis of school shootings. This year could be different — but only if we organize and insist on it.
916,"Last week, Congress held its first hearing on gun violence prevention since 2011. This week, the House Judiciary Committee is poised to approve a bipartisan bill to requiring background checks for all gun purchases, a proposal that represents one important step toward keeping deadly firearms out of the wrong hands. However, it’s also likely this bill won’t get a hearing, let alone a vote, in the Senate."
917,"That chamber’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, needs to explain to all of us who have survived a shooting or lost someone to gun violence why the Senate won’t even vote on such a bill even though there’s been over half a million gun deaths since 2000, the year I was born."
918,And Americans should truly reckon with why this epidemic of gun deaths is treated so differently from any other health crisis in our country. 
919,Imagine for a moment that all these gun deaths were caused by something else widely feared: airplane crashes. There’s no universe in which we wouldn’t see it as a national emergency worthy of our undivided attention.
920,"In fact, 2017 was a remarkable year in aviation. No one died in a commercial airplane crash, meaning it was safer for me to fly than it was for me to go to high school. It would take hundreds of completely full Boeing 737 flights crashing without survivors to total the number of people who died by guns in America in just 2017."
921,"If even a handful of such crashes occurred, the government would declare a national emergency. All 737s would be grounded, there would be an independent commission created to investigate the crisis, and Boeing would be called before Congress to answer for its failures. "
922,"So why then don’t more than 30,000 gun deaths in a year rise to the level of a national crisis for America’s conservative leaders?"
923,"The past year has been one with the deepest of lows and, at times, the highest of highs — moments when the hope that springs from fighting for a better world makes anything feel possible. On Thursday, the anniversary of the shooting, I will be in the only place that matters, nestled in my community and with my family. "
924,"And for the next four days, the organization I helped found, March For Our Lives, will go dark to honor those we lost and their memory."
925,"I am deeply proud of all that my friends and I have accomplished in the last year. Still, I can’t help but wonder why so many lawmakers are ignoring — and, at their worst, enabling — the horrific gun deaths that occur in our country each day. "

929,"BANGKOK — Ly Tong, a South Vietnamese Air Force veteran who dropped anti-Communist leaflets over Vietnam from hijacked planes long after the war’s end, playing out the fantasies of many defeated soldiers of the south, died on Saturday in San Diego. He was 74."
930,"The cause was lung disease, his family said."
931,"A man who never accepted defeat, Mr. Tong considered it his personal mission to take back his country from the Communists, who have ruled it since winning the Vietnam War in 1975."
932,"“I have the duty to liberate my country!” he said in an interview more than 30 years later. “You cannot enjoy yourself when your whole country is in pain, in torture.”"
933,"Mr. Tong became a hero to many Vietnamese refugees in 1992, when he hijacked a commercial airliner after takeoff from Bangkok, ordered the pilot to fly low over Ho Chi Minh City — known as Saigon, South Vietnam’s capital, before the Communist victory — and dumped thousands of leaflets calling for a popular uprising."
934,"He then strapped on a parachute and followed the leaflets down to certain capture. He was released six years later in an amnesty and returned to the United States, where he had become a citizen after the war."
935,"In 2000, under the guise of taking flying lessons in Thailand, Mr. Tong made a second trip over Ho Chi Minh City, sending down a new cascade of leaflets, which he had signed “Global Alliance for the Total Uprising Against Communists.”"
936,"He was arrested on his return to Thailand and spent six years in prison for hijacking. He was not armed, and no one was hurt on either of his flights."
937,"“The only thing that matters is the Communists still control my country,” he shouted through a double screen of wire mesh during an interview at Bangkok’s central jail. “I’m a pilot. This is what I can do.”"
938,"He timed his second flight to coincide with President Bill Clinton’s visit to Vietnam, the first by an American president since the end of the war. Soon after Mr. Tong scattered his leaflets, Mr. Clinton was in Hanoi, the capital, where he delivered a very different message: “The history we leave behind is painful and hard. We must not forget it, but we must not be controlled by it.”"
939,"As the years passed and a new generation of Vietnamese-Americans accepted the unsentimental facts of history, the veterans’ fantasies of liberation became relics of that distant war."
940,"But at the end of his life, it became clear that the legend of Mr. Tong — who proved time and again his loyalty to a country that no longer existed — still compelled devotion."
941,"As word spread that his health was failing, visitors converged on his hospital room in San Diego — as many as 200 people on one recent weekend."
942,"His most devoted followers were former soldiers like himself, liberated from years in Communist labor camps under an agreement with the United States and arriving by the tens of thousands in the 1990s, the last and saddest wave of refugees."
943,"“They have come prepared to show the courage of the former soldiers of South Vietnam, but they are showing themselves only as a group of misfit people,” Yen Ngoc Do, who was then the editor of the Vietnamese-language newspaper Nguoi Viet, said in an interview. “Their political and military past has been totally forgotten.”"
944,"Broken in health and spirit, too old or tired to start over again, many of the veterans lapsed into listlessness and despair."
945,"“I survived the war, I survived prison,” one of them, Phan Nhat Nam, a former paratrooper and wartime journalist, said in a 1995 interview in the Little Saigon area of Orange County, Calif."
946,"“Now I must survive my freedom, and it is very hard,” he said. “We are old men now. We have lost the ability to adapt and renew.”"
947,"For people like these, Mr. Tong offered an alternate reality — a vision of courage and action, a tragic hero in the tradition of Vietnamese history."
948,"Ly Tong was born Le Van Tong on Sept. 1, 1945, in the central Vietnamese city of Hue, according to his family. (Other accounts have said that he was born in 1948.) He was the son of a well-to-do farmer who was executed as a revolutionary."
949,"Mr. Tong joined the South Vietnamese Air Force and served in its elite Black Eagle fighter squadron. As the war neared its end, he was shot down and sent to a re-education camp."
950,"His postwar story began in 1980, with his escape and a 17-month trek to freedom through five countries. He picked his way through minefields, he said, broke out of jails, dodged security patrols and crawled through jungle to avoid border posts."
951,"He was accepted as a refugee in the United States, where he worked as a security guard and earned a degree in political science from the University of New Orleans. He published a 300-page autobiography, “Black Eagle,” which made him a celebrity among overseas Vietnamese."
952,"In early 2000, years after his first flight over Ho Chi Minh City, Mr. Tong burnished his anti-Communist credentials with a flight over Havana in a rented plane, scattering leaflets as he had in Vietnam. He was commended on his return by Cuban-Americans in Florida, who gave him a victory parade. His second foray into Vietnam came later that year."
953,"In his final and most bizarre act of defiance, in 2010 in California, Mr. Tong assaulted a Vietnamese singer whom he deemed sympathetic to the government of Vietnam. Disguised as a woman, he walked to the edge of the stage, reached up as if to hand the singer a bouquet and squirted a liquid, which may have been pepper spray, in her face. He was sentenced on multiple charges to six months in jail and three years’ probation. He appeared at his trial in drag."
954,"Mr. Tong lived out his final years quietly in San Diego. He is survived by a half brother, a half sister, three daughters and several nieces and nephews."
955,"ABOARD THE PAPAL PLANE — Pope Francis said on Tuesday that the Roman Catholic Church had faced a persistent problem of sexual abuse of nuns by priests and even bishops, the first time he has publicly acknowledged the issue."
956,"Catholic nuns have accused clerics of sexual abuse in recent years in India, Africa, Latin America and in Italy, and a Vatican magazine last week mentioned nuns having abortions or giving birth to the children of priests. But Francis has never raised the issue until he was asked to comment during a news conference aboard the papal plane returning to Rome from his trip to the United Arab Emirates."
957,"“It’s true,” Francis said. “There are priests and bishops who have done that.”"
958,"The pope’s admission opens a new front in the long-running scandal of sexual abuse by priests, recognizing nuns who have tried for years to call attention to their plight. With the #MeToo movement going strong, and Francis under pressure for neglecting the victims of child abuse, the nuns’ pleas have gained traction."
959,"In November, the organization representing the world’s Catholic women’s religious orders, the International Union of Superiors General, publicly denounced the “culture of silence and secrecy” that contributed to abuse, and urged nuns to report abuse to law enforcement."
960,"A top official in the Vatican office that handles sexual abuse allegations resigned last month after a former nun accused him of making sexual advances during confession. The official, the Rev. Hermann Geissler, chief of staff in the Vatican’s doctrinal office, denied the allegation, the Vatican said."
961,"An article last week in Women Church World, the women’s magazine of the Vatican newspaper L’Osservatore Romano, blamed the abuse on the outsize power of priests."
962,"“The abuse of women results in procreation and so is at the origin of the scandal of imposed abortions and children not recognized by priests,” wrote the article’s author, Lucetta Scaraffia, a feminist intellectual and the editor in chief of Women Church World."
963,"Asked about these developments on Tuesday, Francis said that it was a continuing problem and that the Vatican was working on the issue. Some priests, he said, have been suspended."
964,"“Should more be done? Yes,” Francis said. “Do we have the will? Yes. But it is a path that we have already begun.”"
965,"Francis recalled that his predecessor, Benedict XVI, had been “a strong man” who he said had sought to remove priests who committed sexual abuse and even “sexual slavery.”"
966,"Francis spoke about a case in which Benedict dissolved an order of nuns “because a certain slavery of women had crept in, slavery to the point of sexual slavery on the part of clergy or the founder.”"
967,"A Vatican spokesman, Alessandro Gisotti, said later that Francis was referring to the Contemplative Sisters of Saint-Jean, a small group in France that confronted a variety of problems."
968,"Even though the abuse of nuns gets less attention than the abuse of children and young men, it is not new. In the 1990s, as the child sex abuse crisis was starting to emerge in the United States, leaders of women’s religious orders wrote several reports calling attention to cases of priests abusing nuns."
969,"Many examples came from Africa, where priests were said to have turned to nuns for sex during the spread of AIDS. One sister at the time, Maura O’Donohue, wrote of a case in Malawi where priests impregnated nearly 30 sisters in one congregation. When they complained to the archbishop, she wrote, they were replaced."
970,"Last year, a nun in India accused a bishop of repeatedly raping her between 2014 and 2016. The bishop was arrested after she reported him to the police, a decision that divided the local Catholic community. Many priests celebrated when the bishop, who faces trial this year, was released on bail."
971,"In a high-profile case in Chile, the Vatican is investigating reports that priests abused nuns. Current and former nuns said the women had been removed from the order when they reported the abuse."
972,"Last summer, an investigation by The Associated Press found cases of abuse of nuns in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, and reported that the Vatican had not adequately punished offenders or supported victims."
973,"At a conference in Pakistan recently, Sister Rose Pacatte, who is based in Los Angeles, spoke to leaders of women’s religious orders on how to prevent abuse."
974,"“Don’t report to bishop or priest as the first step to deal with the situation,” warned one slide in her presentation. “They may be the abusers or may protect them.”"
975,"Last year, Mary Dispenza, a former nun who works with the Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, a victims’ advocacy group, helped popularize the hashtag #nunstoo on Twitter. She intended to gather stories of people abused by nuns, but started to hear from nuns about abuse by priests."
976,"“I’m really angered by the words of the pope just now,” Ms. Dispenza said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “I am angered by the Pope not standing up and really speaking out about the tragedy, and actions he will take.”"
977,"The majority of the pope’s visit to the United Arab Emirates was focused on interreligious dialogue with the Muslim world, and it culminated with the signing of a sort of manifesto for brotherhood with Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Egypt’s influential Al Azhar mosque."
978,"Asked on the plane home about conservative criticism that he had been Pollyannaish in his approach to the Middle East and been taken advantage of by the Muslim sheikhs, Francis joked, “Not only the Muslims,” and noted that his critics felt he had been manipulated by just about everyone."
979,But he said the document he signed was on strong theological footing.
980,"“I want to say this clearly, from a Catholic point of view, the document has not moved a millimeter” from church teaching codified in the Second Vatican Council. He said he took the extra step of having the document vetted by a tough Dominican theologian, who approved it. “It’s not a step backward,” he said. “It is a step forward.”"
981,"He also made it clear that he had continued to voice his concerns about the persecution of Christians in the region — which he said his flock knew all too well — but that either “me or another Peter,” meaning a successor pope, would surely visit more Muslim countries."
982,"Earlier Tuesday, the pope celebrated Mass at the Zayed Sports City Stadium in Abu Dhabi before roughly 135,000 Catholics, many of them migrants from India, the Philippines and South America, who had come to the Emirates to work."
983,"The Mass, also attended by 4,000 Muslims, was the largest public celebration of a Christian rite in the history of the Muslim country, where the worship of other faiths is tolerated but is not typically done in such a public way."
984,The next major event on the pope’s schedule is a meeting with presidents of the world’s bishops’ conferences at the end of February in Rome to focus on a response to the global sex abuse crisis that is threatening the pope’s legacy and the moral capital that is the currency of his pontificate.
985,"KABUL, Afghanistan — For the second time in a few days, an Afghan Army base was destroyed on Wednesday — but this time by American airstrikes that followed a firefight between the Afghans and Americans, Afghan officials said."
986,"A local Afghan official said six soldiers were killed and nine others badly wounded, out of 17 soldiers at the base. Qais Mangal, a spokesman for the Afghan Defense Ministry, confirmed that the airstrikes had taken place after another Afghan unit attacked a joint convoy of Afghan Special Forces and American troops. He put the death toll at five soldiers, with 10 wounded."
987,"An American military spokeswoman said personnel at the Afghan Army post, which she described as a “checkpoint,” had opened fire on the convoy first."
988,"“This is an example of the fog of war,” said Sgt. First Class Debra Richardson. “The U.S. conducted a precision self-defense airstrike on people who were firing at a partnered U.S.-Afghan force.”"
989,"The Defense Ministry spokesman said one Afghan commando had been wounded. There were no reports of American casualties, although the United States military rarely releases details on wounded soldiers."
990,"In western Afghanistan on Monday, a Taliban attack wiped out a company of Afghan soldiers in their base in Badghis Province, killing or capturing more than 50 soldiers. Analysts have said that the Afghan forces’ tendency to stay penned up in fortified bases rather than going on offensives has hurt their effectiveness and led to a devastatingly high rate of casualties."
991,"The airstrikes on Wednesday happened while American soldiers were patrolling on the outskirts of the city of Tirin Kot, the capital of southern Uruzgan Province, near an Afghan National Army base, according to Mohammed Karim Karimi, the deputy head of the Uruzgan provincial council."
992,"Mr. Karimi said the American forces believed that they had heard gunfire coming from the base, and a firefight broke out between the Americans and the Afghan forces at the base. The long-established outpost, known as Satarman Base, guards the approaches to Tirin Kot, which has been repeatedly attacked by Taliban insurgents who dominate much of the surrounding province."
993,"“It is still not confirmed who fired first, but then they both engaged in a firefight,” Mr. Karimi said. The fight lasted four hours, until 3 a.m., when American warplanes carried out airstrikes that destroyed the base, he said."
994,"“There was a misunderstanding between both sides,” Mr. Karimi said, adding that in the darkness of the area both forces thought they were engaging the Taliban."
995,The insurgents often steal Afghan and American military vehicles and uniforms to launch their attacks.
996,"“The Afghan and U.S. partnered force tried to de-escalate the situation, but in the fog of war they continued to be fired upon,” Sergeant Richardson said. “We are operating in a complex environment, Afghans included, where attacks come from fighters who do not wear their uniforms.”"
997,"Two Afghan soldiers who fled during the fight were apparently unhurt, Mr. Karimi said, but the nine soldiers who were wounded were in critical condition."
998,"“It was a mistake between them,” said Mr. Mangal, the Defense Ministry spokesman. “The Afghan Army outpost opened fire first on a unit of Afghan and foreign forces headed to a military operation.”"
999,"In a separate attack on Wednesday, the Taliban again attacked Afghan National Army bases in the Bala Murghab district of Badghis Province, where the 50 soldiers were killed or captured on Monday. This time, seven soldiers were missing, either captured or killed, officials said."
1000,"WASHINGTON — The government shutdown that ended last month has taken a lasting hit on the Coast Guard, which has grounded aircraft, stopped major ship repairs and will leave parts of an air station in Puerto Rico without emergency generators for the start of hurricane season because of a backlog that will take months to process."
1001,"Internal documents obtained by The New York Times show that the Coast Guard’s ship maintenance command lost at least 7,456 productive workdays — or 28.5 years’ worth of workdays — as a direct result of the partial shutdown, which furloughed 6,400 civilian employees."
1002,"“This reality poses significant risk to operational availability of cutters and boats,” the documents concluded."
1003,"The service also noted a “domino effect” that has caused delays in repairs and maintenance on its roughly 200 aircraft, which, in turn, could keep them from being immediately available."
1004,"There are “tremendous backlogs of contractor work,” the documents said."
1005,"[Sign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty, conflict and consequence.]"
1006,"The delays are expected to significantly limit the number of ships and aircraft available for Coast Guard operations, which generally include drug interdiction as well as search-and-rescue and maritime safety missions. They will also affect the training of the uniformed and civilian Coast Guard force."
1007,"“You can get the money, but you can never get the time,” said Mark F. Cancian, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “It’s going to hurt them for quite a while.”"
1008,"The shutdown ended on Jan. 25. But over 35 days, as President Trump held out for $5.7 billion in congressional funding for a border wall, most federal agencies were unable to pay their employees or contractors. That included the Coast Guard, the only branch of the military that is not part of the Pentagon."
1009,"As a branch of the Department of Homeland Security, the Coast Guard went without pay until the shutdown ended. According to the documents, the Coast Guard finance center in Virginia processed about $46,000 in mutual assistance loans — funds often reserved for dire personal hardships — and at least one special request for a service member who sought approval for outside employment."
1010,"During the shutdown, Coast Guard members “continued activities authorized by law that provided for national security and protected life and property,” Chief Warrant Officer Barry Lane, a Coast Guard spokesman in Washington said in a statement to The Times on Friday. “The Coast Guard stopped or curtailed some specific mission activities that did not fall into those categories.”"
1011,"The documents, dated the day before the shutdown ended, outlined a grim forecast for the small service of 55,000 active duty, reserve and civilian employees."
1012,"Over the last decade, the Coast Guard has struggled to secure steady funding levels from Congress. It did receive a $600 million lift this month after a spending bill funded a replacement for the Polar Star, the Coast Guard’s only heavy icebreaker."
1013,"But the shutdown hobbled the vessel, which the documents described as one of the Coast Guard’s “highest priority” ships. The spare parts inventory for the 400-foot Polar Star’s three Pratt and Whitney gas turbine engines were “below safety stock levels,” the documents said, and an employee was taken off furlough to work on a maintenance contract issue for the vessel."
1014,Other examples of the shutdown’s effects on the Coast Guard included:
1015,"■ Roughly 600 employees at the Aviation Logistics Center in Elizabeth City, N.C., potentially would have to work overtime for five to seven months to make up for production lost during the impasse."
1016,"■ The number of aircraft across the Coast Guard deemed “not mission capable” doubled to 10 percent of the aircraft, from 5 percent. Twenty-five aircraft — roughly 12 percent of the Coast Guard fleet — that are under maintenance have had their completion dates pushed back a total of 277 days."
1017,"In the short term, that has created a weekslong delay of delivering a training helicopter to Mobile, Ala., and a surveillance aircraft to Miami. The surveillance aircraft are often used for maritime patrols and spotting drug runners."
1018,"■ In Alaska, a dry dock needed for repairs to the 110-foot cutter Liberty was closed as a result of the shutdown. The Liberty patrols some of the world’s most dangerous waters, and was preparing to go to sea from its home port in Auke Bay in mid-January when one of its diesel engines seized."
1019,■ An engine replacement in one Legend-class cutter and modifications to the small boat launching equipment in the rest of the fleet were delayed. The Legend cutters were built specifically to support Pentagon operations; the ships already were plagued by cost overruns and delays.
1020,"■ Crucial maintenance was pushed back for two “buoy tenders” — smaller boats meant to ensure the position of navigational markers on internal waterways and rivers. One was based in Keokuk, Iowa, on the upper Mississippi River, where thousands of tons of cargo pass through annually. The other, in Chattanooga, Tenn., maintains markers in the Tennessee River and seven other rivers, as well as two creeks and one other waterway."
1021,"■ At Coast Guard Air Station Borniquen in Puerto Rico, where Hurricane Maria tore through in 2017, a project to install emergency generators for base housing “will not be in place before the start of hurricane season,” which begins June 1."
1022,"Boeing dismissed concerns about a powerful new anti-stall system on the 737 Max for months, insisting that pilots could deal with any problems by following a checklist of emergency procedures."
1023,"Now, the preliminary findings from the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 have cast doubt on whether those instructions were sufficient, adding to the scrutiny over Boeing’s and federal regulators’ response to two deadly crashes involving the same jet model."
1024,"The findings, released Thursday in Ethiopia, suggest that the pilots on the Ethiopian Airlines flight initially followed the prescribed procedures after the anti-stall system malfunctioned. They shut off the electricity that allows the automated software to push the plane’s nose down and took manual control of the jet. They then tried to right the plane, with the captain telling his co-pilot three times to “pull up.”"
1025,"But they could not regain control. About four minutes after the system initially activated, the plane hit the ground at colossal speed, killing all 157 people on board."
1026,"“The captain was not able to recover the aircraft with the procedures he was trained on and told by Boeing,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 pilot, who read the report."
1027,"The findings laid out a timeline of the March 10 flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. While the findings are not yet final, the initial evidence has raised new concerns about whether Boeing and federal regulators provided sufficient guidance for pilots. The report and other evidence suggest that Boeing’s procedures may not have worked well when a plane was flying at a high speed."
1028,"The pilots had a short window to react before going into an irrecoverable nose dive. Tests of the 737 Max have shown that once faulty data triggered the system, pilots had little time to save the aircraft. The system, according to the investigators’ findings, appears to have forced the nose of the plane down several times in less than three minutes."
1029,"Moments after takeoff, one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane’s angle of attack diverged wildly, eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane."

1145,"The new report, Mr. Tajer said, suggests that Boeing may have underestimated the power of the new software, known as the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS."
1146,"“It was too aggressive,” he said. “They left the pilot with no ability to gain control of the aircraft if it went to the full limit.”"
1147,"The preliminary findings add to Boeing’s woes, which have mounted after the Ethiopian Airlines disaster and the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max less than five months earlier in Indonesia. The company said this week that it needed more time to finish a software update and training, which will be necessary before the planes can fly again."
1148,Lawmakers and regulators are scrutinizing Boeing and the process for certifying the 737 Max. The families of passengers and crew killed in the two crashes have hired lawyers to pursue claims against Boeing.
1149,[Read more about obstacles to information-sharing in the months between the Indonesian and Ethiopian crashes.]
1150,"“Boeing has made good aircraft over the years, but this is a radical departure from that,” said Chesley B. Sullenberger III, the aviation expert and retired pilot who landed a jet in the Hudson River. “This never should have happened.”"
1151,"Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, acknowledged the role of the software in the accident. “As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it, and we know how to do it.”"
1152,"The Federal Aviation Administration said: “We continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident. As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action.”"
1153,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
1154,"At a news conference on Thursday, Dagmawit Moges, Ethiopia’s minister of transportation, said the flight crew had “performed all the procedures, repeatedly, provided by the manufacturer, but were not able to control the aircraft.”"
1155,"The report, which could change in the coming months when it’s completed, doesn’t rule out the potential for pilot error in the Ethiopian crash. And some pilots in the United States raised doubts about whether the problems on board had been properly handled."
1156,"“They did not follow the Boeing procedures,” said Hart Langer, a former Pan Am pilot and United Airlines executive. If the pilots had used the electric controls to pull the nose up more, he said, they would have been able to recover the plane."
1157,"“Had they done that, it would have cut out the MCAS input,” he said."
1158,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
1159,"When Boeing outlined the emergency process in November after the Lion Air disaster, many pilots were confident that the new instructions were enough to avoid a crash. However, pilots didn’t test the updated procedures in flight simulators, because few airlines had them for the 737 Max."
1160,"The problems with the Ethiopian Airlines flight started almost immediately after takeoff, according to the report, amplifying the pressure for pilots to act. About two minutes after takeoff, a safety system warned, “Don’t sink,” multiple times."
1161,"A sensor that measures the angle at which the plane is flying began producing erroneous readings, suggesting that the plane was about to stall. There are two so-called angle of attack sensors on the plane, and the one on the left began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from the one on the right. The faulty data activated the software that automatically pushed down the nose of the plane."
1162,Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.
1163,"Once the system kicked in, the report said, the pilots appear to have followed the steps in the checklist that Boeing issued after the crash of Lion Air Flight 302 in October. First, they used electrical switches on their control wheels to bring the nose back up."
1164,"About five seconds later, the anti-stall software activated again, pushing the plane toward the ground, according to the report. The pilots again used the switches to pull up the plane. And then, as prescribed by the emergency checklist, they disabled the electrical system that powered the software that pushed the plane down."
1165,"That move forced the crew to manually control the stabilizers, which help right the plane, by turning a wheel next to their seats that helps manually pull the plane’s nose up. Soon after that, the first officer said the manual method was “not working,” the report detailed."
1166,"The plane’s speed appears to have complicated pilot’s efforts to regain control. At high speeds, the force on the plane may make it nearly impossible for pilots to turn the wheel that controls the tail."
1167,"There is no indication that the Ethiopian pilots tried to slow the jet down, according to data from the flight recorder."
1168,"“What needs to be understood and explained is why the airspeed basically increased throughout the flight and the throttles did not move,” said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association."
1169,"When the manual process didn’t work for the Ethiopian Airlines pilots, they appear to have turned back on the electricity to the flight control system in a last-ditch effort at recovery. But the software activated one last time, sending the plane into a deadly nose dive."
1170,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — Just two minutes after takeoff, the captain of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 said the plane was having problems. Pilots then began having trouble controlling the aircraft."
1171,"In the plane’s short and fatal flight, pilots initially followed safety procedures recommended by Boeing, performing actions on the emergency checklist, including cutting off electricity to an automatic system that was pushing the nose down. But they were still unable to prevent the jet from crashing, according to an initial report by Ethiopian investigators."
1172,"About six minutes after takeoff, the plane went into a fatal dive that killed all 157 people on board."
1173,"The report, released Thursday, laid out a timeline of the flight based on analysis from 18 Ethiopian and international investigators and information from the jet’s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder. The investigators’ initial report was released several hours after a news conference held by Ethiopia’s minister of transportation."
1174,"The data showed that shortly after liftoff, a crucial sensor that measures the angle that the plane is moving through the air, began fluctuating wildly on the pilot’s side, falsely indicating that the plane was close to stalling. The sensor, one of two sensors on the plane’s nose, began giving readings nearly 60 degrees different from that of its counterpart."
1175,"About a minute and a half after takeoff, after the pilots had performed routine tasks like retracting flaps on the wings, the false reading appears to have set off an automated system known as MCAS, the black box data shows. MCAS is intended to prevent a stall and began rapidly pushing the nose of the craft down."
1176,"Moments after takeoff, one of two crucial sensors that measure the plane’s angle of attack diverged wildly, eventually triggering an automated system that pushed down the nose of the plane."

1291,By Scott Reinhard | Source: Report by Ethiopian investigators
1292,"The pilots countered that by pushing electrical switches on their control wheels that adjusted the angle of stabilizers on the tail of the plane, which had been moved by MCAS. About five seconds after the pilots tried the right the plane, MCAS again engaged, moving the stabilizers to a dangerous angle in another nose-down action."
1293,"The pilots pushed the electrical switches again. Then, the report says, they followed the emergency checklist and disabled the entire stabilizer electrical system using the so-called stabilizer trim cutout."
1294,"“The first officer called out ‘stab trim cutout’ two times,” the report says. “Captain agreed and first officer confirmed stab trim cutout.”"
1295,"Although that move disabled MCAS, it also forced the crew to control the stabilizers manually with wheels at their feet — a physically difficult task on a plane moving at high speed. A little under four minutes after takeoff, the first officer said the manual method “is not working.”"
1296,"Soon after, the black box data indicates, the crew turned electricity back on and tried two more times to move the stabilizers by hitting the switches. But once they turned the electricity back on, MCAS engaged again, putting the plane into a dive from which it would not recover."
1297,"The crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10 followed the unrecoverable nose-dive almost five months earlier of another jet of the same model, a Boeing 737 Max 8, in Indonesia. Indonesian investigators have implicated MCAS in that disaster, in which the plane’s computer system appeared to override pilot directions based on faulty data."
1298,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
1299,"“These guys are executing the checklist,” Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union, said of the Ethiopian pilots after reviewing the report. “They were identifying the problem and taking swift action.”"
1300,"The initial findings are likely to heighten scrutiny of the Max, Boeing’s newest and top-selling generation of jets. Since the Ethiopian Airlines crash, airlines worldwide have grounded their Max fleets, amid concerns over the apparent propensity of MCAS to malfunction when fed erroneous data."
1301,"The preliminary report was the first official investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines flight, and it echoed some initial suspicions about the crash."
1302,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
1303,"Ethiopian authorities portrayed the pilots of the plane in a positive light. Dagmawit Moges, Ethiopia’s minister of transportation, said that the flight crew repeatedly followed procedures recommended by the plane’s manufacturer “but was not able to control the aircraft.”"
1304,Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.
1305,"Both 737 Max 8 jets crashed at high speed minutes after takeoff in clear weather, following roller-coaster trajectories that hinted at desperate struggles by pilots to control planes seemingly immune to their interventions."
1306,"In a statement on Thursday, Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said that the company was “confident in the fundamental safety of the 737 Max.” Boeing has said it plans to release a software update to MCAS soon, along with increased pilot training for the 737 Max planes."
1307,"“This update, along with the associated training and additional educational materials that pilots want in the wake of these accidents, will eliminate the possibility of unintended MCAS activation and prevent an MCAS-related accident from ever happening again,” Mr. Muilenburg said."
1308,"After the report from Ethiopia was released, Boeing said it was working “to ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again.”"
1309,"“Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 Max,” the company said in a statement."
1310,"Investigations into both crashes are continuing. A final report on the Lion Air accident is expected in August, at the earliest. Ethiopian officials said on Thursday that their final findings could take a year to be released."
1311,"Indonesian investigators have focused on whether the anti-stall system was activated by incorrect data on the plane’s angle of attack, essentially a measure of an aircraft’s likelihood of stalling."
1312,"After the Lion Air crash last October, pilots and airlines complained that they had not been adequately briefed on MCAS by Boeing. The Max manual had no specific mention of how to correct a malfunctioning MCAS. Some pilots reported that they had not even known of the software’s existence."
1313,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
1314,"In creating the Max jet, Boeing added bigger engines to the 737, which gave the airplane the fuel efficiency it needed to compete with a new model from its rival, Airbus. But the change also altered the jet’s aerodynamics and the larger engines had a tendency to push the airplane’s nose up in certain flight conditions."
1315,"To compensate, Boeing engineers created MCAS, which was meant to make the Max behave more like older versions of the 737. To receive certification to fly the Max, some pilots with prior 737 experience had to complete only a couple hours of online training."
1316,"Boeing has said that existing procedures were sufficient to address a MCAS malfunction, but early data suggests that pilots on the doomed flights may not have known how to disengage the system, or may have done so too late to save their flights."
1317,"Most airplane systems are built with backup redundancies to prevent a single data malfunction from altering a plane’s course, but MCAS is activated by data from just one angle-of-attack sensor, not two."
1318,"The Federal Aviation Administration released a statement saying it was still working with Ethiopian officials to investigate the crash. “As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,” the F.A.A. said."
1319,"In the news conference, Ms. Moges, the transport minister, cautioned against holding any party responsible for the plane’s fatal plunge."
1320,"“The major objective of this investigation is to make sure that there is safety in the aviation sector,” she said. “It is not to blame someone.”"
1321,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — As the seconds ticked by on the doomed Indonesian flight, the pilot handed the controls to his co-pilot and flipped through the pages of a technical manual, trying to figure out what was happening."
1322,"Then, as the nose of Lion Air Flight 610 repeatedly bucked downward, Harvino, the co-pilot, began to pray."
1323,The supplication was caught on the final seconds of audio in the cockpit voice recorder.
1324,"“God is great,” Mr. Harvino, an experienced Indonesian aviator, said, then recited a verse asking God to grant a miracle."
1325,"But there was no miracle on Oct. 29, when the brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 dived into the Java Sea in Indonesia, amid good weather, after 12 minutes in the air."
1326,"“I think he knew it was unrecoverable,” said Nurcahyo Utomo, the head of the air accident subcommittee of the Indonesian National Transportation Safety Committee, who listened to and described the contents of the cockpit voice recorder that was retrieved from the ocean floor in January."
1327,[How the U.S. joined other nations in grounding the Boeing plane.]
1328,"Until that point, he said, the pilots had sounded in control and calm."
1329,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
1330,"With the crash of a second nearly brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 this month, when Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 slammed into the ground near Addis Ababa, there has been a renewed focus on the investigation into what caused Flight 610 to crash in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board."
1331,"Indonesian transportation officials say they do not expect to publish a final report on the accident until July or August at the earliest. A preliminary report, based on the contents of the flight data recorder — one of the two so-called black boxes that give investigators clues to what happened in aviation accidents — was released in November."
1332,"The cockpit voice recorder was not found until after the preliminary report was released, so the conversations between Bhavye Suneja, an Indian national who was piloting the plane, and Mr. Harvino were not included in the initial investigative account."
1333,"The report noted that the plane’s nose suddenly shifted downward more than 20 times, a motion that investigators think may have been caused by the incorrect triggering of a new automated anti-stall system on the Boeing Max model."
1334,"Since the Lion Air crash, pilots certified to fly the Max have complained that they were not briefed on the new system or on how to counter it should incorrect data force the nose down."
1335,Indonesian aviation regulations bar the public release of a transcript of the audio in a cockpit voice recorder. But investigators from the National Transportation Safety Committee who listened to the recording described the sounds emanating from the cockpit as the flight crew fought to take control of a plane that seemed almost magnetically propelled toward earth.
1336,"Throughout the brief flight, an ominous rattle could be heard on the voice recorder, evidence that a device called a stick shaker was clattering to alert the pilots of a potential stall that could lead to a crash, said Ony Soerjo Wibowo, an air safety investigator. A stall can occur when a plane ascends too sharply."
1337,[Read more on why the 737 that crashed is Boeing’s best-selling plane ever.]
1338,"Investigators have speculated that incorrect data — including a 20-degree differential between readings from two sensors designed to measure, essentially, the difference between the pitch of the plane and the direction it is moving through the air — could have mistakenly triggered both the stick shaker and the anti-stall system, which is called MCAS."
1339,"The plane had recorded days of questionable data related to air speed, altitude and the angle of the plane’s climb."
1340,"In the first sign of trouble in its doomed flight on Oct. 29, the plane dipped around 700 feet, and in the subsequent minutes, MCAS appears to have kept dragging the plane’s nose down, prompting the pilots to try to push the plane back up by using switches that control stabilizers on the tail."
1341,"The flight crew radioed back to the air traffic control tower in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, to request permission to return to the airport, which was granted. The pilot also asked for the plane to be given a 3,000-foot clearance above and below as it continued to roller coaster through the air."
1342,Flight 610 never turned back to the airport.
1343,"In the cockpit voice recording, the pilots discussed unreliable airspeed and altitude readings they were getting, national transportation safety officials said."
1344,"They consulted the manual to deal with these anomalies. But they did not seem to know about the MCAS system, nor did they speak about what was causing the plane to repeatedly push downward."
1345,"Shortly after Mr. Harvino’s prayer, the plane disappeared from radar, and the cockpit voice recorder stopped. The plane plummeted 5,000 feet, crashing into the Java Sea with such force that parts of the fuselage turned into powder."
1346,Mr. Harvino’s remains are missing to this day.
1347,Boeing said on Friday that it was slowing production of its 737 Max jet and establishing a new internal safety committee after two of the planes were involved in fatal crashes in five months.
1348,"The company will reduce the rate at which it produces the 737 family of airplanes to 42 a month from 52, Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said in a statement. In addition to the Max, Boeing produces the 737 NG and a military version of the plane."
1349,"Boeing will also establish a committee on its board of directors to review how it develops and builds planes, Mr. Muilenburg said."
1350,"The company is making the moves as it confronts an escalating crisis after the crashes of two 737 Max planes: Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 last month. The Max has been grounded, and Boeing paused deliveries of new planes, creating a backlog on its production lines in Renton, Wash. The company has been stockpiling finished planes in Renton and in nearby Seattle."
1351,"Airlines around the world have thousands of outstanding orders for the Max jet, which represent billions of dollars for Boeing’s bottom line in the coming years."
1352,"“Safety is our responsibility, and we own it,” Mr. Muilenburg said. “When the Max returns to the skies, we’ve promised our airline customers and their passengers and crews that it will be as safe as any airplane ever to fly.”"
1353,[The Seattle area is feeling the pain of the Max crisis. The company’s presence is seemingly everywhere in the region.]
1354,"Introduced in 2011 as Boeing scrambled to compete with its European rival, Airbus, the Max became Boeing’s best-selling jet. Each Max sells for about $100 million."
1355,Preliminary investigations now indicate that both airplanes crashed after anti-stall software unique to the Max activated because of faulty data and sent the planes into irrecoverable nose dives.
1356,"The software, known as MCAS, was added to the new jet to compensate for its larger, more fuel-efficient engines. The engines changed the aerodynamics of the plane, raising the possibility that it could stall in some circumstances."
1357,"In his statement, Mr. Muilenburg acknowledged that the new anti-stall software played a role in the accidents. “We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it,” he said."
1358,Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.
1359,"Boeing engineers began working on a software update after the Lion Air crash, but the company and aviation regulators in several countries deemed that the Max remained safe to fly. Though many pilots had not been informed of the powerful new software before the accident in Indonesia, Boeing said it was possible to handle a malfunction if pilots followed a set of instructions it issued after that crash."
1360,"That claim, which was backed by the Federal Aviation Administration, is now under scrutiny. On Thursday, the Ethiopian authorities released a preliminary report of their investigation and found that the pilots in that crash had initially followed the instructions in Boeing’s emergency checklist."
1361,"Only after the crash in Ethiopia did regulators ground the Max. Boeing continues to work on the software update and revised training procedures for the Max, and this week said the fixes were taking longer than anticipated."
1362,"Boeing has given no timetable for the return of the Max. The updates will have to be certified by the F.A.A. and other regulators before the planes can fly again. It may be weeks, if not months, before that can happen."
1363,"“Teams are working tirelessly, advancing and testing the software, conducting non-advocate reviews and engaging regulators and customers worldwide as we proceed to final certification,” Mr. Muilenburg said. “We’re also finalizing new pilot training courses and supplementary educational material for our global Max customers.”"
1364,Boeing is now under pressure from some airlines to compensate them for the cost of the grounded jets. Norwegian Air’s chief executive said previously that he expected Boeing to “take this bill.”
1365,"The airline Garuda Indonesia asked to cancel an order for 49 Max planes last month. And on Friday, Bloomberg reported that Ethiopian Airlines was reconsidering its order for 25 additional Max planes because of the “stigma” surrounding the aircraft."
1366,"“We may reach the decision: Look, we just had a very tragic accident a few weeks ago, and customers still have the accident in their mind,” Tewolde GebreMariam, chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, told Bloomberg. “So it will be a hard sell for us to convince our customers.”"
1367,"Though the airlines have mostly been able to manage the grounding of the Max so far, the credit agency Fitch Ratings said in a note on Friday that the impacts may begin to ripple across Asia in the coming weeks as seasonal air travel picked up."
1368,"“If there is a delay in the delivery schedule of the 737 Max jets by Boeing, affected airlines may choose to either scale back their expansion plans to strengthen their balance sheets or continue to grow by leasing aircraft at increased rates,” Fitch said."
1369,"Boeing is also facing growing pressure from Washington. The Justice Department and the Transportation Department’s inspector general are investigating the design, manufacturing and certification of the Max. Lawmakers have raised questions about Boeing’s close relationship with the F.A.A., which in recent years has given aircraft makers more authority to certify their own products."
1370,"Update: On Tuesday, Britain, Australia, Germany, Singapore, Malaysia and Oman banned all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes from their airspaces. Read more live coverage on the crash and its aftermath here."
1371,"The Ethiopian Airlines plane crash that killed 157 people on Sunday has rattled travelers around the world. Just six months ago, the same model of airplane — a Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by Lion Air — crashed off Indonesia and killed all 189 onboard."
1372,"While the cause of Sunday’s tragedy remains undetermined, and the investigation into the Lion Air accident is ongoing, several circumstances of these two crashes are similar. "
1373,"The 200-seat Boeing 737 Max 8 has been a popular plane since it came on the market in 2017, with more than 4,000 planes ordered within the first six months. The plane sold quickly based on features that passengers crave — a quieter cabin, more legroom — and bottom-line benefits to airlines, like fuel efficiencies. The plane’s entry into the market seemed like the rare win-win for both passengers and airlines. At the time of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, nearly 350 Boeing 737 Max 8s were in operation around the world, including in the United States, on routes across the country: Miami to Los Angeles, Houston to Denver, San Francisco to Portland. "
1374,"In the wake of the Ethiopian crash, more than a dozen airlines around the world said they would ground their 737 Max 8 planes. But at least 12 other carriers, including American Airlines and Southwest Airlines continued to fly them on Monday."
1375,"Alicia Winnett and her husband had planned to fly Air Canada from Vancouver to Calgary on Friday, and she contacted the airline, via Twitter, after hearing about Sunday’s plane crash."
1376,"The airline confirmed that her flight is scheduled to be on the Boeing 737 Max 8, she said adding that the airline told her that the Max 8s “have a great safety, reliability and customer satisfaction rating.”"
1377,"“How could they say that a Boeing 737 Max 8 has a great safety record when two brand-new planes have tragically crashed within five months of each other in a seemingly similar manner,” Ms. Winnett wrote in an email."
1378,"Ms. Winnett said she is hoping to switch to a later flight on an Airbus 320, although she said Air Canada had told her that was not possible. “I just cannot sit on a Boeing 737 Max 8 with confidence,” she said. "
1379,"To help travelers understand how to determine what plane they are scheduled to fly on, and their rights if they decide they do not want to board a Boeing 737 Max 8, we talked to airlines, passenger advocates and airline experts: "
1380,"With 34 planes in operation, Southwest Airlines is the airline with the largest number of Boeing 737 Max 8s in the world. Air Canada and American Airlines each have 24. United Airlines does not operate any Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, but it does fly the 737 Max 9. Delta Air Lines does not fly any 737 Max planes."
1381,"The Federal Aviation Administration tweeted on Sunday that it was “closely monitoring” developments in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, and on Monday, stressed its assurance that the 737 Max suite of planes were airworthy. "
1382,"“If we identify an issue that affects safety, the F.A.A. will take immediate and appropriate action,” the agency statement said."
1383,"For most travelers, the information about their plane type is available at the time of booking, either during the seat-selection process or elsewhere online."
1384,"Experienced travelers — and especially those who frequently book longer flights — often head to FlightStats.com or SeatGuru.com, to determine their planes. "
1385,"Even if passengers determine which type of plane they are booked on, airlines might change planes at the last minute, as required by logistics or a change of weather. "
1386,"Henrik Zillmer, the chief executive of AirHelp, a company that helps travelers make claims against airlines, thinks passengers are probably out of luck. "
1387,"“Travelers can cancel their flights, but would not be eligible to claim compensation if they decide to do so,” he said. “They do not have a right to compensation or reimbursement for tickets purchased as it is technically their decision to cancel.”"
1388,"If, however, you are booked on a flight with an airline that has grounded its Boeing 737 Max 8 planes, Mr. Zillmer believes you will probably be refunded your fare. "
1389,"“Since this situation would be a result of mechanical issues and therefore the airline’s own fault, travelers may be eligible to claim compensation,” he said. "
1390,"Critically, though, what compensation is due and the laws that protect passengers depend on the departure airport and the home country of the airline. "
1391,"If you are on a flight in or out of the European Union, or operated by a European Union-based airline, Mr. Zillmer notes that E.U. regulations may entitle you to compensation of up to “$700 per person.” "
1392,"But depending on where you are, there may not be a different plane operating on the same route, limiting your options. "
1393,"Paul Hudson, the president of Flyers Rights, a passenger advocacy group, says even insurance might not help in these circumstances. "
1394,"“Insurance would probably protect against government or airline action grounding delays, but not passenger election to change flights,” he said. "
1395,"Julie Loffredi, the manager of media relations for InsureMyTrip.com, a travel insurance comparison site, said that “fear” is usually not a good enough reason for insurers to pay compensation to travelers who cancel their flights. "
1396,"“With traditional, standard travel insurance you wouldn’t be able to cancel and get your money back out of fear,” she said. "
1397,"However, since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, more fliers have purchased coverage that allows for any cancellation, whatever the reason. "
1398,"Because the F.A.A. has not grounded the planes, carriers are following their normal policies for passengers who wish to change their travel plans. American Airlines charges a change fee, as does Air Canada. Southwest Airlines does not charge change fees. Passengers may, however, need to pay any difference in fare price. "
1399,"Cayman Airways in the Cayman Islands has grounded its two Boeing 737 Max 8 planes. Ethiopian Airlines has grounded its remaining four. The Civil Aviation Administration of China grounded all 97 of the country’s domestic Boeing 737 Max 8s. Indonesia followed suit, as have other carriers. "
1400,"Southwest Airlines representative Brian Parrish said via email that the airline has been in contact with Boeing and is following the investigation. “We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of our entire fleet of more than 750 Boeing 737 aircraft,” he added. “We don’t have any changes planned to 737 Max operations.”"
1401,"A United Airlines representative, Rachael Rivas, clarified that although United does not have any Max 8 planes in its fleet, it does have other planes from the Boeing 737 Max series. “We have made clear that the Boeing 737 Max aircraft is safe and that our pilots are properly trained to fly the Max aircraft safely,” she added."
1402,"Air Canada is monitoring the situation and has continued to operate its normal schedule, said spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick in an emailed statement. "
1403,"“We have extensive analytical data supporting the safety of these aircraft, which have also performed excellently from reliability and customer satisfaction perspectives,” he wrote. "
1404,American Airlines had not responded to a request for comment.
1405,"John L. Dorman, Kristin Hussey, Tariro Mzezewa and Zach Wichter contributed reporting."
1406,"A Boeing 737 Max 8 plane being flown by Southwest Airlines made an emergency landing in Orlando on Tuesday afternoon after reporting an engine problem shortly after taking off, the airline said."
1407,"The plane — the same type that crashed in Ethiopia earlier this month and in Indonesia in October — had a two-person flight crew but no passengers on board. It was being flown to California for “short-term storage” after the United States ordered the grounding of all 737 Max planes following the two crashes, which killed hundreds of people."
1408,"The engine problem was unrelated to an automatic system on the plane designed to help it avoid stalling, which is being investigated in connection with the two crashes."
1409,"“The crew followed protocol and safely landed back at the airport,” Southwest said."
1410,"The Max 737, Boeing’s best-selling plane, has come under intense scrutiny after the two deadly crashes."
1411,"In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia. It was the first fatal accident involving a 737 Max. One hundred and eighty nine people died."
1412,"On March 10, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, involving the same Max jet model, also crashed minutes after takeoff, killing all 157 people on board."
1413,The Federal Aviation Administration said it was investigating Tuesday’s emergency landing.
1414,Pilots start some new Boeing planes by turning a knob and flipping two switches.
1415,"The Boeing 737 Max, the newest passenger jet on the market, works differently. Pilots follow roughly the same seven steps used on the first 737 nearly 52 years ago: Shut off the cabin’s air-conditioning, redirect the air flow, switch on the engine, start the flow of fuel, revert the air flow, turn back on the air conditioning, and turn on a generator."
1416,"The 737 Max is a legacy of its past, built on decades-old systems, many that date back to the original version. The strategy, to keep updating the plane rather than starting from scratch, offered competitive advantages. Pilots were comfortable flying it, while airlines didn’t have to invest in costly new training for their pilots and mechanics. For Boeing, it was also faster and cheaper to redesign and recertify than starting anew."
1417,"But the strategy has now left the company in crisis, following two deadly crashes in less than five months. The Max stretched the 737 design, creating a patchwork plane that left pilots without some safety features that could be important in a crisis — ones that have been offered for years on other planes. It is the only modern Boeing jet without an electronic alert system that explains what is malfunctioning and how to resolve it. Instead pilots have to check a manual."
1418,"The Max also required makeshift solutions to keep the plane flying like its ancestors, workarounds that may have compromised safety. While the findings aren’t final, investigators suspect that one workaround, an anti-stall system designed to compensate for the larger engines, was central to the crash last month in Ethiopia and an earlier one in Indonesia."
1419,"The Max “ain’t your father’s Buick,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilots’ union who has flown the 737 for a decade. He added that “it’s not lost on us that the foundation of this aircraft is from the ’60s.”"
1420,"[Boeing was “go, go, go” to beat Airbus with the 737 Max.]"
1421,"The Max, Boeing’s best-selling model, with more than 5,000 orders, is suddenly a reputational hazard. It could be weeks or months before regulators around the world lift their ban on the plane, after Boeing’s expected software fix was delayed. Southwest Airlines and American Airlines have canceled some flights through May because of the Max grounding."
1422,"The company has slowed production of the plane, putting pressure on its profits, and some buyers are reconsidering their orders. Shares of the company fell over 4 percent on Monday, and are down 11 percent since the Ethiopia crash."
1423,"“It was state of the art at the time, but that was 50 years ago,” said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing engineer who helped design the Max’s cockpit. “It’s not a good airplane for the current environment.”"
1424,"The 737 has long been a reliable aircraft, flying for decades with relatively few issues. Gordon Johndroe, a Boeing spokesman, defended the development of the Max, saying that airlines wanted an updated 737 over a new single-aisle plane and that pilots were involved in its design."
1425,"“Listening to pilots is an important aspect of our work. Their experienced input is front-and-center in our mind when we develop airplanes,” he said in a statement. “We share a common priority — safety — and we listen carefully to their feedback.” He added that American regulators approved the plane under the same standards they used with previous aircraft."
1426,[Boeing announced that it was going to cut production of the 737 Max.]
1427,"Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said in a statement on Friday that the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia appeared to have been caused by the Max’s new anti-stall system. “We have the responsibility to eliminate this risk, and we know how to do it,” he said."
1428,"At a factory near Seattle on Jan. 17, 1967, flight attendants christened the first Boeing 737, smashing champagne bottles over its wing. Boeing pitched the plane as a smaller alternative to its larger jets, earning it the nickname the “Baby Boeing.”"
1429,"Early on, sales lagged Boeing’s biggest competitor, McDonnell Douglas. In 1972, Boeing had delivered just 14 of the jets, and it considered selling the program to a Japanese manufacturer, said Peter Morton, the 737 marketing manager in the early 1970s. “We had to decide if we were going to end it, or invest in it,” Mr. Morton said."
1430,"Ultimately, Boeing invested. The 737 eventually began to sell, bolstered by airline deregulation in 1978. Six years later, Boeing updated the 737 with its “classic” series, followed by the “next generation” in 1997, and the Max in 2017. Now nearly one in every three domestic flights in the United States is on a 737, more than any other line of aircraft."
1431,"Each of the three redesigns came with a new engine, updates to the cabin and other changes. But Boeing avoided overhauling the jet in order to appease airlines, according to current and former Boeing executives, pilots and engineers, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the open investigations. Airlines wanted new 737s to match their predecessors so pilots could skip expensive training in flight simulators and easily transition to new jets."
1432,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
1433,Boeing’s strategy worked. The Federal Aviation Administration never required simulator training for pilots switching from one 737 to the next.
1434,"“Airlines don’t want Boeing to give them a fancy new product if it requires them to retrain their pilots,” said Matthew Menza, a former 737 Max test pilot for Boeing. “So you iterate off a design that’s 50 years old. The old adage is: If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.”"
1435,"It did require engineering ingenuity, to ensure a decades-old jet handled mostly the same. In doing so, some of the jet’s one-time selling points became challenges."
1436,"For instance, in the early years of the 737, jet travel was rapidly expanding across the world. The plane’s low-slung frame was a benefit for airlines and airports in developing countries. Workers there could load bags by hand without a conveyor belt and maintain the engines without a lift, Mr. Morton said. In the decades that followed, the low frame repeatedly complicated efforts to fit bigger engines under the wing."
1437,"By 2011, Boeing executives were starting to question whether the 737 design had run its course. The company wanted to create an entirely new single-aisle jet. Then Boeing’s rival Airbus added a new fuel-efficient engine to its line of single-aisle planes, the A320, and Boeing quickly decided to update the jet again."
1438,"“We all rolled our eyes. The idea that, ‘Here we go. The 737 again,’” said Mr. Ludtke, the former 737 Max cockpit designer who spent 19 years at Boeing."
1439,"“Nobody was quite perhaps willing to say it was unsafe, but we really felt like the limits were being bumped up against,” he added."
1440,"Some engineers were frustrated they would have to again spend years updating the same jet, taking care to limit any changes, instead of starting fresh and incorporating significant technological advances, the current and former engineers and pilots said. The Max still has roughly the original layout of the cockpit and the hydraulic system of cables and pulleys to control the plane, which aren’t used in modern designs. The flight-control computers have roughly the processing power of 1990s home computers. A Boeing spokesman said the aircraft was designed with an appropriate level of technology to ensure safety."
1441,"When engineers did make changes, it sometimes created knock-on effects for how the plane handled, forcing Boeing to get creative. The company added a new system that moves plates on the wing in part to reduce stress on the plane from its added weight. Boeing recreated the decades-old physical gauges on digital screens."
1442,"As Boeing pushed its engineers to figure out how to accommodate bigger, more fuel-efficient engines, height was again an issue. Simply lengthening the landing gear to make the plane taller could have violated rules for exiting the plane in an emergency."
1443,"Instead, engineers were able to add just a few inches to the front landing gear and shift the engines farther forward on the wing. The engines fit, but the Max sat at a slightly uneven angle when parked."
1444,"While that design solved one problem, it created another. The larger size and new location of the engines gave the Max the tendency to tilt up during certain flight maneuvers, potentially to a dangerous angle."
1445,"To compensate, Boeing engineers created the automated anti-stall system, called MCAS, that pushed the jet’s nose down if it was lifting too high. The software was intended to operate in the background so that the Max flew just like its predecessor. Boeing didn’t mention the system in its training materials for the Max."
1446,"Boeing also designed the system to rely on a single sensor — a rarity in aviation, where redundancy is common. Several former Boeing engineers who were not directly involved in the system’s design said their colleagues most likely opted for such an approach since relying on two sensors could still create issues. If one of two sensors malfunctioned, the system could struggle to know which was right."
1447,"Airbus addressed this potential problem on some of its planes by installing three or more such sensors. Former Max engineers, including one who worked on the sensors, said adding a third sensor to the Max was a nonstarter. Previous 737s, they said, had used two and managers wanted to limit changes."
1448,"“They wanted to A, save money and B, to minimize the certification and flight-test costs,” said Mike Renzelmann, an engineer who worked on the Max’s flight controls. “Any changes are going to require recertification.” Mr. Renzelmann was not involved in discussions about the sensors."
1449,The Max also lacked more modern safety features.
1450,"Most new Boeing jets have electronic systems that take pilots through their preflight checklists, ensuring they don’t skip a step and potentially miss a malfunctioning part. On the Max, pilots still complete those checklists manually in a book."
1451,A second electronic system found on other Boeing jets also alerts pilots to unusual or hazardous situations during flight and lays out recommended steps to resolve them.
1452,"On 737s, a light typically indicates the problem and pilots have to flip through their paper manuals to find next steps. In the doomed Indonesia flight, as the Lion Air pilots struggled with MCAS for control, the pilots consulted the manual moments before the jet plummeted into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people aboard."
1453,"“Meanwhile, I’m flying the jet,” said Mr. Tajer, the American Airlines 737 captain. “Versus, pop, it’s on your screen. It tells you, This is the problem and here’s the checklist that’s recommended.”"
1454,"Boeing decided against adding it to the Max because it could have prompted regulators to require new pilot training, according to two former Boeing employees involved in the decision."
1455,"The Max also runs on a complex web of cables and pulleys that, when pilots pull back on the controls, transfer that movement to the tail. By comparison, Airbus jets and Boeing’s more modern aircraft, such as the 777 and 787, are “fly-by-wire,” meaning pilots’ movement of the flight controls is fed to a computer that directs the plane. The design allows for far more automation, including systems that prevent the jet from entering dangerous situations, such as flying too fast or too low. Some 737 pilots said they preferred the cable-and-pulley system to fly-by-wire because they believed it gave them more control."
1456,"In the recent crashes, investigators believe the MCAS malfunctioned and moved a tail flap called the stabilizer, tilting the plane toward the ground. On the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight, the pilots tried to combat the system by cutting power to the stabilizer’s motor, according to the preliminary crash report."
1457,"Once the power was cut, the pilots tried to regain control manually by turning a wheel next to their seat. The 737 is the last modern Boeing jet that uses a manual wheel as its backup system. But Boeing has long known that turning the wheel is difficult at high speeds, and may have required two pilots to work together."
1458,"In the final moments of the Ethiopian Airlines flight, the first officer said the method wasn’t working, according to the preliminary crash report. About 1 minute and 49 seconds later, the plane crashed, killing 157 people."
1459,Unease about one of Boeing’s most popular jets mounted on Tuesday after the deadly crashes of two 737 Max 8 aircraft in under five months.
1460,"European authorities banned the planes, one of the most important aviation regulators in the world to do so. The decision followed earlier moves by aviation regulators in China, Indonesia, Singapore and Australia, as well as carriers in Africa, South America, and North America, to ground the jets."
1461,"With the decision by European authorities, roughly two-thirds of the 737 Max 8 aircraft in the world have been pulled from use since an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed on Sunday, killing 157 people."
1462,One country holding back: the United States.
1463,[The F.A.A. stood firm on its decision to keep Boeing’s 737 Max planes flying.]
1464,"Such groundings are rare in the United States. The Federal Aviation Administration, the American regulator, is typically hesitant to ground an entire fleet without concrete findings of an inherent design or manufacturing problem."
1465,"Early Tuesday, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, spoke to President Trump on the phone and made the case that the 737 Max planes should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation."
1466,"The investigation of the Ethiopia crash is in its initial phases, as the authorities analyze the plane’s flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders."
1467,"The F.A.A. said on Monday that it would examine the data from the Ethiopia crash and act as necessary. But the agency added that it was too early to make a determination about what caused the fatal accident and cautioned against making comparisons to an October crash in Indonesia involving a Lion Air flight. On Tuesday, Canada’s transport minister affirmed his position that Canada would not ground the planes until investigators determined the cause of the crash on Sunday."
1468,"Boeing echoed the F.A.A.’s warning, with the company saying it was working closely with the American and Ethiopian authorities to investigate the cause of the crash. Boeing said it was committed to ensuring the safety and quality of its planes."
1469,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
1470,"Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, the two carriers in the United States that use the 737 Max 8, also said they remained confident in the safety of the planes and planned to continue flying them. Both airlines have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the jets and found no reason to ground them."
1471,"The Canadian transport minister, Marc Garneau, has indicated that Canada will not ground the plane until American regulators have determined the cause of the latest crash. But he also opened the possibility for a change in thinking."
1472,"“I’ve canceled all my meetings and public events today in order to meet with my Civil Aviation Expert Panel,” he said on Twitter. “All evidence is being evaluated in real time and we’re considering all potential actions.”"
1473,[Read our continuing coverage of developments related to Sunday’s crash.]
1474,One overarching concern among regulators around the world is whether the system suspected of playing a role in the Lion Air crash had contributed to the latest accident.
1475,"Indonesian and American authorities have raised the possibility that a new system in the 737 Max — and pilots’ lack of familiarity with it — could have contributed to the Lion Air Flight 610 crash. The plane’s so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as MCAS, was a new version that could automatically change the aircraft’s trajectory."
1476,"The similarities, with both planes crashing minutes after erratic takeoffs, are driving authorities to order the groundings. Despite Boeing and American authorities standing behind the plane, regulators and carriers elsewhere are opting to ban the plane in the absence of clear information."
1477,Experience is one factor behind regulators’ decisions.
1478,Regulatory standards for pilot experience vary widely from country to country. They also differ considerably from airline to airline within countries.
1479,"Pilots in the rapidly expanding aviation markets of East Asia and in developing countries tend to be much less experienced than their counterparts in the West. Li Jian, the deputy director of China’s Civil Aviation Administration, said the agency — the first to ground the 737 Max after the accident Sunday — worried about the challenges that could face pilots if an aircraft had unexpected difficulties."
1480,"The biggest worry involves possibly inaccurate signals from key flight instruments, Mr. Li said on Monday. Many pilots with less experience depend heavily on automatic systems to help them fly planes, and such systems in turn need reliable data."
1481,"“We are facing uncertainties about whether pilots have the courage or the capability to fly” if an aircraft has difficulties, Mr. Li said."
1482,"“When a pilot is operating manually, if he receives inaccurate signals, which has happened multiple times, it will bring trouble,” Mr. Li said. “As a government supervision department, we should make sure all problem are solved before we allow aircraft to be used.”"
1483,Mr. Li did not elaborate on when or where the inaccurate signals might have occurred on multiple occasions. The aviation regulator did not respond on Tuesday to a faxed request for comment.
1484,Some carriers are bowing to pressure from passengers.
1485,"Comair, a South African airline company, initially said it would continue to fly the plane. But, in the face of travelers’ concerns, it said Monday that it was “removing the 737 Max 8 from its flight schedule.”"
1486,"“The safety and confidence of our customers and crew is always our priority,” Wrenelle Stander, executive director of Comair’s airline division, said in a statement."
1487,"In the United States, calls to ban the plane are mounting."
1488,"Several senators, including Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, and the Democrats Dianne Feinstein of California, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called on the F.A.A. to ground the Boeing planes until the investigation into the Ethiopia crash is completed."
1489,"“The world has now witnessed the second tragic crash of one of these planes in less than six months. While we do not know the causes of these crashes, serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training in order to save money,” Ms. Warren, who is running for president, said in a statement. “Today, immediately, the F.A.A. needs to get these planes out of the sky.”"
1490,"Mr. Trump jumped into the fray on Tuesday morning, posting Twitter messages deploring what he described as the technological complexities of modern commercial aircraft. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT,” Mr. Trump said. Much of what he asserted, however, was misleading or lacked context, aviation experts said."
1491,"The Boeing chief, Mr. Muilenburg, in his conversation with the president reiterated that the plane was safe, outlining the company’s position. He also updated Mr. Trump on the status of the 737 Max models. The call came after the Mr. Trump’s tweets, but was in the works the night before, according to one of the people."
1492,"Mr. Muilenburg has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, although it has sometimes been uneasy."
1493,"Shortly after he was elected president, Mr. Trump assailed Boeing for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes that serve as mobile command centers for the president."
1494,"The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter a month after winning the election but before he took office. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over."
1495,"“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate. Weeks after the conversation, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help finance President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2013. "
1496,"Black box data from a doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight suggests the crash was caused by a faulty sensor that erroneously activated an automated system on the Boeing 737 Max, a series of events suspected in an Indonesian disaster involving the same jet last year."
1497,"Data from a vane-like device, called the angle-of-attack sensor, incorrectly activated the computer-controlled system, according to several people who have been briefed on the contents of the black box in Ethiopia. The system, known as MCAS, is believed to have pushed the front of the plane down, leading to an irrecoverable nose-dive that killed all 157 people aboard."
1498,"The black box, also called the flight data recorder, contains information on dozens of systems aboard the plane. The black boxes on the jets, Boeing’s latest generation of the 737, survived the crashes, allowing investigators to begin piecing together what caused the disasters. Both investigations are continuing, and no final determinations have been made."
1499,"The new connections between the two crashes point to a potential systemic problem with the aircraft, adding to the pressure on Boeing. The company already faces scrutiny for its role in the design and certification of the plane. The Federal Aviation Administration delegated significant responsibility and oversight to Boeing."
1500,"The company is now on the defensive, as investigators, lawmakers and prosecutors try to determine what went wrong. The Justice Department is investigating the jet’s development, while the Transportation Department’s inspector general is looking into the certification process. The inspector general has issued a subpoena to at least one former Boeing engineer for documents related to the 737 Max, according to a person familiar with the investigation."
1501,"MCAS was originally designed to activate based on data from a single angle-of-attack sensor, which measures the level of the jet’s nose relative to oncoming air. Air-safety experts, as well as former employees at Boeing and the supplier that made the sensor, have expressed concern that the system had this single point of failure, a rarity in aviation."
1502,"“That’s not a good engineering system,” said Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical engineer and a former fighter pilot for the Swedish Air Force. “That’s where they screwed up royally.”"
1503,Here’s why a system designed to stabilize the 737 Max may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.
1504,"In a tacit acknowledgment that the initial design was flawed, Boeing this week unveiled a software update that specifically addresses the concerns about MCAS and the sensors. American authorities will have to approve the fix before the planes start flying again."
1505,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
1506,"Regulators around the world grounded the Max this month, and airlines are not expected to use them soon. On Friday, Southwest Airlines said it planned its flight schedule through May without its 34 Max jets."
1507,"Boeing said it could not comment on the black box findings until investigators released their official report, per international aviation agreements. Rosemount Aerospace, a subsidiary of the industrial giant United Technologies based in Burnsville, Minn., made the sensor. A United Technologies spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
1508,"Angle-of-attack sensors are highly reliable and have been used on passenger jets for years, but like any aircraft component, they can fail. Given that, former Boeing and Rosemount engineers said it was surprising that Boeing would allow a single sensor to activate a crucial system that pushes the aircraft toward the ground."
1509,"The sensors, which are effectively wind vanes on the jet’s nose, have malfunctioned in the past, for a variety of reasons, including bird strikes, according to the former engineers. They have also been broken by jetways that attach to the plane for passengers to board and exit the plane."
1510,"The sensors can also malfunction if water pools around them and then freezes when the plane reaches a certain altitude, the engineers said. The sensors have built-in heaters to prevent freezing at such high altitudes, but they sometimes do not work quickly enough or can fail outright."
1511,"“Generally speaking, aviation components are highly reliable,” said Mel McIntyre, a retired Boeing engineer who worked with such sensors for years. “But everything can fail. Nothing is invincible.” Mr. McIntyre declined to comment further on any specifics of the 737 Max."
1512,"Investigators of the Indonesia crash in October, who have produced a preliminary report and released some of the information from the black box, found one sensor produced a reading that was at least 20 degrees different from the other as the plane began its ascent. Based on the bad data, MCAS was activated, erroneously pushing the nose of the plane down."
1513,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
1514,"The pilots on the Indonesian flight tried repeatedly to override the system. But after about 12 minutes, they lost their battle."
1515,"None of the people briefed on the contents of the Ethiopian Airlines black box said whether its data indicated that the pilots tried to counteract the system. But the plane in Ethiopia had the same bouncing, bobbing trajectory seen in the Indonesian flight as the pilots tried to save the plane, according to publicly available flight data."
1516,"Air traffic controllers in Ethiopia also said they saw the oscillating trajectory before the plane crashed on March 10. The pilot radioed to them that he was having trouble controlling the aircraft, but did not give details on what systems were causing problems."
1517,"Boeing has defended the 737 Max, its best-selling jet, which is expected to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years. And most airlines, which have ordered thousands of planes, have stood by the manufacturer."
1518,"“The 737 is a safe airplane,” Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president for product strategy, said at a briefing on Wednesday. “And the 737 Max builds on that tremendous history of safety that we’ve seen through the last almost 50 years.”"
1519,But Boeing’s coming software fix specifically addresses the suspected problems that may have led to the two deadly crashes.
1520,"The F.A.A. classifies potential problems with aircraft at different levels of risk. The agency did not classify a failure of MCAS as the highest risk level, meaning Boeing was allowed to design the system to rely on data from a single sensor, according a company official with knowledge of the matter. After the crashes, the company wanted to make the system more robust and rely less on pilots to intervene if it failed, the official said."
1521,"The software fix will make the system rely on two sensors, rather than just one. The update will also limit MCAS, in most cases, from engaging more than once, a concern in the Lion Air crash in Indonesia. And it would prevent the system from pushing the plane’s nose down more than a pilot could counteract by pulling up on the controls."
1522,"“The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into Max gives us complete confidence that the changes that we’re making will address any of these accidents,” Mr. Sinnett, the Boeing vice president, said on Wednesday."

1524,"The A and B groups had already boarded Jesse Damiani’s Southwest Airlines flight, to New Orleans from Austin-Bergstrom International Airport, when President Trump announced that Boeing’s 737 Max plane was grounded. "
1525,"“We were waiting for groups C and D to board when we got news,” he said in a phone interview. "
1526,"The United States had been one of the few nations to allow the aircraft to fly after two planes of the same model were involved in deadly crashes in the past five months, including an Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday. Forty-two other nations had grounded the planes, as well as airlines around the world. "
1527,"In a statement issued shortly after Mr. Trump’s announcement, the Federal Aviation Administration said that the decision was made using evidence found at the site of Sunday’s plane crash, as well as satellite data that was refined on Wednesday. "
1528,"Domestically, travelers on specific routes offered by Southwest Airlines, American Airlines and United Airlines will be affected by this change. Air Canada and WestJet also fly Max 8 planes but had grounded them earlier on Wednesday. "
1529,"For passengers like Mr. Damiani, 29, the change of face by U.S. authorities meant they needed to change plans. He tried rescheduling his flight online, but was redirected to call the customer service line. When he called the line, he was told there was a 28-minute callback time, so he tried to get help at his gate."
1530,"“Every desk was solidly 50 people deep,” he said. “This was already a busy day with SXSW.”"
1531,He is now flying to New Orleans on a 7:15 p.m. flight with a layover in Orlando. 
1532,Here’s what passengers need to know about the grounding. 
1533,"The Ethiopian Airlines plane crash that killed 157 people on Sunday rattled travelers, lawmakers and aviation officials around the world. Just five months ago, the same model of airplane — a Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by Lion Air — crashed off Indonesia and killed all 189 people onboard."
1534,"While the cause of Sunday’s tragedy remains undetermined, and the investigation into the Lion Air accident is ongoing, several circumstances surrounding these two crashes are similar. "
1535,"The 200-seat Boeing 737 Max 8 has been a popular plane since it came on the market in 2017, with more than 4,000 planes ordered within the first six months. The plane sold quickly, based on features that passengers crave — a quieter cabin, more legroom — and bottom-line benefits to airlines, including fuel efficiency. At the time of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, nearly 350 Boeing 737 Max 8s were in operation around the world, including on routes across the United States: Miami to Los Angeles, Houston to Denver, San Francisco to Portland. "
1536,"With 34 planes in operation, Southwest Airlines has the largest number of Boeing 737 Max 8s in the world. Air Canada and American Airlines each have 24. United Airlines does not operate any Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft, but it does fly the 737 Max 9 and had 14 of the planes. WestJet, another Canadian carrier, flies 13 Max planes, about eight percent of its 162-plane fleet. "
1537,"Because of Wednesday’s ban, all of the 737 Max planes will be grounded."
1538,"For some airlines, the number of routes affected is minimal. On average, American operates 85 flights per day on the Max 8, out of 6,700 departures throughout its system. Southwest Airlines flies 34 Max 8s out of more than 750 total planes, which are used on 4 percent of its flights. A spokesman for Southwest said that the airline had canceled 5 Max flights out of 4,100 flights today as most passengers were moved to other aircraft. “We routinely have available aircraft in our fleet,” he said. "
1539,"In a statement issued on Twitter, United Airlines said that its fleet of 14 Maxs account for roughly 40 flights a day, adding that “through a combination of spare aircraft and rebooking customers, we do not anticipate a significant operational impact.” "
1540,"Air Canada in contrast, told its passengers to brace for possible difficulties. “Given the magnitude of our 737 Max operations which on average carry nine to twelve thousand customers per day, customers can expect delays in rebooking and in reaching Air Canada call centres and we appreciate our customers’ patience,” the company said in a statement. "
1541,It advised customers to check their flights on the airline website before going to the airport. 
1542,"United told affected customers not to cancel their flights. “Customers do not need to cancel and rebook as we will swap aircraft or automatically rebook you,” the statement said. “If you require further assistance, please direct message us here.”"
1543,"American Airlines also put out a statement, saying, “Our teams will make every effort to rebook customers as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” On social media, the airline was telling passengers that it was working to reschedule everyone who had been booked on its 24 planes. It was also advising people to go to its normal refund page. "
1544,"Southwest issued a statement that said: “Our goal is to operate our schedule with every available aircraft in our fleet to meet our customers' expectations during the busy spring travel season. Additionally, to support our customers, Southwest is offering flexible rebooking policies.” "
1545,"While Southwest does not charge a change fee, it does usually require passengers to make up any difference in fares, but it is waiving that requirement for passengers on canceled Max flights who rebook within 14 days of their original date of travel on the same route. "
1546,John L. Dorman and John Surico contributed reporting.
1547,Update on March 12: A number of countries and airlines have now banned or grounded the Boeing 737 Max 8. Read more here. 
1548,"When an airplane carrying at least 150 people crashed in Ethiopia on Sunday, killing all aboard, it was the second time in less than six months that this particular plane model was involved in a catastrophic accident."
1549,"The plane, a Boeing 737 Max 8, was the same model that crashed in Indonesia in October, killing 189 people."
1550,"In both cases, brand-new planes faltered minutes after takeoff and plunged into a deadly descent, leaving no survivors."
1551,"The investigation into both cases is continuing, but the latest crash renewed questions about the safety of the 737 Max, which Boeing unveiled in 2017 and sold as a fuel-efficient, technologically advanced upgrade to its popular 737."
1552,"The 737 Max became the fastest-selling plane in Boeing history, the company said on its website, and is used by airlines around the world."
1553,Here’s what we know so far about the plane involved.
1554,"It is the latest generation of the Boeing 737, a kind of aircraft that’s been flying since the 1960s. There are four kinds of Maxes in the fleet, numbered 7, 8, 9 and 10. The 8 series, which was involved in the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, has been flying the longest."
1555,"The 737 Max is mostly used for short- and medium-distance flights, but a few airlines fly it between Northern Europe and the East Coast of the United States. It is more fuel efficient and has a longer range than earlier versions of the 737."
1556,"The flight on Sunday was traveling from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, to Nairobi, Kenya."
1557,It was too soon to tell on Sunday whether the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash were the same as or similar to those of the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last year.
1558,"But there are some initial similarities: On Sunday, the flight lost contact about six minutes after takeoff. The pilot had been given clearance to return to the airport in Addis Ababa, according to Ethiopian Airlines, which operated the flight. But the plane went down near Bishoftu, about 35 miles southeast of Addis Ababa."
1559,The crash last year also involved a plane that went down minutes after takeoff and after the crew requested permission to return to the airport.
1560,"In that case, investigations by the Indonesian and American aviation authorities determined that the Lion Air plane’s abrupt nose dive might have been caused by updated Boeing software that was meant to prevent a stall but that can send the plane into a fatal descent if the altitude and angle information being fed into the computer system is incorrect."
1561,"The change in the flight control system, which can override manual motions in the Max model, was not explained to pilots, according to some pilots’ unions."
1562,"After that crash, Boeing said that it was continuing “to evaluate the need for software or other changes as we learn more from the ongoing investigation.” It was unclear if the company had made any changes."
1563,"In a statement on Sunday, Boeing said it was “deeply saddened” to learn of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302."
1564,"“A Boeing technical team is prepared to provide technical assistance at the request and under the direction of the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board,” the company said."
1565,"In addition to Ethiopian Airlines, which has a reputation in Africa for having a newer fleet than other airlines, and Lion Air, an Indonesian low-cost airline with a long history of maintenance problems, many airlines around the world use this model."
1566,"In the United States, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines are all operators, using it on routes like Miami-New York and Dallas-Chicago. Other major carriers around the world include Aerolíneas Argentinas, Air China, Icelandair and LOT Polish Airlines."
1567,"As airlines responded to the news on Sunday, some offered assurances and said they were monitoring the results of the investigation. In a statement, Southwest Airlines, which has about 30 Max 8 planes and more than 750 total aircrafts made by Boeing, said, “We remain confident in the safety and airworthiness of our fleet.”"
1568,"The planes are still certified as airworthy by aviation’s governing bodies. But if you’re concerned, most airlines let you see the aircraft type when booking your travel online."
1569,"On Southwest’s website, for example, you can find what kind of plane will be used by clicking the flight number on the page where prices and flight times are displayed. You can also find what kind of plane is being used for your flight on seatguru.com."
1570,"The chief executive of Boeing backed down on Wednesday. He called President Trump to recommend that the United States temporarily take the company’s best-selling jet out of service, following two deadly crashes in less than five months. Hours later, the president announced that the plane had been grounded."
1571,"It was a stark reversal for Boeing, an industrial juggernaut that has enjoyed a decade of rapid growth and has deep ties in Washington. Just the day before, the chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, had urged the president to keep the plane flying, as regulators around the world banned the jet."
1572,"The plane, the 737 Max, was deeply rooted in the company’s psyche, a reflection of its engineering prowess and its enviable safety record. But it was also born out of necessity as the company competed aggressively with its European rival Airbus."
1573,"The stakes for Boeing are high, with 4,600 pending orders that promise to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars. All that is at risk as regulators and lawmakers begin to investigate what went wrong with the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight and an earlier one on Lion Air. Some carriers are already reconsidering their purchases."

1576,The aerospace giant and its ties to Washington are under scrutiny after a version of its best-selling plane was involved in two deadly accidents in five months.
1577,michael barbaro
1578,"From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets, it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots. Then, two of those jets crashed. It’s Tuesday, March 19."
1579,natalie kitroeff
1580,"The global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly. There are two big companies. There’s Boeing, which is American-owned, and there’s Airbus, a European rival."
1581,michael barbaro
1582,Natalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times.
1583,natalie kitroeff
1584,These two are always competing with each other. They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane. And they’re often competing for the same customers.
1585,[music]
1586,
1587,natalie kitroeff
1588,So in late 2010 —
1589,archived recording
1590,"We’re not redesigning the A320. It’s pretty damn good just the way it is. What we’re doing is offering new, more fuel-efficient engines on today’s airplane."
1591,natalie kitroeff
1592,"— Airbus announces that it is offering a new, fuel-efficient version of its best-selling A320 plane."
1593,archived recording
1594,"Well, an A320neo —"
1595,natalie kitroeff
1596,It’s going to be the A320neo.
1597,archived recording
1598,"It’s a new engine option offered on today’s A320 family of aircraft. And now they’re being offered with new, more fuel-efficient engines. We’re putting our money on re-engining the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft."
1599,natalie kitroeff
1600,"This amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing. Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs. And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money, Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment, where they have one main rival."
1601,michael barbaro
1602,So what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel-efficient jetliner?
1603,natalie kitroeff
1604,Boeing scrambles to respond quickly.
1605,archived recording
1606,[MUSIC] We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family.
1607,natalie kitroeff
1608,"And within months, the company comes up with an upgrade of its own."
1609,archived recording
1610,"Max efficiency, which leads to profitability, max reliability, and to the flying public, max passenger appeal."
1611,natalie kitroeff
1612,It’s going to be a fuel-efficient version of their 737 workhorse. It is going to have bigger engines. And it’s going to save airlines money on this fuel.
1613,archived recording
1614,The best single-aisle airplane in the world. [MUSIC]
1615,natalie kitroeff
1616,And they’re going to call it the 737 Max. And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible.
1617,michael barbaro
1618,Why?
1619,natalie kitroeff
1620,Part of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus. And they’re competing with them on every single cost item. And a plane is not just metal and technology. It’s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it.
1621,michael barbaro
1622,Hm.
1623,natalie kitroeff
1624,"If the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator, one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane, it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft. It’s incredibly expensive. So if Boeing were to say, we have this beautiful new jet, but it’s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires, the executives might pause on that. So as the company is manufacturing this plane, it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did."
1625,michael barbaro
1626,So that there is not a need for training.
1627,natalie kitroeff
1628,Exactly. And there’s a little bit of a problem.
1629,[music]
1630,
1631,natalie kitroeff
1632,"There is something that is fundamentally different about this plane. Its engines are bigger, and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings. And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane. So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances. And that can lead to a stall, which is a dangerous situation. So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force. So what it does is it comes up with this system, this software."
1633,michael barbaro
1634,And what does the new system do?
1635,natalie kitroeff
1636,"The new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose. And it pushes the nose down automatically. And it’s supposed to be working in the background, in a way that pilots don’t even notice, correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane. And it’s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did."
1637,michael barbaro
1638,"So Boeing thinks even though the engines are different, that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did. And from a pilot’s point of view, therefore, there would be no need for new training?"
1639,natalie kitroeff
1640,"Yes. Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model. And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed. In March 2017, the F.A.A. certified the plane. It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model. And regulators around the world followed suit. Two months later, Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle. And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists."
1641,michael barbaro
1642,Hmm. So they don’t even tell the pilots. They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don’t even need to know?
1643,natalie kitroeff
1644,Yes.
1645,[music]
1646,
1647,michael barbaro
1648,"So what happens next? This plane is certified, on the market. What happens?"
1649,archived recording
1650,"Well, it’s wheels up for Boeing’s new 737 Max."
1651,natalie kitroeff
1652,Orders come pouring in from across the globe.
1653,archived recording
1654,"Boeing says the Max 8 is the company’s fastest-selling plane in its history, with nearly 4,700 orders for more than 100 customers across the world."
1655,natalie kitroeff
1656,And carriers make this the best-selling Boeing jet ever.
1657,archived recording
1658,"100 737 Maxes expected to be sold to AerCap. That’s a lessor from the Netherlands. Also, Korean Airlines expected to order 30 of those."
1659,natalie kitroeff
1660,Pilots love it.
1661,archived recording
1662,It flew beautifully. Its engines were extremely quiet.
1663,natalie kitroeff
1664,It is a hit.
1665,archived recording 1
1666,"Still, take a look at shares of Boeing, which —"
1667,archived recording 2
1668,Are up! And up today!

1670,They’re enjoying a ton of success in the stock market.

1674,"Investors love them, customers love them — until October 29, 2018, when Lion Air Flight 610, a 737 Max carrying 189 people, takes off and, 12 minutes later, crashes into the Java Sea."
1675,archived recording
1676,"Three days after Lion Air Flight JT610 mysteriously disappeared before plummeting into the sea, there may be hope for answers."
1677,michael barbaro
1678,What do we learn about what went wrong on that flight?
1679,archived recording
1680,Military personnel have found one of the black boxes.
1681,natalie kitroeff
1682,So a picture begins to emerge of this flight that suggests that the pilot may be fighting with that system.
1683,archived recording
1684,"Flight data shows the on-board computers were pushing the plane’s nose down. Then the pilots aimed the nose higher. That happened 26 times, with the crew never following procedures to correct the problem."
1685,natalie kitroeff
1686,"So while the software is pushing the nose down, the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again, multiple times. That is the picture that begins to emerge. But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet."
1687,michael barbaro
1688,"So it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system, a self-correcting one that’s supposed to keep the nose from going up, that they don’t even know exists, right?"
1689,natalie kitroeff
1690,"That’s exactly right. And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading. So it was responding to bad data. And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again, despite the pilot’s best efforts to get the plane back on course."
1691,michael barbaro
1692,And eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system.
1693,natalie kitroeff
1694,"Eventually, the plane plunges into the sea, killing all 189 people on board."
1695,[music]
1696,
1697,michael barbaro
1698,"What, Natalie, is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn’t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information, the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash?"
1699,natalie kitroeff
1700,"Pilots are furious — livid, in fact — that they have not been informed that this thing even exists. So they have these meetings, in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful."
1701,michael barbaro
1702,"So I have to assume that these angry pilots, in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system, are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system."
1703,natalie kitroeff
1704,"No, they’re not. The F.A.A., Boeing, nobody is recommending more training on this system."
1705,michael barbaro
1706,Why not?
1707,natalie kitroeff
1708,"The American pilots that I’ve talked to, they believe that because they’ve been informed about the system, now that they know how it works, they are able to safely fly this plane. They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights. And they feel confident about flying the plane. This is a confidence that’s, in part, based on statistics and experience. There has been only one fatality on U.S. airlines in the last decade. Boeing has an enviable safety record. In many ways, they had good reason to be confident. And they’re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down. That’s going to come within the next several weeks. They will be informed of it. And they feel confident that that is enough."
1709,michael barbaro
1710,"O.K., so after this Lion Air crash, the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system. But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere. And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying?"
1711,natalie kitroeff
1712,Yes.
1713,archived recording 1
1714,"A jet has crashed, and the tragedy is being felt around the world."
1715,archived recording 2
1716,"U.S. aviation investigators and a technical team from Boeing are headed to Ethiopia tonight. That’s where a new 737 Max 8 jetliner crashed today, minutes after taking off from Addis Ababa."
1717,archived recording 3
1718,"Killing everyone on board, Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi, Kenya, when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff. The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members."
1719,natalie kitroeff
1720,"Immediately, it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash."
1721,archived recording 1
1722,"Preliminary data shows a, quote, “clear similarity” to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October."
1723,archived recording 2
1724,Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts.
1725,archived recording 3
1726,"What we now understand is what people had suspected, that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month."
1727,michael barbaro
1728,What are those similarities?
1729,natalie kitroeff
1730,"So the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems. So that was a first clue. The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was, up and down. The speeds are changing rapidly, suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system, again, with the pilot trying to pull the nose up, and the system pushing it down. Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down. We don’t know why. But again, it all points to this system being involved, potentially contributing to another tragedy."
1731,michael barbaro
1732,"And so what is the reaction this time, after the second crash of a 737 Max?"
1733,natalie kitroeff
1734,Boeing stands firm behind the plane. And American carriers are right there with them. But —
1735,archived recording
1736,China has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet.
1737,natalie kitroeff
1738,— regulators around the world seem a little less confident. The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max.
1739,archived recording
1740,More countries following China’s lead and grounding the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet.
1741,natalie kitroeff

1744,"European Aviation Safety Agency, they have banned flights of the 737 Max series, adding to similar groundings by China, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, the U.K., Singapore, New Zealand, France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Netherlands, Turkey. I could go on."
1745,natalie kitroeff
1746,— American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F.A.A. to ground these planes.
1747,archived recording (donald trump)
1748,"Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully, they’ll very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded."
1749,michael barbaro
1750,"All of this looks very bad for Boeing, obviously. And it seems to stem from this original motivation, as you described it, to avoid classifying this new energy-efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots, even though a very crucial part of the plane was different."
1751,natalie kitroeff
1752,"That’s right. This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process. Remember, this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus. It’s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States. There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The F.A.A. and Boeing work together to certify planes. The F.A.A. actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft."
1753,michael barbaro
1754,And is that basically industry practice? Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process?
1755,natalie kitroeff
1756,That’s exactly right.
1757,michael barbaro
1758,Hmm.
1759,natalie kitroeff
1760,"I mean, folks were talking about this, right? But nobody was kind of raising red flags. I mean, it wasn’t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works. But now there’s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months. And we’re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy."
1761,michael barbaro
1762,"Natalie, what do we know about the role that Boeing’s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max?"
1763,natalie kitroeff
1764,"We know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft. And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max. The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F.A.A. relying heavily on Boeing in this case, but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes."
1765,michael barbaro
1766,Hmm.
1767,natalie kitroeff
1768,"The F.A.A., like any federal agency, has a limited budget. And there’s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy. You can see why you would need a relationship, and one where there is a lot of information-sharing, right? Because the one side can’t employ as many people as Boeing does. And the other side has a ton of expertise. But is that relationship too close?"
1769,michael barbaro
1770,"Right. And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you’re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co-regulator of itself. And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits. And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust, that balance could get out of whack, and safety might lose out to profits. And the only way we would know that is when there’s a tragedy or two tragedies."
1771,natalie kitroeff
1772,"Boeing doesn’t want planes to crash. So their motivations are, in many ways, exactly aligned with their customers’. But what’s emerged after these two crashes — I mean, you heard the pilots. They said this was a breach of trust."
1773,michael barbaro
1774,Right.
1775,natalie kitroeff
1776,"I think a lot of people are feeling that right now, that feeling of questioning of this process. And this isn’t to say anything about Boeing’s motivations. We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights, and we do not want to rush to conclusions. But you’re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry, the pilots, the crew, they’re asking that right now. How do we regain trust in Boeing? And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes?"
1777,michael barbaro
1778,"We’ve been talking about trust, the trust that the F.A.A. had in Boeing, that the airlines, their pilots and crews had or didn’t have in this plane. But I’m wondering now about the trust that we, as the flying public, have in these planes. And it’s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon. Let’s say that the software gets fixed. And Boeing and the F.A.A., through their certification process, they all sign off on everything being safe. Why should we trust them after that? Why should we trust them, kind of, ever?"
1779,natalie kitroeff
1780,"I think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing, an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before. And you’ll remember, the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013, when it had battery fire problems."
1781,michael barbaro
1782,And that was a Boeing plane?
1783,natalie kitroeff
1784,"Right, a Boeing plane. And we all fly on it. It’s possible that people will be wary right now. But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will. The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country. What, if anything, is going to change in the process by which we determine, in the United States, that planes are safe to fly?"
1785,[music]
1786,
1787,michael barbaro
1788,"Natalie, thank you very much."
1789,natalie kitroeff
1790,"Thank you, Michael."
1791,"One area of focus is whether the training procedures on Boeing’s jet, greenlighted by the Federal Aviation Administration, left pilots unprepared to deal with new software on the plane. When the plane was introduced, Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn’t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed. The F.A.A. didn’t change those rules after the Lion Air crash in October and there are no plans to do so now."
1792,"Although the investigations are continuing, preliminary evidence and data suggest potential similarities between the crashes, raising questions about the new software on which pilots weren’t trained. Evidence at the Ethiopia crash site suggests there could have been a problem with the software, an automated system designed to help avoid a stall, which has also come up in the Lion Air disaster."
1793,"When Airbus announced in 2010 that it would introduce a new fuel-efficient and cost-effective plane, Boeing rushed to get out its own version. The strategy depended heavily on building a plane that worked essentially the same as the previous generation. Regulators agreed that it was a derivative model and that it didn’t require additional simulator training, a significant savings for airlines."
1794,"For many new airplane models, pilots train for hours on giant, multimillion-dollar machines, on-the-ground versions of cockpits that mimic the flying experience and teach them new features. But in the case of the Max, many pilots with 737 experience learned about the plane on an iPad."
1795,"“We would have liked to have had a simulator” from the start, said Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. “But it wasn’t practical, because it wasn’t built yet.”"
1796,"As Boeing pushed to get the plane done, flights simulators designed specifically for the Max weren’t ready. Greg Bowen, the training and standards chair at the Southwest pilots association, said that senior leadership at the carrier told him the engineering data necessary to design simulator software was still being finalized right up until the plane was nearly completed."
1797,"“They were building the airplane and still designing it,” Mr. Bowen said. “The data to build a simulator didn’t become available until about when the plane was ready to fly.”"
1798,"When United was set to take delivery of the 737 Max in 2017, a group of pilots put together training materials without ever flying the aircraft or a full simulator. James LaRosa, a 737 captain and union official who helped lead the training group, said he flew to a Boeing training center in Seattle to learn about the new plane on a mock cockpit that didn’t move like typical simulators."
1799,"In addition to a two-hour iPad training course from Boeing, he and colleagues used their experience in the cockpit to create a 13-page handbook on the differences between the Max and its predecessor, including changes to displays and the engines. The training materials did not mention the new software that later became a focus of the Lion Air crash investigation."
1800,"“When you find out that there are systems on it that are wildly different that affect the performance of the aircraft, having a simulator is part of a safety culture,” said Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot. “It can be the difference between a safe, recoverable flight and one that makes the newspapers.”"
1801,Boeing said in a statement that “the 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F.A.A. requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.”
1802,"“The F.A.A.’s aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,” the regulator said in a statement."
1803,"After the Lion Air crash that killed all 189 people aboard, the new software on the plane became an area of focus for investigators and pilots."
1804,"The new engines on the planes were bigger, part of Boeing’s competitive push to make it more fuel efficient. To compensate for the different aerodynamics that were the result of the larger engines, Boeing installed a system, known as MCAS, that automatically pushes the plane’s nose down in certain circumstances. A central concern in the Lion Air disaster is that the system may have malfunctioned, based on faulty sensor readings."
1805,"After the crash, it was clear that pilots of the 737 Max had not been fully informed about the new software. Shortly after Thanksgiving, pilot unions from Southwest and American met separately with Boeing officials. The unions wanted answers."
1806,"“The first thing we talked about was the break of trust,” said Mr. Tajer, the American pilot union spokesman. “We called it disrespectful.”"
1807,"According to Mr. Tajer, Boeing officials told American’s pilots that they hadn’t mentioned the new software because they didn’t want to “inundate” them with information."
1808,"The union told Boeing that it was now demanding simulators for its pilots. “We don’t really care what the F.A.A. requires,” Mr. Tajer said, recalling the meeting."
1809,"Pilots at American Airlines, who began asking for simulators for the new model as soon as they started flying the planes, ramped up their requests after the Lion Air crash."
1810,"Boeing officials promised American and Southwest pilots a software fix within several weeks, but added that extra training was not necessary. Notifying the pilots of the nature of the software fix and how it would function would be enough."
1811,"The airlines agreed. After those meetings, the pilots from both unions said that they were certain that they could keep flying the plane safely, even without simulators. Once they had been told how the new software worked, they believed they had “all the information on the system and the ability to interrupt it if it went afoul,” said Mr. Tajer."
1812,"Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House transportation committee, said he asked F.A.A. officials after the Lion Air crash why more substantial training was not required."
1813,"“I said, ‘This is essentially a different airplane, and how is it that it was certified without requiring pilot retraining?’” Mr. DeFazio recalled. He said the F.A.A. defended what had been decided as the work of pilots and others who “came to a consensus decision.”"
1814,"The F.A.A. bases its rules for training around the typical experience of a pilot in the United States, explaining that “the average caliber, skill and training of U.S. pilots is extensive, with countless hours of flight time and training both on the flight deck and in simulators.” But other countries tend to follow the lead of the United States in terms of training, leaving less experienced pilots potentially vulnerable."
1815,"“Overseas, pilots in some cases have a tiny fraction of the training that our pilots have,” Mr. DeFazio said. “Our pilots may all be good enough to recover with an MCAS problem with a bad sensor.”"
1816,"After the Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people, Boeing made calls to airlines, reassuring them that it was taking the situation seriously. Still, it said, it had full faith in the plane."
1817,"“We are confident in the safety of the 737 Max,” Mr. Muilenburg wrote in an email to employees on Monday, “and in the work of the men and women who design and build it.”"
1818,"The tragedy consumed Mr. Trump, according to a person familiar with his thinking who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. He talked about it repeatedly and brought up other major aviation disasters, including the 2015 Germanwings crash, which left 150 dead after the pilot deliberately slammed into the French Alps."
1819,"After his first call with Mr. Muilenburg, Mr. Trump was leaning against banning the flights, according to the person. But aides urged the president to intervene, telling him that the United States couldn’t be the only country to allow the planes to keep flying."
1820,"Instead of letting the F.A.A. announce the grounding, Mr. Trump blurted it out during an event about drug trafficking. “The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern,” he said. He added of Boeing, “They are working very, very hard right now and hopefully they’ll very quickly come up with the answer, but until they do, the planes are grounded.”"
1821,"It is unclear when the planes will start flying again. The company is expected to roll out a software fix by April, which will modify features of the jet around the automated system."
1822,"But Boeing isn’t planning to overhaul its training procedures. And neither the F.A.A., nor the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, are proposing additional simulator training for pilots, according to a person familiar with the deliberations. Instead, the regulators and Boeing agree that the best way to inform pilots about the new software is through additional computer-based training, which can be done on their personal computers."
1823,"While many pilots in the United States are still committed to the plane, they are pushing for Boeing to be more proactive."
1824,"“Would I go out and fly one today and put my family on it? Yeah, I would. Because I know how to fly it,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a 737 captain. “But I would like to see the fix done and have a full briefing from the manufacturer about what this thing is really going to do and how it’s going to do it.”"
1825,"And airlines are getting flight simulators, even if they aren’t required by regulators. One flight simulator maker has received 40 orders."
1826,It will be months before pilots in the United States can use them.
1827,"Hours after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, Mr. Tajer, the American Airlines union spokesman, spoke with the carrier and asked for an update on the simulator request. The reply: One had been ordered, and pilots would be able to train on it by the end of this year."
1828,"United Airlines, the world’s third-largest carrier, was told that it has to wait until 2020 for one. Today, there is only one simulator specifically designed for the Max in the United States."
1829,"(Reuters) - Boeing Co is now unlikely to deliver more than 500 of its 737 MAX planes to customers this year, and even that will depend on a swift removal of an effective halt in deliveries after June, Wall Street analysts said on Monday. "
1830,"Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft have been frozen by a global grounding of the jet following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight on March 10, which killed all 157 people onboard."
1831,"The company's delivery numbers for March are due to be published on Tuesday and are expected to show customers took less than half of a previous consensus estimate of 46 planes as the groundings prevented flights. An estimate for March last week from another brokerage, Baird, was as low as 19 planes."
1832,Yet Wall Street has been slow to draw conclusions about what that means for how many 737 MAX aircraft Boeing will deliver to customers this year and how many it will have to keep on its own books - even after announcing on Friday it will cut production by 10 planes a month or roughly 20 percent.
1833,"Of five well-known brokerages that produce estimates for Boeing's full-year numbers, Cowen and Jefferies cut their 2019 delivery forecast following Boeing's decision to lower production."
1834,"Cowen now expects full-year deliveries of ""around 500"", down from its earlier forecast of 630 737 MAX jets. Jefferies expects Boeing to deliver 497 737 MAX planes, down from 580. "
1835,"Cowen analysts said in a note that, to deliver even 500 MAX jets this year, Boeing would have to ramp up deliveries to foreign airlines swiftly in the second half. "
1836,"""It looks like BA won't deliver its MCAS fix to the FAA until late April and the FAA will have to test the fix before approving it and lifting the grounding,"" Cowen and Co analysts said. "
1837,"""This could delay a resumption of MAX deliveries to U.S. carriers (10% of backlog or ~480 planes) until June ... foreign deliveries may not resume until Q3 or possibly Q4,"" they added. "
1838,"The brokerage said while the production rate cut should help resolve the ""MAX crisis"", limiting the risk of a massive inventory build-up, it would mean a large 2019 cash hit."
1839,Cowen and Co also reduced its price target on the world's largest planemaker to $460 from $475 per share.
1840,"For a graphic on Boeing shares after second fatal crash, see - https://tmsnrt.rs/2D4i2vp "
1841,Analysts have also indicated that Boeing will bear a financial penalty for direct costs such as customers concessions and productivity loss from disruptions associated with the fleet grounding.
1842,"Of the 26 analysts covering Boeing, four now have a ""hold"" rating on the stock, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, while two rate it as ""strong sell""."
1843,"The grounding on 737's has so far wiped off nearly $25 billion from Boeing's market value, making it one of the worst performers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year."
1844,"Boeing's decision to cut the production of its 737 aircraft hit the shares of its suppliers on Monday, while its European rival Airbus rose."

1846, (Reporting by Karina Dsouza and Noor Zainab Hussain in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)
1847,"Weeks after a deadly crash involving a Boeing plane last October, company officials met separately with the pilot unions at Southwest Airlines and American Airlines. The officials said they planned to update the software for their 737 Max jets, the plane involved in the disaster, by around the end of 2018."
1848,"It was the last time the Southwest pilots union heard from Boeing, and months later, the carriers are still waiting for a fix. After a second 737 Max crashed, on Sunday in Ethiopia, United States regulators said the software update would be ready by April."
1849,"“Boeing was going to have a software fix in the next five to six weeks,” said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots union and a Boeing 737 captain. “We told them, ‘Yeah, it can’t drag out.’ And well, here we are.”"
1850,"This delay is now part of the intense scrutiny over Boeing’s response after the first air disaster, a Lion Air accident that killed 189 people in Indonesia. The second crash, involving an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people, bore similarities to the first, pointing to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update."
1851,"The planned fix was “designed to detect the problem,” said Jon Weaks, the president of Southwest’s pilot union, “and keep it from recurring.” Boeing officials told Southwest union leaders that they didn’t believe any extra training was necessary beyond informing the pilots of how the software fix would function."
1852,"The potential similarities between the two crashes were central to regulators’ decision to ground the whole 737 Max line, a family of planes that has been in service for nearly two years. Boeing is now in damage control mode, as carriers cancel flights and try to limit disruptions. Boeing declined to comment for this article."
1853,"Along with the grounding, Boeing has been forced to halt deliveries of the jets, one of its best-selling planes. Authorities are trying to determine exactly what went wrong, while a senior Democratic lawmaker is planning to examine Boeing’s communications with its regulators."
1854,"The lawmaker, Representative Peter A. DeFazio of Oregon, the chairman of the House transportation committee, has said he will investigate the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification of the 737 Max, including why the regulator did not mandate more substantial training for pilots."
1855,"To qualify to fly the plane, the pilots at American were given a 56-minute iPad training and about a dozen white papers on the differences between the Max aircraft and previous 737 jets, union officials said. Mr. Weaks of Southwest said his members were trained with an e-learning module on a company-issued iPad that consisted of under three hours of video presentations."
1856,Both Southwest and American now say they expect to have simulators including the 737 Max systems by the end of this year. American ordered the simulator after the Lion Air crash.
1857,"The meetings last year between Boeing officials and the unions were cordial but direct. The pilots from Southwest and American who met with Boeing were frustrated that they hadn’t been notified of the newly installed software system in the 737 Max planes before the crash in Indonesia. The so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS, is an automated system intended to prevent the plane from stalling."
1858,"“It was a very frank discussion,” said the American union’s safety chairman, Mr. Michaelis. “This is to our knowledge the first time pilots were not informed of a major system on an airplane that could affect flight controls.”"
1859,"The pilots demanded more information about the system. Mr. Michaelis said it had been mentioned once in the appendix of the official aircraft manual, but without any explanation about what it was or did."
1860,"In response to the pilots’ request, Mr. Michaelis said, Boeing concurred. The company has since provided the American pilots with basic information about MCAS, but it hasn’t updated the official manual with a full explanation about how it works."
1861,"Mr. Michaelis said Boeing had partly attributed the delay to the recent government shutdown, which caused a backlog at the F.A.A. Daniel K. Elwell, the acting administrator of the F.A.A., said on Wednesday that the 35-day partial government shutdown that stretched from December until late January “did not cause any delay in work on the software.”"
1862,"For days after the Ethiopian crash, Boeing and the F.A.A. stood by the safety of the plane. As regulators around the world grounded the plane, the F.A.A. resisted doing the same."
1863,Mr. DeFazio said he stepped out of a hearing on Wednesday morning to speak with Mr. Elwell about the plane. Mr. DeFazio said Mr. Elwell assured him there was no cause for alarm.
1864,"Within hours, President Trump announced the Max would be grounded."
1865,"“One of my staff, her phone went ‘bing’ and there it was,” Mr. DeFazio said."
1866,"Mr. Elwell and the F.A.A.’s top safety official, Ali Bahrami, visited Capitol Hill on Thursday to brief members of the House and Senate about the agency’s decision-making after the crash in Ethiopia. Mr. Elwell also made the rounds on morning television shows as his agency continued to face questions about its response to the crash as well as the earlier accident in Indonesia."
1867,"“We’re confident in the safety of the airplane,” he said on “CBS This Morning.” “What we don’t know is if there’s a linkage between those two accidents, and now that we have the new evidence to suggest there very well may be, we grounded the airplanes to find the linkage.”"
1868,"Mr. Trump, at the White House on Thursday, said he hoped the Boeing planes would be back in the air soon. “They have to figure it out fast,” he said. “They know that. They’re under great pressure.”"
1869,"The three American airlines that operate 737 Max aircraft — American and Southwest operate Max 8s and United flies the Max 9 — have scrambled to limit any disruptions caused by the groundings. The airlines have shifted other available aircraft to replace the jets, canceled less popular flights to use those aircraft for busier Max routes, and rebooked some fliers on other airlines. Cancellations will vary by the day based on the availability of other aircraft."
1870,"American, which has 24 Max 8 jets, canceled 85 flights out of 6,700 on Thursday, but it was able to limit the disruption by scrapping emptier flights on routes where it could rebook those passengers on later flights. For instance, it canceled flights from Dallas to Sacramento and Tucson, booking those fliers on later planes, and used those aircraft to instead operate busier routes between Miami and New York."
1871,"Southwest, which has 34 Max 8 jets, said it was able to shift enough planes around to cancel just 39 out of its 4,000 scheduled flights on Thursday. And United, which has 14 Max 9 jets, was able to avoid any cancellations from the grounding on Thursday because it shifted many planes from its hub in Denver, where a snowstorm was already disrupting flights."
1872,"There were still some 737 Max jets flying in American skies on Thursday. The F.A.A. granted the airlines permission to ferry their empty Max jets to new airports for long-term parking. American flew its planes from places like Miami, New York and Tampa, Fla., to places like Tulsa, Orlando, Fla., and Mobile, Ala."
1873,"NORFOLK, Va. — It looked like any other Southwest Airlines flight: free pretzels, conspicuously cheery flight attendants, a mad dash for aisle seats."
1874,"Despite the business-as-usual veneer, many passengers who boarded a Boeing 737 Max 8 on Tuesday brought qualms aboard with their suitcases. But in contrast to the full-volume debate about the plane’s airworthiness playing out on the ground, the scene in the sky was a mix of blissful ignorance and quiet anxiety."
1875,"“I didn’t want to say it and get anybody nervous,” said Candice Neenan, 67, a community college instructor who flew home to Virginia on the Max 8, and who said she had checked on the model of her plane before departure."
1876,"Over the weekend, the Max 8 went from a prized new addition to airlines’ fleets to a source of international anxiety after a deadly crash in Ethiopia, the second wreck involving the model in only months. By Tuesday, a day before President Trump announced the grounding of Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, United States regulators stood nearly alone in allowing the model to continue flying. And so, with as little discussion of the plane types as possible, passengers and flight crews booked on the Max 8 mostly forged ahead with travel plans and hoped for the best."
1877,"On a flight between Oakland, Calif., and Los Angeles, and another from Chicago to Norfolk, Va., reporters for The New York Times flew on the Max 8 on Tuesday, on some of the final runs before the planes were grounded in this country on Wednesday. The two flights, both on Southwest Airlines, were notable mostly for being mundane: earnest instructions about seatbelt usage, passengers snoring softly or playing games on their phones, free Coke and coffee served at cruising altitude."
1878,The crew made the usual announcements about not smoking in the lavatories and not congregating in the aisles. The flight attendants waved their arms theatrically and pointed to the exits. There was even an announcement that two passengers had recently been married. What drew no announcement at all? The model of the plane.
1879,"“It should be a nice ride into L.A.,” the pilot said over the intercom before guiding the plane into blue California skies on Tuesday morning."
1880,"The plane smelled of coffee and vinyl and the ceiling of the cabin was lit in blue and orange, the colors of the airline. The passengers spread out to empty seats in the back and for the most part kept to themselves."
1881,"Asked about the situation, many on the flight said they were unaware that the aircraft was the same model as the two flights that crashed."
1882,"“I really didn’t follow the news,” said Andreas Johns, an administrator at the University of California."
1883,"“I’m not alarmed,” he said about his flight. “Things can go wrong. But I fly with Southwest pretty regularly.”"
1884,"Ebony Wilson, who works in the tech industry in the Bay Area, reasoned that the flight was just a short hop. “If I were going across the country I might feel differently,” she said. “But it’s only an hour.”"
1885,"Others were more worried. Chiara Lesec, a digital marketing researcher who was flying to Los Angeles for a business meeting, had discussed the wisdom of taking the flight with her husband and researched the location of the safest seats on the aircraft."
1886,"“You have a better chance if you’re right behind the wing,” Ms. Lesec said."
1887,"As passengers gathered at Gate B26 at Midway Airport in Chicago, sipping Dunkin’ Donuts coffee and wolfing down French fries, more and more governments announced that the Max 8 would be grounded: the Dutch, the French, then the whole European Union."
1888,"But as the shiny blue plane pulled up to the gate in Chicago, “MAX 8” painted in white beneath its nose, the focus was on lining up strollers for family boarding and explaining Southwest’s distinct boarding system to first-time customers. Just as in California, no official mentioned the plane model."
1889,"Some travelers — like Jon Roberts, 27, returning to Virginia after a work trip in Nevada — were happily unaware of the plane’s recent troubles. “I was pretty much asleep the whole time,” Mr. Roberts said while waiting at baggage claim after the flight was over, when he learned for the first time that he had flown on a Max 8."
1890,"For frequent Southwest fliers, adept at differentiating between the different 737 models the airline uses, the Max 8 had been a favorite as it was added to the fleet over the last few years. Its overhead luggage bins are easier to latch than its older Boeing cousins. Its mood lighting offers a calming touch on hectic travel days. And, crucially for tall passengers, the headrest adjusts upward, making in-flight naps more plausible."
1891,"“There’s nothing wrong with the Maxes,” said Steve Ratliff, 68, a longtime Southwest customer who expressed faith in the airline’s maintenance protocol. “Nobody expressed concern that I heard of.”"
1892,"Elsewhere on the plane, Monique Palmer, 57, was returning to Norfolk from a birthday trip with her family."
1893,"“I started praying,” Ms. Palmer said, upon learning the plane was a Max 8."
1894,"“I was a little concerned, I was a little nervous,” Ms. Palmer said after landing safely in sunny Virginia. “But I don’t know what else to do.”"
1895,• Pressure escalated inside the United States for a grounding of the Boeing 737 Max model that has crashed twice in the past six months. But the Federal Aviation Administration reiterated its position that the plane is considered safe and that it has “no basis to order grounding the aircraft.”
1896,"• The European Union suspended “all flight operations” of the Boeing 737 Max model in question. The action came as more than a half-dozen other countries grounded the plane, and was the most sweeping regulatory action taken so far in the two days since the crash of a Max 8 that killed 157 people on a flight from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya."
1897,"• President Trump had a telephone conversation with the chief executive of Boeing, who made the case that the 737 Max 8 should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation."
1898,"• Mr. Trump also said on Twitter that commercial airplanes had become overly technical, but said nothing about the Boeing Max."
1899,"• At least 34 airlines have now grounded the Max 8, which means roughly two-thirds of the Max 8 planes in operation are now idled. The major outliers are Southwest and American in the United States, and Air Canada."
1900,"• Boeing stands by the airworthiness of the plane, but said it planned to issue a software update and was working on changes to flight controls and training guidelines following the first crash, of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia last October."
1901,[Read more about the latest developments in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash.] 
1902,"• Boeing’s stock price, which fell 5 percent on Monday, fell 6 percent on Tuesday."
1903,"• Investigators from the United States and elsewhere are at the crash site of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Much of the investigation will focus on the voice and data recorders recovered on Monday. The airline’s chief executive, interviewed by CNN, said the pilots had told air traffic control they were having “flight control problems.”"
1904,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
1905,"The European Union’s aviation regulatory agency barred flights of the Max 8, as well as a slightly newer model, the Max 9, joining several other regulators around the world."
1906,"The action, which includes all flights over European Union territory, came as India, France, Germany, Britain, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Oman joined China and Indonesia in suspending all use of the plane."
1907,"The European Union regulator, known as EASA, said the action included the suspension of “all commercial flights performed by third-country operators into, within or out of the E.U.” of the Max 8 and Max 9."
1908,"The decision could disrupt travel not only through the heart of Europe but well beyond, as many commercial flight routes go over European Union territory. Still, the extent of the disruption is unclear."
1909,"Airlines and passengers will be affected as companies scramble to ensure that passengers can still get to their destinations, but the impact will depend on how much of their fleets are made up of the grounded planes, said Andrew Charlton, the managing director at Aviation Advocacy, an air transport consultancy based in Switzerland."
1910,"By Wednesday morning, the groundings spread. Fiji Airways said it had grounded all of its Max 8 planes and would try to accommodate passengers using other aircraft."
1911,"New Zealand’s Civil Aviation Authority said Wednesday it had banned the Boeing 737 Max 8 planes from its airspace, citing uncertainty about the cause of the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The grounding affected only one airline, Fiji, which had its next New Zealand flight scheduled for Thursday afternoon."
1912,Two United States airlines fly the 737 Max 8: Southwest has 34 and American 24. Both have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the planes and found no reason to ground them.
1913,"“We don’t have any changes planned,” Southwest said in a statement. “We have full confidence in the aircraft,” American said. Air Canada, which operates 24 Max 8s, has given no indication it intends to ground them."
1914,"American Airlines, however, has faced growing pressure from its flight attendants union to temporarily ground the planes. Lori Bassani, the president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said members were calling on the airline’s chief executive, Doug Parker, to “strongly consider grounding these planes until a thorough investigation can be performed.”"
1915,"While she did not say flight attendants would refuse to fly on the Max 8, “our flight attendants will not be forced to fly if they feel unsafe.”"
1916,"Adding to the pressure for action in the United States, at least three senators joined the call for grounding the plane. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, Mitt Romney, a Utah Republican, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, called on the F.A.A. to ground the aircraft while the cause of the Ethiopian crash is investigated."
1917,"Nonetheless the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, said in a statement late Tuesday that based on all available data, there was “no basis” to ground the plane. “Nor have other civil aviation authorities provided data to us that would warrant action,” he said."
1918,"The pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 reported to air traffic control that they were having “flight control problems” in the moments before the crash, the airline’s chief executive was quoted as saying in an interview with CNN."
1919,"The quoted remarks from the chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, suggested the plane had not responded to actions by the pilots."
1920,Mr. GebreMariam was also quoted as saying the black boxes recovered from the wreckage “will be sent overseas” and not analyzed in Ethiopia. He did not specify where they would be taken.
1921,"On Tuesday morning, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, spoke to President Trump on the phone and argued that the Max should not be grounded in the United States, according to two people briefed on the conversation. A Boeing official said that during the call with the president, “Dennis reiterated our position that the Max is a safe aircraft.”"
1922,"Mr. Muilenburg has worked to cultivate a relationship with the president, but it has sometimes been an uneasy one."
1923,"Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump assailed Boeing for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president."
1924,"The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter a month after winning the election. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over."
1925,"“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate. Weeks afterward, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help fund President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration."
1926,"Mr. Trump also publicly lamented on Tuesday what he described as excessive technology that has overtaken modern commercial jet travel and made it, in his view, more dangerous."
1927,"Without specifying Boeing or the Max 8, Mr. Trump said aircraft had become “far too complex to fly,” and recalled approvingly the era when pilots had total control in the cockpit."
1928,"“Split second decisions are needed, and the complexity creates danger,” Mr. Trump said in a pair of postings on Twitter. “All this for great cost yet very little gain. I don’t know about you, but I don’t want Albert Einstein to be my pilot. I want great flying professionals that are allowed to easily and quickly take control of a plane!”"
1929,Pilots and aviation experts have said repeatedly that flying is now safer than it has ever been.
1930,"Boeing is negotiating with the Federal Aviation Administration over improvements to its 737 Max 8 after the aircraft’s second crash in five months, though both the government and company insist the plane is safe to fly as is."
1931,"Since October, when a Max 8 belonging to the budget airline Lion Air crashed in Indonesia soon after takeoff, killing all 189 people on board, Boeing has been working on changes to the flight control systems of the aircraft. The company has also been updating its training guidelines and manuals so that airlines can teach their pilots to fly the planes more safely and easily."

2078,"After the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, concerns arose about the aircraft’s flight control systems. The main changes now being developed to those systems include limiting how much the plane’s computers can automatically pull down the nose of the plane if sensors detect a stall."
2079,"The concern after the Lion Air crash was that erroneous readings from poorly maintained sensors in the nose of the plane might have fooled the automatic systems into falsely concluding that the plane was traveling sharply upward and in danger of stalling. The automatic systems may then have forced the nose down significantly, sending the plane into a steep dive into the ocean."
2080,"Boeing issued a statement late Monday saying that since the Lion Air crash, the company had been developing a “flight control software enhancement for the 737 Max, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.” According to the company, it has been working with the F.A.A. to roll out the software updates across the 737 Max fleet in the coming weeks."
2081,"A naturalized newlywed from Ethiopia, a health analyst headed to her first international project, and two brothers on vacation were among at least eight Americans on Flight 302."
2082,"The immigrant, Mucaad Hussein Abdalla, 31, a truck driver in St. Cloud, Minn., had just been married in Morocco; his wife, though, was not on the flight, according to Mr. Abdalla’s cousin, Mohamed Warfa. “He loved to play soccer in his free time, and he had many friends in this community,” Mr. Warfa said."
2083,"Mr. Abdalla came to the United States from Ethiopia as a teenager, gained citizenship and supported his mother, brother and sister, who live in Ethiopia, said Mr. Warfa, 29, who created a GoFundMe page to help pay for the funeral."
2084,"Samya Stumo, 24, of Sheffield, Mass., was a recent graduate of the University of Copenhagen School of Global Health, who had just begun a job at ThinkWell, a nongovernmental organization that promotes access to health care in developing countries. “Samya was in her early 20s and had already done more than I did when I was 34,” her grandmother Laura Nader, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley, told The Boston Globe."
2085,"Melvin Riffel, 30, and Bennett Riffel, 26, were on a vacation that included a stop in Australia. It was intended to be the last escapade before Melvin became a father. His wife, Brittney, is expecting a child in May."
2086,"Melvin worked at the California Department of Transportation. “He was a dedicated civil servant who worked for Caltrans for nearly a decade, and our deepest sympathy and condolences go out to his family, friends and colleagues,” said the Caltrans director, Laurie Berman."
2087,"Matt Vecere, 43, of Long Beach, Calif., was en route to the United Nations Environment Assembly this week in Nairobi. “Matt was passionate about the environment, civil rights, social and environmental justice, and advocating for those less fortunate,” his mother, Donna Vecere, said in a statement. Mr. Vecere had recently been in Haiti, where he had made several trips after the 2010 earthquake."
2088,Three generations of one Canadian family were also onboard the flight and were among the 18 Canadians killed in the disaster.
2089,"“I am not angry, but I am devastated, I have lost everyone,” said Manant Vaidya, 41, whose parents, sister, brother-in-law and two teenage nieces all died in the crash."
2090,"Share prices of Boeing, a major component of the Dow Jones industrial average, fell 6.1 percent during trading on Tuesday, following a similar decline Monday on worries about the spreading impact of the Max 8 crash in Ethiopia and the prognosis for future sales of the plane."
2091,"The flight data and cockpit voice recorders of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 were recovered on Monday, but the process of extracting the data contained within the so-called black boxes could be lengthy, experts cautioned."

2132,"The two recorders will need to be taken to a specialized center to read their data, said Lynnette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London."
2133,Boeing’s share price.
2134,"Boeing’s stock dropped on Monday, a day after a fatal crash in Ethiopia involving the newest version of its most popular jet, the 737 Max. "
2135,"Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed just outside Addis Ababa shortly after takeoff on Sunday, killing all 157 people on board. The plane’s flight-data and cockpit-voice recorders have been recovered, but the cause of the crash is unknown and will take weeks to investigate. "
2136,"But the crash was the second for a new version of the 737 Max after one of the jets operated by Lion Air crashed into the Java Sea off Indonesia in late October, and some countries and carriers responded by grounding their fleets of the plane. "
2137,"Ethiopian Airlines grounded all of its 737 Max 8 planes, and China and Indonesia ordered the grounding of all 737 Max planes. Cayman Airways said it was grounding two new 737 Max jets, and Chinese airlines on Monday began using Boeing 737-800s on routes typically flown by 737 Max jets. "
2138,"“Although we don’t yet know the cause of the accident, we had to decide to ground the particular fleet as extra safety precaution,” Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement on Monday. "
2139,"Comair, a South African airline, which took delivery of its first 737 Max 8 just a few days ago, grounded the jet after initially saying that it would continue running it. It had decided to wait until it had consulted with Boeing, other airlines and technical experts, the company said in a statement."
2140,"Still, several carriers, including Boeing’s biggest customers in the United States, said they would keep flying the aircraft. Southwest Airlines, the biggest buyer of the aircraft in the United States, said it would continue flying the jet, as did American Airlines."
2141,"After falling nearly 13 percent in early trading, Boeing shares bounced back to end the day down around 5 percent."
2142,"On Monday afternoon, the Federal Aviation Administration said in a message on Twitter that it would issue a “continued airworthiness notification” for the 737 Max."
2143,"The questions raised by the latest crash go to the heart of Boeing’s business. The single-aisle 737 Max, the American plane maker’s challenger to Airbus’s A320 jet, was Boeing’s best-selling plane ever. It first started flying in 2017 and by this January, the company had delivered more than 350 of the planes, which sell for $120 million apiece. "
2144,"About 5,000 more are on order. "
2145,It was unclear how the groundings of the 737 Max might affect Boeing’s bottom line. The cost to the company would be significant if regulators in the United States decided to follow suit and take the fleet out of service temporarily. 
2146,Such occurrences are rare. 
2147,"If the 737 Max is taken out of service, Boeing might have to compensate airlines for delayed deliveries. The company might also have to invest in redesigning or updating the aircraft. And Boeing could face lawsuits filed by the families of those killed in the Ethiopian Airline crash. "
2148,"Carter Copeland, an analyst at Melius Research, estimated that Boeing could face nearly $1 billion in costs if regulators grounded its 737 Max fleet for three months. He said his analysis was based partly on the expenses incurred by Boeing when the F. A.A. ordered the company’s 787s to stop flying temporarily in 2013 because of a problem with the plane’s battery system."
2149,"The drop in Boeing’s stock on Monday wiped almost $13 billion off the company’s market value.  “That speaks to the fear,” Mr. Copeland said. “Right now there is a very difficult to quantify risk that people need a substantial discount to stomach.”"
2150,"The decision by China’s Civil Aviation Administration to ground the planes hurts Boeing in a region where the company has been able to sell a large number of them. Chinese airlines have ordered at least 104 737 Max planes, and have taken delivery of at least 70. "
2151,"Several airlines indicated they were holding off on grounding the planes. SpiceJet, a low-cost Indian airline, said it would continue allowing them to fly while awaiting guidance from Indian air safety regulators. Eastar Jet in South Korea and Fiji Airways also said they would keep flying their 737 Max 8s, as did SilkAir, a Singapore Airlines subsidiary. "
2152,"After the Lion Air Crash, some American aviation authorities said Boeing had not adequately explained to pilots a software change on the 737 Max’s flight control system. "
2153,"Since then, airlines have provided training classes to inform pilots of the changes to the new system, but it is not known whether Ethiopian Airlines had conducted such training. The available information does not rule out pilot error or a malfunctioning of an entirely separate system. "
2154,Boeing said in a statement that it would be sending a technical team to the crash site to provide assistance to the Ethiopia Accident Investigation Bureau and the United States National Transportation Safety Board. 
2155,"In the United States, the head of the Association of Flight Attendants called for the F.A.A. to investigate the 737 Max. The F.A.A said it was monitoring the situation and planned to join the N.T.S.B. in assisting in the investigation."

2302,Zach Wichter contributed reporting.
2303,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia’s national airline has told Boeing that it wants to cancel an order of 737 Max 8 jets, the carrier’s spokesman said on Friday, the first publicly confirmed attempt to cancel a deal for the planes since they were grounded around the world this month after two deadly crashes."
2304,"The airline, Garuda Indonesia, said that its passengers had lost confidence in the model after the crashes. It said that it sent a letter to Boeing on March 14 seeking to cancel its order of 49 more planes; it had ordered 50, just one of which has been delivered. The deal is estimated to be worth $4.9 billion."
2305,"“Continuing the Max order does not benefit Garuda,” said the spokesman, Ikhsan Rosan. “Our passengers, psychologically, they don’t trust flying with Max anymore. They often asked during booking what type of aircraft they would be flying on.”"
2306,"A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. More than 4,000 737 Max planes, Boeing’s best-selling aircraft, are on order by airlines around the world. Boeing’s stock, which has dropped about 12 percent since the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash in which 157 people died, fell nearly 3 percent on Friday."
2307,"The Ethiopian Airlines accident, in which the plane’s course became erratic almost immediately after takeoff, was  similar to the Oct. 29 crash of a Lion Air flight, also a Max 8. That plane plunged into the sea off the Indonesian coast, killing all 189 people aboard."
2308,"Investigators examining both crashes are looking into, among other things, whether Boeing’s changes to the Max 8’s flight control system might have played a role. Boeing has planned a software update to fix any issues with the flight-control system, known as MCAS."
2309,Few analysts expect other airlines to follow Garuda’s lead.
2310,"“Changing orders midstream is a very costly affair,” said Howard Wheeldon, an aerospace analyst who runs his own consulting business in Britain. He said he could recall no previous examples of a major airline backing out of an order after an accident."
2311,"“There’s a huge cost involved in training, support” and maintenance, Mr. Wheeldon said. “You’ve got to think long and hard before you change your aircraft and your engine supplier.”"
2312,"Indeed, some American carriers that fly the Max are scheduled to meet with Boeing at the company’s factory in Renton, Wash., this weekend to discuss the planned software update, according to an official at one major United States airline, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the meeting had not been made public. The official cautioned that airlines did not expect to fly the Max immediately after receiving the software update because other questions remained."
2313,"Another person familiar with the gathering said Boeing would talk to the airlines about the possibility of simulator training for the planes, and brief them on the changes being planned to the Max."
2314,"Jon Weaks, the president of the Southwest Airlines pilots union, said “technical and training team members” from the airline would be in attendance. ”We want to ensure the highest quality products for our crews,” he said."
2315,"American, United and Southwest Airlines said there were no changes to their orders for Max aircraft. “We are still confident in the airplane,” said Beth Harbin, a Southwest spokeswoman."
2316,"Garuda could find it difficult to get out of its Max 8 order. Airlines typically put down a deposit of as much as 20 percent of the price of the plane, which costs $120 million before discounts, modifications and other adjustments. To get out of such a commitment, an airline has to show that the plane suffers from a structural problem or some other debilitating flaw, industry experts say."
2317,"Mr. Ikhsan, the Garuda spokesman, did acknowledge that it was difficult to cancel such agreements once they had been signed. He said Garuda officials would meet with Boeing executives in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, on Thursday to discuss alternatives."
2318,"“It still all has to be discussed,” Mr. Ikhsan said."
2319,"Airlines have limited alternatives, as Boeing and Airbus are the primary manufacturers of airliners used by most of the world’s commercial carriers. Airlines maintain longtime relationships with manufacturers, and it would be difficult to cut ties with one of the two manufacturers making the aircraft they needed, something that Mr. Ikhsan acknowledged on Friday. He said it was possible “that we change to another model, not Max, but still from Boeing.”"
2320,"It could also be hard to find replacements. Airbus has a yearslong backlog of orders to fill for its rival to the Max 8, the A320neo. China’s rival plane, the C919 — built by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, or Comac — has not yet flown commercially and must prove that it is both fuel efficient and economical to operate."
2321,"Until investigators determine exactly what happened on both the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the Lion Air flight, airlines could also find it difficult to change contracts they have with Boeing."
2322,"Norwegian Air, a low-cost airline with one of the largest Max 8 fleets outside the United States, said last week that it expected Boeing to cover the costs of the aircraft’s being grounded. But arguing for compensation could be difficult at this stage, experts said."
2323,"A spokesman for Norwegian said on Friday that the airline had no plans to cancel its orders from Boeing. Representatives of other airlines with 737 Max planes on order, including Tui, Icelandair, FlyDubai, LOT, Comair and Enter Air, also said they had no plans to cancel orders."
2324,"“We’re waiting for the result of the investigation,” said Aage Duenhaupt of Tui Fly, a subsidiary of the Tui Group, a tourism company in Germany that has 59 737 Max planes on order. “We see fleet decisions as long-term decisions. There are no plans on our side to change at the moment.”"
2325,"Nevertheless, Garuda’s decision and the indication that many passengers do not trust that they can fly safely in a Boeing’s 737 Max are a blow to the company, which has been thrust into crisis by the crashes."
2326,"With its best-selling plane grounded, no firm timetable for a return and airlines questioning their contracts, the company also faces increased scrutiny from regulators."
2327,"In his first public comments since the Ethiopian crash, Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, said this week that the company was “taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max.”"
2328,"CHICAGO/SEATTLE — Boeing Co said on Friday it plans to cut its monthly 737 aircraft production by nearly 20 percent in the wake of two deadly crashes, signaling it does not expect aviation authorities to allow the plane back in the air anytime soon."
2329,"Deliveries of Boeing's best-selling aircraft were frozen after a global grounding of the narrowbody model following the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet on March 10, killing all 157 people onboard."
2330,"Production will be cut to 42 airplanes per month from 52 starting mid-April, the company said in a statement, without giving an end-date."
2331,"U.S. and airline officials said they now believe the plane could be grounded for at least two months, but an even longer grounding is a serious possibility."
2332,The crash in Ethiopia and the crash of a Lion Air plane in Indonesia last October that killed all 189 people on board have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis.
2333,"Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday said the company now knows that a chain of events caused both disasters, with erroneous activation of so-called MCAS anti-stall software ""a common link"" between the two."
2334,Boeing said it would not reduce jobs at the new production rate and will work to minimize the financial impact. 
2335,"The company's board will establish a committee to review how the company designs and develops airplanes, Muilenburg said. The group will ""recommend improvements to our policies and procedures"" for its 737 MAX and other airplane programs. "
2336,Boeing said it continues to make progress on a 737 MAX software update to prevent further accidents.
2337,"Shares in Boeing Co fell around two percent after the market closed on Friday. While the number of 737 MAX planes grounded is just over 370, nearly 5,000 more are on order. "
2338,"Boeing faces logistical issues in finding places to park the growing number of planes as well as being responsible for all their maintenance costs since it has been unable to deliver the jets to customers, two people briefed on the situation said."
2339,Manufacturers avoid halting and then resuming production as this disrupts supply chains and can cause industrial snags. Boeing had been planning to speed up production in June to 57 a month.
2340,"Having to hold planes in storage without delivering them does, however, consume extra cash through increased inventory."
2341,"Boeing supplier Spirit Aerosystems Holdings said it will continue to make 52 737 MAX shipsets - the complete set of parts for each aircraft - per month, storing extras at its facilities. Its shares fell 3.5 percent."
2342,"National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) chairman Robert Sumwalt told reporters that U.S. investigators were given the raw data from Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 as soon as it was read in France last month. He added that the Ethiopian Airlines 302 preliminary report ""was very thorough and well done."""
2343,Former NTSB chairman Christopher Hart was named by the Federal Aviation Administration this week to head an international team to review the safety of the 737 MAX.
2344,"He told reporters on Friday he thought the review, which will start on Monday, could take about three months. It is still not clear what countries will take part."
2345,He said investigators are going to be focused far more on the interaction between software and pilots than mechanical issues in future.
2346,"""This is territory we are going to see more of,"" Hart said."

2349,— The views of pilots and instructors on the potential risks of trainees spending more time learning automated systems than manual control. 
2350,— A visual explanation of why investigators fear two Boeing 737 Max aircraft may have crashed for similar reasons. 
2351,— The United States decision to ground Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft on Wednesday. 
2352,"Passengers in the United States were bracing for delays on Thursday, a day after President Trump announced the grounding of all Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the wake of a deadly crash in Ethiopia, but experts said the three American carriers that operate the planes would replace the jets with other aircraft."
2353,"• The so-called black boxes, voice and flight data recorders, recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 were sent to France for analysis on Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said. Satellite data has revealed similarities between Sunday’s crash and the October crash of a plane flown by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, but the recorders contain more detailed information about the Ethiopian flight’s final moments."
2354,• New disclosures point to what appears to have been a struggle by pilots of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to control their new Max 8 aircraft minutes after takeoff.
2355,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
2356,"Delays are inevitable, and some customers will be inconvenienced, as airlines reshuffle their plans in the wake of a presidential order grounding about 70 Boeing Max aircraft across the United States."
2357,"The planes operated by Southwest, American and United airlines carry about 300,000 passengers per week, said Scott Mayerowitz, the executive editorial director of The Points Guy, a travel website. Airlines could cancel some of those flights and rebook passengers on similar trips, or briefly delay routine maintenance on some of the few planes they have in standby, he said."
2358,"The airlines may reassign planes originally designated for different routes. For example, an airline could cancel one of its frequent Chicago-to-New York flights, which typically are not sold out, rebook those passengers and reassign a plane."
2359,"That could result in delays and cancellations not just on routes that fly 737 Max jets, but those that use different planes that have been redirected to routes formerly flown by a Max jet."
2360,"No matter the fix, the swap could mean a different seating arrangement. Mr. Mayerowitz said passengers planning to fly in the next few weeks should check their airline’s website to make sure their seat assignments have not changed after switching aircraft."
2361,"“Passengers who were booked in an aisle seat or extra leg room might now find themselves in the back of a jet, stuck in a middle seat,” he said."
2362,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
2363,"Ethiopia sent the “black boxes” recovered from the wreckage of Flight 302 to Paris on Thursday, Ethiopian Airlines said on Twitter, as investigators hope to conduct a more detailed analysis of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders."
2364,"The boxes, which can withstand temperatures of 2,012 degrees Fahrenheit, collect critical information about a flight. Microphones in the cockpit record the pilots’ voices and other telling sounds."
2365,"Information gleaned from the data recorder can reveal nuances about a flight’s altitude, instrument readings and power settings, which help create detailed models of the crash."
2366,"The analysis of the boxes is expected to take months, but the American authorities decided on Wednesday to ground all Boeing 737 Max jets after studying satellite data that suggested similarities between the Ethiopian crash and the October Lion Air crash of a Max 8 in which all 189 people on board were killed."
2367,"The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement on Wednesday that the decision to temporarily ground the planes was based on “new evidence collected at the site and analyzed today,” but did not go into detail."
2368,"“This evidence,” it said, “together with newly refined satellite data available to F.A.A. this morning, led to this decision.”"
2369,"Shortly after takeoff from Bole International Airport in Addis Ababa, the captain of the Ethiopian Airlines jetliner reported “flight control problems” to air traffic control. That suggests that the cockpit crew was having trouble with the mechanical instruments used to handle the aircraft, the computerized systems that fly it, or both."
2370,"The pilot’s alert was reported Wednesday by a spokesman for the airline, Asrat Begashaw; the airline’s chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, had made similar remarks to CNN the day before."
2371,"Mr. Begashaw said the control tower had granted the crew’s request to return to the airport, but the plane crashed three minutes later, killing all aboard."
2372,"The disclosure added to suggestions that the plane had not responded to intended actions by the pilots. There has been no suggestion so far of terrorism or other outside interference in the functioning of the aircraft, which was only a few months old."
2373,"In earlier evidence pointing to the possibility of an intrinsic problem with the Max 8 model, control issues were reported by the crew of the Lion Air Max 8 that crashed minutes after takeoff in Indonesia last October."
2374,"Mr. Begashaw declined to specify what control problems might have led to the crash on Sunday, which killed all 157 people aboard."
2375,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — When a new Boeing 737 Max 8 plunged into the waters off Indonesia last October, a terrifying mystery confronted the aviation industry: What could have caused Lion Air Flight 610, flown by experienced pilots in good weather, to fall out of the sky just 12 minutes after takeoff?"
2376,"But it took the second, equally terrifying crash of an identical aircraft under similar conditions five months later, in Ethiopia, to reveal the climate of mistrust that has plagued inquiries into what caused the first disaster."
2377,"Interviews with government officials, aviation experts and company executives portray an environment in which Lion Air, Boeing, subcontractors, investigators and regulators erected walls to sharing information that seemed designed more for self-preservation than finding the truth about a crash that claimed 189 lives."
2378,"As each party involved in the crash focused on passing the blame, rather than trading information about the Max’s new anti-stall system or disseminating important details about the investigation, airlines, passengers and even Indonesian regulators were left in the dark."
2379,"Indonesia’s top aviation regulatory official said both Boeing and the United States Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the Max 8, were slow in responding to requests for help in determining the safety of other Max planes flown by Indonesian carriers."
2380,"Reached for comment, the F.A.A. said, “We are supporting the investigation and in constant contact with Indonesian civil aviation authorities.” Boeing declined to comment."
2381,"Executives from Lion Air, a low-cost carrier with powerful political backers, have essentially gone into hiding. Lion Air’s safety director told The New York Times he could not accept an interview because of an agreement with Boeing."
2382,"It is not yet clear whether the Ethiopian Airlines crash, in which all 157 people onboard died on March 10, could have been prevented if information had been shared more transparently and quickly after the Lion Air accident. Nor is it certain whether the two new Max jets suffered from the exact same problems, although officials believe that the pilots of both planes struggled with an automated stall-prevention system that was introduced in the Max."
2383,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
2384,"But the lack of trust and recriminations that have afflicted the inquiry into Flight 610 almost certainly slowed the setting of safety standards for the Max, which remains grounded across the world since last month."
2385,"“Lifesaving lessons are only life saving if we learn from them,” said Charles Herrmann, a lawyer representing some families of Lion Air victims in a suit against Boeing. “It’s absolutely inexcusable that it takes another crash for people to kick this investigation into high gear.”"
2386,"The Max is the fastest-selling plane in Boeing’s history, and thousands of these jetliners are still on order. Carriers worldwide will have to decide whether Boeing’s proposed fixes will satisfy their safety requirements and placate worried consumers."
2387,"“Our passengers, psychologically, they don’t trust flying with the Max anymore,” said Ikhsan Rosan, the spokesman for Garuda Indonesia, the national carrier, after it became the first airline to announce that it wanted to cancel its order of Max 8 jets."
2388,"Pilots and airlines have complained that they were not informed about the existence of the anti-stall system, called MCAS. Investigators suspect that in the case of Lion Air Flight 610, and later in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, errant data mistakenly triggered MCAS, sending the plane into a fatal nose-dive."
2389,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
2390,"In November, Haryo Satmiko, the deputy chief of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee, known as KNKT, recounted confusing conversations he was having with Boeing employees who had arrived in Jakarta. Mr. Haryo said he brought up whether inaccurate data readings could have prompted Flight 610’s sudden descent."
2391,"What Mr. Haryo was describing, though he did not know it at the time, was a malfunction of MCAS, which automatically forces the plane’s nose down if data indicates that the jet is angled too sharply upward and might stall."
2392,"Nurcahyo Utomo, the head of the safety group’s air-accident subcommittee, said he first learned of the term MCAS from news reports."
2393,"“People immediately assumed this was a Lion Air problem, an issue with a terrible Indonesian airline,” said Gerry Soejatman, an Indonesian aviation analyst. “But when a brand-new plane crashes, you have to look at all the factors, including the possibility of a manufacturer problem or defect. And you have to look really carefully when that manufacturer isn’t providing all the answers.”"
2394,"Days after Flight 610 crashed, Polana Pramesti, the head of Indonesia’s civil aviation authority, waited for visiting Boeing and F.A.A. officials to talk to her. As head of Indonesia’s version of the F.A.A., she wanted advice on whether to ground Max 8 jets in Indonesia. But the Americans, who did spend time with transportation safety committee officials, never came to her, she said."
2395,"The official in her office in charge of airworthiness and aircraft operation, Avirianto, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, fired off messages to the F.A.A. asking for an explanation of MCAS, which at the time was only vaguely understood, even by aviation experts, because Boeing had failed to put information about it in the plane’s manual."
2396,"Although he conducted four teleconferences with F.A.A. officials, Mr. Avirianto said he was never given a clear explanation of how MCAS worked or whether it was safe. “They kept saying they were still analyzing, evaluating,” he said. “We never received any guidance because there were never any clear answers for us.”"
2397,"The F.A.A. disagrees, saying that it had briefed the Indonesians “on several of the advisories and airworthiness directives on the Boeing 737 Max accidents issued to civilian aviation authorities and operators globally.”"
2398,"But Ms. Polana said, “I think they are protecting Boeing.”"
2399,"“The F.A.A. was the one that certified the aircraft safe to fly,” she said. “And then they found, no, the aircraft is dangerous.”"
2400,"Ms. Polana also sent a letter to Boeing in November, asking for guarantees about the Max. But Boeing was not forthcoming, either, she said. “Of course, we were worried,” Ms. Polana said. “We wanted reassurance that the Boeing 737 Max 8s in Indonesia are airworthy.”"
2401,"Boeing and the F.A.A. have come under scrutiny since the Lion Air crash. The United States Department of Transportation is examining the F.A.A.’s certification of the Max model, amid revelations that Boeing employees may have facilitated that process."
2402,"Only after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, Ms. Polana said, did the F.A.A. and Boeing become more responsive. On March 22, she had her inaugural teleconference with F.A.A. officials — the first time Indonesian officials received a precise explanation of how MCAS worked and how Boeing was planning to fix it, they said."
2403,"For days before the Oct. 29 Lion Air crash, the airplane had experienced faulty data readings. But no one understood that these problems could force the plane into a sudden and bewildering plunge. The plane’s handbook had no clear fix, and Mr. Avirianto was alarmed to find that a new Max flight simulator in Singapore did not simulate MCAS."
2404,"In the days after the crash, American aviation officials visiting Jakarta cast aspersions on their Indonesian counterparts, even as they refused to speak on the record: Which was more reliable? An airplane manufacturer that was one of the most respected companies in the United States, or a low-cost carrier with a long history of shocking safety lapses operating in a country troubled by corruption and weak regulation?"
2405,"And as the spotlight intensified after the crash of Flight 610, Lion Air’s executives retreated from view."
2406,"Last month, Daniel Putut, Lion Air’s director of safety and security, told The New York Times that he could not accept an interview because of a nondisclosure agreement with Boeing. (Such agreements are not unusual, but they do raise questions about transparency in an ongoing investigation.)"
2407,"Indonesian investigators came under criticism, as well. Their preliminary report, released in late November, was marred by inconsistencies and incomplete information, aviation analysts said."
2408,"In one example, the report listed the various data problems that the plane had on its final flight, including a 20-degree differential in a pair of readings that are used to measure the possibility of a stall. Those readings come from angle of attack sensors on the plane’s nose."
2409,"A faulty input of angle of attack data may have mistakenly triggered MCAS. Yet the preliminary report did not mention that on the second-to-last flight, the plane also recorded a 20-degree disparity between the two angle of attack readings — crucial context for determining what may have led to the crash."
2410,"Mr. Nurcahyo, the KNKT head of air accident investigations, said that before the second to last flight, engineers replaced the left angle of attack vane because the plane had suffered problems with data readings on three previous flights. Cold temperatures, he said, appeared to have caused the sensor to malfunction."
2411,"After the crash, the replaced angle of attack sensor was shipped to Minnesota, home of Rosemount Aerospace, the Boeing subcontractor that made it, Mr. Nurcahyo said. He and other Indonesian investigators went to Minneapolis in December. The sensor, he said, was deemed defective."
2412,"United Technologies, the parent company of Rosemount, confirmed that it supplies Boeing with angle of attack sensors. But it declined to comment on the details of the Lion Air investigation, including whether its vanes had been found defective or whether the company had met with Indonesian investigators. Instead, it referred all questions to Boeing."
2413,"“They all say, ‘My product is good,’ ” Mr. Nurcahyo said. “That’s what Boeing does.”"
2414,"For Lion Air Flight 610, even after the vane was changed, the Max 8 continued to malfunction, producing an array of errant data. Some aviation experts believe the variety of airspeed problems points not to a defective sensor but a more fundamental problem with the processor that collects the data displayed in the cockpit."
2415,"“I don’t think it’s a vane failure. It makes no sense,” said Bjorn Fehrm, an aeronautical engineer. “It’s more like a computer failure or a component failure, a system failure.”"
2416,"The air data inertial reference unit is the processor that helps collect data from the probes and vanes on the plane. A malfunction in that system could be consistent with data inaccuracies that triggered MCAS, aviation experts said."
2417,Mr. Nurcahyo acknowledged that Indonesian investigators were looking into the possibility of an issue with the air data inertial reference unit.
2418,"But if a processor glitch could have fatally triggered MCAS in Lion Air, then the attention thus far solely on the angle of attack sensors may have been a distraction for airlines desperate to gauge the safety of their Max planes."
2419,"In the days after the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the carrier’s chief executive brought up both angle of attack sensors and MCAS in the context of the crash. He did not mention the air data inertial reference unit."
2420,"“Airplanes are very complex machines,” said Mr. Soejatman, the Indonesian aviation consultant. “If you don’t have all the information that should be out there, how are you supposed to know how to fix them?”"

2422,"Re “As Uproar Builds, U.S. Grounds Jets Days After Crash” (front page, March 14):"
2423,"Daniel K. Elwell, acting administrator of the Federal Aviation Authority, originally said the Boeing 737 Max 8 plane would continue to fly because there were no known “systemic performance issues” (other than the fact that two of the same type of plane crashed within six months of each other). It is exactly for that reason that you don’t allow the planes to fly. The prudent thing to do would be to act on the side of caution and ground the planes."
2424,Let’s face it. The main reason the planes were not grounded sooner is that Boeing is an American company and the Trump administration was greatly concerned about the financial hit to the economy that would inevitably follow. There was no concern about passenger safety. Mr. Trump views everything in terms of the bottom line. He always has and he always will.
2425,"Gary ShareshianHamilton, N.J."
2426,To the Editor:
2427,"As a lifelong safety engineer, I am horrified by the events leading President Trump and the F.A.A. to finally ground the 737 Max 8 fleet."
2428,The relationship of the regulatory oversight guaranteeing the safety of travel and the companies involved — the regulated — represents a failure to establish and maintain an adequate safety culture. 
2429,"You describe in “Pressure on U.S. to Cease Flights of Troubled Jets” (front page, March 13) an appeal by the head of Boeing directly to President Trump not to take this action. You describe how Boeing and others are allowed by the F.A.A. to choose their own employees to help certify their planes “to help the F.A.A. stretch its limited resources.”"
2430,"A former head of the National Transportation Safety Board is quoted as saying: “It’s a very cozy relationship. The manufacturer essentially becomes both the manufacturer and the regulator, because of the lack of the ability of government to do the job.”"
2431,"The steps needed now are clear to any layman: The fleet must remain grounded until the N.T.S.B. determines the root cause of the crashes and it is fixed, with approval of a strong and independent regulator."
2432,"While this is underway, Congress must investigate the coziness that exists between the F.A.A. and those it regulates. "

2434,To the Editor:
2435,"As a shareholder, I am dismayed that Boeing has tarnished its reputation for excellence and safety in the name of corporate greed. It created a good airplane that seems to have a flaw in the design of a new flight-control system. Pilots were apparently not adequately informed of the changes nor were they trained to deal with a possible malfunction."
2436,"Instead of being forthcoming and transparent, Boeing had to be dragged into doing something to fix the problem. When passengers’ lives are at stake, that isn’t good enough. Shame on Boeing."
2437,"Sidney RosenbergGlen Head, N.Y. "
2438,"For about nine hours, Sead Nikaj’s flight back home to New York from Istanbul was smooth."
2439,"But as the plane was crossing over Maine on Saturday, it hit a patch of severe turbulence, he said. Mr. Nikaj said he watched the woman next to him fly out of her seat. Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. People banged their heads, screamed and prayed."
2440,For about 10 to 15 minutes — but what felt like an eternity to Mr. Nikaj — he thought he was going to die.
2441,"“I said, ‘God help me,’” he said."
2442,"The Turkish Airlines plane landed safely at Kennedy Airport, but at least 30 people were taken to hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries because of the turbulence, the authorities said."
2443,"One flight attendant broke her leg, said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The rest of the injuries were minor, and included “bumps, bruises and cuts,” Mr. Coleman said."
2444,"But the turbulence left the plane cabin full of bloodied and shaken passengers. Several ambulances rushed to the airport as the plane landed, in a chaotic scene that Mr. Nikaj said he keeps replaying."
2445,He said he would never fly again.
2446,"“I’m done with it, I’m definitely done with it, experiencing what I experienced today,” he said."
2447,"In a statement, the airline said it was “deeply saddened by this unfortunate experience” and that it was closely monitoring the health status of the injured passengers."
2448,"The flight, number 001 and a Boeing 777 plane, encountered the turbulence about 45 minutes before it landed at 5:35 p.m., the authorities said."
2449,"Mr. Nikaj said he was returning from a trip to Albania, where his parents live. He said that when the plane went through a small patch of turbulence about 40 minutes before landing, passengers were directed to put on their seatbelts."
2450,"Then a second, larger burst of turbulence seemed to come out of nowhere."
2451,"“It was crazy, really crazy,” Mr. Nikaj said. “All that time, people are screaming, people are praying. It was like something that I never experienced.”"
2452,"The pilot then announced everything was under control, and 10 minutes later, the plane landed, Mr. Nikaj said."
2453,"“Until we parked it, I couldn’t believe we were alive,” he said."
2454,"The Federal Aviation Administration said in a statement that the pilot had declared an emergency and reported that several passengers were injured. Several ambulances arrived at the airport, and 30 people were taken to local hospitals, mostly to the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Mr. Coleman said."
2455,"“It was crazy,” said Sonali Saili, a wheelchair dispatcher who saw passengers being rolled across the terminal floor on stretchers to a line of emergency vehicles outside. “There were people with broken limbs and bandages.”"
2456,Mr. Nikaj said the people with the worst injuries were let off the plane first.
2457,"“There were a lot of wounded people,” said Andrew Kotounis, a Terminal 1 skycap who saw people from the flight trickling out through the departures area, most on foot and some on stretchers. He said he heard waiting family members of the Turkish Airline passengers describing frantic phone calls from the plane."
2458,"Mr. Nikaj said he drove home his wife and children, who had met him at the airport, and then drove himself to a hospital. He thought he had injured his chest trying to help the woman next to him who had flown out of her seat."
2459,"Turbulence is the leading cause of injuries to passengers and flight attendants, excluding fatal accidents, according to the F.A.A. In 2017, 17 passengers and members of the flight crew were injured in turbulence, according to the F.A.A. In 2016, that number was 44. Since 2002 the highest annual number has been 94, in 2009."
2460,Southwest Airlines sued its mechanics’ union late Thursday for what the airline claimed was an illegal work slowdown that grounded planes and has resulted in as many as 100 flight cancellations a day since mid-February.
2461,"The carrier said its mechanics had taken an unusually high number of planes out of service in recent weeks, a move seen as a negotiating tactic in a contract dispute. Negotiations most recently broke down over how much maintenance the airline would be allowed to outsource."
2462,"Last month, mechanics pulled as many as 62 planes from service in one day, resulting in schedule disruptions across Southwest’s network, according to the lawsuit. By comparison, the airline said, it expects to have about 14 planes out of service on an average day, and can operate a normal schedule with as many as 35 grounded aircraft, out of a fleet of 752."
2463,"The mechanics, who are members of the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, have cited safety concerns as the reason for taking the aircraft out of service. The airline argued in its suit that many of the planes had been taken out of commission for relatively minor issues that did not affect their ability to fly."
2464,The union’s national director issued a statement last week denying that the mechanics were improperly grounding aircraft.
2465,"“Southwest has a legitimate argument here, and it is trying to strike this balance between keeping everything safe and not having the airplanes taken out of service for what would be considered extremely minor, noncritical matters,” said Henry Harteveldt, founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a travel industry analysis firm in San Francisco. “What Southwest wants to make sure is that if a plane is taken out of service, it’s correct — it’s not because of what’s considered a nuisance item.”"
2466,"As an example, Mr. Harteveldt said, it would be fine for a plane to fly with a broken coffee maker or a dead bulb in a passenger reading light, but those kinds of issues could be used to justify grounding planes."
2467,"“Yesterday’s action does not alter our goal of reaching an agreement that benefits our hardworking maintenance employees, nor does it change the company’s unwavering commitment to safety,” Russell McCrady, Southwest’s vice president of labor relations, said in a statement. “We will not stray from our focus on rewarding our mechanics, while we work to shield our employees and customers from unnecessary disruptions within the operation.”"
2468,The union did not respond to a request for comment.
2469,"Southwest and its mechanics have been in turbulent contract negotiations for years. The airline previously sued its mechanics in 2017, when the union encouraged its members to participate in a boycott of overtime work. That lawsuit remains pending after the union and the airline failed to reach a contract agreement."
2470,"Mr. Harteveldt said that it was not unusual for airlines and their unions to wind up in court during contract negotiations, and that usually these kinds of disputes did not have long-term effects on the airlines’ operations."
2471,"RENTON, Wash. — Boeing on Wednesday made its most overt acknowledgment that new software in its jets could have played a role in two deadly crashes as it tries to convince pilots, airlines and regulators around the world that a coming fix will solve the problem."
2472,"Before a meeting with more than 200 pilots and airline executives at its factory in Renton, Wash., Boeing, for the first time, publicly laid out its proposed updates to the software as well other changes to the 737 Max that it hopes will get the plane flying again. The changes would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data, two issues at the center of the investigations into the crashes."
2473,"“The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we’re making will address any of these accidents,” Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president for product strategy, said in a press briefing."
2474,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
2475,"The company, which was eager to complete the plane quickly for competitive reasons, also faced new scrutiny in Washington on Wednesday over the development and certification of the jet, a process that regulators heavily delegated to Boeing. Senators, in two congressional hearings with Boeing’s regulators, pressed for more oversight and raised the possibility of overhauling the system."
2476,"The acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration, in a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, said that the agency initially scrutinized the new software independently, but ultimately left it to Boeing. The official, Daniel Elwell, also said he did not believe the automated system had been tested with a scenario involving a faulty sensor, which was a concern in a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in October."
2477,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
2478,"“The F.A.A. decided to do safety on the cheap, which is neither cheap nor safe,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut. He added that he planned to introduce legislation to reform the system, which he said “is so fatally riddled with flaws.”"
2479,"The F.A.A. “put the fox in charge of the henhouse,” he said."
2480,"Boeing and the F.A.A. are playing defense on two fronts, as prosecutors, regulators and lawmakers investigate their responses to the crashes and their approval of the plane."
2481,"During his hearing, Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, said he was looking into how the F.A.A. handled the crisis. In the days after an Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people this month, global regulators grounded the jets, while the United States initially held off doing the same."
2482,"“Clearly, confidence in F.A.A. as the gold standard for aviation safety has been shaken,” he said. Mr. Scovel said he wanted to understand why the agency was the last major aviation regulator in the world to “drive risk to zero” by grounding the 737 Max."
2483,"Mr. Scovel also said he would investigate why the F.A.A. approved the software system, which is known as MCAS, including the decision not to include it in the operating instructions and not to require additional training for pilots. When the plane was introduced, pilots learned about the 737 Max on an iPad."
2484,"Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also said in the hearing that his agency was “examining the U.S. design certification process.”"
2485,"The F.A.A. has long allowed plane makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. In recent years, Boeing was able to choose its own employees to help regulators approve the 737 Max."
2486,"In a separate hearing with the Senate Appropriations Committee’s transportation subcommittee, the Transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, called the practice “necessary.”"
2487,"Ms. Chao stressed that the F.A.A. sets safety standards that manufacturers must meet while developing aircraft. The certification process, she said, “is, of course, subject to oversight and supervision by the F.A.A.”"
2488,"When asked by the subcommittee’s chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, about concerns that the arrangement “sacrifices potentially the safety of the traveling public,” Ms. Chao said that the possibility was “troubling.”"
2489,"Mr. Elwell, during his hearing, said that the F.A.A. initially oversaw certification for the software, but delegated more authority over time, “when we had the comfort level” that the Boeing employees were knowledgeable enough about the system."
2490,"Mr. Elwell later said that practice was “part of the fabric of what we’ve used to become as safe as we are today” and that without it, the F.A.A. would need 10,000 more employees and $1.8 billion for its certification offices."
2491,"Boeing has defended the process, saying the plane adhered to all F.A.A. safety rules."
2492,"A Boeing official cautioned against drawing any definite conclusions until more is known. “In general, the process has worked and continues to work, and we see no reason to overhaul the process,” this official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the investigations."
2493,"The Boeing official said that in most accidents, many things go wrong. Based on what is known about the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia, Boeing said it felt that MCAS was in need of updating."
2494,"“We’ve seen two accidents now and we believe it is appropriate to make that link in the chain more robust,” the official said."
2495,"The updated software, which Boeing outlined on Wednesday, will rely on data from two so-called angle of attack sensors, so the plane won’t have a single point of failure. It will also make it easier for pilots to override the system, which was originally designed to push down the nose of the plane repeatedly and aggressively."
2496,The company said the new software had been extensively tested and officials from the F.A.A. had taken test flights on updated jets. Pilots from United States airlines have also tried out the updated system in flight simulators.
2497,"Dennis A. Muilenburg, Boeing’s chief executive, has avoided the spotlight in recent weeks and was not in Renton on Wednesday for the news briefing or the meeting with pilots and executives."
2498,"Boeing also said it would retrofit jets with a safety feature that was previously optional. The feature — known as a disagree light, which is activated if two key sensors on the plane do not produce the same readings — will be standard on new Max planes. The disagree light might have helped the pilots in the Lion Air crash identify the source of the problem."
2499,"During a testy exchange, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, repeatedly pressed the F.A.A. official, Mr. Elwell, on whether all available safety features should be required on planes. Mr. Elwell responded that “safety-critical pieces of equipment on an aircraft are mandatory.” He added, “If there is any manufacturer that sells a safety-critical part a la carte, we will not permit it.”"
2500,But Mr. Elwell added that he found it “hard to believe that a safety company like an airline would save a couple thousand dollars on an option that might improve safety.”
2501,"Although the fix is apparently ready, Boeing provided no timetable for installing it. The F.A.A. must first approve the new software and the training. Then, Boeing said, each existing 737 Max will need to be manually upgraded, a procedure that takes an hour for each plane. Finally, Max pilots will need to receive an additional 30-minute training program about the software."
2502,"Even if the F.A.A. does approve the changes, regulators in Europe, Canada, China, Brazil and elsewhere might move more slowly. “Certification around the world will be at the discretion of those regulators around the world, and so we can’t comment on timing,” Mr. Sinnett said."
2503,"PARIS/SEATTLE/SINGAPORE — Minutes after take-off, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation."
2504,"A key sensor had been wrecked, possibly by a bird strike. As soon as they retracted the landing gear, flaps and slats, it began to feed faulty data into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), designed to prevent stalls."
2505,"Flying faster than recommended, the crew struggled with MCAS. But the high speed made it nearly impossible to use the controls to pull the nose up."
2506,"Moments later, the Boeing Co jet hit the ground, killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight."
2507,Ethiopian authorities said on Thursday that the pilots followed all the correct procedures in trying to keep MCAS from sending the plane into a fatal dive.
2508,But the full picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from a preliminary report and a newly released data plot showing how crew and technology interacted.
2509,"The airline's youngest-ever captain, a 29-year-old with an impressive 8,100 hours flying time, and his rookie 25-year-old co-pilot may have made a crucial mistake by leaving the engines at full take-off power, according to data and other pilots."
2510,"By the end, the aircraft was traveling at 500 knots (575 mph, 926 kph), far beyond its design limits. "
2511,"That and some other potential missteps may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive, experts said after studying the data. "
2512,"""Power being left in take-off power while leveling off at that speed is not a normal procedure,"" said one U.S. pilot, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media. ""I can't imagine a scenario where you'd need to do that."""
2513,"The Ethiopian Airlines crash, and another in Indonesia five months earlier, have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis as its top-selling jetliner is grounded worldwide, and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa's most successful companies."
2514,"Boeing is working on a software fix for MCAS and extra pilot training, which its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, said would prevent similar events from happening again."
2515,BIRD STRIKE 
2516,Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take-off. 
2517,A sudden data spike suggests a bird hit the plane as it was taking off and sheared away a vital airflow sensor.
2518,"As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the damaged 'angle of attack' sensor, which tells pilots what angle the aircraft has relative to its forward movement, may have set off a volatile chain of events."
2519,"In both cases, the faulty sensor tricked the plane's computer into thinking the nose was too high and the aircraft was about to stall, or lose lift. The anti-stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft's ""trim"" system, normally used to maintain level flight."
2520,"The first time the MCAS software kicked in, the Ethiopian Airlines pilots quickly countered the movement by flicking switches under their thumbs - they had recognized the movements as the same type all flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air flight. "
2521,"But data suggest they did not hold the buttons down long enough to fully counteract the computer's movements. At that point, they were a mere 3,000 feet above the airport, so low that a new warning - a computerized voice saying ""don't sink"" - sounded in the cabin.  "
2522,"When MCAS triggered again, the jetliner's trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level, while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a ""stick shaker."" "
2523,"This time, the pilots countered MCAS more effectively. But when they turned off the system - as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of the Lion Air disaster - the nose was still pointed downward, leaving the jetliner vulnerable."
2524,"The combination of excess speed and cutting off the system while the plane was still leaning downwards meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column, and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible. "
2525,"'PULL UP, PULL UP'"
2526,"The captain called out ""pull up"" three times. The co-pilot reported problems to air traffic control."
2527,"In the meantime, the aircraft's speed remained abnormally high. "
2528,"The bird strike and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too. In such cases, pilots know to turn off automatic engine settlings and control thrust manually."
2529,"But the report says ""the throttles did not move,"" without elaborating. Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power. Other 737 pilots say that made the crew's job tougher by making the controls much harder to move."
2530,"Some experienced pilots said there were an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots' attention, which Muilenburg addressed on Thursday. "
2531,"""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment,"" Muilenburg said. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" "
2532,"Among the distractions was a ""clacker"" warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast."
2533,"As the nose gradually fell, the pilots turned to a last-resort device to adjust the plane's trim. "
2534,The captain asked the young co-pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the center console to lift the nose and make it easier to recover from the dive. 
2535,"But it was too hard to move the wheel. Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together. The captain, according to the report, said it was not enough. "
2536,MCAS RE-ACTIVATES
2537,"In a possible last-ditch attempt to level the plane, data suggests the pilots turned MCAS-related systems back on. That would also reactivate the electric trim system, and perhaps make it easier for the pilots to force the reluctant nose higher."
2538,Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration after Lion Air. The report did not address that.
2539,The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes. But data suggest they may have flicked the switches too gingerly. 
2540,"With its power restored, a final MCAS nose-down command kicked in, eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at an airspeed of up to 500 knots, far beyond the plane's operating limits."
2541,"As the 737 MAX plunged, G-forces turned negative, pulling occupants out of their seats and possibly inducing a feeling of weightlessness as the plane hurtled toward the ground."
2542,"Just six minutes after take off, the plane crashed into a field. "
2543," (Additional reporting by Jason Neely in Addis Ababa, Tracy Rucinski in Chicago, David Shepardson in Washington, Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Gerry Doyle)"
2544,Investigators at the crash site of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight have found new evidence that points to another connection to the earlier disaster involving the same Boeing jet.
2545,"The evidence, a piece of the Boeing 737 Max 8 jet that crashed in Ethiopia last weekend killing 157 people, suggests that the plane’s stabilizers were tilted upward, according to two people with knowledge of the recovery operations. At that angle, the stabilizers would have forced down the nose of the jet, a similarity with the Lion Air crash in October."
2546,"Although the crash investigations are still in the early phases, the new evidence potentially indicates that the two planes both had problems with a newly installed automated system on the 737 Max jet intended to prevent a stall."
2547,"This evidence ultimately contributed to American regulators’ decision to ground the 737 Max this week, according to the two people who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The Federal Aviation Administration said it had found physical evidence from the Ethiopian crash that, along with satellite tracking data, suggested similarities between the two crashes."
2548,"As the investigations continue, Boeing has also been racing to finish a software update for the 737 Max aircraft, which is expected by April. Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration have continued to stand by the safety of the plane. Yet Boeing’s update will modify features of the jet around the automated system that investigators have suggested might have played a role in the Lion Air crash."
2549,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
2550,"The new evidence found at the crash site in Ethiopia, a piece of equipment known as a jackscrew, controls the angle of the horizontal stabilizers. The stabilizers can be triggered by the automated system, known as MCAS."
2551,The stabilizers could have been tilted upward for other reasons. Authorities in France are analyzing the black boxes of the Ethiopian Airlines plane for more information.
2552,"Indonesian and American authorities are also looking into whether MCAS contributed to the Lion Air crash that killed 189 people in October. In that disaster, the automated system, possibly based on faulty sensor readings, may have repeatedly pushed the nose of the plane down, creating a struggle between the new flight control system and the pilots."
2553,"After the Lion Air crash, Boeing backed the safety its planes and 737 Max aircraft continued to crisscross the planet. In the background, Boeing has been working on a software update for the planes."
2554,"Boeing designed the 737 Max as an updated, more fuel-efficient version of its best-selling 737 aircraft. The Max’s engines were bigger and mounted farther forward on its wings, a configuration that could push the nose upward toward a stall in certain circumstances. To compensate for that, Boeing installed MCAS to automatically push the nose down to counteract those forces, in the hopes of making the 737 Max safer and able to handle like its predecessors."
2555,"That similarity was part of Boeing’s pitch to the F.A.A. and airlines: Because the plane handled like previous 737s, pilots would not need to be retrained to fly it. Regulators and carriers agreed, and the pilots’ 737 Max training typically amounted to a course on an iPad and a few white papers."
2556,"Jumbo jets are being replaced by planes like the Boeing 737: smaller, fuel-efficient aircraft capable of traveling greater distances."
2557,"The automated system, which may have pushed down the nose of the aircraft in the Lion Air crash, activates if just one of two sensors mounted on the aircraft’s exterior says the nose is too high. That means a single malfunctioning sensor could force the plane in the wrong direction, as has been theorized in the Lion Air crash."
2558,"Boeing is updating the software to require data from both sensors for the system to kick in, according to pilots at several major airlines and two lawmakers briefed on the matter."
2559,"Modern aircraft are built with backups and redundancies for virtually every crucial component. So when something breaks — as things often do — it won’t threaten the safety of a flight. Boeing’s software fix indicates that the plane maker shipped the 737 Max with a single point of failure, a potentially dangerous anomaly in aviation, and the Federal Aviation Administration approved it."
2560,"Such a single point of failure on a modern jet is rare and far riskier than having backup systems, said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at American Airlines’ pilots union and a 737 captain. “A single point of failure on a significant system that points my nose towards the ground?” he said. “Now that to me seems just a little bit over the line.”"
2561,"Boeing has also said its software fix would cause the automated system to push the nose down at a slower rate, Mr. Michaelis said. The system currently pushes the nose down by 2.7 degrees in 10 seconds, Mr. Michaelis said. “That’s a pretty aggressive pitch down,” he said, particularly just after takeoff."
2562,The update will also deal with another concern in the wake of the Lion Air crash: pilots fighting with MCAS.
2563,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
2564,Investigators have said it appears that the Lion Air pilots repeatedly pulled the plane’s nose back up after the automated system pushed it down. This continued until it was too late and the aircraft slammed into the Java Sea.
2565,"The system is designed to push down the nose of the aircraft if sensors are saying it is necessary — overriding what pilots may be trying to do. The software update would limit the number of times MCAS tries to push down the nose, preventing it from struggling with a pilot, according to the pilots."
2566,Boeing has indicated the software fix will “make an already safe aircraft even safer.” The F.A.A. has said it expects to tell airlines “no later than April” to incorporate the software fix.
2567,"Pilots at American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines said they still generally felt comfortable flying the 737 Max jets, in part because they are now aware of the automated system. Boeing did not fully disclose the system to pilots until after the Lion Air crash."
2568,"Reviews of tens of thousands of 737 Max flights at American, Southwest and United showed the automated system never activated, presumably because their pilots never forced the noses of their aircraft too high. Some pilots said they were concerned the system could be activated by a single inaccurate sensor, pushing the plane toward the ground right after takeoff, when the margin for error was thin. But they added that in that situation, they could always flip a switch to automatically turn off systems like MCAS."
2569,"“It is, of course, a concern for pilots,” said James LaRosa, a United Airlines’ 737 pilot and union official. “But if it happened to me or our pilots, I know that our pilots would react.”"
2570,"When Boeing’s Dreamliner was grounded in 2013, it took more than $20 million and three months to fix the problem. The crisis over its 737 Max jet could be even harder to manage, given the incalculable reputational risk after two fatal crashes."
2571,"The short-term costs such as a software fix to the plane are likely to be manageable for Boeing, but the bigger financial unknown is whether airlines lose confidence in the Max, the company’s best-selling jet. Some 4,600 planes are on order, accounting for around $550 billion in future revenue."
2572,"Since the second crash, in Ethiopia on Sunday, shares of Boeing have dropped nearly 11 percent."
2573,"“Reputationally and financially, this is painful,” said Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at Teal Group Corp., a consulting firm."
2574,"With all of the Max planes now grounded around the world, Boeing’s first priority is developing a fix. Boeing has been working with American regulators to roll out a software update and new training guidelines in the months since the first crash, off Indonesia in October. The update is expected by April, but a final solution could take more time depending on what investigators determine happened in the Ethiopia disaster."
2575,"The longer it takes to find a solution, the higher the price tag. The battery fix for the Dreamliner jets amounted to $465,000 per plane, according to Carter Copeland, an analyst at Melius Research. Based on those costs, he estimates that Boeing could spend nearly $1 billion to resolve issues with the 737 Max fleet."
2576,"Airlines, which have 350 of the planes in their fleets, have also begun to demand compensation for their losses during the grounding. It costs an estimated $1 million to lease a replacement jet for three months."
2577,"“It’s quite obvious that we will not take the cost related to the new aircraft that we have to park temporarily,” said Bjorn Kjos, the chief executive of Norwegian Air, which had to take 18 of the planes out of service after an order from European regulators on Tuesday. “We will send this bill to those who produce this aircraft.”"
2578,"[In a big shift, China was among the first to ground the jet.]"
2579,Boeing could also face lawsuits from the families of passengers who died in the disasters. The Dreamliner had battery problems but never crashed.
2580,"A company the size of Boeing will probably be able to absorb such costs. Boeing, an aerospace giant that builds commercial and military aircraft, makes more than $100 billion in revenue a year."
2581,"The bigger challenge for Boeing is how it will handle future orders. If deliveries are delayed because the plane needs to be redesigned, the manufacturer is likely to have to offer discounts to carriers with orders."
2582,"There is also a broader risk that, if the passenger backlash to the Max lasts, the manufacturer could lose some corporate customers in the long run. Such a shift would give an advantage to its European rival Airbus, which makes a similar fuel-efficient plane, the A320neo."
2583,"[As planes become more automated, some worry pilots are losing flying skills.]"
2584,"But it’s unlikely that airlines will cancel their Max purchases outright. Carriers typically put down a deposit of around 20 percent for their orders on the $120 million plane, which is paid out over time. It can be difficult to get out of those commitments without solid evidence that there’s a structural problem with the aircraft, airline executives and analysts said."
2585,"Even if customers could walk away from their Boeing orders without losing money, they probably wouldn’t. The aircraft manufacturing business is essentially a global duopoly. And Airbus has a yearslong backlog."
2586,"“I don’t think anyone will abandon them,” said Jonathan G. Ornstein, the chief executive of Mesa Airlines, who operated a fleet of 737s in his previous role at the helm of Virgin Express, a European airline. Mr. Ornstein called Boeing “customer-centric” and said he expected that the company would bend over backward to maintain its rapport with carriers."
2587,"“The manufacturers do not pull up the bridge across the moat when this happens,” Mr. Ornstein said. “It’s much more of a cooperative relationship.”"
2588,"Three American airlines — Southwest, United and American — fly the 737 Max aircraft, and one, Alaska, has ordered some. But Boeing has delivered hundreds more around the world and have thousands on order."

3079,By Karl Russell
3080,"The most significant fallout may be from the new scrutiny over the manufacturer’s relationship to its regulator, the Federal Aviation Administration."
3081,"On Wednesday, top House Democrats with oversight of the agency said that they would begin a thorough review of the process used to determine the airworthiness of the 737 Max."
3082,"“There must be a rigorous investigation into why the aircraft, which has critical safety systems that did not exist on prior models, was certified without requiring additional pilot training,” said Representatives Peter DeFazio of Oregon and Rick Larsen of Washington."
3083,"“The narrative that’s out there right now is that Boeing might have gotten favorable treatment from the F.A.A.,” said Mr. Aboulafia, the analyst. “That’s not good.”"
3084,"Through a program established in 2005, Boeing and other aircraft manufacturers have been able to choose employees to help certify their planes for regulatory compliance. The program is meant to help the F.A.A. stretch its limited resources. But critics say that system gives too much authority over the process to Boeing."
3085,"“It has become a largely self-certified system,” said Mary Schiavo, the former inspector general of the Transportation Department. Over the last several days, unions representing pilots and flight attendants have been raising the alarm over potential conflicts in the regulatory process that could put their members at risk."
3086,"“The F.A.A. has got to stop treating the airlines and manufacturers as their clients, and get back to doing their job with oversight for the American people,” said Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants."
3087,"Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot, said his members had long been concerned about the minimal training required for pilots to become qualified to fly the Max models."
3088,"“The F.A.A. certified the aircraft to be flown and sold without a simulator,” said Mr. Tajer. The certification process, he said, has prompted him to ask the F.A.A.: “What is your relationship to Boeing?”"
3089,"[On Wednesday, Canada was the latest country to ban Boeing 737 Max planes from its airspace. Read the latest about the bans here, or read more updates on the Ethiopian Airlines crash here.]"
3090,"As he waited on Tuesday morning to board Southwest Flight 2315 from Oakland to Los Angeles, William Gonzales learned that the plane that he was about to board was a Boeing 737 Max 8. "
3091,"“This is the Max?” Mr. Gonzales asked, his eyes widening. “I’m not getting on that plane if it’s the Max.”"
3092,"The model, which on Sunday was involved in a fatal crash for the second time in five months, had by Tuesday been banned from the national airspace of China, Australia and countries in the European Union. At least 34 airlines around the world have grounded their planes since Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crashed on its way from Ethiopia to Kenya, killing all 157 people on board. "
3093,"But almost all the American and Canadian carriers that fly the 737 Max series — including Southwest, American Airlines, Air Canada and United, which has the Max 9 — said they would continue to use the planes as scheduled. On Tuesday, the Canadian carrier Sunwing said that it was temporarily grounding its four Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft because of growing airspace bans overseas and “evolving commercial reasons.”"
3094,"After scrolling through his phone to look up the plane model, which turned out to be a Max 8, Mr. Gonzales said he would take a later flight."
3095,"“There are enough flights going to L.A., and I can miss a meeting,” he said. "
3096,"But Mr. Gonzales seemed to be the exception — onboard the flight there was anything but alarm, and disarray and disruption seemed to be minimal at airports. "
3097,[Times reporters rode on two Boeing 737 Max 8 flights on Tuesday. Here’s what it was like.]
3098,"In a statement Monday evening, the Federal Aviation Administration, which oversees air safety in the United States, said that while there were reported similarities between the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the crash in October of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia, the investigation into the Ethiopia crash “has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions.”"
3099,"The statement added, “This aircraft has a strong safety record in the U.S., where the F.A.A. continues to closely monitor its performance as part of our everyday oversight of aviation safety.”"
3100,"According to the F.A.A. statement, there are 74 Max 8s in the U.S.-registered fleet, and 387 worldwide."
3101,"As carriers grounded those planes, on many airlines, passengers were automatically being rebooked on other flights — without even having to call the airline. Norwegian Air Shuttle,  Norway’s largest airline, which has 18 Max 8 planes in its fleet, was offering free rebooking and refunds to affected passengers, for example."
3102,"How can airlines already operating at capacity move around so many passengers to other planes? Norwegian’s statement hinted at the logistical complexity. “All aircraft that are currently airborne will continue to its destination or return to home base. We are now working on reallocating our fleet options with other aircraft types, rebookings to other flights and combining flights to minimize inconvenience caused to our passengers.”"
3103,"TUI, the world’s largest charter airline, which operates five Max 8 planes, said on Tuesday that they were grounded. “Any customers due to fly home today on a 737 Max 8 from their holiday will be flown back on another aircraft,” the company’s statement said. “Customers due to travel in the coming days will also travel on holiday as planned on other aircraft.”"
3104,Air Canada canceled its Tuesday flight from Halifax to London because Britain had banned the plane from its airspace. 
3105,"In a statement, Air Canada said it was working to rebook affected customers as soon as possible through its Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa hubs. It also said customers could rebook their flights at no added cost."
3106,"“The reality is that flight cancellations even before this crash were a part of travel,” said Douglas Kidd, the executive director at the National Association of Airline Passengers."
3107,"According to data at FlightAware.com, a website that tracks flight activity live, major British airports like Heathrow and Gatwick did not appear to show a spike in the usual number of canceled flights."
3108,"Passengers choosing to cancel their flights on American carriers scheduled on Max 8s are not being offered refunds by the airlines. Dan Landson, a spokesman for Southwest, wrote in an email that, “we are not issuing refunds of nonrefundable fares though we are working with customers individually who wish to rebook their flight to another aircraft type.” Southwest does not charge change fees, and passengers are able to change their flights, paying only the difference in fare."
3109,"American Airlines does charge its passengers change fees. When a passenger tweeted on Tuesday that his family was looking to rebook a nonrefundable flight, the airline’s Twitter account responded, “We don’t have a travel waiver program in affect, but we are confident in the safe operation of all of our aircraft, including the 737 MAX 8.”"
3110,"New York’s La Guardia Airport, which serves only North American destinations, was characteristically bustling on Tuesday, its operations more affected by the major construction out front than the nerves of rattled fliers within."
3111,"“Statistically, flying is the safest way to travel,” said Michael Cadesky, 65, a certified public accountant from Toronto. “It’s safer than taking the taxi into Midtown.”"
3112,"Mr. Cadesky, who takes around 30 flights annually, said he did not care whether he flew on a Max 8 because he suspected the past two crashes were due to poor maintenance or mechanical error, something he doesn’t worry about with Air Canada, which he flew on Tuesday."
3113,"Thomas Fuller, John L. Dorman, Tariro Mzezewa, Nate Schweber and Justin Sablich contributed reporting."
3114,"If you’re an airline passenger, automation is your friend — setting aside the fears over its role in the crashes of two Boeing 737 Max planes in the past five months. The gradual spread of automation through the civil aircraft fleet is a primary reason the accident rate worldwide has fallen from about four accidents per million flights in 1977 to less than 0.4 today. Pilots today, as one former pilot puts it, are less stick-and-rudder movers than they are overseers of systems."
3115,"Automation is not without its own hazards, though. As it has become ubiquitous in cockpits, automation-related accidents have come to make up a significant proportion of all air disasters. In 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration published a study of accidents over the previous two decades and found that reports of “unexpected or unexplained” behavior of automated systems were present in 46 percent of the accident reports and 60 percent of the major incident reports collected by the researchers."
3116,"There are two main ways in which automation can lead to catastrophe. Sometimes a malfunction causes the autopilot to run haywire and put the plane into a dangerous state. This is what seems to have happened to the Lion Air 737 Max that crashed last October shortly after takeoff from Jakarta, Indonesia. (It may have occurred in the case of Sunday’s Ethiopian Airlines crash as well; on Wednesday, the F.A.A. said that newly available satellite data “indicates some similarities” between the two accidents.)"
3117,"Because the 737 Max had been outfitted with larger new engines that could cause its nose to pitch dangerously skyward, Boeing had added a maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or M.C.A.S., that would kick in and push the nose down if necessary. But a faulty sensor fed incorrect information to the Lion Air flight’s M.C.A.S., causing it to put the plane into a steep dive. Pilots on at least two flights in the United States reported similar problems, but in those cases they were able to disengage the autopilot system and recover control of the plane. "
3118,"Another way that automation can come to grief is when the system works as designed but the pilot becomes confused and does the wrong thing. In 2009, Air France 447 was over the middle of the Atlantic en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris when its speed sensors became clogged with ice and stopped feeding data to the autopilot. The autopilot then switched itself off and handed control of the plane over to the pilots, as it was designed to do under such circumstances. The pilots, however, became disoriented and one of them inadvertently pulled the plane’s nose up, so it climbed and lost a dangerous amount of speed. Worse, the pilot didn’t realize that with the autopilot off, the plane’s computer was no longer preventing the wing from aerodynamically stalling. In less than five minutes, a perfectly good airplane went from cruising at 32,000 feet to hitting the ocean."
3119,"In both kinds of events, pilots find themselves having to suddenly figure out why a complex system is no longer acting as expected and then take quick action based on that analysis. Moments of high stress are precisely those in which the human brain is least equipped to figure out complex situations."
3120,"The best way to deal with emergencies is to train and practice beforehand, so that response becomes automatic. Ironically, by turning over the mundane stick-and-rudder aspects of flying to computer automation, pilots are deprived of the opportunity to continually practice. This leaves them without the mental automation that might save them in a crisis."
3121,"Unfortunately, in the case of the 737 Max, it seems that Boeing has built a plane with a fundamental aeronautical issue that it thought would be resolved by adding a new automated system. But the company convinced airlines and the F.A.A. that the planes were essentially interchangeable with earlier models of 737, and therefore pilots who were already trained in flying older 737s would not need comprehensive additional training on the new system. The F.A.A. agreed with that conclusion. This would, among other things, save money on crew training and maintenance costs. That has proved to be a terrible miscalculation."
3122,"In the wake of a double disaster, Boeing has announced that it will release a software upgrade for the 737 Max. The company may indeed have solved the problem. It may be that the 737 Max will return to service with the patched software and never again suffer a mishap."
3123,"The problem is that it’s hard to prove a negative. Passengers won’t have any faith in the fix until decades have passed. And given that the flaws of humans and automatic systems have a well-demonstrated tendency to amplify each other at the worst possible moment, trusting Boeing’s solution could well be a risk that few airlines, passengers or safety regulators will be willing to take."
3124,"Jeff Wise is a science journalist, private pilot and the author of “The Taking of MH370.”"
3125,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
3126,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
3127,"During flight simulations recreating the problems with the doomed Lion Air plane, pilots discovered that they had less than 40 seconds to override an automated system on Boeing’s new jets and avert disaster."
3128,"The pilots tested a crisis situation similar to what investigators suspect went wrong in the Lion Air crash in Indonesia last fall. In the tests, a single sensor failed, triggering software designed to help prevent a stall."
3129,"Once that happened, the pilots had just moments to disengage the system and avoid an unrecoverable nose dive of the Boeing 737 Max, according to two people involved in the testing in recent days. Although the investigations are continuing, the automated system, known as MCAS, is a focus of authorities trying to determine what went wrong in the Lion Air disaster in October and the Ethiopian Airlines crash of the same Boeing model this month."
3130,"The software, as originally designed and explained, left little room for error. Those involved in the testing hadn’t fully understood just how powerful the system was until they flew the plane on a 737 Max simulator, according to the two people."
3131,"Compounding the flaws, pilots received limited training about the system before the first crash. During the final minutes, the captain of the Lion Air flight flipped through a technical manual trying to figure out what was happening."
3132,"In a tacit acknowledgment of the system’s problems, Boeing is expected to propose a software update that would give pilots more control over the system and make it less likely to trigger erroneously, according to three people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private meetings."
3133,"There are common procedures in place to counteract MCAS, as currently designed. If the system starts pushing the plane’s nose down, pilots can reverse the movement via a switch at their thumb, a typical reaction in that situation. In doing so, they can potentially extend the 40-second window, giving them more time to avoid a crash."
3134,"To fully neutralize the system, pilots would need to flip two more switches. That would shut off the electricity to a motor that allows the system to push the plane toward the ground. Then the pilots would need to crank a wheel to correct whatever problems had emerged."
3135,"The pilots, in the simulations, followed such procedures to successfully shut off the system and land safely. But they did so with a far better understanding of how it worked and prior knowledge that it would be triggered — benefits that the pilots of the fatal 737 Max crashes did not have."
3136,"If pilots don’t act hastily enough, attempts to disable the system can be too late. In the Lion Air crash, pilots used the thumb switch more than two dozen times to try to override the system. The system kept engaging nonetheless, most likely because of bad readings from a sensor, until the plane crashed into the Java Sea, killing all 189 people on board."
3137,"John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and a former 737 pilot, said pilots are highly likely to use the thumb switch to extend the 40-second window to several minutes. But that may still not be enough time to diagnose and solve the problem, especially if the pilots, like the Lion Air crew, were not informed of the system."
3138,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
3139,"“There is a limited window to solve this problem, and this crew didn’t even know that this system existed,” he said."
3140,A Boeing spokesman said that existing procedures for flying the 737 Max include how to respond to similar conditions. The spokesman added that Boeing had reinforced those procedures in a bulletin to pilots after the Lion Air crash.
3141,"“Our proposed software update incorporates additional limits and safeguards to the system and reduces crew workload,” the spokesman said in a statement."
3142,"The new software system was designed to be a safety feature, operating in the background to help avoid a stall. Taking data from a sensor, the system would engage if the nose of the jet was too high. It would then push down the nose of the plane to keep it from stalling."
3143,"In the current design, the system engages for 10 seconds at a time, with five-second pauses in between. Under conditions similar to the Lion Air flight, three engagements over just 40 seconds, including pauses, would send the plane into an unrecoverable dive, the two people involved in the testing said."
3144,"That conclusion agreed with a separate analysis by the American Airlines pilots’ union, which examined available data about the system, said Michael Michaelis, the union’s top safety official."
3145,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
3146,"One of the people involved in the training said MCAS was surprisingly powerful once tested in the simulator. Another person found the system controllable because it was expected. Before the Lion Air crash, Boeing and regulators agreed that pilots didn’t need to be alerted to the new system, and training was minimal."
3147,"At least some of the simulator flights happened on Saturday in Renton, Wash., where the 737 Max is built. Pilots from five airlines — American, United, Southwest, Copa and Fly Dubai — took turns testing how the Max would have responded with the software running as it was originally written, and with the updated version, known as 12.1."
3148,"In the simulations running the updated software, MCAS engaged, though less aggressively and persistently, and the pilots were also able to control the planes."
3149,"Boeing’s software update would require the system to rely on two sensors, rather than just one, and would not be triggered if the sensors disagreed by a certain amount, according to the three people. Given that the 737 Max has had both sensors already, many pilots and safety officials have questioned why the system was designed to rely on a single sensor, creating, in effect, one point of failure."
3150,"The update would also limit the system to engaging just once in most cases. And it would prevent the system from pushing the plane’s nose down more than a pilot could counteract by pulling up on the controls, the three people said."
3151,"In conversations with pilots and airline officials over the weekend, Boeing executives didn’t directly address why MCAS was designed with such flaws, one person with direct knowledge of the meetings said. Instead, the company stayed focused on the software update, the person said."
3152,The software changes still require approval by the Federal Aviation Administration. Pilots’ unions have said they are comfortable with the proposed changes but want to review them before making a decision. Pilots will be required to complete a training on the updated system on their iPads.
3153,"As regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration reviewed designs for Boeing’s newest passenger jet, they paid extra attention to several features, including the lithium batteries, the pressure fueling system and the inflatable safety slides."
3154,One feature that did not receive exceptional scrutiny: a new software system intended to prevent stalls.
3155,"That same software is suspected of playing a role in two deadly crashes involving the same jet, the Boeing 737 Max. Authorities around the world are now taking a closer look at the jet’s approval by the F.A.A., a process that relies heavily on Boeing employees to certify the safety of the plane."
3156,"The 737 Max was one of the first commercial jets approved under new rules, which delegated more authority to Boeing than had been the case when most previous planes were certified. And the software system did not raise warnings during the approval process. Top F.A.A. officials, who are briefed on significant safety issues, were not aware of the software system, according to three people with knowledge of the process."
3157,"The United States transportation secretary, Elaine L. Chao, on Tuesday called for her agency’s internal watchdog to open an inquiry into the process, saying that “safety is the top priority of the department.” Lawmakers in the United States are similarly pushing for a review, while Canada is looking into its approval of the plane’s American certification."
3158,"The scrutiny adds to the pressure at Boeing, an aerospace giant with a strong safety record. The 737 Max, its best-selling jet, has more than 4,600 pending orders, which are expected to bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in the coming years."
3159,The plane is now grounded as the company races to come up with a fix to the software. It is unclear when the jet will start flying again.
3160,"A spokesman for Boeing said the manufacturer would cooperate with the audit by the Department of Transportation. It has defended the certification process for the jet, saying that “the 737 Max was certified in accordance with the identical F.A.A. requirements and processes that have governed certification of all previous new airplanes and derivatives.”"
3161,"The F.A.A.’s response to the crisis has also come under scrutiny. As authorities in other countries moved quickly to ban the plane following the crash in Ethiopia this month, the American regulator held off."
3162,"The F.A.A. has been run by an acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, since January 2018. President Trump on Tuesday picked a former Delta Air Lines executive, Stephen Dickson, to become the permanent head of the agency."
3163,"Before a new plane can fly, the F.A.A., in partnership with manufacturers, assesses the technology, design and components that make up the jet. They look for potential safety issues that could affect the airworthiness of the plane."
3164,"The investigations into the crashes are ongoing, but the similarities between the two doomed flights suggest potential problems with the new software system, known as MCAS. In the case of the Lion Air crash in October, the automated system may have engaged based on erroneous data, creating a struggle for the pilots who were trying to maintain control."
3165,"But the software — powerful as it was — did not emerge as a major focus for the F.A.A. regulators who certified the Max as safe to fly in 2017, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process."
3166,"The software did not elicit what are known as special conditions, usually applied to a novel feature that requires additional regulations before it can be certified as safe. The plane’s non-rechargeable lithium batteries, for example, fell into that category."
3167,"Because the system was not flagged as especially noteworthy, senior F.A.A. officials were not even aware of it, according to the people involved in the effort who were not authorized to speak publicly about the process. Instead, it was only lower-level F.A.A. officials involved in the certification process who were even aware of MCAS."
3168,"The system was intended as a safety feature to make the 737 Max, which included significant design changes, fly like earlier models."
3169,"The new, more efficient engines on the 737 Max were larger and placed in a different location than previous generations. To compensate for the new aerodynamics, Boeing installed the software, which would force the nose of the plane down in certain circumstances. The goal was to help avoid a stall."
3170,"The F.A.A., in its approval of the plane, did not require training on the software, a sign that regulators did not see the system as critical for pilots to understand. Nor did the F.A.A. require pilots who could fly the predecessor 737 to train on a simulator in order to fly the Max. Most pilots did not know about MCAS until after the Lion Air crash."
3171,"The regulators also approved the software to be triggered after receiving data from only one so-called angle-of-attack sensor. The decision allowed for the system to have a single point of potential failure, a rarity in aviation safety."
3172,"Most important safety systems include redundancy. The coming software fix by Boeing will require data from both of the plane’s angle-of-attack sensors, among other changes, according to pilots and lawmakers."
3173,Certifying the 737 Max was a collaborative effort between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The regulator for decades has relied on employees at aircraft manufacturers to assist in the review process.
3174,"In 2005, the F.A.A. delegated more authority to companies, allowing manufacturers like Boeing to select their own employees who would help with certification work. And the 737 Max, which started going through certification process in 2012, was one of the first passenger jets to be approved under this new program."
3175,"In regards to the F.A.A. inquiry, a spokesman for the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General said the office was “currently developing the scope and objectives of our review” and expected “to formally announce and begin our audit work as soon as possible.”"
3176,"The F.A.A. declined to comment on Tuesday. The agency has said that its “aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs,” and that the certification of the Max “followed the F.A.A.’s standard certification process.”"
3177,"For regulators, outsourcing part of the review process was a way to stretch their resources. For American plane manufacturers like Boeing, it was critical for speeding up the regulatory process, as they try to compete with foreign rivals."
3178,"“People want oversight when something goes wrong,” said Peter Goelz, a former managing director of the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates aviation accidents. “But at the same time, they do not want these companies tied up in knots and not able to produce products for the marketplace.”"
3179,"Ali Bahrami, the F.A.A.’s top safety official, used to be an executive at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group whose members include Boeing as well as many other companies in the aviation industry. In 2013, he urged the F.A.A. to “allow maximum use of delegation.”"
3180,"“With the worldwide market shifting to Asia and the developing world, it would be detrimental to our competitiveness if foreign manufacturers are able to move improved products into the marketplace more quickly,” he said in prepared testimony for a congressional hearing."
3181,But the relationship between Boeing and the F.A.A. prompted concern even before the 737 Max crashes.
3182,"In 2012, an investigation by the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General found that F.A.A. managers had not always been supportive of efforts by agency employees to “hold Boeing accountable.” F.A.A. employees viewed their management as “having too close a relationship with Boeing officials,” according to a report from the inspector general’s office."
3183,"A 2015 report by the inspector general’s office expressed concern about the certification process. “During our review, industry representatives expressed concern that F.A.A.’s focus was often on paperwork — not on safety-critical items,” the report said."
3184,"The same year, a Boeing executive at a congressional hearing described the arrangement as effectively having an “arm of the F.A.A. within the Boeing Company.” Some 1,000 employees, the executive said, were part of the program."
3185,"“Boeing and the F.A.A. have had an almost symbiotic relationship,” said Michael Dreikorn, an aviation safety expert who previously worked in a safety oversight role at the F.A.A. “The relationship is too cozy.”"
3186,"ADDIS ABABA/SEATTLE — Faulty sensor readings and multiple automatic commands to push down the nose of a Boeing plane contributed to last month's fatal crash in Ethiopia, leaving the crew struggling to regain control, according to a preliminary accident report."
3187,"The first substantial account of the last minutes of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 from Addis Ababa to Nairobi on March 10 described how the captain three times called out: ""Pull up"" and was acknowledged by the first officer, but to no avail."
3188,"Boeing's top-selling aircraft, the 787 MAX, has been grounded worldwide since the March 10 disaster, which killed 157 people and came just five months after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia that killed 189 in a plane of the same model. "
3189,"Families of the victims, regulators and travelers around the world have been waiting for signs of whether the two crashes are linked, and the extent to which Boeing technology and the actions of the Ethiopian Airlines pilots played a role. "
3190,"The doomed flight crashed six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa in clear conditions. ""Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground,"" said the report by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority's Accident Prevention and Investigation Bureau published on Thursday."
3191,It recommended that Boeing review its flight-control systems and that regulators properly verify the review.
3192,"Ethiopian Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges told a news conference in the Ethiopian capital the crew had performed all the procedures recommended by Boeing, but safety experts said this was likely to spark debate with U.S. regulators and Boeing."
3193,Boeing said its coming software fix for the anti-stall system that pushes down the plane's nose would give pilots the authority to always override the system if activated by faulty sensor data.
3194,"""I'd like to reiterate our deepest sympathies are with the families and loved ones of those who lost their lives in the accident,"" said Boeing Commercial Airplanes President and Chief Executive Kevin McAllister."
3195,"""We will carefully review the AIB's preliminary report, and will take any and all additional steps necessary to enhance the safety of our aircraft."""
3196,QUESTIONS RAISED
3197,"The report leaves unanswered questions, some experts said, such as why the plane's trajectory did not respond to pilot and automatic commands including two final nose up commands from the pilots about 30 seconds before the plane crashed."
3198,"""Those should literally follow each other,"" said one U.S.-based expert, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""I think this is a more complex problem than what we initially thought."""
3199,"Questions have also been raised over whether crew followed guidance not to restore power to a troublesome anti-stall system following the sensor damage, possibly caused by a bird strike. The plane was also set to unusually high thrust, data suggested."
3200,A final report by Ethiopian authorities aided by air-safety experts from the United States and Europe is due to be published within a year.
3201,Some pilots expressed disquiet that following Boeing's checklist for the malfunction had not appeared to work.
3202,"""If the preliminary report from the Ethiopian authorities is accurate, the pilots quickly identified the malfunction and applied the manufacturer's checklist. Following this checklist did not appear to allow the pilots to regain control of the aircraft,"" said Captain Jason Goldberg, spokesman for Allied Pilots Association, which represents American Airlines pilots. "
3203,"The Federal Aviation Administration, which has come under fire over the way it decided to certify the plane and its so-called MCAS anti-stall software, cautioned the investigation had not yet concluded."
3204,"""We continue to work toward a full understanding of all aspects of this accident. As we learn more about the accident and findings become available, we will take appropriate action,"" the U.S. agency said in a statement."
3205,"Southwest Airlines Co and American Airlines Group Inc, the two largest U.S. operators of the MAX with 34 and 24 jets respectively and dozens more on order, each said on Thursday that they continued to await guidance from U.S. regulators and Boeing on when the MAX could resume flying."
3206,"Ethiopian investigators did not blame anyone for the crash, stressing the importance of international rules requiring civil probes to focus on recommendations for safer flight. "
3207,Most accidents take months of analysis because of the need to trace backwards to find a root cause from tangled evidence.
3208,"""There is a big difference between having the data and knowing the cause,"" a senior European investigator said. "
3209,Officials denied reports of tensions between Ethiopian officials and U.S. and other foreign investigators accredited to the probe.
3210,"""We don't have any reservations from different stakeholders who were engaged in the investigations,"" chief investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said."
3211,"Following a previous Ethiopian Airlines accident off Beirut in 2010, Addis Ababa authorities rejected the conclusions of a Lebanese investigation citing pilot error and suggested the aircraft had exploded in a possible act of sabotage. "
3212,"Aviation safety analyst Paul Hayes said deeper investigation would delve into the role played by software and how pilots were able to respond, and said he hoped scars from the 2010 dispute would not get in the way of a comprehensive investigation."
3213,"""Pilots shouldn't have to cope with such an emergency situation. We need to understand what are the factors that meant these two crews were overcome,"" said Hayes, safety director at UK-based consultancy Flight Ascend."
3214,"""It is unusual for there to be a single cause,"" he added."
3215," (Writing by Katharine Houreld, Tim Hepher and Georgina Prodhan; Additional reporting by Maggie Fick, Jamie Freed, David Shepardson, Alwyn Scott and Tracy Rucinski; Editing by Mark Potter)"
3216,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — The captain of a doomed Ethiopian Airlines jetliner faced an emergency almost immediately after takeoff from Addis Ababa, requesting permission in a panicky voice to return after three minutes as the aircraft accelerated to abnormal speed, a person who reviewed air traffic communications said Thursday."
3217,"“Break break, request back to home,” the captain told air traffic controllers as they scrambled to divert two other flights approaching the airport. “Request vector for landing.”"
3218,"Controllers also observed that the aircraft, a new Boeing 737 Max 8, was oscillating up and down by hundreds of feet — a sign that something was extraordinarily wrong."
3219,"All contact between air controllers and the aircraft, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 to Nairobi, was lost five minutes after it took off on Sunday, the person said."
3220,"The person who shared the information, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the communications have not been publicly released, said the controllers had concluded even before the captain’s message that he had an emergency."

3260,By Scott Reinhard
3261,"The account of the cockpit communications sheds chilling new detail about the final minutes before the plane crashed, killing all 157 people aboard. The crash, which has led to a worldwide grounding of Max 8s, was the second for the best-selling Boeing aircraft in less than five months."
3262,"Regulatory authorities in the United States and Canada say similar patterns in the trajectories of both planes may point to a common cause for the two crashes. But they cautioned that no explanation had been ruled out yet, and said the planes might have crashed for different reasons."
3263,[New evidence in the Ethiopian crash pointed to similarities with the earlier crash.]
3264,The new disclosures about the last moments of Flight 302 came as pilots were discussing what they described as the dangerously high speed of the aircraft after it took off from Addis Ababa’s Bole International Airport.
3265,"Pilots were abuzz over publicly available radar data that showed the aircraft had accelerated far beyond what is considered standard practice, for reasons that remain unclear."
3266,"“The thing that is most abnormal is the speed,” said John Cox, an aviation safety consultant and former 737 pilot."
3267,"“The speed is very high,” said Mr. Cox, a former executive air safety chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association in the United States. “The question is why. The plane accelerates far faster than it should.”"
3268,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
3269,"Ethiopian Airlines officials have said the crew of Flight 302 reported “flight control” problems to air traffic controllers a few minutes before contact was lost. The new account of communications between air traffic controllers and the pilot, Yared Getachew, who had 8,000 hours of flying experience, provides much more information about what was happening in the cockpit."
3270,"Within one minute of Flight 302’s departure, the person who reviewed communications said, Captain Getachew reported a “flight control” problem in a calm voice. At that point, radar showed the aircraft’s altitude as being well below what is known as the minimum safe height from the ground during a climb."
3271,"Within two minutes, the person said, the plane had climbed to a safer altitude, and the pilot said he wanted to stay on a straight course to 14,000 feet."
3272,"Then the controllers observed the plane going up and down by hundreds of feet, and it appeared to be moving unusually fast, the person said. The controllers, the person said, “started wondering out loud what the flight was doing.”"
3273,"Two other Ethiopian flights, 613 and 629, were approaching from the east, and the controllers, sensing an emergency on Flight 302, ordered them to remain at higher altitudes. It was during that exchange with the other planes, the person said, that Captain Getachew, with panic in his voice, interrupted with his request to turn back."
3274,"Flight 302 was just three minutes into its flight, the person said, and appeared to have accelerated to even higher speeds, well beyond its safety limits."
3275,"Cleared by the controllers to turn back, Flight 302 turned right as it climbed further. A minute later, it disappeared from the radar over a restricted military zone."
3276,"The disaster drew immediate comparisons to the October crash of another Boeing 737 Max 8, operated by Lion Air, in Indonesia. Both took place soon after takeoff, and the crews of both planes had sought to return to the airport."
3277,"The possibility that the two crashes had a similar cause was central to regulators’ decision to ground all 737 Maxes, a family of planes that entered passenger service less than two years ago."
3278,"After the Indonesia crash, a new flight-control system meant to keep the jet from stalling was suspected as a cause. In both cases, pilots struggled to control their aircraft."
3279,[Why investigators fear the two Boeing 737s crashed for the same reason.]
3280,"The investigation of the Ethiopian crash is still in its early stages, and safety regulators have noted that it is too soon to draw conclusions about the cause. The so-called black boxes, voice and flight data recorders that contain more detailed information about the Ethiopian flight’s final moments, arrived in France on Thursday for analysis."
3281,"Since the Indonesia crash, Boeing has been working on a software update for the 737 Max jets, expected by April. But the company and the Federal Aviation Administration face new questions over whether there should have been more pilot training as airlines added the new models to their fleets."
3282,"On Wednesday, the chairman of the transportation committee in the House of Representatives said he would investigate the F.A.A.’s certification of the 737 Max, including why the regulator did not require more extensive training."
3283,To the Editor:
3284,"Re “Crisis for Boeing as Safety Worry Grounds New Jet” (front page, March 12):"
3285,"I urge the Federal Aviation Administration to call for the immediate grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft. Imagine my dread upon learning that the American Airlines plane tickets I bought weeks ago for my family’s vacation are on this very plane. I’m now faced with the choice of changing our tickets and incurring significant financial penalties, or canceling our vacation altogether."
3286,"While the F.A.A. still has no “data to draw any conclusions or take any action,” and American Airlines reassures its customers about the safety of the aircraft, the families of the 346 people who have died since October while flying on Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grieve."
3287,"Does it not make the most sense given the two similar tragedies to ground the entire fleet first, then resolve what is potentially a life-or-death problem?"
3288,Rachel KuenyBrooklyn
3289,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — A preliminary review of the “black boxes” recovered from a jetliner that went down in Ethiopia found similarities between that crash and one involving the same Boeing model in Indonesia five months earlier, Ethiopia’s transport ministry said Sunday."
3290,"Although a spokesman for the ministry would not detail what the similarities were, the information from the black boxes, as the data and voice recorders are known, suggests that Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 may have had problems similar to those of Lion Air Flight 610."
3291,"Both brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8s crashed shortly after takeoff — Lion Air in October and Ethiopian Airlines last week — following erratic ascents, killing everyone on board."
3292,The disclosure by the transport ministry came as a procession of empty coffins made their way to a churchyard in Ethiopia. The crash of the jetliner was so violent that mourners were left with few remains to bury. One hundred and fifty-seven people were killed in the disaster. (The Lion Air crash killed 189.)
3293,"The second crash led to a worldwide grounding of the Max jet, Boeing’s best-selling aircraft. Although American regulators were slower to ground the planes than other countries, they said last week that physical evidence from the Ethiopian crash, along with satellite tracking data, suggested similarities between the two crashes."
3294,"Now, investigators are also looking at information from the two flight recorders, whose data was downloaded in France by airline investigators in recent days and handed to the Ethiopians. Black boxes, which record sounds in the cockpit and detailed information on such things as altitude and speed, are crucial to helping investigators reconstruct how crashes occur."
3295,"The United States National Transportation Safety Board said in recent days that it was sending a delegation to France, but when asked about the black box findings on Sunday, a spokesman for the agency said that only Ethiopian officials could release those results."
3296,The terse announcement in Ethiopia about the initial findings is a fresh indication of potentially deep trouble for Boeing.
3297,"Since the Indonesian crash, a cloud of suspicion has hung over not just the jet but also Boeing’s handling of its rollout. It has gotten only bigger after the Ethiopia disaster."
3298,"Should the two crashes prove to have a common cause, the company may be hard-pressed to explain why it let a top-selling aircraft continue to fly with a suspected problem, and why it did not move more quickly to address it. Safety experts caution, however, that conclusions at this stage of an investigation are far from certain."
3299,"On Sunday, in response to the Ethiopian findings, Boeing issued a statement from its chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, saying the company was “working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available.”"
3300,"“In accordance with international protocol,” it said, “all inquiries about the ongoing accident investigation must be directed to the investigating authorities.”"
3301,"Launched in response to competitive pressure from Boeing’s chief rival, Airbus, the project to design and build the 737 Max was pushed quickly from the start."
3302,"Larger, repositioned engines changed the aerodynamics of the Max compared with the previous-generation 737. To address potential problems associated with the new design, Boeing added new software instead of rethinking the plane from scratch."
3303,"Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration decided that pilots did not need to be told about the new software, called MCAS."
3304,"And the plane proved immediately popular with airlines. Boeing has delivered nearly 380 Max aircraft and has orders for another 4,600."
3305,"But after the first crash, the company quickly found itself on the defensive."
3306,"When the 737 went down in Indonesia and MCAS came under suspicion, Boeing repeatedly said emergency procedures should have been sufficient for the pilots to save the craft if the system had malfunctioned."
3307,"Even so, the company hastily informed pilots about MCAS — and then said it was working on software changes. It promised to release them around the end of last year, according to pilots at Southwest and American Airlines."
3308,But the software fix has not happened yet. Boeing now promises to release the revisions in the next several weeks.
3309,"“While investigators continue to work to establish definitive conclusions,” it said in its statement Sunday, “Boeing is finalizing its development of a previously announced software update and pilot training revision that will address the MCAS flight control law’s behavior in response to erroneous sensor inputs.”"
3310,"Even before the Ethiopians’ announcement Sunday, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, publicly available data was accumulating that suggested the plane might have had problems with MCAS."
3311,"That system was installed in the Max 8 planes as a way of preventing stalls, and it works by forcing the nose of the planes down."
3312,"In the Indonesian flight there are indications that the system acted because of faulty readings from a sensor on the plane, and that the pilots had trouble overriding the software’s actions. They ultimately lost their battle, and the plane plunged into the sea."
3313,None of the public evidence about Ethiopian Flight 302 is strong enough to prove that the system was active before the crash or that it forced the plane down.
3314,"Still, for both the Ethiopian and the Lion Air flights, public data appears to show repeated up-and-down oscillations lasting 15 to 20 seconds — a possible indication that pilots overrode the nose-down push by MCAS, only to see it activate again. For Lion Air, those oscillations were later confirmed by data from the flight recorders."
3315,Debris from the Ethiopian jet crash site adds to suspicions that the MCAS system may have been involved.
3316,"An obscure part called a jackscrew — the component that moves the stabilizers up and down on the tail — was recovered, and its configuration showed that the stabilizers had been tilted upward, according to two people with knowledge of the recovery operations. That upward tilt of the stabilizers is the mechanism that MCAS uses to push the nose down."
3317,The software fix Boeing is working on would change features of the automated system that investigators believe may have been a factor in the Lion Air crash.
3318,"In that crash, investigators say, it appears faulty data from a single sensor might have triggered the automated system, causing it to push the plane toward the ground."
3319,"The software fix is expected to make the automated system rely on data from two sensors, instead of just one, a more common method, according to several pilots and two lawmakers briefed on the planned changes."
3320,"The changes are also likely to slow the rate at which the automated system pushes the nose down, said Michael Michaelis, the top safety official at the American Airlines pilots’ union. And the update will also cause the automated system to shut off if pilots appear to be fighting with it for control of the aircraft, pilots said."
3321,The changes amount to a tacit admission by Boeing that its automated system was flawed.
3322,"The plane maker, which aims to deliver the software update by April, has said the software fix will “make an already safe aircraft even safer.”"
3323,"LONDON — Passengers on a British Airways flight from London to Düsseldorf, Germany, were left bewildered on Monday when their plane landed in Scotland by mistake."
3324,"A blunder with paperwork seems to have been the problem: British Airways said a German company that had chartered the plane, WDL Aviation, had submitted the wrong route to air traffic controllers."
3325,"“We are working with WDL Aviation, who operated this flight on behalf of British Airways, to establish why the incorrect flight plan was filed,” British Airways said in a statement."
3326,"The flight, BA3271, which took off from London City Airport, did not seem to have been in any danger; because of the incorrect paperwork, the crew — including the pilot — and air traffic controllers had all apparently believed that Edinburgh was the plane’s intended destination."
3327,"That came as small comfort to the passengers when flight attendants informed them that they had landed in the Scottish capital, about 520 miles from their intended destination."
3328,"“British Airways, can you please explain how can my morning flight taking off from LCY to Düsseldorf land in Edinburgh?” one passenger, Son Tran, wrote on Twitter, using the airport code for London City Airport."
3329,"Mr. Tran, who was going to Düsseldorf on business, said that none of the passengers had seemed aware of the destination mix-up."
3330,"“While an interesting concept, I don’t think anyone on board has signed up for this mystery travel lottery,” he added in his post."
3331,"British Airways said, “We have apologized to customers for this interruption to their journey and will be contacting them all individually.”"
3332,"London City Airport also apologized, saying on Twitter, “As pleasant as Edinburgh is this time of year, we’re sorry that passengers traveling to Düsseldorf on BA3271, operated by WDL Aviation, initially landed in the Scottish capital.”"
3333,"In an emailed statement, WDL Aviation said it was “working closely with the authorities to investigate how the obviously unfortunate mix-up of flight schedules could occur.”"
3334,"While in Scotland, the plane refueled, and WDL Aviation said it took off again “after the involuntary stopover in Edinburgh.” The flight did eventually reach Düsseldorf — less than three hours late."
3335,"MOSCOW — Natalia V. Fileva, the longtime Russian airline executive who died on Sunday in a plane crash in Germany, was credited with consolidating splinter companies of the former Soviet aviation giant Aeroflot into a viable and profitable airline."
3336,"Ms. Fileva, along with her husband, Vladislav Filev, founded and ran S7 airline, Russia’s second-largest passenger carrier after the national flag airline, which is still called Aeroflot. She was chairwoman and co-owner of the company. The couple also ventured into the private space launch business."
3337,"Ms. Fileva was flying with her father in a small propeller plane when, en route from Cannes, France, it crashed in a field a few miles from an airport in Egelsbach, in southern Germany, Russian and German news media said. Her father, identified by some news organizations as Valery Karachev, and the pilot were also killed. An investigation was underway, said Roman Trotsenko, a longtime business partner of Ms. Fileva’s."
3338,"Known for her tenacity in the face of setbacks, including fatal crashes of her company’s planes, Ms. Fileva was outspoken about the Russian government’s heavy hand in business; last year she chided officials for speaking at a conference about ending corruption while wearing thousand-dollar suits to the event."
3339,"Ms. Fileva was the rare woman to hold an executive position in Russia and the country’s fourth richest, according to Forbes magazine."
3340,"“She didn’t speak much about this,” Mr. Trotsenko, who is chairman of the Novaport airport company, said in an interview. “She believed that men and women could be either good leaders and bring success, or bad leaders. To her, the role of women and men didn’t differ at all.”"
3341,"Her business career traced the arc of post-Soviet passenger aviation. After the Soviet breakup in 1991, Aeroflot, which had the world’s largest passenger airplane fleet, dissolved into a host of regional airlines in Russia and other newly independent states. Aeroflot retained the international routes, while the spinoffs became known as the Babyflots."
3342,"It was a frightening era for passengers. For a time, about 800 airlines were in operation, some owning only one plane. Safety standards were abysmal. The Soviet legacy jets, like the needle-nosed Tupolev-154, had narrow, dim cabins; entering them felt like climbing into a pipe. The seating upholstery was tattered, and the engines often screeched during takeoff."
3343,"Ms. Fileva and her husband, who had been working at a bank, were appointed to operate one of the Babyflots, known as Sibir, in the early 1990s after it had failed to repay debts. They later bought a controlling share in the airline and then expanded by purchasing other Babyflots."
3344,"The couple divided their responsibilities, business associates said: She handled marketing and government relations while he focused on operations and strategy. In telephone negotiations, the couple would pass a phone back and forth, letting each have a say in the talks."
3345,"Sibir succeeded where other Babyflots had failed because the couple had switched to Boeing and Airbus jets and set up a regional hub in their hometown, Novosibirsk, in southern Siberia; other airlines had continued the Soviet practice of routing most transfers through Moscow."
3346,A memorial to those who lost their lives in 2019
3347,"“She bet on the quick connection,” Mr. Trotsenko said."
3348,"Several disasters tested the new company. In 2001, the Ukrainian military, while conducting an air defense exercise, accidentally shot down a Sibir passenger plane flying from Tel Aviv to Novosibirsk, killing all 76 people onboard. The next year, a Chechen suicide bomber detonated her explosives on a Sibir airplane in midflight, killing all 46 people onboard."
3349,"To turn the page, Ms. Fileva rebranded Sibir, changing its name to S7 and repainting its fleet light green. Together with the rising Russian middle class, the airline flourished."
3350,"In 2016, S7 formed Russia’s first private space launch company, spending about $150 million to adapt an oil platform at sea near the Equator to launch rockets. Launches are more efficient in those latitudes."
3351,"In another venture, in 2012, a subsidiary of S7 branched into aircraft manufacturing by buying Epic Aircraft, a struggling maker of small turboprops and jets based in Bend, Ore. The company planned to revive production in Oregon and license it in Russia. The plane in which Ms. Fileva and the others died was an Epic LT turboprop."
3352,She was born in Novosibirsk in 1963 and earned an undergraduate degree in radio engineering and a graduate degree in management.
3353,"Along with her husband, her survivors include their two daughters."
3354,"• Elaine Chao, the secretary of transportation, faced a number of questions about Boeing’s 737 Max plane, which has been involved in two deadly crashes, during a Senate hearing on Wednesday."
3355,"• In a separate hearing, the acting head of the Federal Aviation Administration defended the agency’s certification practices as “extensive, well-established.”"
3356,"• The Department of Transportation’s inspector general said he would perform an audit on the F.A.A.’s certification of the 737 Max, which has been grounded around the world."
3357,• Boeing said it was close to completing a software update for the planes and that the changes it was making would “address any of these accidents.”
3358,"[Sign up for With Interest, a Sunday newsletter to catch you up and prep for the coming week in business and tech news.]"
3359,Boeing on Wednesday said it was close to completing an update on the anti-stall software that may have played a role in the crashes of two of its new 737 Max jets in recent months.
3360,"In a news media briefing near the factory in Renton where the 737 Max is assembled, Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s vice president of product strategy, said the new software had been tested and that F.A.A. regulators had taken test flights on updated jets."
3361,The briefing came just before Boeing met with about 200 pilots and executives from airlines to review proposed updates to the software and training for the Max.
3362,"But Boeing provided no timetable for the return of the model, which is grounded around the world. The F.A.A. must first approve the new software and the training. Then, Boeing said, each 737 Max will need to be manually upgraded. Finally, Max pilots will need to receive a 30-minute training program about the software."
3363,"Even if the F.A.A. does approve the new software and training soon, regulators in other nations might move more slowly. “Certification around the world will be at the discretion of those regulators around the world, and so we can’t comment on timing,” Mr. Sinnett said."
3364,"Boeing stressed that no final conclusions have been made about what caused the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 this month. Investigations into both crashes are continuing, but preliminary flight data and other evidence have suggested similarities between the two accidents. Investigators are examining whether the anti-stall system may have been partly to blame."
3365,"In his prepared remarks, Mr. Sinnett seemed to acknowledge that, based on the available information, there appeared to be a link between the new anti-stall software on the Max, known as MCAS, and the crashes."
3366,"“The rigor and thoroughness of the design and testing that went into the Max gives us complete confidence that the changes we’re making will address any of these accidents,” he said."
3367,"At the same time, Mr. Sinnett said that Boeing had faith in its design and engineering."
3368,"“The 737 is a safe airplane,” he said. “The 737 family is a safe airplane family. And the 737 Max builds on that tremendous history of safety.”"
3369,"Dennis A. Muilenburg, the Boeing chief executive, has avoided the spotlight in recent weeks and was not in Renton for the briefing or the meeting with pilots and executives. He was in town a day earlier, however, meeting with employees and discussing the Max crisis."
3370,"On Capitol Hill, the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, faced probing questions from senators about the agency’s approval of the Boeing 737 Max."
3371,"Mr. Elwell appeared at a hearing convened by the Senate Commerce Committee’s aviation subcommittee, the first of what are expected to be multiple congressional hearings."
3372,"In his testimony, he defended the way the F.A.A. approved new jetliners, saying the agency’s certification procedures “are extensive, well-established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades.” He said the F.A.A. was “fully involved” in certifying the 737 Max."
3373,"“I want to assure you and everyone else that the F.A.A. will go wherever the facts lead us in our pursuit of safety,” he said. “The 737 Max will return to service for U.S. carriers only when the F.A.A.’s analysis of the facts and technical data indicate that it is appropriate to do so.”"
3374,"Robert L. Sumwalt, the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, and Calvin L. Scovel III, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, also appeared at the hearing."
3375,"Earlier, the Senate Appropriations Committee’s transportation subcommittee convened a hearing with Ms. Chao. It was ostensibly about the Transportation Department’s budget request for the 2020 fiscal year, but lawmakers used the forum to question her about the 737 Max."
3376,"“Let me emphasize that safety is always No. 1 at the Department of Transportation, and a good day is when nothing bad happens,” Ms. Chao said. Of the Ethiopian Airlines crash this month in which 157 people died, she added, “We all have a lot of important questions about this accident.”"
3377,"Hours before Mr. Scovel’s appearance, his office formally announced it would conduct an audit of the F.A.A.’s certification of the 737 Max, as Ms. Chao had requested last week."
3378,"During his testimony, Mr. Scovel laid out the general parameters of his planned audit. He said he would investigate why the F.A.A. approved MCAS and how the agency concluded that information about it did not need to be part of the plane’s manual and pilots did not need additional training."
3379,He said he would also look into how the F.A.A. handled the crisis.
3380,"“Clearly, confidence in F.A.A. as the gold standard for aviation safety has been shaken,” he said."
3381,Mr. Scovel said he wanted to understand why the agency was the last aviation regulator in the world to “drive risk to zero” by grounding the 737 Max.
3382,"“That apparent disparity in appreciation of the safety regulator’s role should be another question,” he said."
3383,"The planes flew in similar erratic patterns, suggesting to experts that an automated system might have malfunctioned on both flights."
3384,"In October, Lion Air Flight 610 crashed just minutes after taking off from Jakarta, Indonesia, killing 189 people. Then, on March 10, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 also crashed minutes after takeoff, killing everyone on board. Both accidents involved Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets."
3385,"In the days after the Ethiopian accident, global regulators grounded the jets. Those in China were the first to do so, and other governments around the world quickly followed suit."
3386,"In addition to the software update and new training procedures, Boeing said in a statement on Wednesday it would retrofit jets with a safety feature that was previously optional. The feature — known as a disagree light, which is activated if two key sensors on the plane do not produce the same readings — will be standard on new Max planes."
3387,"During a testy exchange in the afternoon, Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, repeatedly pressed Mr. Elwell to say whether all available safety features should be required on planes. Mr. Elwell said, “Safety-critical pieces of equipment on an aircraft are mandatory,” and “If there is any manufacturer that sells a safety-critical part a la carte, we will not permit it.”"
3388,"Mr. Elwell added, “I find it hard to believe that a safety company like an airline would save a couple thousand dollars on an option that might improve safety.”"
3389,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
3390,"The F.A.A. has long allowed plane makers to help certify that their new aircraft meet safety standards. Ms. Chao called the practice “necessary,” though it is coming under increased scrutiny."
3391,"Boeing, through the Organization Designation Authorization program, was able to choose its own employees to help government regulators certify the 737 Max. When asked by the subcommittee’s chairwoman, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, about concerns that the arrangement “sacrifices potentially the safety of the traveling public,” Ms. Chao said that the possibility was “troubling.”"
3392,"Ms. Chao stressed that the F.A.A. sets safety standards that manufacturers must meet while developing aircraft. The certification process, she said, “is, of course, subject to oversight and supervision by the F.A.A.”"
3393,"Responding to a question from Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, Mr. Elwell explained some of the process."
3394,"He said that the F.A.A. initially oversaw certification for the software, but delegated more authority to Boeing over time, “when we had the comfort level” that designees at Boeing were knowledgeable enough about the system."
3395,"Mr. Elwell later said that practice was “part of the fabric of what we’ve used to become as safe as we are today” and that without it, the F.A.A. would need 10,000 more employees and $1.8 billion for its certification office."
3396,"Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said that he planned to introduce legislation to reform the delegation system, which he said “is so fatally riddled with flaws.”"
3397,"“The fact is that the F.A.A. decided to do safety on the cheap,” he said."
3398,"Boeing developed the 737 Max as the latest move in its rivalry with Airbus, the European plane manufacturer. When Airbus announced a more fuel-efficient version of its A320, the main competitor to the 737, Boeing risked losing major customers if it didn’t develop its own, more fuel-efficient planes."
3399,"Boeing decided to update its popular 737 instead of designing a new plane from scratch. To make the 737 more fuel efficient, Boeing gave it bigger engines. However, that update changed the plane’s aerodynamics and made it prone to stall in certain conditions."
3400,"To reduce the risk of stalling, Boeing developed the software system MCAS. It made the 737 Max fly more like previous versions of the plane, but pilots were not explicitly informed about how it worked."
3401,"Pilots from several airlines met with Boeing executives in Renton, Wash., on Saturday to discuss proposed changes to 737 Max jets, two of which have crashed in recent months."
3402,"The meeting on Saturday, with about a dozen pilots and trainers, was part of Boeing’s effort to manage the crisis set off by the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in October and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 under similar circumstances this month. Boeing and people briefed on the meeting confirmed it."
3403,"In addition to reviewing proposed modifications to new anti-stall software and cockpit displays, pilots from five airlines strapped into flight simulators to see how they would have handled the situation that is believed to have brought down Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia, according to two people briefed on the meeting."
3404,"In each case, the pilots using the simulators were able to land the plane safely."
3405,"Saturday’s session included representatives from American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines — the three American carriers that fly the Max — as well as from two non-U.S. airlines, Copa Airlines and Fly Dubai. The group did not include representatives from Ethiopian Airlines, Lion Air or the large Chinese carriers that fly the 737 Max."
3406,"On Wednesday in Renton, where the 737 Max is assembled, Boeing will host a group of 200 pilots and officials from almost all the carriers that currently fly the Max or have ordered the jets. As on Saturday, Boeing plans to describe the proposed changes to the software, and review what new training procedures may be needed before airlines can once again fly the Max, which is grounded worldwide."
3407,"“This is part of our ongoing effort to share more details about our plan for supporting the safe return of the 737 Max to commercial service,” Boeing said in a statement. “We had a productive session this past Saturday and plan to reach all current and many future Max operators and their home regulators.”"
3408,"While Boeing continues to work on a software fix, American Airlines said it would extend its cancellations through April 24. American canceled nearly 90 of its roughly 6,700 flights a day because of the Max grounding."
3409,International authorities and domestic regulators including the Federal Aviation Administration will have to sign off before the Max can fly again.
3410,"On Saturday, pilots from the five airlines simulated flights with the software as it was originally written, as well as with the proposed updates."
3411,"A leading theory is that the Lion Air flight crashed because the anti-stall software received erroneous data, forcing the plane into a nose-dive. The Ethiopian Airlines flight also crashed after an erratic takeoff."
3412,"In simulations using the current software, pilots were able to disable the anti-stall software using existing procedures, and land the airplane safely."
3413,The simulations using the updated software required less intervention by the pilots.
3414,"The software, known as MCAS, is designed to push the nose of the plane down if it detects the plane pointing up at a dangerous angle that might induce a stall. To determine when it is needed, the software takes data from two so-called angle of attack sensors on the side of the plane, which measure whether the fuselage is pointing up or down."
3415,"But when it was originally designed, the software only responded to data from one sensor at a time."
3416,"Preliminary plans for a proposed update will change the software in several substantial ways, according to the people familiar with the meeting. It will take data from both angle of attack sensors, instead of just one."
3417,"If the difference between the two sensors is more than 5 degrees, the software will be disabled."
3418,"Instead of allowing the software to push the nose down multiple times, it will limit the number of instances it can attempt to push the nose down, and limit the duration of that intervention to 10 seconds."
3419,"On Sunday, Boeing also issued a statement on the equipment used to measure and display the plane’s angle of attack."
3420,"The New York Times reported on Thursday, that two of these indicators were sold as options."
3421,"Boeing previously charged extra for two features in the cockpit: the angle of attack indicator, which showed pilots the readings from the angle of attack sensors; and the disagree light, which notified pilots if the readings from the two sensors were at odds with one another."
3422,"Boeing will now make the disagree light standard in all new 737 Max planes, and will provide the indicator free of charge for customers who want it."
3423,"“All primary flight information required to safely and efficiently operate the 737 Max is included on the baseline primary flight display,” Boeing said. “All 737 Max airplanes display this data in a way that is consistent with pilot training and the fundamental instrument scan pattern that pilots are trained to use.”"
3424,"The F.A.A. does not currently require pilots to to train on simulators that replicate all the features of the Max, and may not change that stance. But it is possible that even if the F.A.A. does not require simulator training, other international regulators may do so."
3425,"“We’ve been working diligently and in close cooperation with the F.A.A. on the software update,” Boeing said in its statement. “We are taking a comprehensive and careful approach to design, develop and test the software that will ultimately lead to certification.”"
3426,"BEIJING — Responding to the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max 8 soon after takeoff in less than five months, China and Indonesia ordered their airlines on Monday to ground all of these aircraft that they operate."
3427,The Civil Aviation Administration of China noted in its announcement on Monday morning of the grounding that both the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday and a Lion Air crash in Indonesia in late October had involved very recently delivered Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft that crashed soon after takeoff.
3428,Indonesia joined China about nine hours later in also ordering its airlines to stop operating their Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft.
3429,[Read live updates about the investigation into Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and the worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 Max jets.]
3430,"The Chinese aviation regulator said in its announcement that it had notified Chinese air carriers at 9 a.m. that they had until 6 p.m. to take the planes out of service. VariFlight, an online flight tracking service based in Hefei, China, said that the last Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by a Chinese carrier was a China Southern Airlines jet that flew between Urumqi, China, and Bangkok."
3431,"The airlines of China and Indonesia are among the biggest users of the new Boeing jets, having taken delivery of most of the planes they have ordered so far."
3432,"After the Lion Air crash in late October near Jakarta, Indonesia’s Ministry of Transportation grounded every Max 8 operating in the country. But after inspections were conducted last November, the planes were declared safe to fly. The ministry then grounded them again on Monday evening."
3433,"Separately, Boeing said it was postponing the external debut of its 777X plane, which had been planned for Wednesday. The company took the action in a statement in which it said it was “deeply saddened” by the Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 crash."
3434,"On a commercial level, China’s aviation sector could actually benefit from the tragedies in Indonesia and Ethiopia. A government-owned company in Shanghai has begun doing flight tests of a Chinese-made alternative to the Boeing 737, called the Comac C919. The C919 is the cornerstone of China’s effort to build a commercial aviation competitor to Boeing and Airbus."
3435,"The C919 has already attracted hundreds of orders from air carriers in China’s state-controlled airline industry, and it is scheduled to deliver the plane starting in 2021. But China has struggled to find overseas buyers beyond securing a handful of orders from tiny airlines in impoverished countries that are heavily dependent on Chinese aid."
3436,"The C919 still faces big hurdles before it could prove to be a viable competitor. Airlines worry that it won’t be as fuel efficient as rival planes from Boeing and Airbus. Fuel is one of the main costs in operating a passenger airline, and even more important for international cargo airlines like FedEx, which have evinced little immediate interest in buying the C919. Big buyers would likely wait to see how the planes perform in China before making a commitment."
3437,"Another issue lies in how open about safety issues China will be. The country’s safety regulator and the manufacturer, the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, have so far worked closely with foreign experts on safety."
3438,"An embarrassing crash could test how willing the company and regulators in Beijing would be to share information. When a high-speed train crashed in southeastern China in July 2011, the authorities quickly bulldozed the wreckage into pits and covered it over before investigators could even start trying to figure out what went wrong. The Chinese government also issued an order to domestic media not to cover the crash and not to do investigations into what went wrong."
3439,"Airlines might switch instead from the Boeing 737 Max 8 to the better-known Airbus alternative, the A320neo."
3440,"After more than a week of near silence, Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive of Boeing, made his first substantive public comments about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302."
3441,"In a statement released by Boeing on Monday night, Mr. Muilenburg expressed remorse for the deaths of 346 people in two strikingly similar air disasters involving the company’s 737 Max jets — the accident in Ethiopia, on March 10, and the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia in October."
3442,"“Our hearts are heavy, and we continue to extend our deepest sympathies to the loved ones of the passengers and crew on board,” Mr. Muilenburg said."
3443,"The investigations into the causes of both crashes are still in progress, and no conclusions have been reached by the authorities. But preliminary data suggests that a combination of new software, faulty sensor readings and inadequate pilot training may have been to blame."
3444,French air accident investigators confirmed on Monday that flight recorder data from the Ethiopian Airlines jet showed “clear similarities” with the Lion Air jet.
3445,"The B.E.A., the French agency that investigates aviation crashes and incidents, said in a statement that the investigation team had noted these similarities “during the verification process” of data from the flight recorder, which keeps information like altitude and speed."
3446,"Mr. Muilenburg said Boeing was “taking actions to fully ensure the safety of the 737 Max,” based on the information the company got from the investigations."
3447,"Among those actions is a software update that has been in the works for months, in response to the Lion Air crash. He said the update was due “soon.”"
3448,"Mr. Muilenburg had been conspicuously quiet since the latest crash, as regulators around the world grounded Boeing jets and the company’s stock slumped 12 percent."
3449,"He did make time to call President Trump twice — first on Tuesday of last week to press the president to keep the 737 Max jets flying, and a day later to encourage their grounding."
3450,"But on Monday night, Mr. Muilenburg for the first time appeared to try to reassure the public. “Safety is at the core of who we are at Boeing, and ensuring safe and reliable travel on our airplanes is an enduring value and our absolute commitment to everyone,” he said. “This overarching focus on safety spans and binds together our entire global aerospace industry and communities.”"
3451,"After the crash in Indonesia, Boeing faced tough questions about the development of the 737 Max, and a flight-control system known as MCAS in particular, which will get the promised software upgrade. Other questions are being raised about the company’s training procedures. When the plane was introduced, Boeing believed that pilots who had flown an earlier model didn’t need additional simulator training and regulators agreed."
3452,"Many experts believe MCAS played a role in that first crash. But the Max jets continued to fly, reflecting the confidence of Boeing, regulators and pilots that the planes were beyond reproach."
3453,"But Boeing was thrust into a crisis last week when another jet crashed in nearly identical circumstances. Boeing’s newest jet, its best seller, is now grounded; airlines are demanding compensation; and there is no clear timetable for the return of the Max planes."
3454,"And in a development that could have far-reaching implications, Canada’s aviation regulator is reviewing its validation of the American certification of the 737 Max, Marc Garneau, the transport minister, told reporters on Monday."
3455,"“We may not change anything, but we think it’s a good idea to review that at this time,” Mr. Garneau said."

3458,The aerospace giant and its ties to Washington are under scrutiny after a version of its best-selling plane was involved in two deadly accidents in five months.
3459,michael barbaro
3460,"From The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: As Boeing developed a new line of passenger jets, it was determined to avoid costly training for pilots. Then, two of those jets crashed. It’s Tuesday, March 19."
3461,natalie kitroeff
3462,"The global aerospace business is essentially a duopoly. There are two big companies. There’s Boeing, which is American-owned, and there’s Airbus, a European rival."
3463,michael barbaro
3464,Natalie Kitroeff is a business reporter at The Times.
3465,natalie kitroeff
3466,These two are always competing with each other. They are competing on every single aspect of an airplane. And they’re often competing for the same customers.
3467,[music]
3468,
3469,natalie kitroeff
3470,So in late 2010 —
3471,archived recording
3472,"We’re not redesigning the A320. It’s pretty damn good just the way it is. What we’re doing is offering new, more fuel-efficient engines on today’s airplane."
3473,natalie kitroeff
3474,"— Airbus announces that it is offering a new, fuel-efficient version of its best-selling A320 plane."
3475,archived recording
3476,"Well, an A320neo —"
3477,natalie kitroeff
3478,It’s going to be the A320neo.
3479,archived recording
3480,"It’s a new engine option offered on today’s A320 family of aircraft. And now they’re being offered with new, more fuel-efficient engines. We’re putting our money on re-engining the world’s best-selling single-aisle aircraft."
3481,natalie kitroeff
3482,"This amounts to essentially a frontal assault for Boeing. Fuel savings mean that airlines are saving on costs. And if Airbus is going to offer an option that is going to save airlines money, Boeing better will come up with its own alternative in order to compete in this cutthroat environment, where they have one main rival."
3483,michael barbaro
3484,So what does Boeing do in response to its biggest and most important rival coming up with this fuel-efficient jetliner?
3485,natalie kitroeff
3486,Boeing scrambles to respond quickly.
3487,archived recording
3488,[MUSIC] We are making a decision to invest in the 737 family.

3490,"And within months, the company comes up with an upgrade of its own."
3491,archived recording
3492,"Max efficiency, which leads to profitability, max reliability, and to the flying public, max passenger appeal."
3493,natalie kitroeff
3494,It’s going to be a fuel-efficient version of their 737 workhorse. It is going to have bigger engines. And it’s going to save airlines money on this fuel.
3495,archived recording
3496,The best single-aisle airplane in the world. [MUSIC]
3497,natalie kitroeff
3498,And they’re going to call it the 737 Max. And one of the main goals of this engineering process is to keep this new plane as similar to its predecessor as possible.
3499,michael barbaro
3500,Why?
3501,natalie kitroeff
3502,Part of the reason is that Boeing is competing with Airbus. And they’re competing with them on every single cost item. And a plane is not just metal and technology. It’s also what it costs to operate the aircraft and to train pilots to fly it.
3503,michael barbaro
3504,Hm.
3505,natalie kitroeff
3506,"If the 737 Max turned out to be so different from its predecessor that it required training on a flight simulator, one of these giant machines where you have a cockpit and it mimics the experience of flying the plane, it would cost airlines tens of millions of dollars over the life of an aircraft. It’s incredibly expensive. So if Boeing were to say, we have this beautiful new jet, but it’s going to require twice the amount of training that the Airbus model requires, the executives might pause on that. So as the company is manufacturing this plane, it wants to find ways to make it fly exactly the way that its predecessors did."
3507,michael barbaro
3508,So that there is not a need for training.
3509,natalie kitroeff
3510,Exactly. And there’s a little bit of a problem.
3511,[music]
3512,
3513,natalie kitroeff
3514,"There is something that is fundamentally different about this plane. Its engines are bigger, and those engines need to be mounted farther forward on the wings. And that changes the aerodynamics of the plane. So the placement of those engines makes the nose of the plane push upward in certain circumstances. And that can lead to a stall, which is a dangerous situation. So Boeing has to come up with a solution to make the plane act the way its predecessor did and to counteract that force. So what it does is it comes up with this system, this software."
3515,michael barbaro
3516,And what does the new system do?
3517,natalie kitroeff
3518,"The new system automatically corrects for that upward motion of the nose. And it pushes the nose down automatically. And it’s supposed to be working in the background, in a way that pilots don’t even notice, correcting for an issue that was not in the prior model of this plane. And it’s supposed to be something that is just keeping the pilot in a position where he or she feels as though the plane is flying in the same exact way under the same conditions that the prior model did."
3519,michael barbaro
3520,"So Boeing thinks even though the engines are different, that they have developed a system that makes the engines operate essentially the same way the old 737 did. And from a pilot’s point of view, therefore, there would be no need for new training?"
3521,natalie kitroeff
3522,"Yes. Boeing believed there was no need for extra training for pilots who had flown the previous model. And the Federal Aviation Administration agreed. In March 2017, the F.A.A. certified the plane. It did not require flight simulator training for pilots who had flown the prior model. And regulators around the world followed suit. Two months later, Boeing shipped out its first 737 Max out of Seattle. And the company decided that it does not need to fully inform pilots that this new software even exists."
3523,michael barbaro
3524,Hmm. So they don’t even tell the pilots. They think it is so unimportant to the operation of the plane from the experience of a pilot that they don’t even need to know?
3525,natalie kitroeff
3526,Yes.
3527,[music]
3528,
3529,michael barbaro
3530,"So what happens next? This plane is certified, on the market. What happens?"

3568,"So while the software is pushing the nose down, the pilot is trying to push it back up over and over and over again, multiple times. That is the picture that begins to emerge. But we do not have full conclusive evidence yet."
3569,michael barbaro
3570,"So it seems like the pilots on this flight are fighting a flight control system, a self-correcting one that’s supposed to keep the nose from going up, that they don’t even know exists, right?"
3571,natalie kitroeff
3572,"That’s exactly right. And what experts believe was happening was that this system was taking in a faulty sensor reading. So it was responding to bad data. And that is why it kept triggering over and over and over again, despite the pilot’s best efforts to get the plane back on course."
3573,michael barbaro
3574,And eventually those pilots lose their battle against the system.
3575,natalie kitroeff
3576,"Eventually, the plane plunges into the sea, killing all 189 people on board."

3580,"What, Natalie, is the reaction among the airlines that have bought this line of planes to this emerging realization that Boeing hadn’t revealed what turned out to be this important piece of information, the existence of this system that may likely have contributed to this crash?"
3581,natalie kitroeff
3582,"Pilots are furious — livid, in fact — that they have not been informed that this thing even exists. So they have these meetings, in which they told Boeing officials that this was a breach of trust and that it was disrespectful."
3583,michael barbaro
3584,"So I have to assume that these angry pilots, in addition to just wanting to be sure everyone knows about this system, are demanding training so that they can properly respond to this system."
3585,natalie kitroeff
3586,"No, they’re not. The F.A.A., Boeing, nobody is recommending more training on this system."
3587,michael barbaro
3588,Why not?
3589,natalie kitroeff
3590,"The American pilots that I’ve talked to, they believe that because they’ve been informed about the system, now that they know how it works, they are able to safely fly this plane. They know how to deal with this software if it becomes an issue on their flights. And they feel confident about flying the plane. This is a confidence that’s, in part, based on statistics and experience. There has been only one fatality on U.S. airlines in the last decade. Boeing has an enviable safety record. In many ways, they had good reason to be confident. And they’re also promised a fix to the software that pushes the nose down. That’s going to come within the next several weeks. They will be informed of it. And they feel confident that that is enough."
3591,michael barbaro
3592,"O.K., so after this Lion Air crash, the only thing that changes is that Boeing vows to fix the system. But no additional training is ordered for any pilot anywhere. And the 737 Max planes are free to keep flying?"
3593,natalie kitroeff
3594,Yes.

3600,"Killing everyone on board, Flight 302 was en route to Nairobi, Kenya, when it crashed in the town of Bishoftu just six minutes after takeoff. The plane was carrying 149 passengers and 8 crew members."
3601,natalie kitroeff
3602,"Immediately, it becomes apparent that there are some similarities between this flight and the Lion Air crash."
3603,archived recording 1
3604,"Preliminary data shows a, quote, “clear similarity” to the Lion Air Max 8 crash off Indonesia in October."
3605,archived recording 2
3606,Both planes were Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts.
3607,archived recording 3
3608,"What we now understand is what people had suspected, that there are certain similarities between the Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian crash earlier this month."
3609,michael barbaro
3610,What are those similarities?
3611,natalie kitroeff
3612,"So the pilot of the Ethiopian Airlines flight reported flight control problems. So that was a first clue. The plane is also moving in the same way that the Lion Air plane was, up and down. The speeds are changing rapidly, suggesting that the pilot may have been fighting with this system, again, with the pilot trying to pull the nose up, and the system pushing it down. Then there is physical evidence recovered at the site of the crash that seems to suggest that the nose was being pitched down. We don’t know why. But again, it all points to this system being involved, potentially contributing to another tragedy."
3613,michael barbaro
3614,"And so what is the reaction this time, after the second crash of a 737 Max?"
3615,natalie kitroeff
3616,Boeing stands firm behind the plane. And American carriers are right there with them. But —
3617,archived recording
3618,China has grounded its entire Boeing 737 Max fleet.
3619,natalie kitroeff
3620,— regulators around the world seem a little less confident. The Chinese and Indonesians quickly ground the 737 Max.

3627,natalie kitroeff
3628,— American regulators are all of a sudden under immense pressure for the F.A.A. to ground these planes.
3629,archived recording (donald trump)
3630,"Boeing is an incredible company. They are working very, very hard right now. And hopefully, they’ll very quickly come up with the answer. But until they do, the planes are grounded."
3631,michael barbaro
3632,"All of this looks very bad for Boeing, obviously. And it seems to stem from this original motivation, as you described it, to avoid classifying this new energy-efficient plane that would compete against Airbuses as fundamentally different from older models of the 737 that would require expensive training of the pilots, even though a very crucial part of the plane was different."
3633,natalie kitroeff
3634,"That’s right. This motivation to keep this plane as similar as possible to its predecessor permeated the entire engineering process. Remember, this is how Boeing needs to compete with Airbus. It’s also raising questions about the entire process for certifying aircraft in the United States. There is renewed scrutiny on the closeness between the F.A.A. and Boeing. The F.A.A. and Boeing work together to certify planes. The F.A.A. actually relies heavily on Boeing employees to help certify its aircraft."
3635,michael barbaro
3636,And is that basically industry practice? Companies that make these planes work with the Federal Aviation Administration on the approval process?
3637,natalie kitroeff
3638,That’s exactly right.
3639,michael barbaro
3640,Hmm.
3641,natalie kitroeff
3642,"I mean, folks were talking about this, right? But nobody was kind of raising red flags. I mean, it wasn’t like people were up in arms about the way that this certification system works. But now there’s been two crashes of the same model in less than five months. And we’re hearing more and more from regulators and former regulators about how this close relationship may be too cozy."
3643,michael barbaro
3644,"Natalie, what do we know about the role that Boeing’s employees played specifically in the certification of the Boeing 737 Max?"
3645,natalie kitroeff
3646,"We know that Boeing plays a critical role in helping to certify its aircraft. And we are learning more and more about the role that it played in the case of the 737 Max. The Seattle Times recently reported that not only was the F.A.A. relying heavily on Boeing in this case, but that Boeing itself was turning out an analysis that was downplaying the potential risks of a software system that is now at issue after these two crashes."
3647,michael barbaro
3648,Hmm.
3649,natalie kitroeff
3650,"The F.A.A., like any federal agency, has a limited budget. And there’s a reason why it would want to rely on the people who are most informed about the inner workings of increasingly complex aircraft in order to determine whether that plane is airworthy. You can see why you would need a relationship, and one where there is a lot of information-sharing, right? Because the one side can’t employ as many people as Boeing does. And the other side has a ton of expertise. But is that relationship too close?"
3651,michael barbaro
3652,"Right. And there seems to be a lot of trust at the center of this system you’re describing that allows Boeing to basically be like a co-regulator of itself. And the most important trust involved here seems to be that a business will always put safety above profits. And I guess the question here is whether in a system with that much trust, that balance could get out of whack, and safety might lose out to profits. And the only way we would know that is when there’s a tragedy or two tragedies."
3653,natalie kitroeff
3654,"Boeing doesn’t want planes to crash. So their motivations are, in many ways, exactly aligned with their customers’. But what’s emerged after these two crashes — I mean, you heard the pilots. They said this was a breach of trust."
3655,michael barbaro
3656,Right.
3657,natalie kitroeff
3658,"I think a lot of people are feeling that right now, that feeling of questioning of this process. And this isn’t to say anything about Boeing’s motivations. We are at the very beginning of investigating these two flights, and we do not want to rush to conclusions. But you’re asking the questions that the people at the front line of this industry, the pilots, the crew, they’re asking that right now. How do we regain trust in Boeing? And how do we know for sure that we are being told everything we need to know in order to fly these planes?"
3659,michael barbaro
3660,"We’ve been talking about trust, the trust that the F.A.A. had in Boeing, that the airlines, their pilots and crews had or didn’t have in this plane. But I’m wondering now about the trust that we, as the flying public, have in these planes. And it’s kind of hard to imagine wanting to fly on a 737 Max anytime soon. Let’s say that the software gets fixed. And Boeing and the F.A.A., through their certification process, they all sign off on everything being safe. Why should we trust them after that? Why should we trust them, kind of, ever?"
3661,natalie kitroeff
3662,"I think that coming up with the software fix is manageable for Boeing, an industrial juggernaut that has dealt with these issues before. And you’ll remember, the 787 Dreamliner was grounded for three months in 2013, when it had battery fire problems."
3663,michael barbaro
3664,And that was a Boeing plane?
3665,natalie kitroeff
3666,"Right, a Boeing plane. And we all fly on it. It’s possible that people will be wary right now. But Boeing has the capacity to fix this thing and probably will. The bigger question is whether these two tragedies lead to a more wholesale transformation in the process for regulating the aircraft manufacturers in this country. What, if anything, is going to change in the process by which we determine, in the United States, that planes are safe to fly?"
3667,[music]
3668,
3669,michael barbaro
3670,"Natalie, thank you very much."
3671,natalie kitroeff
3672,"Thank you, Michael."
3673,"The Federal Aviation Administration certified the 737 Max 8 in 2017, and a key question now is the role that Boeing employees played in the certification process."
3674,"The F.A.A. has long relied on outside experts known as designees to help approve new aircraft, and in 2005, it established a program through which plane makers like Boeing could choose their own employees to act on the agency’s behalf in helping to certify new models."
3675,"The program is meant to allow the F.A.A. to focus its limited resources on the most crucial work, but critics have questioned whether it essentially allows plane makers to serve as their own regulators."
3676,"Mr. Garneau said the Canadian government would also examine any alterations that Boeing made to the planes’ software regardless of F.A.A. certification, as is the normal procedure."
3677,"Just the suggestion that Canada has doubts about the F.A.A.’s certification of the planes is a significant change from last week. When Mr. Garneau announced that he was banning the Max series aircraft from Canadian skies on Wednesday, he also praised the professionalism of the F.A.A."
3678,"“With respect to safety, we are very comfortable with the fact that they are the certifying agency,” he said at a news conference."
3679,"By mutual agreement, Canada and the United States have accepted the other’s certifications for its planes."
3680,"“The F.A.A. has been something that Canada would follow to a considerable degree,” said Karl Moore, a business professor at McGill University in Montreal who closely follows the aviation industry. “So I would view this as a considerable shift.”"
3681,"While Mr. Garneau did not offer any specific reason for his department’s review, Professor Moore said it might be linked to questions around Boeing’s relationship with the F.A.A. as well as concerns about the certification of the Max series."
3682,"The F.A.A. and Boeing have been adamant for the last week that the certification process is working well, and neither has suggested that any changes are planned. After the crash in Ethiopia, the F.A.A. said its “aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs.”"
3683,This has been a week unusually marked by tragedies.
3684,"Among Commonwealth countries, it seems to me that Canadians have a particular kinship with New Zealanders. Perhaps that’s because New Zealand’s relationship with much larger Australia somewhat mirrors Canada’s with the larger still United States."

3686,"But whatever the nature of the relationship, Canada joined the rest of the world in shock and sorrow over the mosque killings in Christchurch on Friday."
3687,"And, of course, the week began with an another awful event: the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people, 18 of them Canadians."
3688,"The victims included four young people in a program to help develop future leaders, and conservationists who were off to Kenya to represent Canada at a United Nations conference. My colleague Dan Bilefsky met in Brampton, Ontario, with surviving members of a single family that lost six people."

3690,"And if it was school break in your part of Canada, you most likely know all too well that the crash led to the global grounding of the Boeing 737 Max airliner, a relatively new plane used by Air Canada, WestJet and Sunwing. Last weekend’s crash in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, was the second crash of a 737 Max 8 since October, when a Lion Air plane plummeted to earth, taking 189 lives."
3691,"While the investigation of this week’s crash is in its early stages, both that flight and the Lion Air flight had extraordinarily erratic takeoffs. In the case of the earlier crash, problems with a software and sensor system that was supposed to be a safety feature to prevent the plane from stalling have been blamed. Instead, the software repeatedly contradicted the pilot’s actions."
3692,"“Unfortunately the pilot lost that fight with the software,” Marc Garneau, the former astronaut and transport minister, said about the Lion Air flight while announcing that Canada was banning the planes from its skies."
3693,"Earlier this year, a team at the The Times used the data from the Lion Air crash to recreate the scene inside the cockpit, minute by minute, to show how the pilots lost the battle to save the flight."
3694,"[Read: In 12 Minutes, Everything Went Wrong]"
3695,"There is an indirect link between Canada’s aerospace industry and Boeing’s need for the special software in the recently developed Max airliners. Boeing was concerned that its new version of the 737, a plane that first flew in 1967, might stall because it had a new type of jet engine that allowed it to fly farther and faster on less fuel while making less noise."
3696,"The trouble was that the new engines were much larger than those of traditional jets and wouldn’t fit under the 737’s unusually low wings. So on the Max planes, the engines were positioned well ahead of and slightly above the wing, which created the potential for stalls that the software was supposed to cure."
3697,"Both Boeing and Airbus initially dismissed the new engines, but Montreal’s Bombardier bet the future of its aerospace division on them and designed an all-new airliner, the CSeries, around the new technology. But the project, as I wrote in 2015, was hit by delays, cost overruns and a reluctance by carriers to buy from anyone other than Boeing and Airbus."
3698,"While Bombardier struggled, the two aerospace giants eventually saw the light. Creating the Max jetliners out of the 52-year-old 737 was Boeing’s low-cost and, until now, highly successful answer. As Bombardier’s project neared collapse because of an American trade action, Airbus took over the CSeries and renamed it the A220. It paid nothing for the plane and its technology, and Bombardier is now very much Airbus’s junior partner."
3699,"As the 737 Maxes remain grounded, we will continue to look into a variety of related questions, including why Boeing was able to convince regulators that 737 pilots required no new training to fly the plane or even be informed about its anti-stall software, and why months have passed without fixes for that software being released."

3712,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
3713,"It was the second time in a matter of months that this model, the 737 Max 8, crashed just minutes after an erratic takeoff, leaving Boeing and safety regulators around the globe racing to determine what went wrong and whether the plane is safe to fly."
3714,"Investigators in Ethiopia on Monday said the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder had both been recovered, which could speed up the investigation. But it could still take time to discern whether the cause of the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which killed 157 people, was a faulty plane, pilot error or something else entirely."
3715,"In October, a Lion Air flight crashed under similar circumstances in Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board. While the cause of that crash is still under investigation, Indonesian and American aviation authorities have raised the possibility that software in the Max 8 was partly to blame."
3716,"Those similarities immediately provoked concern among carriers, pilots, flight attendants, passengers and investors. At least 20 airlines around the world have grounded their 737 Max 8 planes, largely in China and Indonesia. In all, more than 140 of the roughly 350 new jets that were in service have been pulled from use."
3717,"The Federal Aviation Administration said on Monday that it would examine the data and act as necessary. “External reports are drawing similarities between this accident and the Lion Air Flight 610 accident,” the American regulator said in a statement. “However, this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions.”"
3718,"Southwest Airlines and American Airlines, the only two carriers in the United States that use the jet, both said they would continue to fly the plane. At least 16 more carriers around the world are still flying the jet."
3719,"Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis Muilenburg, expressed sympathy for the victims and their families on Monday, saying the company was working closely with American and Ethiopian authorities to investigate the accident. He said Boeing was committed to ensuring the safety and quality of its planes. But he cautioned against speculating about “the cause of the accident without all the necessary facts,” adding that it could “compromise the integrity of the investigation.”"
3720,"The uncertainty over the cause of the latest crash has put Boeing on the defensive. The 737 Max is the company’s best-selling jet ever, and it is expected to be a major driver of profits in the future. Around 5,000 of the planes are on order, with a list price of $120 million for the Max 8 version."
3721,"Shares of the company fell 5 percent on Monday, as pressure mounted from various corners."
3722,"The Association of Flight Attendants sent a letter to the F.A.A. on Monday calling for a review of the 737 Max. “We need help from the regulators when the entire world is looking at two catastrophic incidents that happened on the same aircraft type within five months of each other,” said Sara Nelson, the president of the flight attendants’ union. “Our system is so safe that these things don’t happen today. That is why people are questioning what is going on here.”"
3723,"Pilots also raised questions about the safety of the plane. “We’re very concerned about why two brand-new aircraft suddenly pitched over and nosed into the ground,” said Rory Kay, a former top safety official at the world’s largest pilot union and a senior pilot and pilot trainer at a major United States airline. “This is not the dawn of aviation. We’ve evolved, planes have evolved.”"
3724,"Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot, said that the Lion Air crash hurt the reputation of the 737 Max in the eyes of some of his members and that the Ethiopian accident had prompted new questions from them. “I think there needs to be further review into the certification process” for the aircraft, Mr. Tajer said. “Everybody should be looking at this.”"
3725,"In Washington, two senators, Dianne Feinstein of California and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, went a step further, calling on the F.A.A. to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8s until the investigation into the Ethiopia crash was complete."
3726,"Some passengers tried to rebook their flights to avoid a 737 Max 8. Carriers that hadn’t grounded the plane sought to reassure customers, providing information about the jet’s safety."
3727,"Alicia Winnett and her husband had planned to fly Air Canada from Vancouver to Calgary on Friday. Ms. Winnett contacted the carrier hoping to switch to a later flight on an Airbus 320, but Air Canada told her that was not possible."
3728,"“I just cannot sit on a Boeing 737 Max 8 with confidence,” she said."
3729,"Chinese airlines operated other aircraft as substitutes for the 737 Max 8s on 256 flights in the first several hours after the grounding of the jets, according to VariFlight, an online flight-tracking service based in China. Twenty-nine flights were canceled."
3730,"A key question for investigators is whether the same system suspected to have played a role in the Lion Air crash contributed to the Ethiopia disaster. Indonesian and American aviation authorities have raised the possibility that a new system in the 737 Max jets — and the pilots’ lack of familiarity with it — could have contributed to the crash of Flight 610. The so-called maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, known as MCAS, was a new software system that could automatically change the plane’s trajectory."
3731,"Boeing and regulatory agencies have since informed pilots and airlines of the new system. It was not immediately known if pilots for Ethiopian Airlines, which has a strong safety reputation, were given additional training."
3732,"After the Lion Air crash, Boeing was expected to update the software. On Monday night, Boeing said it was working with the F.A.A. on an upgrade to “be deployed across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks.”"
3733,"Details from Ethiopia were still scant. The pilot of the flight on Sunday sent out a distress call shortly after takeoff, and was cleared to return to the airport. Before it could do so, witnesses described an aircraft that swerved and dipped wildly in its final moments, spewing smoke and making unusual noises before it hurtled into the ground."

3774,One man told Ethiopia’s national broadcaster that the jet appeared to briefly gain altitude shortly before it smashed into a field.
3775,"Another witness, who identified himself by only one name, Feyissa, said he had seen the aircraft circling four or five times. “Then the plane came down almost vertically at great speed, hard and loud — fire, smoke and everything happened so fast,” he said."
3776,"Aviation experts have cautioned that while witness accounts can help in an investigation, they are not necessarily accurate and are of limited value in helping pinpoint the cause or causes of a crash."
3777,The victims were from more than 35 countries and included at least 22 employees of United Nations-affiliated agencies.
3778,"Persistent concerns about the Boeing 737 Max 8 could have an outsize influence on global travel. Airlines often fly those jets, and their earlier versions, multiple times a day."
3779,"“Because it’s the most widely used jetliner, when there are unanswered questions about it and groundings, it can have a huge ripple effect in the confidence of the aviation system,” said Bill Adair, author of “The Mystery of Flight 427,” a book about a 737 crash in 1994. “But it’s important not to jump to conclusions, and it’s awfully early to be grounding airplanes.”"
3780,"Boeing has faced periods of scrutiny in the past. A series of 737 crashes in the 1980s and 1990s prompted concerns about the plane’s safety, though Boeing kept producing and selling them."
3781,"In the last decade, Boeing faced a crisis when lithium-ion batteries in the 787 Dreamliner were catching fire. To address that problem, Boeing assembled a team of experts from around the company, many of whom hadn’t initially worked on the 787."
3782,"“It was a total mobilization, they had hundreds of people working on it,” said John Hall, a former Boeing engineer who was part of the effort. “This is a far more difficult call. It’s not clear that there’s anything wrong with the airplane. They’ve had two crashes now, but they don’t know the cause.”"
3783,"On Sunday, Boeing dispatched a so-called technical assistance team — a group of several engineers and experts based in the United States — to assist with the investigation in Ethiopia."
3784,"The company communicated with the 59 carriers that use the 737 Max 8 and 9 models, and Mr. Muilenburg, the Boeing chief, kept his board updated on developments."
3785,"Late Monday, Mr. Muilenburg sent an email to employees with an update on the situation."
3786,"“I know this tragedy is especially challenging coming only months after the loss of Lion Air Flight 610,” he wrote, according to a copy of the email reviewed by The New York Times. “While difficult, I encourage everyone to stay focused on the important work we do.”"
3787,"Boeing faced an unthinkable defection in the spring of 2011. American Airlines, an exclusive Boeing customer for more than a decade, was ready to place an order for hundreds of new, fuel-efficient jets from the world’s other major aircraft manufacturer, Airbus."
3788,"The chief executive of American called Boeing’s leader, W. James McNerney Jr., to say a deal was close. If Boeing wanted the business, it would need to move aggressively, the airline executive, Gerard Arpey, told Mr. McNerney."
3789,"To win over American, Boeing ditched the idea of developing a new passenger plane, which would take a decade. Instead, it decided to update its workhorse 737, promising the plane would be done in six years."
3790,The 737 Max was born roughly three months later.
3791,"The competitive pressure to build the jet — which permeated the entire design and development — now threatens the reputation and profits of Boeing, after two deadly crashes of the 737 Max in less than five months. Prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether the effort to design, produce and certify the Max was rushed, leading Boeing to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training."
3792,"While investigators are still trying to determine the cause of the crash in Ethiopia this month and one in Indonesia in October, they are focused on a newly installed piece of software designed to avoid stalls. The software was meant to compensate for bigger, more fuel-efficient engines and ensure the plane flew the same way as an earlier version."
3793,"Months behind Airbus, Boeing had to play catch-up. The pace of the work on the 737 Max was frenetic, according to current and former employees who spoke with The New York Times. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter."
3794,"Engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings and designs at roughly double the normal pace, former employees said. Facing tight deadlines and strict budgets, managers quickly pulled workers from other departments when someone left the Max project. Although the project had been hectic, current and former employees said they had finished it feeling confident in the safety of the plane."
3795,"The specter of Boeing’s chief rival was constant. Airbus had been delivering more jets than Boeing for several years. And losing the American account would have been gutting, costing the manufacturer billions in lost sales and potentially thousands of jobs."
3796,"“They weren’t going to stand by and let Airbus steal market share,” said Mike Renzelmann, an engineer who retired in 2016 from Boeing’s flight control team on the 737 Max."
3797,"Boeing didn’t seem bothered at first by the A320neo, the fuel-efficient plane that Airbus announced in 2010."
3798,"At a meeting in January of the next year, James F. Albaugh, the chief executive of Boeing’s commercial airplanes division, told employees that Airbus would probably go over budget creating a plane that carriers didn’t really want, according to a recording of the meeting reviewed by The Times."
3799,"Mr. Albaugh boasted that carriers were already paying more for Boeing’s single-aisle jet than the Airbus version. He didn’t see the need to strike now — Boeing could wait until the end of the decade to produce a new plane from scratch, the executive said."
3800,"“I don’t think we need to get too spun up over the fact that they’re making some sales,” he said."
3801,"For decades, Airbus was barely on Boeing’s radar. A consortium started in 1970 by several European countries, it was slow to compete globally. Boeing, founded in 1916, dominated the passenger-jet market with its 737 midsize jet and the 747 jumbo jet."
3802,"Then came John Leahy, an American who rose through the ranks to become the chief Airbus salesman in 1994. Mr. Leahy was relentless. Once, the chief executive of an airline got sick just as a deal was about to close. Mr. Leahy traveled to the man’s house, and the executive signed the papers while wearing his bathrobe."
3803,"“Boeing thought we were a flash in the pan,” Mr. Leahy said in an interview. “But I thought there was no reason we couldn’t have 50 percent of the market.”"
3804,"Mr. Leahy scored a major coup in 1999 when JetBlue decided to launch with a fleet composed entirely of Airbus A320s. In the years that followed, more low-cost carriers around the world, like easyJet, placed big orders, too."
3805,"Airbus had pulled ahead of Boeing by 2005. “Boeing has struggled with the development work needed to take the company into the 21st century,” Tim Clark, president of Emirates, the Dubai airline, said that year. Airbus, he said, “has been braver, more brazen.”"
3806,"In 2008, Airbus delivered 483 airplanes, while Boeing delivered just 375. Three years later at the Paris Air Show, Airbus took orders for 730 aircraft, worth some $72.2 billion, with its new fuel-efficient version dominating."
3807,"“Boeing was just completely arrogant in dismissing the viability of the A320,” said Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm."
3808,"As American considered placing its largest-ever aircraft order exclusively with Airbus in the spring of 2011, executives at the carrier initially didn’t believe Boeing thought that the threat was real, according to a person involved with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity."
3809,"Airbus had a team camped out in a suite at the Ritz-Carlton in Dallas, near American’s headquarters. Mr. Leahy traveled to Dallas and dined with the American chief, Mr. Arpey, at the Mansion on Turtle Creek, a five-star hotel. Boeing visited less frequently, according to several people involved in the sales process."
3810,"With American pondering which planes to buy, Boeing made a business decision. A former senior Boeing official said the company opted to build the Max because it would be far quicker, easier and cheaper than starting from scratch, and would provide almost as much fuel savings for airlines."
3811,"Eventually, American decided to make deals with both Boeing and Airbus, buying hundreds of jets from each. Mr. Arpey called Mr. McNerney again, this time reading from a script to carefully calibrate his words. First, he congratulated the Boeing chief on the deal, according to the person with knowledge of the discussions. Then he broke the news that American would also place an order with Airbus."
3812,"Inside Boeing, the race was on. Roughly six months after the project’s launch, engineers were already documenting the differences between the Max and its predecessor, meaning they already had preliminary designs for the Max — a fast turnaround, according to an engineer who worked on the project."
3813,"“The timeline was extremely compressed,” the engineer said. “It was go, go, go.”"
3814,"One former designer on the team working on flight controls for the Max said the group had at times produced 16 technical drawings a week, double the normal rate. “They basically said, ‘We need something now,’” the designer said."
3815,"A technician who assembles wiring on the Max said that in the first months of development, rushed designers were delivering sloppy blueprints to him. He was told that the instructions for the wiring would be cleaned up later in the process, he said."
3816,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
3817,"His internal assembly designs for the Max, he said, still include omissions today, like not specifying which tools to use to install a certain wire, a situation that could lead to a faulty connection. Normally such blueprints include intricate instructions."
3818,"Despite the intense atmosphere, current and former employees said, they felt during the project that Boeing’s internal quality checks ensured the aircraft was safe."
3819,"In a statement, Boeing said: “The Max program launched in 2011. It was offered to customers in September 2012. Firm configuration of the airplane was achieved in July 2013. The first completed 737 Max 8 rolled out of the Renton factory in November 2015.”"
3820,"The company added, “A multiyear process could hardly be considered rushed.”"
3821,"At the heart of Boeing’s push was a focus on creating a plane that was essentially the same as earlier 737 models, important for getting the jet certified quickly. It would also help limit the training that pilots would need, cutting down costs for airlines."
3822,"Rick Ludtke, an engineer who helped design the 737 Max cockpit and spent 19 years at Boeing, said the company had set a ground rule for engineers: Limit changes to hopefully avert a requirement that pilots spend time training in a flight simulator before flying the Max."
3823,"“Any designs we created could not drive any new training that required a simulator,” Mr. Ludtke said. “That was a first.”"
3824,"When upgrading the cockpit with a digital display, he said, his team wanted to redesign the layout of information to give pilots more data that were easier to read. But that might have required new pilot training."
3825,"So instead, they simply recreated the decades-old gauges on the screen. “We just went from an analog presentation to a digital presentation,” Mr. Ludtke said. “There was so much opportunity to make big jumps, but the training differences held us back.”"
3826,"“This program was a much more intense pressure cooker than I’ve ever been in,” he added. “The company was trying to avoid costs and trying to contain the level of change. They wanted the minimum change to simplify the training differences, minimum change to reduce costs, and to get it done quickly.”"
3827,"Boeing said in a statement that the 2011 decision to build the Max had beaten out other options, including developing a new airplane."
3828,"“The decision had to offer the best value to customers, including operating economics as well as timing, which was clearly a strong factor,” the company said. “Safety is our highest priority as we design, build and support our airplanes.”"
3829,"Months before Boeing’s announcement of the Max, the commercial airplanes executive, Mr. Albaugh, critiqued the decision by Airbus to refit the A320 with bigger engines, which could alter the aerodynamics and require big changes to the plane."
3830,"“It’s going to be a design change that will ripple through the airplane,” Mr. Albaugh said in the meeting with employees."
3831,"“I think they’ll find it more challenging than they think it will be,” he told them. “When they get done, they’ll have an airplane that might be as good as the Next Generation 737,” a plane that Boeing had launched in 1997."
3832,"But a main selling point of the new A320 was its fuel-efficient engines. To match Airbus, Boeing needed to mount the Max with its own larger and powerful new engines."
3833,"Just as Mr. Albaugh had predicted for Airbus, the decision created a cascade of changes. The bigger engines altered the aerodynamics of the plane, making it more likely to pitch up in some circumstances."
3834,"To offset that possibility, Boeing added the new software in the Max, known as MCAS, which would automatically push the nose down if it sensed the plane pointing up at a dangerous angle. The goal was to avoid a stall. Because the system was supposed to work in the background, Boeing believed it didn’t need to brief pilots on it, and regulators agreed. Pilots weren’t required to train in simulators."
3835,"The push for automation was a philosophical shift for Boeing, which for decades wanted to keep pilots in control of the planes as much as possible. Airbus, by comparison, tended to embrace technology, putting computers in control. Pilots who preferred the American manufacturer even had a saying: “If it’s not Boeing, I’m not going.”"
3836,"The new software system is now a focus of investigators who are trying to determine what went wrong in the Ethiopian Airlines crash and the Lion Air tragedy in Indonesia. A leading theory in the Lion Air crash is that the system was receiving bad data from a faulty sensor, triggering an unrecoverable nose dive. All 737 Max jets around the world are grounded, and Boeing has given no estimate of when they might return to flight."
3837,"In Renton, Wash., where the 737 Max is produced in a 1.1-million-square-foot plant, the mere possibility that Boeing engineering contributed to the crashes has cast a pall over the factory. After the Lion Air crash, Boeing offered trauma counseling to engineers who had worked on the plane."
3838,"“People in my group are devastated by this,” said Mr. Renzelmann, the former Boeing technical engineer. “It’s a heavy burden.”"
3839,"In a statement, Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, said he had spent time in Renton recently and “saw firsthand the pride our people feel in their work and the pain we’re all experiencing in light of these tragedies.”"
3840,"Boeing is working on an update to MCAS software. The company was meeting with carriers over the weekend to discuss the update, which is expected to roll out by April. It also intends to make a previously optional safety indicator in its cockpit standard in new Max jets."
3841,The business is increasingly under pressure as airlines reconsider their orders and ask for compensation. But work in Renton is continuing apace.
3842,"Boeing now makes a record 52 737s a month — most of them Maxes — and aims to reach 57 by April. As fuselages and plane skeletons continued to chug into the factory by train this past week, crews worked around the clock to make thousands more."
3843,"On March 10, The New York Times reported that under the Trump administration the American military had drastically increased airstrikes in Somalia against the Shabab, an insurgent group affiliated with Al Qaeda, even as it scaled back counterterrorism operations in other parts of the world. In recent years, Africa Command has acknowledged using unmanned MQ-9 Reaper drones, which are mainly armed with Hellfire missiles and 500-pound guided bombs. But as far back as November 2017, the Pentagon deployed Air Force variants of C-130 Hercules cargo planes with dispensers called common launch tubes, or C.L.T.s, to launch a new kind of guided weapon at Somali targets, according to a report released by Amnesty International on March 20. While Africa Command would not confirm to The Times its use of ground-attack aircraft in the region, Amnesty International found photographs of an American airstrike site that showed the remains of a GBU-69 Small Glide Munition, a bomb that can be dropped only using a C.L.T., which in this instance was fitted to an AC-130 gunship."
3844,"[For more stories about the changing nature of warfare, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]"
3845,"The escalation of airstrikes, as well as the introduction of manned gunships, has transformed the Defense Department’s Africa Command, based in Germany, into a war-fighting element akin to Central Command, which directs the wars in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Africa Command, which was created only in 2007, has stressed that its role on the continent is to focus on training and equipping allied troops on the continent, but the rise in strikes points to a change in both posture and mission. Current and former American officials previously told The Times that there wasn’t one clear reason for the increase, but they noted that the drawdown of American military operations elsewhere in the world has given Africa Command more drones and gunships to use in Somalia. The loosening of regulations under the Trump administration on using force in the country has also contributed to the rise."
3846,"At just four feet long and slightly less than seven inches in diameter, the launch tube attached to these manned gunships dispenses a type of air-to-ground weapon that the Pentagon is buying in greater numbers. These tubes can, according to manufacturers’ websites, be fitted onto much of the Defense Department’s fleet of previously unarmed surveillance planes to enable covert attacks — and thus potentially vastly increase the number of aircraft capable of carrying out airstrikes, allowing the American military to discreetly move converted gunships around the world."
3847,"The C.L.T. has gone from concept to killer relatively quickly by defense industry standards. Developed in 2009 as a joint project between Special Operations Command and Systima Technologies, its first use in combat was in November 2010, according to Lt. Phillip Chitty, a spokesman for Special Operations Command. Chitty declined to provide additional details of that airstrike, saying that “the location and scenario are classified.” Systima Technologies did not respond to numerous requests for comment."
3848,"The types of weapons the Pentagon has tested with the launch tube offer some insight into how Special Operations forces plan to fight in the future. In interviews with The Times, military officials said they placed a premium on long-range silent weapons with smaller explosive warheads over traditional airdropped bombs. By removing solid rocket motors and adding aerofoil wings to produce lift, these “glide bombs” use gravity to reach their targets without making any noise. Contracting documents reviewed by The Times indicate that Special Operations Command required one such munition to weigh approximately 50 pounds, take no more than one minute to reach targets four nautical miles away, hit moving targets traveling up to 70 miles per hour and either burst in the air above the target or from contact with the target. According to those documents, only one weapon currently meets those requirements: the GBU-69 Small Glide Munition, made by Dynetics and dropped solely from C.L.T.s. This 60-pound glide bomb, which can be GPS-guided for stationary targets and laser-guided for moving targets, is a marked departure from weapons like the Hellfire missile. "
3849,"Nearly two decades of nonstop combat has revealed the limitations of weapons like the Hellfire, which was originally designed to destroy tanks. Even though Hellfire’s warhead has been redesigned for use against combatants, when fired the missile still produces a sound that pilots say can tip off people on the ground, prompting them to flee. By contrast, the Small Glide Munition reportedly makes far less noise than a Hellfire missile. Dynetics says its range exceeds 20 nautical miles, which could allow for a gunship to drop the bomb far enough away that people on the ground would not even see or hear the plane. In June 2018, Dynetics received a $470 million “indefinite quantity” contract to supply Special Operations Command with GBU-69s. A spokeswoman said that Special Operations Command has ordered more than 2,000 so far."
3850,"Special Operations Command has also been firing a small guided missile called Griffin from its dispensers. It is similar to the Hellfire missile in design and function, but is only two-thirds as long, weighs two-thirds less and has a similarly sized warhead."
3851,"In its development of new munitions like the GBU-69, the military has also come up with new ways to launch them. As the war in Iraq ground on, the Marine Corps decided in 2008 to arm its KC-130J Hercules refueling aircraft and turn them into close air support gunships. The resulting program, the Hercules Airborne Weapons Kit, added Hellfire missiles under the wings and two rows of five C.L.T.s strapped to the planes’ cargo ramp. By 2012, the Navy refitted the left-side passenger door toward the rear of these cargo planes with pressure-sealed fittings that allowed crewmen to load two launch tubes inside the plane side by side and drop them through the bottom of the door. The Navy called this the “Derringer Door” after the double-barreled pocket pistol designed for easy concealability. In a further evolution, Air Force AC-130 gunships now have a modified tail ramp with similar pressure-sealed fittings that allow up to 10 tube-launched weapons to be dropped before reloading."
3852,Air Force Special Operations Command declined to identify other aircraft that it intends to outfit with C.L.T. dispensers. But a review of available material from defense companies offers some clues that the Pentagon may be attaching the launch tubes to lower-profile aircraft like helicopters and small propeller-driven planes.
3853,"As the Special Operations Command evaluated different weapons for the launch tube, defense firms armed civilian planes for testing them. In 2012, MBDA, a defense giant in the weapons manufacturing industry, reported dropping a GBU-44 Viper Strike glide bomb from a Cessna Caravan, and in 2015, Textron dropped a G-CLAW guided bomb from the same kind of plane. Though the Pentagon has stopped buying the Viper Strike bomb and never purchased any G-CLAW guided bombs, the demonstrated ability to dispense these munitions from small propeller-driven airplanes is a notable development. A promotional video from Raytheon shows its Griffin missile being fired from a launch tube slung underneath the stub wing of an Army OH-58 Kiowa Warrior helicopter, and a manufacturer in Arizona advertises such mounts on its website. All these aircraft are much easier to hide in plain sight than huge, weaponized C-130 Hercules airplanes."

3856,"As the investigation continues into the fatal crash of a 737 Max 8 in Ethiopia on Sunday, regulators in China and Indonesia are grounding the planes, and some airlines in other countries are voluntarily pulling their fleets from service."
3857,"In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration, which certified the latest version of Boeing’s best-selling jet as airworthy in 2017, has not taken that step despite mounting questions about the plane’s safety record. The agency released a memo, known as a Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community, on Monday night that made no mention of plans to ground 737 Max planes. "
3858,"Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., described what a grounding entails and the factors regulators consider when making the decision to order one. His responses have been condensed and edited for clarity."
3859,What is a grounding?
3860,"A grounding occurs when the relevant safety regulator (the F.A.A. in the United States, or the European Aviation Safety Agency in Europe) removes the airworthiness certificate for a certain kind of plane. Effectively that makes those airplanes unusable in that jurisdiction, and also in other jurisdictions that have accepted a particular regulator’s authority."
3861,"Groundings come in a variety of forms. They can require planes be taken out of service immediately, even before a remedy has been specified, or they can come with a remedy specified. Airplanes can also be grounded after a certain number of hours or flights, during which the airlines that operate the affected aircraft can decide when and how to inspect and repair them. That kind of grounding happened most recently after the engine failure on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 last spring prompted the F.A.A. to order closer inspections of a type of engine made by CFM International. "
3862,What does it take for the F.A.A. to ground a fleet of planes?
3863,Regulators would have to conclude that there was some inherent design or manufacturing problem that was pervasive. 
3864,"The worst case example was the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 grounding following the American Airlines accident in Chicago in 1979 that killed more than 250 people. It’s the worst case from an airline’s perspective because as of the order’s effective  date, you don’t have the airplane to utilize in your fleet so your schedule is decimated."
3865,"In the case of that accident as I recall it, the concern was that there was some sort of a fatigue or maintenance procedure issue that could appear on that fleet of airplanes no matter who operated them. "
3866,When was the last time the F.A.A. grounded a fleet?
3867,"The most recent fleetwide grounding was in 2013, when the Federal Aviation Administration ordered Boeing 787s to stop flying temporarily after a problem with the plane’s battery system was identified."
3868,"That kind of grounding is pretty rare, and it should be, too. If they were happening regularly you would conclude that the review-of-design or review-of-manufacturing process was deficient. "
3869,What happened in the 787 case? 
3870,"In close sequence, an All Nippon Airways airplane had a battery system fire, and then days later a Japanese Airlines flight arrived to Boston with an aft cargo fire indication."
3871,The two battery fires in close sequence identified the issue that these batteries could go into thermal runaway. What Boeing engineered to isolate that problem was to first conduct an extensive analysis of the battery packs.
3872,"The F.A.A. determined there has to be some method of isolating these batteries if you have a problem. Boeing designed a stainless steel box into which the batteries were installed, and it was vented to the atmosphere. It controlled the battery fire if there was one within the box and let it get vented outside the airplane as opposed to burning into the cabin or the cargo compartment. To the best of my knowledge, that fix is still flying today."
3873,"A couple of years later, an Ethiopian 787 caught fire at Heathrow, and that was attributed to the emergency locator battery. That took about 15 months to figure out. In that case, the locator beacon was banned and pulled from service."
3874,How long do groundings usually last?
3875,It varies. The issue is whether you have anything to suggest how to remedy the issue or whether there’s anything that needs to be remedied. 
3876,"If it’s just a question of reinforcing what needs to be done to respond to that particular event should it occur, you train for that, you test for it and that’s what you do. "
3877,"But if it’s something that requires a system redesign, then there’s a question of whether you issue an interim order that focuses on a way to make that kind of system moot or whether there’s some greater change that needs to be made. "
3878,"In the case of the 737 Max, the fact that there are people that fly the airplane every day without issue suggests there’s some sort of anomaly that’s occurring or why it doesn’t seem to happen here or in China where there are a hundred of them flying. It’s unclear what, if anything, is the proximate cause of these particular incidents."
3879,"While airlines like Southwest and American have said they will continue to operate with their fleets of Max 8s, other carriers have halted their use as the investigation continues."

4026,"The body of the Argentine soccer striker Emiliano Sala was recovered from the plane that crashed into the English Channel last month, the British authorities said late Thursday."
4027,"The body, recovered a day earlier from the channel, was identified by the coroner for the County of Dorset, England, the police said in a statement. The police said that the families of Mr. Sala and the pilot, David Ibbotson, had been informed."
4028,"“Our thoughts remain with them at this difficult time,” the police said. Mr. Ibbotson was the only other person who was on the small plane."
4029,"The recovery crews from the British Air Accidents Investigation Branch tried to retrieve the wreckage itself, but bad weather forced them to give up, investigators said in an earlier statement. Privately funded search teams had also joined the search for Mr. Sala and Mr. Ibbotson."
4030,"Mr. Sala, 28, who had recently transferred to the English Premier League club Cardiff City from Nantes in the French league, was flying to Cardiff from Nantes on Jan. 21 when the single-engine, propeller-driven Piper Malibu vanished."
4031,"Mr. Sala had sent an audio message from the plane to a group of friends on WhatsApp, saying that he was “so afraid” and that the plane “seems like it’s falling to pieces.”"
4032,"The authorities called off a search on Jan. 24. But efforts resumed after more than 371,000 euros, about $424,000, was raised from donors, including some of soccer’s most prominent players."
4033,"On Sunday, a shipwreck hunter, David Mearns, announced that his team on the ship FPV Morven had found the plane. Another ship, the Geo Ocean III, used a remotely operated vehicle to film the wreckage, and images of the registration number on the fuselage confirmed that it was the missing plane."
4034,"Mr. Sala had been one of the leading strikers in France this season. Cardiff City, which has one of the Premier League’s lowest goal totals, had signed him in an effort to improve its poor offensive production."
4035,"The Welsh team agreed to pay 15 million pounds, or more than $19 million, to acquire Mr. Sala. Nantes has demanded payment of the first installment of that transfer fee, which is to be paid over three years, the BBC reported on Wednesday."
4036,The trouble appeared to begin almost immediately after takeoff. The pilots told air traffic controllers that they were having technical problems. And the plane seemed to repeatedly climb and dive before a final plunge.
4037,"Two eerily similar scenes have played out in recent months for Boeing’s brand-new 737 Max jets: on Sunday, when an Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed just after taking off from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people, and in October, when a Lion Air disaster killed 189 people in Indonesia."
4038,"The Ethiopian crash occurred just outside the country’s capital, leaving a smoking crater where investigators combed over the grim scene. Much about the cause of the crash remains unknown and will take weeks to investigate, and Boeing and the National Transportation Safety Board are sending teams to the crash site."
4039,[The plane lost contact with air traffic controllers six minutes after takeoff before plunging to earth.]
4040,"But the rarity of two planes of the same model going down in such a short time span has urgently caught the attention of pilots, passengers, engineers and industry analysts."
4041,"For Boeing, the questions go to the heart of its business, as the 737 class is a workhorse for airlines worldwide, and the single-aisle 737 Max has been the company’s best-selling plane ever. By the end of January, Boeing had delivered over 350 737 Max jets since putting them in service in 2017. They have a list price of around $120 million, the company said, and around 5,000 more are on order."

4098,"“There’s a whole lot of questions here and not a lot of answers,” said John Cox, the former executive air safety chairman of the Air Line Pilots Association in the United States and now the chief executive of Safety Operating Systems, a consulting firm."
4099,"Some airline and national officials are not waiting for answers. China on Monday morning ordered the grounding of 737 Max planes, and Cayman Airways said it was grounding its two new 737 Max jets."
4100,[Boeing’s shares dropped as trading began on Monday.]
4101,"The business of building and selling jets is brutally competitive, and the 737 Max was Boeing’s answer to an update that Airbus, the giant European aircraft manufacturer, unveiled for its popular A320 jet that made it more fuel-efficient. The two companies are global leaders in the field, and they have jockeyed for dominance for years. About 10,000 total planes from Boeing’s 737 family are in service, compared with over 8,000 in Airbus’s A320 family. Many airlines rely on these kinds of planes as linchpins of their fleets. They are designed to efficiently serve short- and medium-haul routes (like New York to Miami or Los Angeles), and carry about 200 passengers."
4102,"Boeing’s response to its rival’s move was a more efficient engine, but the Max engine was bigger than the earlier versions. To address this engineering challenge, Boeing updated the software for the flight control system. After the Lion Air crash, some American aviation authorities said that the change had not been adequately explained to pilots."
4103,"But in light of the Indonesian disaster, pilots have since been informed by Boeing and regulatory agencies of the Max’s new system, and airlines have provided training classes on it. Whether Ethiopian Airlines, which, unlike Lion Air, has a strong safety reputation, carried out that training was not immediately known."
4104,"Boeing installed the system on the new 737s as part of the “control law” — commands issued by the plane’s flight-control computer that bypass the pilots. On the Lion Air flight, the swings up and down may have come about as pilots repeatedly tried to keep that system from pushing the nose of the aircraft down and putting it into a fatal dive. Whatever happened, the pilots lost their battle after about 12 minutes of flight."
4105,"While a malfunction of that system is a possibility in the Ethiopian flight, which lasted about six minutes and included a shorter series of swings, early information is still too sketchy to draw conclusions. And what is known so far does not rule out pilot error or the malfunction of a completely separate system."
4106,[World leaders and citizens from more than 30 countries mourned the dead in Ethiopia.]
4107,"Robert Stengel, an expert on flight control systems and a professor of engineering and applied science at Princeton University, said it was not clear whether the rocking trajectory of the Ethiopian jet was caused by a malfunctioning control system or pilots trying to fly the plane manually while distracted by some other, as yet unknown, emergency."
4108,"While cautioning that no conclusions could be reached without more information, Professor Stengel said that broad similarities in the two crashes could not help but affect the flying public."
4109,"“If you’re simply looking at circumstantial evidence, that gives you pause, doesn’t it?” Professor Stengel said. “That’s not a deep technical observation — that’s just human nature.”"
4110,"The short, deadly flight in Ethiopia may call for immediate action while investigators determine if there is a common thread, said Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board."
4111,"“This matter has got to be addressed,” Mr. Hall said. “The possibility of grounding the aircraft would be one of many options I would assume the regulators and the investigators are looking at.”"
4112,"Analysts agree that Wall Street is not going to be kind to Boeing stock on Monday. And whatever hit its shares take will weigh heavily on the Dow Jones industrial average, which in recent years has been lifted by Boeing’s success."
4113,"Shares of Boeing have tripled since the presidential election in 2016, making it the highest-priced stock in the Dow. From Nov. 8, 2016, through Friday, the Dow added more than 7,000 points, and Boeing’s rise accounted for nearly 30 percent of its gain."
4114,How the pilots of Lion Air Flight 610 lost control.
4115,"Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group, cautioned against reading too much into the immediate reaction in Boeing’s shares. “I’ve learned from bitter experience not to look at the stock prices in the aftermath of a crash,” he said. “It’s just all over the place.” Mr. Aboulafia also predicted that any pullback was likely to be a short dip, given the company’s recent strength."
4116,"At the close of trading on Friday, Boeing was valued at nearly $239 billion, with a stock price above $422 a share. The company, which employs about 150,000 people, took in just over $100 billion in 2018, with profit for the year topping $10 billion."
4117,"Mr. Aboulafia said, “If they have to implement a very rapid series of any kind of modification or training procedures, A) they have the resources and B) relative to their revenue base, it’s not going to be a disaster.”"
4118,"Boeing has said that it is evaluating changes to  the new software, and a person briefed on the matter said an upgrade was in the works."
4119,"Just six years ago, Boeing had another high-profile headache with a new plane, when its 787s were grounded after a series of battery problems."
4120,"Scott Hamilton, an aviation industry consultant with the Leeham Company, said Boeing’s response to the issues with the 787 — when there were 50 in service — could preview its response to the 737 Max accidents."
4121,"Still, “it would be a bigger problem,” Mr. Hamilton said, “because at this point you have something close to 300 737 Maxes already in service.”"
4122,"The rapid series of steps that may have been needed to save the plane were not in the manual, and the pilots had not been trained on them."
4123,"Boeing, which makes commercial and military airplanes as well as other aerospace components, is one of the biggest exporters in the United States. The company’s main offices are in Chicago, and most of its production takes place in factories in Washington State and South Carolina."
4124,"According to Mr. Hamilton, the factory in Renton, Wash., primarily produces the 737 Max planes. Boeing also opened a so-called completion center in China in December. According to The Seattle Times, about a third of new 737s are delivered to Chinese airlines, and the new facility will allow finishing work like exterior painting and the installation of interior fixtures to happen more quickly and efficiently for those customers."
4125,"On Monday morning in China, most Chinese carriers stopped using the dozens of Boeing 737 Max jets that they had acquired and began flying Boeing 737-800s on the same routes. The Civil Aviation Administration of China then issued an order for the mandatory grounding of Boeing 737 Max planes by Chinese carriers."
4126,Flight-tracking websites showed that Chinese airlines were starting to substitute Boeing 737-800s on Monday morning on routes on which they had previously operated a Boeing 737 Max.
4127,"China’s main airlines are among the biggest users so far of the new Boeing jets, having ordered at least 104 of them and taken delivery already of at least 70. By contrast, many other carriers, often in slower-growing markets than China’s, have taken delivery of only a small fraction of their orders for the Boeing 737 Max."
4128,"The pilots who fly the 737 Max are keeping a close eye on developments. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot, said the training and other information had restored pilots’ confidence in Boeing since the Indonesia crash."
4129,"Mr. Tajer said it was too soon to say that the Ethiopian crash would change that view. But, he added, “We’re not far off the time when we were being told that new equipment on the Max wasn’t disclosed. We have that memory to work with.”"
4130,"“It’s too early,” he said, to say what influence the crash will have, “but boy, are we watching.”"
4131,"The Australian carrier Qantas has canceled an outstanding 2006 order for eight Airbus A380 airplanes, adding to the uncertainty about the fate of the world’s largest passenger aircraft. "
4132,"Qantas said in a statement on Thursday that it would instead upgrade the 12 A380 planes that it already had, adding that “these aircraft have not been part of the airline’s fleet and network plans for some time.” "
4133,"Airbus has already said the giant plane’s days could be numbered, acknowledging a year ago that it would have to end production if Emirates, its only major customer, did not order more. "
4134,"A bet that airport congestion and increased international travel would lead to demand for larger planes, the A380 was pitched as a way for airlines to transport more passengers with limited landing slots. The aircraft can carry more than 500 passengers. "
4135,"Instead, the industry shifted toward using smaller airplanes, a move that favored Airbus's main competitor, Boeing, and other makers of midsize planes that are cheaper to maintain. "
4136,"In an emailed statement on Thursday, Airbus said it had “agreed to the contract amendment announced by Qantas.”"
4137,"The double-decker A380 costs on average $445.6 million and boasts amenities like showers, first-class suites and a bar, but it has been a loss maker for Airbus. And the company’s chief operating offer, John Leahy, admitted in January 2018 that without an order from Emirates, which owns a fleet of 105, A380 production would be shut down. "
4138,"The jumbo jet was given a lifeline days later when Emirates put in a $16 billion order for as many as 36 of the planes. But this deal appears to be up in the air, too: Airbus confirmed at the end of January that it was in discussions with the Dubai-based airlines about the A380 contract. Emirates already owns 105 A380s. On Thursday, Airbus declined to comment on those talks."
4139,"LONDON/CARACAS — An Iranian delegation landed in Venezuela on Monday to discuss launching direct flights between the two countries, Venezuela's foreign minister said, as Tehran voices support for President Nicolas Maduro against the opposition backed by most Western countries."
4140,"A plane belonging to Mahan Air, a private Iranian airline accused by the West of transporting military equipment to Middle East war zones, landed in Caracas on Monday, and the two countries will discuss launching a direct flight ""in the coming months,"" Minister Jorge Arreaza told reporters."
4141,"A White House official said the U.S. government viewed the launch of direct flights as a ""politically motivated gesture."""
4142,"""From our standpoint, there's clearly no commercial reason to establish this flight at this time,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity."
4143,Iran's Mehr news agency quoted the spokesman of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization Reza Jafarzadeh as saying a delegation from Mahan Air was travelling to Caracas to discuss maintaining regular flights between the two countries. The nonstop Tehran-Caracas flight would take 16 hours.
4144,A Reuters photographer saw a Mahan Air plane parked at Caracas' main Maiquetia airport on Monday morning.
4145,"Mahan Air, established in 1992 as Iran's first private airline, has the country's largest fleet of aircraft. The United States imposed sanctions on the company in 2011, saying it provided financial and other support to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards (IRGC)."
4146,"France and Germany banned the airline's flights earlier this year, accusing it of transporting military equipment and personnel to Syria and other regional war zones."
4147,"Iran has voiced support for Maduro, who faces demands from the opposition and the United States to step down. Russia, China and Turkey have also backed Maduro."
4148,"The U.S. government has recognised opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's interim president. Most Latin American countries have done so as well, while European governments have cautiously thrown their support behind Guaido."
4149,"Since Guaido began a campaign in January to oust Maduro, whom he denounces as illegitimate, Chinese and Russian planes have flown supplies and military personnel to Venezuela in support of the government."

4151,"As much as any company in corporate America, Boeing would appear to be well prepared to deal with a public-relations crisis. A major exporter and military contractor, Boeing has deep ties in Washington and spends lavishly on lobbying."
4152,"Dennis A. Muilenburg, the chief executive, is on the board of the Business Roundtable, an influential group that seeks to shape public policy. Boeing’s top executive in the nation’s capital is a seasoned operator who worked in the Clinton White House."
4153,"Yet for all the scrutiny Boeing faced after the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and the subsequent grounding of its 737 Max planes around the world, the company initially had very little to say."
4154,[Follow our Boeing and F.A.A. Hearings Live Updates.]
4155,"It issued brief statements, expressing sympathy and standing by its planes. It communicated quietly with the news media and government officials. And Mr. Muilenburg stayed out of sight — his first substantial public comments came in the form of a statement released more than a week after the crash in Ethiopia — and to many observers, Boeing appeared to be caught flat-footed by the growing public outcry."
4156,"“Their comments have been very engineering-esque,” said Richard Levick, founder of Levick, a Washington crisis communications firm. “There has been no human face to this.”"
4157,"Boeing now faces its most public reckoning since the accident in Ethiopia this month, which followed the crash of another 737 Max jet, Lion Air Flight 610, in Indonesia in October."
4158,"On Wednesday in Washington, two Senate subcommittees are scheduled to hold hearings dealing with federal oversight of the aviation industry. Witnesses will include the transportation secretary, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration and the chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board."
4159,"In Renton, Wash., Boeing will be engaged in a charm offensive with its customers and the news media. An early-morning briefing for reporters will be followed by a factory tour. Later in the day, Boeing executives — though not Mr. Muilenburg — will meet with about 200 pilots, airline executives and regulators to review proposed changes to the 737 Max."
4160,"The crash in Ethiopia set off a global crisis for Boeing. In the days that followed, regulators around the world grounded the Max, lawmakers pushed for investigations and airlines called for compensation."
4161,Aviation experts zeroed in on new anti-stall software included in the 737 Max that is believed to have contributed to the Lion Air crash and may have played a role in the Ethiopian Airlines crash. Boeing has lost about $40 billion in market value in recent weeks.
4162,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
4163,"At first, Boeing stood by the airworthiness of the 737 Max, even as some regulators took the jetliner out of service. After President Trump tweeted concerns about aviation safety two days after the crash, Mr. Muilenburg called the president and encouraged him to keep the planes flying."
4164,"Yet Boeing did not make Mr. Muilenburg or other executives available for interviews at the time. Nor did anyone in Washington — like Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao or Daniel Elwell, the acting F.A.A. chief — truly step forward to become the face of the government response."
4165,"“You had inconsistent signals coming from the Department of Transportation, the F.A.A. and the N.T.S.B.,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a leadership professor at the Yale School of Management. “There was no one commanding voice of authority.”"
4166,"Meanwhile, the story quickly transcended Washington. Consumers scheduled to fly on 737 Maxes requested to switch planes. The travel website Kayak added a feature that allowed shoppers to sort flights by plane type."
4167,"“Boeing responded as a business-to-business company, but this has become a business-to-consumer issue,” Mr. Levick said. “Consumers now care about what plane they are on.”"
4168,"The F.A.A. eventually grounded the 737 Max planes, but not until after regulators around the world had already done so. Boeing supported the decision, with Mr. Muilenburg, the day after his first conversation with Mr. Trump, placing another call to the White House to say as much."
4169,"Though it appeared to be a flip-flop, Mr. Sonnenfeld said Boeing was doing the best it could with limited and constantly changing information."
4170,"“They weren’t avoiding or denying, they just didn’t have all the facts,” he said. “It’s just a very confusing situation, and they needed to frame the issue: Here’s what we know and here’s what we don’t know.”"
4171,"Even with the planes grounded, there have been tense moments. On Tuesday, a Boeing 737 Max 8 that Southwest Airlines was flying to California to be grounded was forced to make an emergency landing in Orlando, Fla., after the pilots reported “performance issues” with one of the engines shortly after takeoff, the airline said. There were no passengers on board. The F.A.A. said it was investigating."
4172,"Boeing has traditionally relied on in-house employees, rather than public-affairs consultants, to manage periods of intense public scrutiny. But after that hectic week following the Ethiopia crash, Boeing turned to Sard Verbinnen, a crisis communications firm based in New York that it kept on retainer, for assistance. What followed was a more assertive posture by Boeing."
4173,"On March 18, Mr. Muilenburg released a statement and video expressing regret for the crashes and emphasizing Boeing’s commitment to safety. Days later, Boeing took out full-page advertisements in newspapers including The New York Times, The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal. Sard Verbinnen declined to comment."
4174,"But as Boeing tried to seize control of the narrative, the bad news kept coming. The Justice Department opened an investigation into Boeing’s rushed development of the 737 Max. The Transportation Department’s inspector general is examining how the plane was certified."
4175,"And the Defense Department’s inspector general said it was looking into complaints that Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary and a former Boeing executive, had been promoting his former employer and talking down other military contractors."
4176,"So far, Boeing has not hired any outside law firms to help it with the mounting investigations. It is relying on its Washington office, led by Timothy Keating, who previously worked in government relations at Honeywell International and served as a special assistant to President Bill Clinton and as staff director for the White House Legislative Affairs office."
4177,"To advocate for Boeing in Washington, Mr. Keating has assembled a team that includes more than a dozen former government officials. Boeing spent over $15 million in lobbying in Washington last year, more than all but a few other companies."
4178,"Boeing said it was being responsive to inquiries from lawmakers. “We are engaging with offices from across the country to share the facts,” Boeing said in a statement. “We’re taking every phone call and responding to every request.”"
4179,"On Saturday, Boeing hosted about a dozen pilots and executives from five airlines in Renton. It was the first time Boeing had met directly with airline pilots since the crash in Ethiopia, and followed a round of more contentious meetings between Boeing and pilots after the Lion Air crash last year."
4180,"Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots’ Association, said his pilots expected to be in more regular communication with Boeing from now on."
4181,"“As the pilots of the aircraft, we need more direct interaction with Boeing going forward,” he said. “This needs to be the start of an ongoing relationship.”"
4182,"Even as it plays host to hundreds in Renton on Wednesday, Boeing said it would be following the hearings in Washington closely."
4183,"“Boeing continues to support the ongoing accident investigations, and is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available,” the company said in a statement. “Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft.”"
4184,"And Mr. Muilenburg released another statement on Tuesday that said, in part, “We are all humbled and learning from this experience.”"
4185,"But as Boeing continues to grapple with an escalating crisis, the public will be watching the company closely, and paying particular attention to what Mr. Muilenburg does, or doesn’t, say."
4186,"“He could be out there more,” Mr. Sonnenfeld said. “You can never express sympathy enough for something this catastrophic.”"
4187,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia — When Noelle Jalal was a child, her uncle used to take her to the international airport in Addis Ababa to watch the giant Ethiopian Airlines Boeings come and go."
4188,"For years, the airport in Ethiopia’s capital was not just a hub for travelers: It was also a weekend destination for families like Ms. Noelle’s who came to see the first Boeings piloted by Africans."
4189,Families took out-of-town visitors to the airport tower. Parents bought their children cotton candy and let them dash around the terminal’s corridors to work off the sugar high.
4190,"“Everyone I grew up with in Addis went to the airport,” said Ms. Noelle, a 30-year-old humanitarian aid worker who now lives in the Ivory Coast. “It was very close to my heart,” she said."
4191,"Ethiopian Airlines is not just an airline. It is an emblem of a country whose self-esteem is high, whatever its daily struggles."
4192,"And for Ethiopians, Boeing is not just a plane manufacturer. Its name is synonymous with the jets roaring through the sky — and with Ethiopian Airlines, too."
4193,"Now, the long love affair between a country and its airplanes is being put to the test."
4194,"Last week, a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8 crashed shortly after takeoff in Ethiopia. Five months earlier, an identical Boeing model crashed in Indonesia. With investigators looking into the possibility that a design flaw played a role in both disasters, the company is in a harsh spotlight."
4195,"Like Boeing, Ethiopian Airlines has long been held in high regard. It maintains a young fleet, and it operates a respected aviation school. But it, too, may have sustained a serious blow."
4196,"The airline has been intertwined with Boeing for six decades. It was the first African airline to buy its jets, with a loan from the American government. And over the years, it has maintained such close ties with Boeing that it did not purchase planes from rival Airbus until three years ago."
4197,"“Ethiopians think of Boeing when they think of planes, the way people call all toothpaste Colgate,” said Yonathan Menkir Kassa, a pilot and aviation writer."
4198,"But many Ethiopians believe Boeing was to blame for the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Flight 302. And some have started to mistrust the manufacturer, worried that it may try to use its power to strong-arm a developing-world airline as the crash investigation continues."
4199,"Last week, there was a collective sigh of relief when news came that the plane’s “black boxes” — the cockpit voice and flight data recorders — would go to France for analysis, not to Boeing’s home country."
4200,"With its entire Max 8 fleet grounded around the world, Boeing faces much bigger immediate problems than what Ethiopians think. But once the investigations are over and the dust has settled, the company may need to work hard to restore its image in a country where its reputation was once beyond challenge."
4201,"For now, public reaction in Ethiopia to the crash has largely been muted, perhaps not surprising in a country with a long history of repression. A week after the crash, Ethiopian Airlines has said very little about the early findings of the investigation. The local press has been excluded from the terse briefings of the Ministry of Transport."
4202,"Among this virtual blackout of information, a local paper ran an editorial last week imploring Ethiopians to withhold judgment against both the airline and the plane maker. Next to the text was an image of a middle-aged man “shushing” readers."
4203,"Many people here regard the investigation with suspicion. But in a deeply religious country often caught in the spasms of violent change, the public has become resigned to the commonplace of loss."
4204,"Abiy Yilma, 56, an accountant who lost a relative in the crash, believes a design flaw was responsible for the Boeing’s nose-dive. But he suspects relatives of the victims will not be inclined to go after the manufacturer."
4205,“What can we possibly do?” Mr. Abiy asked. “We have to accept our fate.”
4206,"The ties between Ethiopian Airlines and Boeing began forming in the 1960s, just over a decade after the carrier was set up under the management of Trans World Airlines."
4207,"At first, the airline’s fleet was made up of no-frills Douglas C-47 military planes, which were not known for their comfort."
4208,"But the carrier had ambitious plans. It wanted to operate jets that would connect Addis Ababa to Europe and beyond. With this in mind, Ethiopian dignitaries went to America to lobby Boeing to sell them its planes."
4209,"After they signed the first $45 million deal for two Boeing jets, the Ethiopians sent two pilots and six maintenance crew members to train with the manufacturer in Seattle. When the planes arrived in the early 1960s, Ethiopian Airlines became the first African carrier that could independently fly and maintain the jets."
4210,"In the early 1970s, after a Marxist revolution in Ethiopia, relations between Boeing and the airline became bumpy. It was a few years after Ethiopians had taken full control of their carrier, and Moscow was courting its new ally with discounted Aeroflot planes. But in a Cold War victory for an American enterprise, the airline eventually decided to stick with Boeing."
4211,"In the early 1980s, at a time when Ethiopia was best known for a famine that claimed a million lives, the airline’s first Boeing 767 landed in Addis Ababa after a 13-and-a-half hour flight from New York. Stickers advertising that flight — “767 is coming” — can still be spotted in some homes in the capital."
4212,"In the years since, Ethiopian Airlines has undergone a major expansion. It is a member of the Star Alliance group of airlines, and books passengers for major carriers like United and Lufthansa."
4213,"Even with the addition of the Airbus jets, about three-quarters of Ethiopian Airlines’ fleet of 108 is Boeing, according to its website."
4214,And the Max 8 was shaping up to be a star player.
4215,"In 2014, the airline ordered 20 of the popular Boeing jets — the biggest such order by an African carrier. It is among the few airlines in the world that operate a simulator for the aircraft."
4216,"When the first Max 8 was delivered last July, the airline’s beaming chief executive, Tewolde GebreMariam, was there to welcome it."
4217,"“Today marks another important milestone in our colorful history,” Mr. Tewolde said, adding, “We have shown the world that Africa can own, operate and manage successful global companies like Ethiopian Airlines.”"
4218,Ethiopians have long closed ranks around their national carrier.
4219,"The airline is not just the polished face of a nation on the rise. For a long while, it was also a critical link for ordinary Ethiopians to the outside world."
4220,"Before Twitter and Facebook, when the government had a monopoly over what information could trickle in, Ethiopians read the airline’s in-flight magazine to learn about its exotic destinations. Teenagers exchanged valued copies of the magazine and made scrapbooks from pages that listed the latest movies and pop hits."
4221,"As their purchasing power grew, Ethiopians here and abroad have supported the national carrier with their wallets. They have booked its flights even when they are not the cheapest. They may complain about problems with its service among themselves — but never in the company of foreigners."
4222,"And however damaged Boeing may be in the eyes of Ethiopians now, their loyalty to their airline remains unshaken."
4223,"And so many Ethiopians were irked by early news coverage of the crash last week. Some took their outrage to social media when a news show questioned the airline’s safety record, even as aviation experts noted that the opposite was true."
4224,International headlines about a “jet crash in Africa” also rankled some seeing them in Addis Ababa.
4225,"“I was in shock,” said Ms. Noelle, the aid worker. “Did the jet crash in all 54 countries? That was too toxic for me.”"
4226,"WASHINGTON — Seven years ago, an internal government watchdog took a hard look at the part of the Federal Aviation Administration responsible for certifying new Boeing jetliners. The watchdog’s investigation came to some alarming conclusions."
4227,"F.A.A. employees viewed their management, the inquiry by the Transportation Department’s inspector general’s office found, as “having too close a relationship with Boeing officials.” F.A.A. managers, the report said, had not always backed efforts by agency employees “to hold Boeing accountable,” and employees feared retaliation for trying to do so."
4228,"The part of the F.A.A. under scrutiny, the Transport Airplane Directorate, was led at the time by an aerospace engineer named Ali Bahrami. The next year, he took a job at the Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group whose members include Boeing. In that position, he urged his former agency to allow manufacturers like Boeing to perform as much of the work of certifying new planes as possible."
4229,Mr. Bahrami is now back at the F.A.A. as its top safety official.
4230,"The question of whether the F.A.A. has gone too far in allowing Boeing to regulate itself has emerged as one of the key issues after the crash of a Boeing 737 Max in Ethiopia this month, the second deadly crash of the new plane in less than five months. The practice is already coming under scrutiny from Congress, and lawmakers are likely to press the F.A.A.’s acting administrator on Wednesday when he appears at a Senate hearing."
4231,[Follow our live coverage of Wednesday’s Congressional hearings here.]
4232,The practice has been repeatedly endorsed by Congress and successive administrations to speed up the certification process for Boeing and the rest of the aviation industry while holding down costs for the government.
4233,"In theory, delegating much of the day-to-day regulatory work to Boeing allows the F.A.A. to focus its limited resources on the most critical safety work, taps into existing industry technical expertise at a time when airliners are becoming increasingly complex, and allows Boeing in particular to bring out new planes faster at a time of intense global competition with its European rival Airbus."
4234,"But over the years, government watchdogs and unions have raised flags, warnings that are getting renewed attention in light of the two Boeing crashes."
4235,"It is not clear what role Boeing employees played in vetting the automated flight-control system, known as MCAS, that appears to have played a central role in the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in October, and may have played a role in the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 this month as well. The Seattle Times reported last week that a safety analysis for MCAS was delegated to Boeing, and that the company produced a document that had significant flaws."
4236,"[Here’s what you need to know about the deadly Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air crashes, and what Boeing has been doing since.]"
4237,"Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao has requested that her department’s inspector general conduct an audit of how the 737 Max 8, the model involved in both deadly crashes, was certified. Lawmakers have asked the inspector general to examine the role that the delegation program played in the Max’s certification. And the Justice Department is investigating the plane’s development, a person briefed on the inquiry said."
4238,"Under the delegation program, “the staff responsible for regulating aircraft safety are answerable to the manufacturers who profit from cutting corners, not the American people who may be put at risk,” Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, wrote to the inspector general last week."
4239,"In testimony prepared for the Senate hearing on Wednesday, the F.A.A.’s acting administrator, Daniel K. Elwell, described the system of delegating authority outside of his agency as “critical to the success and effectiveness of the certification process.”"
4240,"“This is not self-certification; the F.A.A. retains strict oversight authority,” Mr. Elwell said in the prepared remarks."
4241,"In the case of the 737 Max, Mr. Elwell said that the F.A.A. was “directly involved” in reviewing the safety of MCAS. The agency’s engineers and flight test pilots participated in evaluating the system, he said, calling the certification process for the plane “detailed and thorough.”"
4242,"In draft testimony for the Senate hearing, the Transportation Department’s inspector general, Calvin L. Scovel III, said the F.A.A. was revamping how it supervises manufacturers that perform certification work on its behalf. He said the F.A.A. planned by July “to introduce a new process that represents a significant change in its oversight approach.”"
4243,Boeing has come under intense scrutiny after its best-selling 737 Max jet was involved in two deadly crashes in five months.
4244,"The practice of delegating authority from regulators to plane makers stretches back decades. For the Boeing 747-400, approved in 1989 as an update to the iconic jumbo jet, the F.A.A. estimated that it had delegated 95 percent of the certification work, according to a 1993 report from the agency now known as the Government Accountability Office."
4245,"The report raised concerns that the F.A.A. had turned over responsibility for critical work, including “analyses of hypothetical failures of systems.”"
4246,"The F.A.A. overhauled its approach to delegation in 2005, creating a new program that expanded the authority given to manufacturers to help certify their own products. Under the new program, called Organization Designation Authorization, companies like Boeing can choose their own employees to work on behalf of the F.A.A."
4247,"When the F.A.A. moved to create the program, Boeing called it “an important building block toward increased delegation throughout the aviation industry.”"
4248,"But not everyone in aviation circles shared that positive view. The National Air Traffic Controllers Association, whose members include F.A.A. certification employees, said at the time that the F.A.A.’s new approach “provides less specific and technical F.A.A. oversight and therefore would in time lower the safety of the flying public.”"
4249,"Another F.A.A. union now known as the Professional Aviation Safety Specialists said it would oppose “any system that allows industry to self-regulate oversight via the honor system.” The union wrote that the F.A.A.’s “blatant outsourcing” was “reckless” and would “actually compromise public air safety, not enhance it.”"
4250,"The F.A.A. was “rushing to hand off their oversight responsibilities to industry and virtually establishing a ‘fox guarding the henhouse’ mentality,” the union wrote."
4251,The delegation program has come under scrutiny on multiple occasions since then.
4252,"In 2011, after a review stretching nearly two years, the Transportation Department’s inspector general’s office released an audit that raised concerns about the F.A.A.’s oversight of the program."
4253,The report warned that the new delegation program created the risk that plane makers could choose employees “with inadequate qualifications or a history of poor performance to approve certification projects.” The report cited an instance where F.A.A. engineers were concerned about the “integrity” of an employee acting on the agency’s behalf at an unnamed manufacturer because the employee was “advocating a position that directly opposed F.A.A. rules on an aircraft fuel system in favor of the manufacturer.”
4254,"Representative Daniel Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois, had requested the review. On Monday, he said that the delegation program, known in aviation lingo as the O.D.A. program, had not been a source of concern in recent years, but that the two crashes should prompt another look at it."
4255,"“Part of the question is, did the O.D.A. program, did that in any way impact the certification of these planes?” he said. “I think it’s a legitimate question.”"
4256,"In another audit released in 2015, the inspector general’s office again reviewed the F.A.A.’s oversight of the delegation program. Once again, the watchdog raised concerns about the F.A.A.’s supervision of the program, including about the focus of its oversight work and whether there was adequate staffing to perform that work."
4257,"“Industry representatives expressed concern that F.A.A.’s focus was often on paperwork — not on safety-critical items,” the report said."
4258,"One factor in the debate is the F.A.A.’s budget. If Congress wanted the government to handle more certification work without slowing down the approval of new planes, lawmakers would most likely need to drastically increase funding for the F.A.A. so it could expand its staff. Instead, Congress has encouraged the F.A.A. to delegate more certification work to manufacturers."
4259,A report accompanying a spending bill last year said that utilizing the F.A.A.’s program for delegating authority to manufacturers was “key to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of product certification.”
4260,"“Ideally, if resources are no constraint, you would want the regulator to be doing it all,” said Christopher A. Hart, a former F.A.A. official and National Transportation Safety Board chairman. “But this isn’t the ideal world and resources are constrained.”"
4261,"Mr. Hart cited the stellar safety record of commercial air travel in the United States in recent years as evidence of the delegation system’s success. “If it’s properly done,” he said, “it can equate to the safety of not delegating.”"
4262,"WASHINGTON — President Trump got a firsthand taste of aircraft safety risks in August 1989 when a Boeing 727 operated by the Trump Shuttle, which he had bought a few months earlier and rebranded with his name, failed to lower its nose gear as it prepared to land in Boston."
4263,"“He was quite terrified that we were going to have an airplane burning on the runway with his name splashed across it,” said Bruce R. Nobles, who was the airline’s president."
4264,"The Trump Shuttle jet landed safely, if in a shower of sparks, and a euphoric Mr. Trump hailed the pilots as heroes. But Mr. Nobles said his boss was nervous about flying to Boston on a shuttle flight the next day to demonstrate the airline’s safety."
4265,"That same mix of swagger and uneasiness was on display in the White House on Wednesday, when Mr. Trump pre-empted the Federal Aviation Administration in announcing that the United States would ground Boeing’s fleet of 737 Max planes after two deadly crashes."
4266,"Boeing, he said, was an “incredible company” and would find and fix the problem. But in the meantime, he said, “I felt it was important both psychologically and in a lot of ways” to ground the planes."
4267,"It was the latest illustration of Mr. Trump’s longstanding, peculiar affinity for aviation — an industry he knows as an owner and frequent flier, but often claims to understand as an aeronautical engineer."
4268,"Whether it is the merits of Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet, the cost of a new Air Force One or Mr. Trump’s frequent assertion that the F-35 stealth fighter is “literally invisible,” the president barges into the technical details of aviation with more enthusiasm than expertise."
4269,"A day before grounding the 737s, Mr. Trump declared that modern planes were too complex for anyone but “computer scientists from MIT” to fly. Aviation experts pointed out that the problem with the 737 Max might be exactly the opposite: Boeing designed the modified 737 so that it would require minimal additional training of the pilots."
4270,"People who have worked with Mr. Trump said his knowledge of aviation reflected someone who had owned private planes — first a 727 and later a 757 — but little more than that. His older brother, Fred Trump Jr., was a pilot for Trans World Airlines and married a flight attendant. But Mr. Trump channeled his passion into real estate development."
4271,"“He knows more about airlines and aviation than the average person, but he doesn’t know as much as I do,” said Mr. Nobles, who ran Hawaiian Airlines and Air Jamaica after his time at the Trump Shuttle. “Then again, I don’t know as much as him about real estate.”"
4272,"Mr. Trump’s short-lived tenure as an airline executive captures his strange relationship with the industry. He was drawn to the shuttle less because he loved flying than because he saw it as a “diamond” — a prestigious, pre-Acela system of transportation for the nation’s East Coast elite."
4273,"After buying the shuttle from financially strapped Eastern Air Lines for $365 million in 1989, Mr. Trump proceeded to polish it by fitting out its fleet of 21 planes with maple wood veneer and gold-colored lavatory fixtures. He offered passengers free food, coffee, magazines and newspapers."
4274,"“I’ll spend more money and I’ll give the people more than they anticipate even,” he told The New York Times in 1989, vowing, with characteristic immodesty, to create “the best transportation system of any kind in the entire world.”"
4275,"Mr. Trump brought bare-knuckle tactics to the Avis-Hertz competition with his rival, Pan Am Shuttle. At one point, he warned that Pan Am might not have the financial resources to maintain safe planes — a statement that violated the industry’s informal code and drew protests from Mr. Nobles, who had run the Pan Am Shuttle before jumping over to Mr. Trump."
4276,"“I said to Donald: ‘Look, most people are uncomfortable flying. You’re up in the air at 35,000 feet, and the only thing between you and death is a piece of aluminum,’” Mr. Nobles recalled. “‘Anything you do to make flying seem more risky and less safe is bad for all of us.’”"
4277,"For a while, Mr. Trump’s innovations fueled a lively competition between the two carriers. But the economy in the Northeast ran out of steam in the fall of 1989, and Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait caused oil prices to spike the next summer. Mr. Trump looked for ways to economize."
4278,"He pressed Mr. Nobles to cut the flight crews in the 727s from three to two. His personal 727 had only two pilots, he pointed out. Mr. Nobles said he explained to Mr. Trump that the 727s used by the Trump Shuttle were configured for a pilot, a co-pilot and a flight engineer. The planes would require a costly redesign to be certified for only two pilots. Mr. Trump replied that he suspected Mr. Nobles was trying to protect the pilots’ jobs."
4279,"In December 1991, USAir struck a deal with Mr. Trump’s banks to take over the Trump Shuttle. Under the terms of the agreement, Mr. Trump was relieved of the bulk of the $135 million in loans he had guaranteed personally to buy the airline from Eastern. Mr. Trump has told friends he got out of the airline industry at the right time, though the economics of the industry were in a free fall by the time Mr. Trump unloaded the shuttle."
4280,"“He’s not going to be remembered in the annals of the airline industry,” said Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group. “He is known as the temporary caretaker of something that was heading into oblivion. That doesn’t make you an aviation industry executive.”"
4281,"Mr. Aboulafia said the president’s pattern with aviation, as in other areas, had been to declare a crisis and then take credit for fixing it."
4282,"“The F-35 was a disaster until he could take credit for cost savings,” he said. “Air Force One was a disaster until he got major cost savings from Boeing. The Super Hornet was a terrible plane until he could take credit for putting it back into the defense budget.”"
4283,"After selling the Trump Shuttle, Mr. Trump’s involvement in aviation was mainly through his 757-200, which is equipped with a big-screen entertainment system and 24-karat-gold fixtures. The plane, once owned by Microsoft’s co-founder, Paul Allen, became known as “Trump Force One” after Mr. Trump used it to hopscotch between rallies during the 2016 presidential campaign."
4284,"Mr. Trump was so fond of the 757 that he briefly considered using it instead of Air Force One after he took office. That coincided with Mr. Trump’s bitter complaints about the cost of a plan to replace the two Boeing 747s that currently operate as Air Force One. He also floated the prospect of naming his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to be the head of the F.A.A."
4285,"Those ideas have vanished like a jet’s contrails, but Mr. Trump remains opinionated about airplanes and the industry."
4286,"In January 2018 he tweeted: “Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation. Good news — it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record!” In fact, there had not been a fatality on a commercial airliner in the United States since 2013."
4287,"TOULOUSE, France — Since a solo flight by the Wright brothers on the shore of North Carolina more than a century ago, the size of airplanes has gone in one direction — up. But the era of ever larger jets, and the romantic idea of continent-hopping travel they inspired, came to an unofficial end with the announcement by Airbus on Thursday that it plans to cease production of the A380, the largest passenger airliner ever built."
4288,"An engineering marvel expansive enough for showers and sleekly designed bars, the planes hark back to the age when flying had glamour. The four engines are powerful enough to reach cruising altitude in roughly 15 minutes, all the while keeping noise to a tolerable hum. There are fan clubs for the A380 on both Twitter and Facebook."
4289,"But for years, the jet has been far more popular with passengers than airlines. When it debuted in 2005, the A380 was a bet that the future of air travel was big planes flying between major hubs, followed by connectors to final destinations."
4290,"Instead, the dominant trend became smaller planes and direct flights. Dropping $445 million for a jet — the A380’s list price — that can carry more than 500 people made little economic sense, especially as budget airlines cropped up as competition."
4291,"Airbus, which is based in Toulouse, struggled to market the A380 for years and never sold one to an American carrier. Citing reduced orders from Emirates Airline, a major customer, and an inability to find other buyers, the company said it would halt deliveries of the jetliner in 2021. (It will continue to support existing A380s.)"
4292,"“As a result of this decision we have no substantial A380 backlog and hence no basis to sustain production, despite all our sales efforts with other airlines in recent years,” the company’s chief executive, Tom Enders, said in a statement."
4293,"When Airbus started developing the A380 about two decades ago, airport congestion was a rising concern. The company offered its supersized jet, a 6,000-square-foot double-decker, as a way to get more travelers on and off limited tarmac space. Airbus spent $25 billion developing the plane, which is about 50 percent larger than its nearest rival, Boeing’s 747."
4294,"But it turned out that the solution to congested airports was not larger planes. It was smaller planes at a wide variety of less crowded airports. Airlines reduced costs by offering direct flights on jets that were cheaper to maintain, in part because they were landing at airports with lower fees and in part because they were burning less gas."
4295,"The A380 “is an aircraft of a previous generation where fuel was not as big of an issue,” said Frank Netscher, an analyst at Scope Group, a credit-rating company. “It’s not by accident that all the new models will only have two engines, not four.”"
4296,"The age of the jumbo jet has been winding down for a while. Last year, Boeing’s 747, the original mega-plane, with the iconic hump, took its last flight for an airline based in its home country, the United States."
4297,"Competition had already shifted from the S.U.V.s of the sky to the sedans, with Airbus’s more compact and flexible A350 going head to head against Boeing’s 787, which can carry a little more than half the number of passengers as a 747."
4298,"To Robert W. Mann, an airline consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., all of these developments seemed inevitable 15 years ago."
4299,"“If you think of market size as a pyramid, there are zillions of markets at the bottom of the pyramid that have very small volume,” Mr. Mann said. “If you look at why the 787 and A350 are so popular, they have better range, and better range at smaller market sizes. They can capitalize on those parts of the pyramid that you could never fly an A380 economically.”"
4300,"The plane’s survival was ensured only by Emirates, which uses its home in Dubai as a hub for about 1,500 flights a week. Emirates was Airbus’s biggest A380 customer, with a fleet of more than 100. The manufacturer was so dependent on the airline that it acknowledged in January 2018 that it might cancel production of the jet, barring an Emirates order. A few days later, Emirates asked for $16 billion worth of the planes."
4301,"Since then, the airline has been buffeted by the same forces that have transformed the rest of the industry. Emirates decided to take delivery of just 14 more A380s over the next two years, while ordering 70 smaller aircraft that can serve smaller airports."
4302,"“While we are disappointed to have to give up our order, and sad that the program could not be sustained, we accept that this is the reality of the situation,” Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airline and Group, said in a statement. “For us, the A380 is a wonderful aircraft loved by our customers and our crew. It is a differentiator for Emirates.”"
4303,"The A380 took another hit last week when the Australian airline Qantas canceled its long outstanding order, placed in 2006, for eight of the planes."
4304,"The decision to cease production of the A380 will prompt job cuts at Airbus, potentially affecting as many as 3,500 of its 134,000 employees over the next three years. The move also overshadowed positive news in Airbus’s full-year earnings report."
4305,"Net income rose 29 percent in 2018 to 3.1 billion euros, or about $3.5 billion. Airbus said the decision to wind down production of the A380 was reflected in the 2018 financial figures, with the company taking a €463 million hit because of the decision by Emirates to scale back its order."
4306,"Airbus did not give up easily on the A380, said Mr. Enders, the chief executive. But the demand wasn’t there. “If you have a product that nobody wants any more or you can only sell below production costs, you have to stop it, as painful as it is,” he said."
4307,"Mr. Enders emphasized that the airplane would not disappear any time soon, noting that it was likely to be a presence in the skies into the 2030s."
4308,"“We’re talking about the end of a production,” he said at a news conference after the company earnings. “We’re not talking about end of a program.”"
4309,"To aviation analysts, the story of the A380 is the stuff of business case studies, and not the flattering kind. The life and death of the jet will stand as an example of the high cost of poor forecasting."
4310,"“It was supposed to be a game changer,” Mr. Netscher of Scope Group said. “But, yeah, well, the game changed.”"
4311,"[Update: The United States has now grounded Boeing’s 737 Max aircraft, reversing an earlier decision.]"
4312,"With more countries grounding Boeing jets and with lawmakers, aviation workers and consumers calling on the United States to do the same, the head of the aerospace giant on Tuesday made a personal appeal to President Trump."
4313,"Boeing’s chief executive, Dennis A. Muilenburg, called from Chicago and expressed to Mr. Trump his confidence in the safety of the 737 Max 8 jets, according to two people briefed on the conversation. Two of the planes flown by overseas carriers have crashed in recent months in similar accidents."
4314,"The brief call had been in the works since Monday, but it came shortly after Mr. Trump raised concerns that the increasing use of technology in airplanes was compromising passenger safety. “Airplanes are becoming far too complex to fly,” he wrote on Twitter. “Pilots are no longer needed, but rather computer scientists from MIT.”"
4315,China was the first major country to ground the jets. The U.S. was last.
4316,"Soon after the conversation ended, Mr. Muilenburg received more bad news. The European Union suspended “all flight operations” of the Boeing 737 Max 8 model, a striking move by one of the industry’s important regulators. At the end of the day, the Federal Aviation Administration said that it was continuing with its review and that the planes could keep flying."
4317,"Yet the decision in Europe means roughly two-thirds of the Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft in the world have been pulled from use in the two days since the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines flight that killed 157 people. The swift actions by authorities around the world were driven in part by concerns about a connection to a similar disaster involving a Max 8 in Indonesia last October, when a Lion Air flight plunged into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff, killing all 189 people aboard."
4318,"By Tuesday afternoon, the United States was nearly alone among major countries still allowing the jets to fly."
4319,"Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary, said regulators “will not hesitate to take immediate and appropriate action” if a safety issue arises."
4320,"Boeing reiterated in a statement late Tuesday that it had “full confidence” in the 737 Max 8. It noted that the F.A.A. had taken no action and “based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators.”"
4321,Two United States airlines fly the 737 Max 8 aircraft and both said they planned to keep flying. Southwest Airlines has 34 of the planes and American Airlines has 24. The airlines have said they have analyzed data from their thousands of flights with the jets and found no reason to ground them.
4322,"“We don’t have any changes planned,” Southwest said in a statement. “We have full confidence in the aircraft,” American said."
4323,"The growing pressure left Boeing in an increasingly unfamiliar position. The company, a major military contractor, has close ties with the American government, and the F.A.A. in particular."
4324,[Three generations of a Canadian family died in the Ethiopian plane crash.]
4325,"Boeing is a major lobbying force in the nation’s capital. Its top government relations official is a veteran of the Clinton White House, and last year, the company employed more than a dozen lobbying firms to advocate for its interests and spent $15 million in total on lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics."
4326,"The company, through its political action committee, funnels millions of dollars into the campaign accounts of lawmakers from both political parties. A list of a year’s worth of political spending on Boeing’s website stretches on for 14 pages, listing campaign contributions to lawmakers ranging from a city councilman in South Carolina to Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is now the House speaker."
4327,"“Boeing is one of the 800-pound gorillas around here,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, who has called for the Max 8 to be grounded.

4329,"For decades, the F.A.A. has used a network of outside experts, known as F.A.A. designees, to certify that aircraft meet safety standards. In 2005, the regulator shifted its approach for how it delegated authority outside the agency, creating a new program through which aircraft manufacturers like Boeing could choose their own employees to be the designees and help certify their planes."
4330,"The program is intended to help the F.A.A. stretch its limited resources, while also benefiting plane makers who are eager to avoid delays in the certification process."
4331,"The regulator maintains offices inside Boeing’s factories, including those in Renton, Wash., and in Charleston, S.C. “I’ve raised this concern in the past, about people who go to work at the Boeing plant who work for the F.A.A.,” said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House transportation committee. “How much scrutiny are they applying, and could they be influenced?”"

4334,"“It’s a very cozy relationship,” said Jim Hall, the former head of the National Transportation Safety Board. “The manufacturer essentially becomes both the manufacturer and the regulator, because of the lack of the ability of government to do the job.”"
4335,"At a congressional hearing in 2015, a Boeing executive described the arrangement as effectively having an “arm of the F.A.A. within the Boeing Company,” and said 1,000 employees were part of the program."
4336,"The regulatory policy of allowing manufacturers to essentially sign off on the safety of their own products has drawn criticism in the past. In 2011, a report from the Transportation Department’s Office of Inspector General found that the “F.A.A. has significantly reduced its role in approving individuals who perform work on F.A.A.’s behalf by further delegating this approval to private companies.”"
4337,"Boeing’s relationship with Mr. Trump has not always been smooth, however. Shortly after becoming president-elect, Mr. Trump assailed Boeing for the estimated cost of its program to build new Air Force One planes, which provide mobile command centers for the president."
4338,"The “costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter a month after winning the election, but before taking office. A couple of weeks later, Mr. Muilenburg visited Mr. Trump at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Fla., to try to smooth things over."
4339,"“It was a terrific conversation,” Mr. Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, explaining that he had given Mr. Trump “my personal commitment” that Boeing would build new Air Force One planes for less than the $4 billion estimate. Weeks after the conversation, Boeing donated $1 million to Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee. The company had donated the same amount to help finance President Barack Obama’s inauguration in 2013."
4340,"As concerns about the airworthiness of the Boeing 737 Max 8 spread around the globe on Tuesday, pressure was building on the F.A.A. to take action. Boeing shares fell 6 percent on Tuesday, after falling 5 percent on Monday. Early on Wednesday in New Zealand, the country’s aviation regulator suspended 737 Max flights there."
4341,"Two unions representing flight attendants called for the jets to be grounded. “The F.A.A. must restore public confidence by grounding the 737 Max until the required changes have been implemented and the public can be fully assured,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants."

Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who is the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, said he wanted “to temporarily ground 737 Max aircraft until the F.A.A. confirms the safety of these aircraft.” He also said he planned to hold a hearing to investigate the crashes."
4344,"Senators Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, also called on the F.A.A. to ground the aircraft while the cause of the Ethiopian crash is investigated."
4345,"“Serious questions have been raised about whether these planes were pressed into service without additional pilot training in order to save money,” Ms. Warren said. Mr. Romney, in a Twitter post, urged a grounding “out of an abundance of caution for the flying public.”"
4346,"In his phone call with the president, the Boeing chief, Mr. Muilenburg, outlined the company’s position since the crash. He also updated Mr. Trump on the status of the 737 Max models."

4349,"SINGAPORE — Ethiopia's insistence that its pilots followed procedures when their Boeing Co 737 MAX nosedived before a deadly crash, and Boeing's recent declaration that a new software fix makes a ""safe plane safer,"" have set the stage for a lengthy fight over the roles of technology and crew in recent 737 MAX crashes."
4350,"After a deadly Lion Air crash in October, Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration told airlines what to do in the event that an erroneous sensor reading fooled the jet into thinking it was in a stall and pushed the nose down."
4351,"The Ethiopian Airlines pilots initially followed the advice to shut off the MCAS anti-stall system but later reversed the command counter to guidance at a time when they were traveling beyond maximum operating speeds, according to data contained in a preliminary report released on Thursday and experts on the jet."
4352,WHAT ARE THE PROPER PROCEDURES?
4353,"If MCAS misfires, forcing the nose down in a maneuver similar to a condition that pilots know as runaway trim, pilots are supposed to hit two cut-out switches at the plane's center console to turn off power to the electric trim system. "
4354,"Under normal circumstances, trim is used to keep an aircraft flying level, but the MCAS makes automated nose-down movements."
4355,"Data from the Ethiopian Airlines flight indicates the aircraft was flying nose-heavy and not in a ""neutral"" attitude when pilots hit the stabilizer cutout switches to disable the MCAS system, the preliminary report showed."
4356,"That would make the situation harder to manage, possibly accounting for their decision to turn the system back on."
4357,"Boeing's checklist for pilots tells them to ""control airplane pitch attitude manually with control column and main electric trim as needed"" before hitting cut-out switches and turning to a rarely used manual wheel to keep the plane's nose in the proper position. It does not describe a specific trim setting for the pilots to achieve."
4358,WOULD THE PROCEDURES WORK?
4359,Experts are questioning whether the procedures outlined after the Lion Air crash were comprehensive enough to ensure pilots could recover from a real-life cockpit emergency with several distractions at a low altitude shortly after take-off rather than in a pre-planned simulator ride.
4360,"A 737 MAX pilot said the resistance on the control yoke would be about four times normal and it could take a few dozen turns of the manual wheel to return the nose to the proper position, depending on the alignment when the switches were cut."
4361,The preliminary report indicates the pilots tried to move their wheels together but were unable to raise the nose much at all by doing so.
4362,"""It appears the flight crew reactivated electric trim,"" former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme said. ""But they only made a very small nose up adjustment - I would have expected them to immediately and without stopping move the stabilizer back into trim. The last MCAS command comes 5 seconds after their last manual trim command."""
4363,WHY COULDN'T THEY RAISE THE NOSE MANUALLY?
4364,"The proper response to MCAS emergencies, Leeham Co analyst Bjorn Fehrm said, is to correct the dangerous nose-down ""trim"" using electronic thumb switches, then turn off MCAS and trim manually with the wheel."
4365,"But if the aircraft is going too fast, those electronic switches may not be effective, European regulators said in a 2016 memo. And failing to fully fix the trim before MCAS is deactivated can make it physically impossible for pilots to control the plane, Fehrm said."
4366,"Under normal circumstances, trim is used to keep an aircraft flying level."
4367,"At speeds up to 250 knots (288 mph) pilots can stabilize trim with the manual wheel. But when the speed rises towards 300 knots and higher, the wheel becomes impossible to turn as air rushing over control surfaces makes them harder to move, Fehrm said. "
4368,"At the time when both pilots were unable to move the wheel, they were traveling at over 340 knots, the maximum operating speed of the airplane and clacker alarms were sounding. By the end of the fatal flight they had reached 500 knots."
4369,WHY WAS THE ETHIOPIAN JET GOING SO FAST?
4370,The plane's engines were at 94 percent thrust on take-off and remained there for the rest of the flight.
4371,"That is consistent with the pilots leaving the thrust setting in take-off mode throughout, aviation experts said."
4372,"The 737's air data computer also uses angle-of-attack (AOA) information to adjust airspeed readings. If it mistakenly thinks the angle of attack is high, it can trigger pilot warnings that airspeed and altitude data are unreliable on one of the pilot's controls, according to former Boeing engineer Peter Lemme. "
4373,That leads to an unreliable airspeed checklist which involves turning off the autothrottle as well as setting engine thrust to 75 percent. The runaway stabilizer checklist to shut off MCAS also says to turn off autothrottle.
4374,"However, according to the flight data recorder, the pilots never reduced the thrust from 94 percent."
4375,"""The report does not address information about unreliable airspeed procedures which should be considered because they had erratic airspeed,"" said Greg Feith, a former senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board."

4378,"Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation resulting from plane crashes. But last fall a grand jury in Washington, D.C., issued a subpoena for records after the crash of a Lion Air 737 Max plane. In the wake of the recent Ethiopian Airlines crash involving similar circumstances, the F.B.I. has joined that investigation."
4379,The New York Times described Boeing’s push to develop the 737 Max as “frenetic” and reported that prosecutors and regulators are investigating whether that led Boeing “to miss crucial safety risks and to underplay the need for pilot training.”
4380,But what federal criminal laws are the investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing’s records? Both the Justice Department and Boeing have declined to comment on the criminal inquiry.
4381,"One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law. The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with “any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation” about a matter that comes within its jurisdiction."
4382,"Investigators will examine whether Boeing made any false statements regarding a new software system added to avoid stalls in Boeing’s 737 Max series. Investigators suspect that faulty data from sensors on both planes may have caused the system, known as MCAS, to malfunction. Boeing’s chief executive has said that the automated flight system played a role in the two crashes."
4383,Boeing also charged extra for two safety features on its 737 Max jets that might have helped the pilots detect erroneous sensor readings to avoid problems with the software.
4384,"Investigators likely will examine whether Boeing made any misstatements about the upgrades or if the company failed to disclose possible safety problems to the F.A.A. without those upgrades. The false statement law covers not only outright lies, but also submissions in which a person “falsifies, conceals, or covers up” information submitted to a federal agency. There have been a number of prosecutions involving false statements to the F.A.A. under the statute. Most of those cases, though, involve pilots who fail to disclose information that might result in the agency revoking or refusing to renew a license."
4385,The challenge to bringing a false statement charge is that the government must show they were made “knowingly and willfully.” That means negligence by Boeing would not be enough to prove a violation.
4386,"The criminal investigation may also examine whether Boeing violated a law adopted in 2000. The statute makes it a crime to “knowingly and with intent to defraud” to falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part, or to make “any materially fraudulent representation” about a part. It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country, which, as a Delaware corporation, Boeing is."
4387,"The aircraft fraud parts law carries stiff penalties, including a fine of $10 million for each violation by a company and a sentence of up to life in prison for individuals charged if the part involved was the “proximate cause” of a malfunction that resulted in death. A conviction also could result in a criminal forfeiture of “any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds that the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of the offense.”"
4388,"If there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements, the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case. Prosecutors used that law against General Motors for the failure of ignition switches in certain models that caused a number of deaths, along with a charge under the false statement law. In addition, the auto parts maker Takata pleaded guilty to a wire fraud charge for installing faulty airbag inflaters."
4389,"Federal prosecutors have a number of options if there is evidence that Boeing intentionally provided false or misleading information to the F.A.A. The investigation is still in a preliminary stage, and there is no guarantee that a criminal case will emerge. For the company, there is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best-selling aircraft."
4390,The Federal Aviation Administration has warned Southwest Airlines and its mechanics union that their legal dispute could end up damaging the safety of the airline.
4391,"In a letter sent to the airline and the union on Friday, the agency’s top safety official, Ali Bahrami, said the dispute “raises concern about the ongoing effectiveness of the airline’s safety management system.”"
4392,"Southwest sued the union on Feb. 28, claiming that a work slowdown had illegally grounded many of the airline’s planes and caused over 100 flight cancellations since the middle of the month. The lawsuit’s implication was that the union had grounded the planes to gain leverage in contract negotiations, which have been going on for years and had recently broken down over how much of the airline’s maintenance work would be outsourced."
4393,"The union, the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association, said it had grounded the planes because of safety concerns."
4394,"In a statement, Southwest played down the importance of the letter from the federal agency. “This type of communication is normal protocol designed to underscore continued safe operations during such times at a carrier,” the statement said."
4395,"Bret Oestreich, the national director of the mechanics union, declined to comment on the letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times."
4396,"It is not unusual for airlines and their unions to end up in court, but the Southwest dispute has been particularly heated. The airline also sued the union in 2017 over a conflict related to overtime pay, and that suit is still pending."
4397,"On Feb. 22, Southwest declared an operational emergency in a memo to the union, according to reports. The union responded with a public letter denying that the mechanics were improperly grounding aircraft."
4398,"In his letter on Friday, Mr. Bahrami said the F.A.A. was a neutral party in the legal dispute, but he cautioned that the airline and the union were both responsible for ensuring that the airline met the agency’s safety standards."
4399,"“Safety is a shared responsibility of Southwest and A.M.F.A. members that demands a collaborative culture,” he wrote, “irrespective of any ongoing controversy between the two organizations.”"

4401,"All flights bound for Newark Liberty International Airport were halted on Tuesday evening after two pilots reported seeing a drone flying nearby, the Federal Aviation Administration said."
4402,"The drone was spotted about 3,500 feet over Teterboro Airport In New Jersey, a small airport about 17 miles north of Newark Liberty that handles private planes, the agency said. After the sightings, takeoffs from Newark were halted and inbound planes were held in the air."
4403,"By 5:45 p.m., planes had resumed landing at Newark, but planes headed for the airport from other cities were blocked from taking off, the agency said. Newark is one of the three main airports serving New York City and the surrounding region."
4404,"Brett Sosnik, a passenger on a flight headed for Newark, said his plane was forced to circle out over southern New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania during the halt in arrivals. He said the pilot said they were circling “due to drone activity.”"
4405,The pilot of an inbound United flight from New Orleans that was due to land at Newark around 6 p.m. said the plane had circled for about 20 minutes because of the drone activity before diverting to Philadelphia to refuel. At 6:20 p.m. he said he expected to continue on to Newark soon.
4406,"Just after 7 p.m., Port Authority officials said that normal operations had resumed at Newark Liberty, ending a disruption that lasted about 90 minutes. They said they would work with the F.A.A. and federal law-enforcement agencies “as they investigate this incident.”"
4407,"Teterboro Airport is patrolled by the Port Authority Police Department and falls within the jurisdiction of the Moonachie Police Department. Asked Tuesday evening about the drone sighting, an officer on duty there said the department was unaware of it."
4408,"The disruption came one month after reported drone sightings caused the shutdown of Gatwick Airport in London. Those sightings led to the grounding or diversion of more than 1,000 flights over three days. The resulting chaos affected more than 140,000 passengers in Britain and reverberated around the world, delaying tens of thousands of people traveling for the holidays."
4409,The aviation administration limits amateur drone flights to an altitude of 400 feet and prohibits flying them in controlled airspace without a permit. Flying a drone near a major airport like Newark Liberty requires clearance from air traffic controllers.
4410,"PARIS/SEATTLE/SINGAPORE — Minutes after take-off, the pilots of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX were caught in a bad situation."
4411,"A key sensor had been wrecked, possibly by hitting a foreign object, according to four aviation experts and two U.S. officials who were briefed on the flight data."
4412,"As soon as the pilots retracted the flaps and slats, according to flight data, the sensor began to feed faulty information into the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), designed to prevent stalls."
4413,"Flying at full take-off power, according to the flight data, the crew then struggled with nose-down commands from MCAS, the four experts said. The high speed and the jet's forward-leaning posture made it nearly impossible to use the controls to pull the nose up."
4414,"Moments later, the Boeing Co jet hit the ground, killing all 157 people onboard after six minutes of flight."
4415,A complicated picture of what happened in the cockpit of Flight 302 on March 10 is emerging from the sparse commentary of a preliminary report and a new data plot showing how crew and technology interacted.
4416,Ethiopia's transport minister said on Thursday that the pilots followed all correct procedures in trying to keep the plane in the air.
4417,"""The preliminary report confirmed beyond reasonable doubt that the crew followed the right procedures,"" Ethiopian Airlines said in a statement to Reuters on Sunday. ""Under the circumstances, with a number of simultaneous warnings in the cockpit, the crew have performed professionally."""
4418,"The airline's youngest-ever but highly-experienced captain, a 29-year-old with a lengthy 8,122 hours flying time, and his 25-year-old co-pilot, with 361 hours, left the engines at full take-off power. "
4419,"That would be an unusual step in a regular flight, according to four experts and five current and former pilots interviewed by Reuters, most of whom were not authorized to speak publicly."
4420,"""You would never, ever have full power for the whole flight,"" said Hart Langer, a veteran former senior vice president for flight operations at United Airlines."
4421,"The reason the pilots continued at full take-off power was not clear from the report. But it is not part of a usual procedure for dealing with the loss of key information such as the sensor data, the four experts said."
4422,The Ethiopian Airlines statement suggested the crew left the throttles at takeoff power because they intended to continue to climb and were hampered by the nose-down commands of MCAS.
4423,"By the end, the aircraft was traveling at 500 knots (575 mph, 926 kph), far beyond Boeing's operating limits."
4424,"The Ethiopian Airlines statement said ""no excess speed was noted at the initial phases of the flight."""
4425,"The aircraft's speed and its nose-down angle when MCAS switched on for the last time may have left them unable to fight flawed Boeing software that eventually sent the jet into an uncontrollable dive, the four experts said after studying the data. "
4426,"The Ethiopian Airlines crash, and another in Indonesia five months earlier, have left the world's largest planemaker in crisis as its top-selling jetliner is grounded worldwide, and Ethiopia scrambling to protect one of Africa's most successful companies."
4427,All 737 MAX aircraft have been grounded and Boeing is working on an MCAS software fix and extra training that it says will prevent a repeat of such accidents.
4428,"Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg said on Friday that both accidents were caused by a chain of events, ""with a common chain link being erroneous activation of the aircraft's MCAS function."" "
4429,BIRD STRIKE 
4430,Sources who reviewed the crash data said the problems started barely 12 seconds after take-off. 
4431,"A sudden spike in black box data was consistent with a bird or other debris hitting the plane as it was taking off, shearing away a vital airflow sensor, said the four experts and two U.S. officials."
4432,"Ethiopian Airlines on Sunday called that scenario ""completely speculative""."
4433,Ethiopian investigator Amdye Ayalew Fanta said a preliminary report released by Ethiopian investigators did not contain any indications of this. 
4434,Boeing said it would not comment on ongoing investigations.
4435,"As with the Lion Air crash in Indonesia, the damaged 'angle of attack' sensor, which measures how the wing is cutting through the air, may have set off a volatile chain of events."
4436,"In both cases, the faulty sensor tricked the plane's computer into thinking the aircraft was about to stall, or lose lift. The anti-stall MCAS software then pushed the nose down forcefully with the aircraft's ""trim"" system, normally used to maintain level flight."
4437,"The first time the MCAS software kicked in, flight data shows the Ethiopian Airlines pilots reacted quickly by flicking switches under their thumbs - they had recognized the movements as the same type flight crews had been warned about after the Lion Air crash. "
4438,"But data shows they were not able to fully counteract the computer's movements. At that point, they were a mere 3,000 feet above the airport, so low that a new warning - a computerized voice saying ""don't sink"" - sounded in the cabin."
4439,"When MCAS triggered again, the jetliner's trim was set to push the nose down at almost the maximum level, flight data shows, while the control yoke noisily vibrated with another stall warning called a ""stick shaker."" "
4440,"    This time, the pilots countered MCAS more effectively, the experts said after studying the data. But when they turned off the system - as they were instructed to do by Boeing and the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the wake of the Lion Air disaster - the nose was still pointed downward, leaving the jetliner vulnerable."
4441,"The combination of their speed and a nose-down attitude meant up to 50 pounds of force would be needed to move the control column, the four experts and one of the pilots said, and moving the manual trim wheels was impossible. "
4442,"'PULL UP, PULL UP'"
4443,"The captain called out ""pull up"" three times, according to the cockpit voice recorder. The co-pilot reported problems to air traffic control."
4444,"In the meantime, the aircraft's speed remained abnormally high, the five pilots and four aviation experts said. "
4445,"The sensor problems and loss of airflow data would have affected airspeed information too. In such cases, pilots are trained to turn off automatic engine settings and control thrust manually, according to a Boeing checklist, the pilots told Reuters. "
4446,Data confirms the engines stayed at nearly full power.
4447,"Still, several experienced pilots said there was an array of stressful factors sapping the pilots' attention."
4448,"""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high-workload environment,"" Muilenburg said Thursday. ""It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk."" "
4449,"Among the distractions was a ""clacker"" warning telling the pilots their aircraft was going too fast"
4450,"As the nose gradually fell, the captain asked the co-pilot to try to trim the plane manually using a wheel in the center console to help the plane recover from the dive, according to the voice recorder. "
4451,"But it was too hard to move the wheel. Both men then tried to pitch the nose up together. The captain, according to the report, said it was not enough. "
4452,MCAS RE-ACTIVATES
4453,"Data shows the MCAS-related systems were switched back on. That would also reactivate the electric trim system, making it easier to force the reluctant nose higher, the experts said."
4454,Reactivating MCAS is contrary to advice issued by Boeing and the FAA after Lion Air. The report did not address that. The airline did not comment.
4455,The pilots managed to lift the nose slightly using the electric thumb switches on their control yokes. But the data readout shows they flicked those switches only briefly.
4456,"With its power restored, a final MCAS command kicked in, eventually pushing the nose down to a 40 degree angle at 500 knots, far beyond the plane's safe operating speed, defined by Boeing as 340 knots."
4457,"As the 737 MAX plunged, G-forces turned negative, pulling occupants out of their seats."
4458,"Just six minutes after take off, the plane crashed into a field."

4461,"• The newest version of Boeing’s most popular jet is under intensified scrutiny after the deadly crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on Sunday, leading that carrier and at least 17 others around the world to ground their 737 Max 8 planes. But at least 18 carriers, including American Airlines and Southwest Airlines, which are heavy users of the Max 8, continued to fly them on Monday."
4462,"• The Federal Aviation Administration in the United States, in a “continued airworthiness notification,” said that the investigation had just begun and that it did not have information to draw any conclusions or take any action — meaning the agency still considered the Max 8 safe to fly. But pilots and flight attendants in the United States raised questions about the Max 8’s safety."
4463,"• While investigators have not determined the cause of the crash, the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder have both been recovered, Ethiopian Airlines said. Some circumstances of the crash were similar to one in October in Indonesia that killed 189 people."
4464,"• Aviation experts expressed surprise at the vast disparity in experience in the two-person cockpit crew. Ethiopian Airlines said the pilot of Flight 302 had 8,000 hours of flying time but the co-pilot had just 200."
4465,"• The pilot sent out a distress call before the crash, which killed all 157 people aboard. The victims, en route from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to Nairobi, Kenya, were from more than 35 countries and included at least 22 employees of United Nations-affiliated agencies."
4466,"• The questions go to the heart of Boeing’s business: The 737 Max is its best-selling model. After falling more than 12 percent in early trading on Monday, Boeing shares were down about 7 percent by midday and ended the day down more than 5 percent. Late on Monday, the company issued a statement that it has been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, due to be released by April."
4467,"In what could hasten the determination of what caused the crash, the flight data and cockpit voice recorders of Flight 302 were recovered, Ethiopian Airlines said on Monday."
4468,"The two recorders will need to be taken to a specialized center to read their data, said Lynnette Dray, an aviation expert and senior research associate at University College London."
4469,"“If the boxes are intact, then they will be able to take the data off them and look at it immediately,” Dr. Dray said."
4470,"But if they are dented or burned, the data might not be easily extractable."
4471,"“They might need to decontaminate them, or adjust smoke components first,” she said."
4472,"Dr. Dray said the two recorders would be treated slightly differently. Some of the flight data, which generally includes information about speed, air pressure and other details, might already be known to investigators. But the cockpit voice recorder, which captures anything that might have been said or heard by the captain and co-pilot, can be more revealing — and more sensitive, Dr. Dray said."
4473,"The two recorders are just part of the evidence. “This is just one strand of the investigation — there are lots of strands,” Dr. Dray said. It could be more than a year before the final report is released, she added."
4474,China and Indonesia were among the countries that ordered their airlines on Monday to ground all of the Max 8 aircraft they operate.
4475,"The Indonesian Transport Ministry on Monday called for the temporary grounding of all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes operated by Indonesian carriers, following the fatal accidents involving two new aircraft of that model."
4476,"The first accident came in October, when a Lion Air flight crashed in Indonesia, minutes after an erratic takeoff. On Sunday, an Ethiopian Airlines flight went down with 157 people on board, shortly after leaving Bole Airport in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, with an unstable trajectory."
4477,"After Lion Air Flight 610 nose-dived into the sea shortly after taking off from the airport in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, killing all 189 people on board, the Transport Ministry grounded all Max 8s operating in the country. But after inspections were conducted last November, the planes were declared safe."
4478,Indonesian and American aviation authorities have raised the possibility that Flight 610’s crash was caused by automated anti-stall software in the Max 8 model that may have been erroneously activated by incorrect flight data.
4479,"China’s main airlines are among the biggest users so far of the new Boeing jets, having taken delivery of most of the planes they have ordered. By contrast, many other carriers, often in slower-growing markets than China’s, have taken delivery of only a small fraction of their orders."
4480,"China’s aviation sector could benefit from the tragedies in Ethiopia and Indonesia. A government-owned company has developed an alternative to the Boeing 737, called the Comac C919, but has so far struggled to find major buyers outside China. Airlines have expressed concerns about fuel efficiency and safety issues, including how willing Chinese regulators would be to share information about accidents."
4481,At least 20 airlines around the world have grounded their 737 Max 8 planes. At least 18 were continuing to fly them on Monday.

4626,"Sources: Airlines, Flightradar24. Notes: Jet Airways hasn’t flown any of its Max 8s since the beginning of March due to financial distress."

4628,"Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board in the United States were at the crash site on Monday. In a Twitter post, the F.A.A. said: “We are collecting data and keeping in contact with international civil aviation authorities as information becomes available.”"
4629,It later issued a “Continued Airworthiness Notification to the International Community” that said it would examine all data from the investigation and “take appropriate action if the data indicates the need to do so.”
4630,"But the notification also said nothing immediate was planned — meaning the Max 8 was deemed airworthy, despite the groundings in some other countries, including China and Indonesia. The notification said “this investigation has just begun and to date we have not been provided data to draw any conclusions or take any actions.”"
4631,"As regulators in other countries grounded Max 8 fleets, The New York Times asked Robert W. Mann, an airline industry consultant in Port Washington, N.Y., about what it would take for the F.A.A. to make a similar decision in the United States."
4632,"The F.A.A. hasn’t taken that kind of step on a fleet of aircraft since 2013, when it ordered Boeing 787s to stop flying temporarily after a problem with the plane’s battery system was identified."
4633,"The agency, which certified the latest version of Boeing’s best-selling jet as airworthy in 2017, has not taken that step with the Max 8 despite mounting questions about the plane’s safety record."
4634,"Boeing issued a statement late Monday night saying that for the past several months, in the aftermath of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610, the company has been developing a “flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.” According to the company, it has been working with the F.A.A. to roll out the software updates across the 737 MAX fleet in the coming weeks."
4635,"The Association of Flight Attendants sent a letter to the F.A.A. calling for a review of the Max 8. “We need help from the regulators when the entire world is looking at two catastrophic incidents that happened on the same aircraft type within five months of each other,” said Sara Nelson, the president of the flight attendants’ union. “Our system is so safe that these things don’t happen today. That is why people are questioning what is going on here.”"
4636,"Pilots also raised questions. “We’re very concerned about why two brand-new aircraft suddenly pitched over and nosed into the ground,” said Rory Kay, a former top safety official at the world’s largest pilot union. Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for the American Airlines pilot union and a 737 pilot, said pilots were already wary of the 737 Max because of the Lion Air crash, and that the Ethiopian Airlines crash had intensified scrutiny of the plane by his members."
4637,"In Washington, Senator Dianne Feinstein went a step further, calling on the F.A.A. to ground all Boeing 737 Max 8’s until the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash was complete."
4638,"At the scene of the crash near Bishoftu, a two-hour drive south of Addis Ababa, emergency workers picked through the debris-strewn site, spread across a wide field."

4679,"In one pile, luggage and personal items were searched for identification documents. In another, smashed plane parts were gathered. Red Cross officials wearing face masks searched for human remains."
4680,A government-affiliated broadcaster said experts from China and volunteers from an Israeli rescue and recovery organization were assisting local emergency workers at the site of the crash.
4681,"The flight carried professors from Kenya, aid workers from Ethiopia, a career ambassador from Nigeria and a fisheries consultant from Britain. Some were heading to job training, others to a United Nations environmental conference. Some were simply going home."
4682,"On Monday, as the identities of more victims were revealed, heartache rippled through convention halls, classrooms and living rooms across the globe. Tributes flowed on social media. Colleagues observed moments of silence."
4683,"The United Nations said that at least 22 of the organization’s staff members were among the victims. Maimunah Mohd Sharif, executive director of U.N.-Habitat, told the opening of the environmental conference that nationals of more than 30 countries had been on the airplane."
4684,"“I want to assure you all that as the day and week unfold, and the world’s global environmental leaders meet to discuss the future of our planet, we will not forget this tragedy,” she said."
4685,"Witnesses described an aircraft that swerved and dipped wildly in its final moments, spewing smoke and making unusual noises before it hurtled into the ground."
4686,"One man told Ethiopia’s national broadcaster that it appeared to gain altitude briefly shortly before it smashed into a field and disintegrated. “The plane was moving in all directions,” he told the station. “There was smoke coming out of it, and it was on fire.”"
4687,"Another witness, who identified himself by only one name, Feyissa, said he had seen the aircraft circling four or five times. “Then the plane came down almost vertically at great speed, hard and loud — fire, smoke and everything happened so fast.”"
4688,"Aviation experts have cautioned that while witness accounts can help in an investigation, they are not necessarily accurate and are of limited value in helping pinpoint the cause or causes of a crash."

4745,"Ethiopian Airlines said after the crash that the pilot of Flight 302, Yared Getachew, 29, had 8,000 hours of flying time, but aviation experts were drawn to the paucity of experience on the part of someone else in the cockpit: the co-pilot, Ahmed Nur Mohammod Nur, who had just 200 hours."
4746,"Peter Marosszeky, a former executive and aircraft engineer at Qantas Airways, Pan Am and American Airlines who has advised Boeing on its 747 and 777 programs, said that pilots and co-pilots of large commercial aircraft should have thousands of hours of flight time."
4747,"“The 200 is obviously ridiculously low,” Mr. Marosszeky said. He noted that in Australia, where he now lives and works as an aviation consultant, the minimum experience to obtain an unrestricted flying license for a small personal plane is 155 hours of flight time."
4748,"It was a rough day for Boeing on Wall Street. The company’s shares fell more than 12 percent shortly after trading opened on Monday, and finished the day down more than 5 percent."
4749,"Shares of Boeing have tripled since the presidential election in 2016, making it the highest-priced stock in the Dow."
4750,"Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group, cautioned against reading too much into the immediate reaction in Boeing’s shares. “I’ve learned from bitter experience not to look at the stock prices in the aftermath of a crash,” he said. “It’s just all over the place.”"
4751,"The company, which employs about 150,000 people, took in just over $100 billion in 2018, with profit for the year topping $10 billion."
4752,"ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia/NAKURU, Kenya — Mourning families of Ethiopian Airlines passengers who died in last month's crash are asking awkward and angry questions of U.S. planemaker Boeing after closely following a preliminary report into the disaster."
4753,"Though Ethiopian investigators' remit was not to find blame, they implicitly pointed at Boeing by recommending it fix a faulty system and saying pilots followed pre-established procedures, before the 737 MAX crashed killing all 157 on board. "
4754,"Konjit Shafi, who lost her 31-year-old brother Sintayehu, listened to the Ethiopian transport minister's press conference live on Thursday and wondered why lessons were not learned from a similar MAX disaster in Indonesia last October."
4755,"""Boeing - they knew the problem already,"" she said, referring to an automatic anti-stall system in the MAX model that tipped the jets down in both cases due to faulty sensors. "
4756,"""If they could have announced the problem to the airlines first, the accident may not have happened,"" she told Reuters in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa. "
4757,"Boeing has expressed condolences and promised a software fix. It will also have awkward questions of its own - over whether the Ethiopian crew correctly followed guidance not to restore power to the anti-stall system following sensor damage, and why the plane was also at unusually high thrust. "
4758,"For Konjit, the report's release on Thursday brought back her last words with her brother, who called after takeoff to say hello as the family lived in the flight path."
4759,"""He asked me to go outside and see the plane because he was just above our home,"" she said, sitting in a dimly lit front room in front of a portrait from Sintayehu's university graduation and a row of burned candles."
4760,"""I called him again and asked how the network was working and he answered 'I don't know, it's just working until now' and then 'good bye'. I think it's at that time that the accident happened."" "
4761,"Flight 302 had taken off late, at 8:38 a.m., and contact was lost six minutes later. It crashed into a dusty plain under still blue skies with such force that much of the wreckage was buried in the dry earth."
4762,"""PROFITS BEFORE LIVES""?"
4763,"Among those on board were three generations of one Kenyan family - grandmother Anne Wangui Karanja, her daughter and her three young grandchildren. "
4764,"In the back yard of the family home in the central Kenyan town of Nakuru, bunches of white roses were wilting on a newly-built stone memorial, emblazoned with photos, dates of birth and words of remembrance."
4765,"""From the report, we gather that the manufacturer is the problem,"" said Quindos Karanja, who lost his mother, sister, nieces and nephew. ""My anger comes in because they (Boeing) were putting profits before lives."""
4766,"The family read the crash report online as soon as it was published, and have followed news coverage with the aid of a stream of lawyers arriving at their home. "
4767,"""It is good that the CEO of Boeing came out and owned up, but all we want, before these planes go back into the skies, is that they make sure everything is taken care of,"" Karanja said."
4768,"""We don't want to have such a tragedy because it is very painful,"" he said. "
4769,"Boeing has not admitted liability, but its boss Dennis Muilenburg said on Thursday the company was working to eliminate the risk of ""erroneous activation"" of the so-called MCAS anti-stall system via a software update and pilot training."
4770,"The 737 MAX fleet has been grounded worldwide as a precaution. If culpability is found, it could open the world's biggest planemaker to a slew of lawsuits. "
4771,"Relatives of an American woman killed in the crash, Samya Stumo, filed the first lawsuit on behalf of a U.S. victim in Chicago. The complaint targeted Boeing and Rosemount Aerospace Inc, the manufacturer of the sensor at the heart of the inquiry. "
4772,"Stumo is the niece of consumer activist Ralph Nader, who has called for a boycott of the 737 MAX."
4773,"""We as passengers need to demand that planes be safe so that noone else dies,"" said her mother Nadia Milleron."
4774,"""Profits should not come before safety, and we are making this effort here to help prevent a third crash."" "

4776,"JAKARTA, Indonesia — The families were still mourning relatives lost in the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia when they were crammed into a hotel conference room a few weeks after the crash. Sign this form, they were told by employees of the low-cost carrier, and they would receive 1.3 billion rupiah, or $91,600."
4777,"For those who lost breadwinners in the crash on Oct. 29, the money, government-mandated compensation for loss of life in an aviation accident, was welcomed."
4778,"But that amount, while not insignificant for desperate families with bills to pay and children to school, was roughly the minimum they were entitled to receive under Indonesian law."
4779,"And the conditions imposed by Lion Air before it would disburse the payments were complicated and shocking, with some legal experts questioning their legality."
4780,"To collect the money, families had to sign a pledge, called a release and discharge, that they would not pursue legal action against Lion Air, its financial backers and insurers, as well as Boeing, which manufactured the nearly brand-new 737 Max 8 plane."
4781,"Moreover, the signers promised not to disclose the terms of the agreement itself, a copy reviewed by The New York Times shows."
4782,"Yet an Indonesian aviation act from 2011 specifies that when heirs receive the government-mandated payment, they do not give up their right to pursue legal action against a carrier or other entities that may have been involved in an air accident."
4783,"“The heirs of the victims have no obligation or duty to sign any requirements, including release and discharge,” said Ahmad Sudiro, the dean of the law faculty at Tarumanagara University in Jakarta, the Indonesian capital. “It could be that the company is trying to be tricky. This signing has no jurisdictional basis, but this is what the company is trying to force the families to do.”"
4784,"The document that relatives signed included an eight-page list of hundreds of other companies, many subcontractors for Boeing, which also could not be sued if relatives were to claim the money. Boeing officials declined to comment on the agreement’s terms."
4785,"“This is a very unorthodox document from Lion Air,” said Charles Herrmann, an American lawyer who is representing clients from the Lion Air crash and who has litigated aviation accident lawsuits for decades. “I’ve never seen anything like it.”"
4786,"Nearly five months after Flight 610 hurtled into the Java Sea, many questions remain about what caused the accident, which was followed on March 10 by the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, another nearly new Boeing Max 8, outside Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital."
4787,Investigations have centered on whether pilots may have been foiled by an automated system designed to prevent stalls in the Max 8 that could have pitched the plane forward into a fatal nose-dive when triggered by false data.
4788,"But for the families of the 189 people who died on Flight 610, some say their grief has been exacerbated by an effort to pressure them to accept low compensation and renounce all rights to sue."
4789,"Families said they were not allowed to take home copies of the release form to study it before signing. Some said they were prohibited from bringing their own lawyers into the room to scan the paperwork, even though the form said they “had been given the opportunity to consult with a lawyer.”"
4790,"A Lion Air official videotaped the family members who signed the form, some of the signatories said."
4791,"“There was no time to read it carefully or check it,” said Latief Nurbana, a high-ranking civil servant whose 24-year-old son was killed in the crash. “It is cruel and it is illegal.”"
4792,"“The amount is small,” said Dedi Sukendar, a relative of one of the crash victims who said the family agreed to sign the release form so that the dead man’s two children could afford to continue their schooling. “But we wanted the psychological pressure to stop.”"
4793,Mr. Latief is among those who refused to sign.
4794,"The Indonesian Ministry of Transportation has sent letters to Lion Air reminding the carrier of its obligation to conform to aviation regulations. A few days ago, the ministry received a reply from Lion Air saying they would comply, transportation officials said."
4795,Lion Air officials did not respond to questions about the form.
4796,"More than 20 relatives of those who died on Flight 610 have sued Boeing in the United States, including the family of the plane’s co-pilot, Harvino, who filed a suit claiming that the plane “was defective and in a condition that rendered it unreasonably dangerous for its intended use.”"
4797,"Following the Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month, countries around the world grounded the 737 Max 8. The United States Department of Transportation has begun looking at investigating the Federal Aviation Administration’s certification of the best-selling plane model."
4798,"Pilots who flew the Max 8 said they were not adequately informed about the new automated stall-prevention system, nor were they instructed how to disable it should incorrect data prompt it to seize control of the plane and propel its nose down."
4799,"“Having two horrible accidents within months of each other has put the focus in the United States on what is going on with the Max 8 and it strengthens our position on Lion Air,” said Mr. Herrmann, who is also considering pursuing legal action against the Federal Aviation Administration for certifying the plane model."
4800,"Lion Air, which has amassed 15 major safety lapses in its 20-year history, including two fatal crashes, has a history of trying to use quick cash to make problems go away, according to government investigators, air safety regulators and people involved in previous accidents."
4801,"One former Indonesian transportation safety investigator said that a Lion Air employee once tried to hand over a black garbage bag full of cash when the investigator was probing the fatal crash of a Lion Air flight that overshot the runway in bad weather in 2004. When the investigator declined the bag of cash, Edward Sirait, now president director of the Lion Air Group, asked why the payment had been refused, the investigator said."
4802,"Such payments from Lion Air were common because transportation safety officials were poorly paid, former investigators said. A former high-level Lion Air employee confirmed that when he worked at the company, clandestine payments to government investigators, even for restaurants and prostitutes, were routine."
4803,Mr. Sirait did not respond to a request for comment on the account of the plastic bag full of cash.
4804,"In an interview last year after the Flight 610 crash, he did not express condolences for the loss of life. He declined to discuss the unfolding investigation or maintenance logs detailing how the plane had recorded various data problems in the days preceding the crash."
4805,"“I am not an engineer,” he said. “There are so many documents that I don’t know.”"
4806,"Vinni Wulandari, the sister of Mr. Harvino, the co-pilot, said that since her family sued Boeing, Lion Air has refused to pay out his pension and has not honored a verbal agreement to fund his children’s education. The company no longer is willing to meet with her, she said."
4807,"“They’ve blocked my number,” Ms. Vinni said of Lion Air’s senior management. “It’s awful how the company treats us. We are victims, too.”"
4808,Lion Air did not respond to requests for comment on her accusations.
4809,"Mr. Latief, whose son, Muhammad Luthfi Nurrandhani, was among the Lion Air 610 victims, took notice at how Tewolde GebreMariam, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, quickly traveled to the Flight 302 crash site and that other senior airline employees were seen comforting grieving family members."
4810,"His son, Mr. Latief said, left behind a pregnant wife, who has since given birth to a boy. In November, the family took Mr. Luthfi’s remains that were recovered from the Java Sea and buried them in Jakarta."
4811,"Two months later, health officials called and said they had more remains that they had neglected to give Mr. Latief earlier. Did he want them? Mr. Latief said he did not want to upset his wife so he had a second, tiny coffin constructed and quietly buried it without telling her."
