1,"Given the Metropolitan Transportation Authority’s difficulty running a functional subway system, it might be unrealistic to expect subway stations to have decent bathrooms. It’s not the Metropolitan Restroom Authority."
2,"But subway bathrooms have long occupied an inner ring of the city’s underworld, each grim, battered door a portal to a multisensory nightmare."
3,"Or so we had heard. In 25 combined years in the city, these two reporters had never summoned the courage to enter one."
4,"Recently, though, your correspondents took a whirlwind tour (as others have done) to see if subway restrooms lived up to the horrific hype. Mostly, they did."
5,"The most scandalous thing about New York’s subway bathrooms may be not how gross they are, but how few. By the M.T.A.’s official count, there are operative restrooms — at least one per gender — in 51 of the 472 stations. In a system with an average 5.6 million riders each weekday, that’s about one bathroom for every 53,000 riders. "
6,"The M.T.A. is working on this. The agency fixed up 12 bathrooms last year. It plans to refurbish an additional 25 this year. “Our customers and employees can all use more open, clean bathrooms,” said Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman."
7,"To be fair, the bathrooms at the handful of new multibillion-dollar stations on Second Avenue and the West Side are practically pristine. But here’s what you may encounter in the rest of the system."
8,"Touch of class: A guard sits in a booth and buzzes you in to one of four single-occupancy restrooms, where you have a five-minute time limit."
9,"The stainless-steel sink and toilet gave off a penitentiary vibe, but were reasonably clean. It was the only station on our tour that supplied all the basics of personal hygiene (though none of the stations had tampons or pads)."
10,"Maximum-security steampunk: In the men’s room, toilet paper rolls hung from the wall by a heavy chain and padlock. A sticker on the stall door advertised the services of Rikersgoods.com, which delivers packages to inmates of the city jail."
11,A prospective user walked in but exited immediately.
12,"“It’s not looking pleasant to me right now,” said the man, a 30-year-old welder who gave his name only as Michael. The missing soap dispenser was the deal breaker. “That should be illegal,” he said."
13,"The women’s room floor featured two piles of toilet paper. One was dry, the other was a blob atop a yellowing spread of wet newspaper."
14,"There was no coat hook on the stall door, leaving a reporter to choose between putting her handbag on the floor or clenching the strap in her teeth. A fellow customer left without flushing, glancing at the sink on her way out."
15,"Beside the empty paper-towel dispenser, a hand dryer emitted a feeble puff."
16,The urine smell in the women’s room was more subtle than in the men’s. It was still staggering.
17,"The cracked concrete floor of the men’s room looked like it had not been mopped in years. But on the plus side, on the frigid day of our visit, the room was toasty hot."
18,"So hot that someone had wedged takeout Chinese food between the scalding radiator and the wall, possibly to keep it warm — a full container of shrimp-fried rice and brown-breaded nuggets."
19,"“That’s no good,” said the station supervisor, S. Hope, when we brought it to his attention. “That will melt and catch fire.” He threw it out. "
20,"In the women’s room, fire safety has apparently been learned the hard way. “No storage within three (3) feet,” read a sign on the floor beside a radiator covered in burn marks. The radiator was working fine, though. The environment was reminiscent of the tropical monkey habitat at the Central Park Zoo."
21,(Mr. Hope said the bathrooms are cleaned three times a day.)
22,"The main door to the women’s room has a peephole to let you see who’s in the hall. But it does not lock. “People hert people,” reads graffiti on the door."
23,"The women’s room offered another unexpected sight: a man, standing at the toilet. He apologized on his way out, but offered no explanation. Nor did he flush."
24,"Evidently a good place to kick back and relax: A 25-ounce can of malt liquor rested on the toilet in the men’s room, and generously proportioned hermaphroditic portraits graced two walls of the stall."
25,"But the only toilet paper in the room was stuck around the rim of the toilet, perhaps by someone who did not want to sit on the spattered seat. "
26,The women’s room was wreathed in cigarette smoke. There was no toilet paper at all.
27,The luxury liner of dilapidated subway restrooms. The soap dispenser in the women’s room was half full. Toilet paper flowed freely. The trash can was being used for trash.
28,"In the men’s room, where a pleasantly crenulated green-and-white tile motif adorns the walls, traffic was brisk and the hand dryer roared like a happy lion. The door latch was too bent to slide, but bent so that it kept the door from swinging open. Good work, M.T.A."

30,"Subway officials in New York City held a news conference recently to celebrate the system’s progress. The on-time rate for trains hit 76 percent, they boasted, signaling a “renaissance” for the floundering system."
31,But that figure masks a surprising disparity.
32,"While the numbered lines have seen a notable boost in reliability, many of the lettered lines are still delivering poor service. The F train has a miserable on-time rate of about 50 percent — the lowest in the system."
33,"“It seems like there’s always something, from a sick passenger to signal problems,” said Paul Galloway, an F train rider who lives in Brooklyn and works at the Museum of Modern Art. “It just seems like a cursed line to me.”"
34,"It is clear that the subway is improving after hitting rock bottom in the summer of 2017, when a train derailed in Harlem and the on-time rate dipped below 65 percent — the worst of any major transit system in the world. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has won accolades for making the system more reliable."
35,But the diverging fates of the lines represented by letters and numbers can feel like A Tale of Two Subways — a system where some riders see signs of hope while others continue to endure constant pain.
36,"Subway leaders say there are several reasons for the gulf: schedule changes on the numbered lines that boosted the on-time rate; a computer system on the numbered lines that allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains; the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which eased crowding on several numbered lines; and signal upgrades that improved service on another numbered line."
37,The trend has left some riders wondering how to game the system to get where they are going on time.
38,"“The numbered lines have more stops, but they arrive more regularly and are less prone to problems,” said Benjamin Kabak, who writes the Second Ave. Sagas subway blog and lives near several lines in Brooklyn. “Do you roll the dice and take the ideally faster way, or do you take the way you know is going to work?”"

60,[Read more on why your subway train might start moving faster.]
61,"The seven numbered subway lines are on time about 79 percent of the time, compared to about 68 percent for the fifteen lettered lines. Trains are considered on time if they reach the final stop within five minutes of the schedule."
62,"One reason the lettered lines are lagging is that they have older equipment. Some lettered lines are slated to  get modern signals, which should improve reliability. But Mr. Byford’s plan to modernize the entire subway will cost billions of dollars, and it is not clear whether state leaders will approve new funding streams for the transit system this year."
63,"Still, every line has improved as part of a broader effort to make trains run faster, said Sally Librera, the head of the subways department. Workers are increasing speed limits on parts of the system and replacing faulty signals that slowed trains."
64,"Transit officials point to other statistics that show subway service is improving, including fewer major incidents that delay 50 or more trains."
65,"“We recognize that we have more to do,” Ms. Librera said. “But we’re encouraged by the progress that we’re seeing.”"
66,"The subway now has its best on-time rate in four years — a figure that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is highlighting as he presses state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest part of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, is also pushing for reforms at the transit agency, though the State Senate issued a separate reform proposal."
67,"Critics have raised concerns over the schedule changes in late 2017 that made it easier to ensure that certain numbered trains are on time. On the No. 6 line, five trains were eliminated at Grand Central Station in Manhattan during the morning rush from 7 to 9 a.m., according to documents obtained by The New York Times."
68,"There were 68 trains scheduled on the 6 line during the morning rush in June 2017. The number fell to 63 last year. The on-time rate for the 6 train jumped to 72 percent in January, up from 52 percent in September 2017."
69,"“I’m inherently skeptical when they say we changed the schedule, and now everything is running on time,” Mr. Kabak said. “You’re running the risk of padding the schedule.”"
70,[Read more on how NYC tackled subway crime and how it may be coming back.]
71,Subway officials denied padding the schedule and said the changes were needed to accurately reflect how long it took to route trains through the system.
72,"“Adjusting schedules to accurately reflect actual system conditions allows for less train congestion and faster, more reliable service,” said Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the system. “This, along with other significant factors such as the $800 million Subway Action Plan and deliberately improved operating procedures, have led to the recent subway performance gains.”"
73,"Though fewer trains are scheduled, the same number of trains are running on the 6 line during the morning rush — an average of about 61 trains, Mr. Young said. Officials also cut service on the No. 1 and 5 lines, which each lost two scheduled trains in Midtown Manhattan during the morning rush."
74,"While fewer trains could help raise the on-time performance, they also can lead to more crowded trains and less capacity on the system. Each train can carry roughly 1,000 passengers."
75,"Most riders never learned about the schedule changes. The authority’s board did not approve them because they only vote on “major” service changes, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority. The schedule changes on the numbered lines were considered “minor” and the board was merely notified."
76,"An investigation by The New York Times in 2017 revealed that the transit agency was running fewer trains. The Lexington Avenue line, which carries the 4, 5 and 6 trains, regularly failed to meet its schedule, effectively canceling dozens of trains and reducing the system’s capacity by tens of thousands of riders. At Grand Central Station, just 77 of 90 scheduled trains regularly ran through the stop from 8 a.m. to 9 a.m."
77,"For years, the lettered trains actually had better on-time rates than the numbered trains, but that shifted in January 2018, shortly after the schedule changes took effect. Ms. Librera cited two other factors behind the resurgence: The Second Avenue line opened on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in January 2017, drawing riders who had previously used the overburdened 4, 5 and 6 lines, which bolstered the on-time rate for those lines. New signals on the No. 7 line also improved service."
78,"Most experts agree that the system is bouncing back. Andrew Albert, a board member who represents riders, said he noticed trains running faster along the Lexington Avenue line in Manhattan where they used to move at a snail’s pace."
79,"“Absolutely, it’s getting better,” he said. “I’m thwarted less often, and I notice the running times are much faster.”"

81,The police officers who patrol New York City’s transit system are constantly scanning subway stations looking for a familiar set of faces: repeat sexual offenders who have arrest records.
82,"The officers follow them through jam-packed platforms and onto crowded trains, waiting to see if they grope, grind, molest or indecently expose themselves again."
83,Because only then can the police intervene and make an arrest or eject them from the subway system.
84,The authorities have long been frustrated by not being able to keep known subway sexual harassers from returning to the scene of their crimes.
85,"But now, lawmakers and police officials are pushing a dramatic measure: On Monday, a city councilman, Chaim M. Deutsch, introduced a bill that would bar repeat sexual offenders from the subway system for life."
86,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed the idea of dealing more forcefully with sexual predators, though they stopped short of embracing a lifetime ban."
87,"“If someone shoplifts in a store, and they are a recidivist, then that person could be banned from walking into the store,” said Mr. Deutsch, who represents parts of Brooklyn."
88,"“This should not be any different,” added Mr. Deutsch, who said he was prompted to pursue the bill by an article in The New York Post about the challenges the police face in thwarting repeat subway sexual offenses."
89,City Council members often introduce bills that do not progress very far and Mr. Deutsch’s bill likely faces long odds.
90,"Still, it has prompted a debate about a problem that many women who ride the subway must contend with on a near-daily basis."
91,"“We have individuals who, literally, since the 1980s have been committing sexual offenses on the trains,” the Police Department’s chief of detectives, Dermot F. Shea, said on Wednesday during a news conference in Brooklyn. Chief Shea spoke outside the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station, where the police said they had earlier that day arrested a man for forcibly touching a 15-year-old girl."
92,"Mr. Cuomo, who controls the subway, said he supported barring sexual offenders after a second conviction."
93,"“This is one of these issues that I think common sense needs to prevail,” he told reporters in Albany on Tuesday, adding that groping and grinding was “a major problem.”"
94,"A precedent for such measures, the governor said, already existed because of laws that prohibit sexual offenders released from prison from living near schools."
95,"“You have people who target people in the subways,” he said, adding that the high recidivism rate for such crimes shows that existing laws were ineffective. “Why keep doing the same thing over and over and over again?”"
96,"Mr. de Blasio also did not say specifically whether he supported Mr. Deutsch’s bill, but said he would support legislation that would “help us do more to go at these predators and get them off the subway.”"
97,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, issued a statement saying that it supported efforts to keep repeat sexual offenders out of the subway."
98,"The number of sex crimes, including felonies and misdemeanors, on the subway are on the rise — 165 were reported through March 17, a 10 percent increase compared with the same period last year, according to the New York Police Department."
99,"Even though victims of sexual offenses have been encouraged to come forward for years, Chief Shea said he still believed the number of crimes did not reflect the extent of the problem."
100,"In recent years, the police and the transit agency have focused on making victims more willing to report criminal encounters."
101,"As part of that campaign, the Police Department has trained more female officers to work on sex-crime cases in the subway. They have also encouraged riders to submit cellphone camera photos and videos that could help them identify suspects and have posted these photos on social media."
102,"Still, because most sexual offenses committed on the subway are misdemeanors, prosecutors are limited in punishing convicted offenders and keeping them out of the subway, said Chief Edward Delatorre, who oversees the Police Department’s transit bureau."
103,"In Albany, State Senator Diane J. Savino, a Democrat who represents Staten Island and Brooklyn, has been working for several years to increase the penalties for people who repeatedly commit sexual offenses on the subway."
104,"“Right now, these offenders are only committing misdemeanors and can only be sentenced to up to a year in jail, with most serving little to no time at all,” Ms. Savino said."
105,"While Ms. Savino said she supported the ban proposed by Mr. Deutsch, she believed it would be hard to enforce."
106,"“They can’t be expected to have people at every turnstile checking who gets on and off the subway,” she said. “The real solution is to properly punish these crimes.”"
107,"A bill she has sponsored would make unwanted sexual contact on public transportation — what Ms. Savino called “subway grinding” — a felony. The bill was passed by the Senate three times between 2013 and 2018, all while the chamber was controlled by Republicans, but never made it past the Democratic-controlled Assembly’s Committee on Codes, which has jurisdiction over criminal justice policy."
108,"""Their attitude is that these penalties are severe enough,” she said of the committee. “But they’re not. If they were, you would not have repeat incidents by the same predators.”"
109,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
110,It is a peculiarity of New York City history: The mayor does not control the subway that is so essential to the city’s success.
111,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has some influence over the transit system, but he is largely at the whim of state leaders who have controlled the subway since 1968. Now Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, wants to change that."
112,"Mr. Johnson introduced an ambitious plan on Tuesday to wrest control of the subway from the governor and state lawmakers, many of whom live far from the city and rarely, if ever, take the subway."
113,"“We must take control of our destiny,” Mr. Johnson said during his first State of the City speech. “We must have municipal control of our mass transit system.”"
114,"Mr. Johnson, a Democrat who is likely to run for mayor in 2021, released a 100-page report calling for the creation of a city-controlled entity called “Big Apple Transit” to oversee subways and buses. The idea of the mayor taking charge of the subway has long been debated, but Mr. Johnson’s report is the most comprehensive proposal in years."
115,"New York City is unique in having its transit system run by state leaders. In Los Angeles and Chicago, the systems are mostly controlled by the mayor, allowing those leaders to set their own priorities and to undertake major upgrades. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has overseen a comeback of its aging subway. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti helped win support for a $120 billion ballot measure to expand the rail system."
116,"But some argue that it makes sense for the state to control New York’s subway since it is part of a much bigger regional transit network. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is a sweeping agency that oversees the subways, buses, commuter railroads and key bridges and tunnels."
117,"The debate over the subway’s future comes as state lawmakers in Albany are deciding whether to approve new revenue streams for the subway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has pressed for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise billions of dollars for the transit system."
118,"Mr. de Blasio recently threw his support behind congestion pricing and announced a plan to fix the system with Mr. Cuomo, with whom the mayor has frequently clashed. Their joint plan called for reforms of the transit agency and for new funding from taxes on recreational marijuana and internet sales."
119,"A spokesman for the mayor, Eric F. Phillips, said Mr. de Blasio was focused on “immediate actions to fix the broken subway system.” A city takeover of the subway was worth discussing, Mr. Phillips said, but “in best-case scenario would take years to achieve.”"
120,"Other leaders like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, have called for mayoral control of the subway in the past."
121,"Still, Mr. Johnson’s proposal faces long odds because the governor and the State Legislature would have to sign off on the new structure."
122,"The city once ran the subway, but the state took over the struggling system in 1968, in a power grab by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. Officials wanted to preserve the 20-cent fare and hoped that the tolls on bridges and tunnels would subsidize the costs of the subway."
123,"Mr. Johnson has drawn attention to the fact that he regularly takes the subway, unlike the mayor and the governor. Mr. de Blasio occasionally rides the subway while Mr. Cuomo rarely uses the system. Mr. Johnson has made the subway a priority, pushing for congestion pricing and half-price MetroCards for poor New Yorkers."
124,"Transit advocates praised Mr. Johnson’s proposal, as did Joseph J. Lhota, the authority’s former chairman, who ran against Mr. de Blasio for mayor. Mr. Lhota, who supported the idea of mayoral control during his campaign, praised Mr. Johnson’s “vision for the city.”"
125,"“It’s refreshing to see someone stand before the people,” Mr. Lhota said, “and say, ‘Hold me responsible. Hold me accountable.’”"
126,"Mr. Johnson’s speech had the feel of a campaign rally as he sought to position himself as a leader capable of thinking big, in contrast to Mr. de Blasio, who has been criticized for a lack of bold new initiatives in his second term. Mr. Johnson also challenged the state Legislature, saying that the City Council would approve congestion pricing if Albany failed to do so, though it is not clear whether the Council has the authority."
127,"The speech made clear that if Mr. Johnson runs for mayor, he would use the city takeover of the transit system as a signature issue, just as Mr. de Blasio focused on early childhood education when he first ran for mayor in 2013. Mr. Johnson was introduced by his mother, Ann Richardson, who is from Boston and has the accent to match, telling the audience about her son’s “kind loving haht.”"
128,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has received a wave of criticism over his handling of the transit system. Although he exerts great control over the agency, he has argued that he does not have enough power and that one person or entity should take charge and be accountable to the public."
129,"A Cuomo spokeswoman, Dani Lever, responded to Mr. Johnson’s speech with a short retort: “The city already owns the New York City Transit system,” in reference to a long-running debate over whether the city technically owns the system — a contention that Mr. de Blasio’s office has disputed."
130,"The authority is governed by a board that typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. Mr. Cuomo selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership."
131,"Mr. Johnson was careful not to mention Mr. Cuomo’s name or to attack him directly, though he criticized the unpopular decision by the Cuomo administration to divert transit funding to struggling ski resorts. Mr. Johnson joked that a mayor would never make that decision over fears that it would lead to tabloid headlines of “Mayor to City: Go Sled!”"
132,"Mr. Johnson also raised concerns about whether the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, could fix the system with its current structure under Mr. Cuomo."
133,“Imagine what Andy Byford could do without the built-in dysfunction of the M.T.A. slowing him down?” he asked.
134,"Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the authority, defended the agency. Transit officials, he said, are working hard to improve service and to convince state lawmakers to support a congestion pricing plan before the April 1 budget deadline."
135,"“We are laser-focused on the passage of congestion pricing,” Mr. Young said, “and obtaining the funding we need to deliver the transit system that New Yorkers deserve.”"
136,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
137,"He had wandered onto the Brooklyn subway tracks near Hoyt Street Station on Thursday morning, a boy of about 12, unattended and willing to test fate."
138,He managed to amble over the rail that carries 600 volts of electricity and wedge himself between the columns that separate the local and express tracks.
139,"It was about 9:15 a.m., and a northbound train was barreling his way."
140,The response was swift. A customer hurried to a call box and pushed a button for help. The station agent who got the call notified the rail control center. All train operators in the area received an alert and were told to be on the lookout.
141,"By then Hopeton Kiffin, a 51-year-old operator for the No. 5 train, had already spotted a flash of red on the tracks ahead of him in an area his express train would normally rush through. He slowed the train down. Someone on the platform pointed. There stood a boy in a red shirt, staring straight ahead, clapping his hands."
142,"“I’ve seen strange things, adults walking on the tracks — once I saw a guy who was on there walking to the next station — but this one, with the child standing there, I was taken aback,” Mr. Kiffin said in an interview."
143,"Mr. Kiffin’s reaction was swift but gentle. He secured the train, jumped out and approached the boy, who did not speak or respond physically or verbally to words."
144,"“He was very serious — there was no emotion, no verbal communication, not a lot of eye contact,” Mr. Kiffin said."
145,So the father of three stopped talking and offered his hand.
146,"“I have an 8-year-old daughter and sometimes words — they don’t listen — so I just gently held him by the hand,” he said. “I thought, ‘Let me guide him, and let him feel secure.’”"
147,"For a moment, the frequent subway story line of shared communal woe took a turn. Complaints about delayed trains, jam-packed platforms and violent crime were briefly overshadowed by Mr. Kiffin’s compassion."
148,About 15 minutes passed. Some people watched from the platform. Mr. Kiffin asked them how the boy had gotten into such an unusual place. No one knew.
149,Eventually Mr. Kiffin got the boy to walk to the waiting train and coaxed him into the operator’s cab.
150,"The train then moved to the next stop, Borough Hall, where the police were waiting. The boy was taken to a nearby hospital to be evaluated."
151,Mr. Kiffin was praised for his efforts.
152,"“I’m very proud of our train operator and station agent for their quick action to bring this child to safety without incident so that he can be reunited with his family,” the president of New York City Transit, Andy Byford, said in a statement."
153,"Tony Utano, the president of Local 100 of the Transport Workers Union, said Mr. Kiffin had helped to avoid a terrible tragedy."
154,"“You can never relax when you are operating a subway train,” Mr. Utano said in a statement. “You have to be alert for anything out of place. This story has a happy ending only because this operator spotted this child and managed to get him to safety.”"
155,"Mr. Kiffin lives in East Flatbush and has been a train operator for 13 years. When reflecting on the day’s events, he was relieved that his instincts as a train operator and a parent had quickly fused. Things could have gone very differently, he believed, had the boy become frightened or upset or fallen on the electric rail."
156,"“I feel I did my job,” Mr. Kiffin said."
157,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is in a state of crisis. 
158,Deterioration of service is apparent. Ridership is down and public misery is up. The unacceptable condition of the system is having a negative effect on the city and state economies. It is difficult to imagine how the public transportation network will accommodate the hundreds of thousands of people expected to enter the regional work force over the next 20 years with a system that already delivers an average of 5.6 million rides each weekday.
159,"Most everyone agrees on these facts, but there is no consensus on what to do about that."
160,"Lately, the political debate is focused on the money, and in particular, on a congestion-pricing proposal put forth by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio, which, if adopted, would not cover all of the funding gaps. "
161,"Thus, despite the best efforts of those who support congestion pricing, how to properly fund the M.T.A. remains a vexing question. But getting the M.T.A. out of its crisis will also require significant changes in two other related areas: governance and management."
162,"The M.T.A. was created in 1968 to bring together the underfunded and poorly maintained transit systems of New York City and its region. The authorizing statute established very clearly that the chairman of the board of the M.T.A., while appointed by the governor, should be an independent chief executive officer. The heads of each agency under the M.T.A. umbrella — for example, New York’s subway authority and the suburban train lines — would report to the board chairman."
163,"The point was hard to miss: The transportation services needed professional management. No one doubted that politics and competition for resources would remain. But the system needed a voice independent of elected officials like the governor, the mayor and those in the State Legislature. This works, when it is allowed to."
164,"In 1983, Gov. Mario Cuomo pushed the Legislature to pass a law to make the M.T.A. chairman serve at the pleasure of the governor. This proposal had no support and died."
165,"To this day, neither the chairman nor the other board members report to the governor or to the other elected officials who have the authority to make board appointments. This principle has been reinforced over time."
166,"In 2009, New York State passed a law that said members of the boards of public authorities owe their fiduciary duty exclusively to the mission of their authorities — not to the elected officials who appointed them. "
167,"New York’s current governor, Andrew Cuomo, has at times ignored the legally mandated independence of the M.T.A. "
168,"I’ve learned from conversations with lawmakers and M.T.A. officials that Mr. Cuomo has appointed board members who take directions from him and his staff. He has influenced the selection of senior M.T.A. managers. M.T.A. officials have said to me that they report to the governor on many issues. The lines are often blurred among the governor, his staff and senior M.T.A. leadership. "
169,"This is not entirely new — other governors have had influence over the board, especially with the members they appointed. But it has become more pervasive in recent years, according to M.T.A. officers I’ve spoken with. No other governor in my memory has exercised such direct control over the M.T.A. board."
170,"The members of the board, even those not appointed by the governor, have mostly looked the other way. The state agency charged with enforcing the laws that govern M.T.A. independence has not done its job. "
171,"As a consequence of Mr. Cuomo’s interference, M.T.A. managers often do not know whom they report to on any particular issue. They even disagree among themselves on whom they should take direction from. "
172,"No manager, no matter how skilled, can work effectively in this environment."
173,Mr. Cuomo recently proposed some management “reforms” to the M.T.A. that will be considered by state lawmakers along with the congestion pricing plan. But his idea to create an expert panel to set congestion pricing rates and approve M.T.A.’s finances is exactly the opposite of what the M.T.A. needs.
174,"Some observers and lawmakers have proposed that New York City take back the subway and bus system, returning to something resembling the organization that failed more than 50 years ago. This proposal ignores the regional nature of our transportation system and would put in grave jeopardy the Legislature’s responsibility of enacting regional taxes to fund the system. A city-run subway would inevitably become a city-funded subway, with some limited federal contribution for capital costs, and be subject to the complex rules that frustrate effective management of other city agencies. "
175,Let’s be clear: The problem is not with the governance structure created by the original laws. The problem is that this governor is interfering where he shouldn’t.
176,The first step toward reforming the transportation system is to restore the independence of the M.T.A. management. The system will continue to fail as long as the management structure remains as it is today.
177,"If proper governance were in place, the next step would be for the board to take stock of M.T.A. assets to determine their physical condition and the financial resources needed to keep the system in a state of good repair. With such an inventory, priorities can be set, and the public can determine whether the M.T.A.’s funding requests are accurate and adequate or, like many things there, politically determined."
178,"In addition to governance reform, the M.T.A. requires more funding. Congestion pricing — even if it could pass the Legislature — amounts to a regressive tax that will fall significantly short of providing the M.T.A. with the money it needs. "
179,"New revenue streams need to be reliable, such that the source is not substantially diminished in an economic downturn, and they should have minimal effect on the regional economy. Revenue should come from across the metropolitan region, not just the city, and its burdens should be shared by general taxpayers and all the motorists who benefit from a well functioning transportation system. "
180,"These are not simple matters. Previous governors and legislatures have risen to the challenges, and they can do so again, but only if they first focus on the real problems."
181,Richard Ravitch is a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a former lieutenant governor of New York.

185,It’s Friday.
186,"Weather: Friday may be wet. Expect sprinkles throughout the day, strong winds in the afternoon and a high near 50. Saturday may feel chilly. Sunday will be warmer."
187,Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday).
188,"The city’s subway trains are arriving on time more often, yet riders might be noticing an unusual divide in the system. The numbered lines are performing better than the lettered ones."
189,"To get a sense of why this is happening, I talked to my colleague Emma G. Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter."
190,[Why New York’s lettered subway lines are “cursed.”]
191,How are the trains performing?
192,"In 2017, less than 65 percent of trains were on time — the worst of any major transit system in the world, Ms. Fitzsimmons has reported. This year, that improved to 76 percent."
193,"But there was a twist: The seven numbered trains were outperforming the 15 lettered trains. Seventy-nine percent of numbered trains were on time, compared with 68 percent of lettered trains."
194,Why are numbered trains doing better?
195,Subway leaders cite several reasons:
196,• Schedule changes on the numbered lines improved the on-time rate.
197,• A computer system on the numbered lines allows workers to more efficiently dispatch trains.
198,"• The opening of the Second Avenue subway eased crowding on several numbered lines, and signal upgrades improved service on another numbered line."
199,Is there one thing that can improve all trains?
200,"Modern signals are the No. 1 solution, Ms. Fitzsimmons said."
201,"The subway system’s chief, Andy Byford, wants to install these signals on all the lines, but that takes time and costs billions. He hasn’t secured the funding from state lawmakers (yet)."
202,"The subway system also needs new train cars. Trains on the C line are the oldest in daily operation in the world, according to Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials."
203,Do affluent neighborhoods have better trains?
204,"Not necessarily. The F train goes through Park Slope and other wealthy neighborhoods in Brooklyn, and it has really terrible service. The on-time rate is about 50 percent — the lowest in the city."
205,"One reason I left Park Slope was because I didn’t want to live on the F train. I now ride the A train in Washington Heights, and it’s a much better experience."
206,Why were the lines assigned certain letters and numbers?
207,Three competing systems were built throughout the city.
208,• The Interborough Rapid Transit Company built the trains that are numbered.
209,"• The Independent System included what are now the A, C, D, E, F, G, R and Q lines."
210,"• The Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation included what are now the B, J, M, N, Z and L lines."
211,The companies were merged in 1953. (The W line was created in 2001.)
212,Have you noticed those weird new mailboxes? Here’s why the Postal Service made the change.
213,Several women said the philanthropist Michael Steinhardt made sexual requests of them while they were relying on or seeking his support. He denies many of the actions attributed to him.
214,Con Ed cut off new gas hookups in some New York suburbs. The move in Westchester County set off anger and panic among developers.

232,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
233,"Instead of the Big Apple, maybe New York should be called Bean Town."
234,"In 1994, Starbucks opened its first coffee shop in New York City. It was at 87th Street and Broadway."
235,"Ten years after the company’s debut here, the city’s Independent Budget Office determined that New Yorkers were downing so many lattes that if it taxed that coffee drink, it would  generate $12 million in revenue."
236,"So it really is no wonder that Starbucks, which was founded in Seattle, wrote on its website that “New York is America’s original coffee town.”"
237,All that coffee enthusiasm may help explain why the Coffee and Tea Festival in New York City outgrew the small Manhattan venue where it was first held 14 years ago.
238,"This weekend, the festival will be at the Brooklyn Expo Center in Greenpoint and will include seminars about Ethiopian coffee, “online tea matchmaking” and Italian iced coffee and tea. (Find out more on the festival’s website.)"
239,"Kristyn Noren, who worked at a Starbucks for seven years, said that by her estimate New York is “one of the most caffeinated cities in America.”"
240,"Mr. Noren knows beverages. She is the director of event marketing and sales for the festival, as well as the editor of Hard Cider News."
241,"She prefers her coffee black, preferably iced."
242,"So, which New York City coffee spot is her favorite?"
243,"“Working with so many different coffee companies, I really can’t have a favorite,” she said."
244,It’s Friday — drink up!

246,"It was raining as I zoomed down the street on my longboard. The station was 11 blocks away, and the train I wanted to catch would be leaving in five minutes. I didn’t like my odds."
247,"Just as my leg began to tire out from pushing, a small sedan turned the corner behind me and began to trail me. I swerved to the side of the street to make space for the car to drive by."
248,"After speeding up, the car slowed down once it came even with me. The window rolled down, and a young guy wearing a Yankees cap poked out his head."
249,“Where you off to?” he asked as we cruised along parallel to each other.
250,"“L.I.R.R.,” I said between breaths. “Queens Village Station.”"
251,He grinned.
252,“Grab on.”
253,"I smiled, grabbed onto the window and felt my wheels scream as he picked up speed."

258,"We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave."
259,"The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang."
260,"He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music."
261,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

309,"A man has been taken into police custody in connection with a brutal attack on a 78-year-old woman on the subway in the Bronx this month, the police said on Saturday."
310,"The man, Marc Gomez, 36, of Yonkers, was arrested around 10:30 a.m. on Saturday in Lower Manhattan, the police said. Mr. Gomez was identified this week by an anonymous tip that said he often hung around areas of Lower Manhattan. Mr. Gomez was charged with felony assault."
311,"The attack, which took place around 3 a.m. on March 10, surfaced this week when a video of the assault was posted to the internet. The recording of the attack had received more than 10 million views as of Saturday afternoon."
312,"The video showed a tall man wearing jeans, glasses, a leather jacket and a knit cap forcefully kicking the woman at least six times as she sat on a northbound No. 2 train that was pulling into the Nereid Avenue station. Bystanders recorded the encounter and shouted but did not intervene."
313,"As the man made his way off the train, he turned to the passengers recording and said, “WorldStar that” — a reference to a popular website that often showcases clips of violent altercations."
314,"The woman was met by an ambulance at the next train station, and treated for swelling and cuts to the face, the police said."
315,"On Sunday, Alisa Cox, Mr. Gomez’s fiancée, said the woman repeatedly threatened her family, including her 11-year-old daughter, as they were traveling back to Yonkers after attending a birthday party."
316,"“It looks like he just went over there and starting kicking her for no apparent reason,” Ms. Cox, 44, said in an interview, adding, “I’ve known him since he was 16. He’s not a bad person.”"
317,"Ms. Cox said Mr. Gomez, who had been working in a TriBeCa restaurant, immediately expressed remorse after he got off the train, admitting he let his temper get the best of him."
318,"Mr. Gomez has another open case in connection with an arrest from November. Officers arrested Mr. Gomez and a teenager after they found a loaded shotgun in a car the two were riding in on the Cross Bronx Expressway, the police said."
319,"Mr. Gomez was charged at the time with criminal possession of a loaded firearm, criminal possession of a firearm and criminal possession of a weapon after the police said they found a Mossberg shotgun in the car, a 2018 Mercedes with taxi license plates."
320,"While crime in the subway — and the city — is at lows not seen since the 1950s, violent encounters in the transit system posted to social media receive outsize attention. One such attack was the murder of 20-year-old Abel Mosso by alleged rival gang members on a Queens subway platform last month."
321,"As of March 17, there were 465 reported crimes in the transit system, down from 476 during the same period in 2018."
322,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.] 
323,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has faced its greatest challenge in a generation as officials have struggled to modernize New York City’s failing subway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has responded by promising bold solutions to fix the troubled agency and regain the trust of angry riders.
324,"But here are the changes Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers unveiled this week as part of the new state budget: A reorganization plan due in June, a “forensic audit” of train cars and signals, a group of outside experts who will review major projects and a “debarment process” that would ban contractors who do not finish projects on time."
325,"And even though state leaders have vowed more transparency, the authority’s new chairman — among the most powerful positions in New York government — was confirmed by the State Senate around 2 a.m. on Monday when most New Yorkers were asleep."
326,"Transit advocates have praised Mr. Cuomo for persuading state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, which will raise billions of dollars for the subway by establishing tolls to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan. But they were less enthusiastic about his changes at the transit agency, which appear to be more of a bureaucratic reshuffling than a radical transformation."
327,"Many New Yorkers view the authority, the nation’s largest transit agency, which oversees more than 70,000 employees, as inept — if not corrupt. The authority’s construction projects are routinely late and over budget — as high as seven times as costly as elsewhere in the world."
328,"The authority’s new chairman, Patrick J. Foye, was approved by the State Senate in the dead of night after hastily called hearings on Sunday, leaving virtually no chance for any significant public input."
329,"“This is just a wildly bad start at real M.T.A. reform,” said Benjamin Kabak, a transit advocate who runs the Second Ave. Sagas website."
330,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, defended the timing, saying that Mr. Foye’s appointment was part of the budget deal, which included both congestion pricing and changes at the transportation authority."
331,"“I said unless we have a management reform plan, I’m not going to approve more money,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday."
332,"His budget director, Robert Mujica, said in an interview that new rules would make the authority’s board more accountable to the public and the M.T.A. leadership team understood the urgency of overhauling how it does business."
333,"“You have a management team now that recognizes what the failures are and recognizes that there has to be a significant cultural change,” Mr. Mujica said."
334,"But Richard Ravitch, a former M.T.A. chairman credited with turning the subway around in the 1980s when it was plagued by delays and crime, said he was concerned about new rules allowing M.T.A. board members to serve only while the person who appointed them was in office. The board’s members need to be more independent to make tough decisions for the system, he said, instead of acting like political appointees."
335,"“This certainly gives the governor more power,” Mr. Ravitch said of the reforms."
336,"John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, a watchdog group, said the changes did not address the agency’s politicization under Mr. Cuomo, who has been accused of micromanaging the system. Mr. Cuomo has at times prioritized aesthetics, like the appearance of subway stations, over the nuts and bolts of maintenance."
337,"“The thing at the top of everyone’s list is to hire good transit managers and let them do their jobs,” Mr. Kaehny said. “It may seem obvious, but that’s one of the crucial problems.”"
338,"Maria Doulis, a vice president at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, said the changes did not address the costs of an upcoming union contract for subway workers or improving work rules to reduce costs. The union, Transport Workers Union Local 100, is a close ally of Mr. Cuomo."
339,"“Increasing the productivity of the work force to be able to perform the work more cost effectively is essential to the success of the M.T.A.,” she said. “I don’t see that part here.”"
340,"The legislation did expand the use of “design build,” a construction approach favored by Mr. Cuomo that bundles together the design and construction phases of a project instead of carrying them out separately."
341,"Mayor Bill de Blasio, a frequent adversary of Mr. Cuomo, said on Monday that he supported the M.T.A. reforms, even though some say the congestion pricing plan gave away control of city streets to the state."
342,"“The final plan on the M.T.A. is one I fully supported,” Mr. de Blasio said in a television interview. “We got the important changes and reforms we wanted to see in the name of fairness.”"
343,"The authority, which oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads, had gone nearly five months without a permanent leader. Its previous chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, stepped down in November amid questions over his potential conflicts of interests and outside jobs."
344,"Mr. Foye is a respected transit executive, though not exactly a revolutionary choice: He had been a top leader at the agency for the last year and a half. He is taking over at a critical time. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has an ambitious plan to fix the subway by upgrading its signals."
345,"The agency’s bridges and tunnel division will oversee the rollout of the Manhattan toll plan in 2021, making New York the first city in the country to impose congestion pricing."
346,"Mr. Foye told reporters on Monday that the agency had to do better and “everything is on the table” in terms of reforms, like merging procurement and legal departments at different parts of the agency. “The harsh truth is we’ve lost credibility with our customers and with our funders both in Albany and City Hall,” he said at a news conference to discuss the congestion pricing deal."
347,"At a hearing called by the Senate on Sunday afternoon that was streamed online, Mr. Foye pledged to serve as the authority’s full-time chairman and chief executive, without taking on outside jobs. Asked why the system had not improved since he joined the authority, Mr. Foye said the subway was getting better and now he would have full responsibility as chairman."
348,"“The buck stops at my desk,” Mr. Foye said."
349,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
350,"ALBANY — After years of hesitation, New York is poised to become the first city in the United States to introduce congestion pricing, which would put new electronic tolls in place for drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan."
351,"Though state leaders have not ironed out details, they had reached consensus on Monday that the plan was necessary to help pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s beleaguered subway system."
352,"The proceeds from congestion pricing are expected to enable the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the city’s public transit network, to raise billions of dollars in bonds to modernize the antiquated subway. Such a windfall overwhelmed lingering concerns about various aspects of the plan, including the cost to commuters in the boroughs and suburbs outside Manhattan who rely on cars."
353,"Other American cities are exploring variations of congestion pricing, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The idea dates back decades, with supporters often pointing to an array of health, safety and environmental benefits, including reducing air pollution and pedestrian injuries, and alleviating the stranglehold on gridlocked city streets."
354,"Those arguments have been bolstered by the success of plans in places like London, Stockholm and Singapore, where congestion pricing helped unclog streets. Still, such plans have also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that especially hurts poor people who do not have access to public transit."
355,"In New York, for example, a 2008 proposal from Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, died in the face of legislative apathy. But with the state currently facing shortfalls in income tax revenue and a subway crisis looming, Albany’s lawmakers on Monday finally agreed that it was an idea whose time had come."
356,"“Safe to say that the Assembly is ready to go forward on congestion pricing,” Carl E. Heastie, the chamber’s speaker, said on Monday; the Democratic-controlled Assembly had been the holdout in endorsing the plan. “We’re at the point where the Assembly members understand the need to fund the M.T.A.”"
357,"The State Senate, which is also controlled by Democrats, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, have already expressed support for congestion pricing, with the governor suggesting that without it, subway and bus fares could rise by 30 percent."
358,"Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has pushed for it as a funding mechanism for the subway system; in late February, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Cuomo, also warmed to the idea, saying there was no way to address the problems in the subway “without congestion pricing.”"
359,"Mr. Heastie and other legislative officials stressed that specifics about the plan, including the exact price for entering Manhattan’s main business district, were still being considered, though he seemed confident that a deal could be brokered, likely before the state’s budget deadline on April 1."
360,"Assembly members and Mr. Heastie have been hunkered behind closed doors in recent days, discussing a broad array of exemptions that would make congestion pricing more palatable, according to several members and aides. These include exemptions from the congestion fees for drivers who are poor, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments, among other things."
361,"Calls for a congestion pricing plan had also increased. On Monday, prominent congestion pricing supporters, including Patrick Foye, the M.T.A. president, and Polly Trottenberg, the New York City transportation commissioner, came to Albany to meet with legislative leaders."
362,"Kathryn S. Wylde, the head of the influential Partnership for New York City, a business group, was also pushing for such a plan, and praised Mr. Heastie shortly after he announced the deal for his “real skill” in “pulling together his diverse membership.”"
363,"In a sign of widening support this year, two separate grass-roots campaigns had emerged, as advocates lobbied legislators to gain their support, flooded local subway stops and urged frustrated subway riders to call and text their legislators."
364,"“Transit riders were up in arms about the state of our subway system and it seems that our representatives in Albany really listened,” said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, which helped organize the #FixtheSubway coalition. “I think the visceral anger of subway riders stuck on yet another unreliable train played a pivotal role in legislators feeling the urgency of the problem.”"
365,"One congestion pricing plan backed by the governor and mayor is projected to raise about $1 billion annually from fees for driving into a congestion zone spanning Manhattan’s central business district, from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would, in turn, be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for M.T.A. capital projects through 2024."
366,Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge on Manhattan’s West Side would receive a credit toward the fees. Those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the F.D.R. Drive to go north past the congestion zone would be exempted from the fees.
367,"The potential passage of congestion pricing would be a win for Mr. Cuomo, who was heavily criticized for his handling of the subways last year during his successful bid for re-election. He has pushed this year to overhaul the M.T.A., saying he will not sign a budget without reforms to the authority, and touting congestion pricing as a valuable source of funding for badly needed repairs."
368,"“Congestion pricing is the greatest opportunity we have had,” Mr. Cuomo said last week, in an interview on WNYC. “We have talked about it for 20 years. It is the smartest idea I think for urban development.”"
369,Suburban lawmakers have raised objections about the financial impact on those driving into the city and also have sought to ensure that some of the money from congestion pricing go to commuter railroads. But they seemed ready to make a deal.
370,"“Long Island senators have stated clearly that a fair and equitable congestion pricing plan must include a dedicated revenue stream for infrastructure upgrades to the beleaguered L.I.R.R.,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who represents Nassau County. “I am optimistic that an agreement can be reached that benefits both the region and the suburban commuter.”"
371,"With the budget deadline still a week away, and Albany known for its fractious and fragile deal making, there could still be snags before such a plan becomes law."
372,"Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat and leading critic of congestion pricing, said on Monday that he remained opposed to it unless his request for an exemption for all city residents was included in the plan. He represents parts of Queens where he said many residents have to drive because they do not have ready or affordable access to public transit. “I know there are a lot of exemptions on the table,” he said. “They could exempt residents of the five boroughs.”"
373,"Mr. Heastie said that such details were still being discussed, though he seemed reluctant to allow too many exemptions."
374,"“The more you carve out, the less you have in revenue,” Mr. Heastie said."
375,"The speaker said several issues still remained to be addressed, including help for so-called “transit deserts,” tolling on bridges and possible discounts for commuter rail users. Still, he seemed confident that such tolling would soon be the norm in Lower Manhattan."
376,"“I think we’re in a very good place,” he said."
377,"A woman attacked seven people with a substance like pepper spray in four places in Harlem and the Upper West Side on Friday, including two subway stations, in a series of attacks that were being investigated as possible hate crimes, the police said."
378,"Detective George Tsourovakas, a police spokesman, said the woman was black and the seven victims were white. He declined to elaborate on the hate crime investigation."
379,"As of Friday night, the police were still searching for the woman, who had not been identified or arrested."
380,"The attacks occurred between 11:50 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday, Detective Tsourovakas said."
381,"He said the first victim, a man, was on the southbound platform at the 125th and Lenox subway station. The woman walked up to him and sprayed him in the face without either of them exchanging words, he said."
382,The detective said the woman then left the station and pepper-sprayed a 47-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman as they were walking near 125th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard. She then sprayed another man and a 38-year-old woman near 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.
383,"A 23-year-old woman reported being sprayed near 125th Street and St. Nicholas Avenue, Detective Tsourovakas said. A 30-year-old woman then reported being sprayed on the platform at the 96th and Broadway subway station, he said."
384,"None of the victims had serious injuries, he said. The woman who was attacked at the 96th and Broadway station was taken to a hospital."

386,"At Hudson Yards, the expansive real estate development that is about to open in Manhattan, seven floors of retail are occupied by Fendi, Dior, Neiman Marcus and other high-end shops. Major corporations, including WarnerMedia and L’Oreal USA, will have their headquarters there. In the luxury residential buildings, one-bedroom apartments will rent for at least $5,200 a month — or you can buy a two-floor penthouse condo for $32 million."
387,All thanks to the help of taxpayers.
388,"New York was riveted for weeks by a debate over whether Amazon should receive $3 billion in tax breaks and other incentives in return for setting up a headquarters in Queens and creating 25,000 jobs. But with far less public attention, the city government has for more than a decade been funneling even more aid to Hudson Yards, a 28-acre complex of gleaming office buildings and luxury residential towers that is one of the nation’s biggest real estate projects in recent years."
389,"In all, the tax breaks and other government assistance for Hudson Yards have reached nearly $6 billion, according to public records and  a recent analysis by the New School."
390,"The city spent about $2.4 billion to extend the No. 7 subway line to Hudson Yards and set aside $1.2 billion for about four acres of parks and open spaces called Hudson Park and Boulevard. The City Council stepped up to pay $359 million in interest payments on bonds when revenue from the development, which was supposed to cover the tab, fell short of projections."
391,"As a result, Hudson Yards is perhaps an even more resonant symbol of the role of government in giving tax breaks and other incentives to spur development. In this case, two of the world’s largest real estate developers, Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group, which together built Hudson Yards, have significantly benefited."
392,"Supporters of the Hudson Yards project say the government incentives will pay vast dividends by creating an entirely new business district, generating thousands of new jobs and retaining many thousands more. They point out that the No. 7 subway extension, the parks and other improvements that the city financed will help make the Far West Side an overall better neighborhood."
393,"But the project’s detractors voice the kind of criticism that reverberated during the Amazon deal: Wealthy businesses, no matter their promises of jobs, should pay their own way and not demand government incentives to undertake projects. (Stung by the backlash over the incentives that it would receive, Amazon last month abandoned its plans for its campus in Long Island City.)"
394,"The opponents are focused in particular on a lengthy and lucrative property tax break for developers within the broader Hudson Yards area. So far, the cost of that tax break has surpassed $1 billion, according to the recent analysis by Bridget Fisher and Flávia Leite at the New School."
395,"Future properties in Hudson Yards can also take advantage of the tax break, which can be as much as a 40 percent discount and last about 20 years. The opponents said such incentives inevitably end up widening income inequality in a city like New York."
396,"“We are still giving tax breaks to a development that enriches billionaire developers and high-rise commercial and residential development that is not benefiting ordinary people in New York,” said James Parrott, director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City Affairs at the New School."
397,There are other incentives as well.
398,"BlackRock, the world’s largest money manager, which ended 2018 with $5.98 trillion under management, can obtain $25 million in state tax credits if it adds 700 jobs at Hudson Yards. L’Oreal USA is in line for $5.5 million for the same discretionary tax credit, while WarnerMedia can get $14 million."
399,"Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, a supporter of the Hudson Yards project, is now expressing some misgivings about the property tax breaks. Mr. de Blasio had been a backer of the Amazon deal, but since the company pulled out, he has abruptly shifted tone, just as he has been seeking to solidify his credentials with progressives."
400,"Mr. de Blasio said in a statement that the subway and park spending had broad benefits, but added: “We’ve moved away from providing discretionary incentives like the prior administration. I believe state and local economic development programs need to be re-evaluated and updated.”"
401,"Hudson Yards sprouted during a moment of post-Sept. 11 pride and economic uncertainty, with the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg, vowing to reclaim a neighborhood that included a stubby collection of brick warehouses, factories and tenements built when the Hudson River docks were busy. In the middle was an unsightly rail yard."
402,"On Friday, when Hudson Yards officially opens, a city within a city will rise as the centerpiece of an area bounded by Eighth and 12th Avenues from 30th to 42nd Streets. The main site, developed by Related Companies and Oxford Properties, was built over the rail yard, and it is by some estimates the largest real estate project in New York since Rockefeller Center in the 1930s."
403,"The $25 billion neighborhood has 13 buildings, including a school and parks, that will bring more than 55,000 employees to new offices there. There will also be a major dining complex with restaurants run by celebrity chefs like Thomas Keller and David Chang."
404,"“Without a doubt, we now have millions of square feet of office space and housing we did not have,” said Alexander Garvin, a former commissioner on the New York City Planning Commission, who became involved with Hudson Yards in the mid-1990s. “We have that many more jobs, that many more places for people to live, and that much more property taxes that come into the city.”"
405,"(The Related Companies chairman, Stephen M. Ross, a 78-year-old billionaire who is one of the world’s richest people, is moving into a penthouse in the 72-story tower, which is known as 35 Hudson Yards.)"
406,"L. Jay Cross, president of Related Hudson Yards, which oversees the development of the site, said in an interview that the redevelopment would not have gotten off the ground without the subway extension and tax breaks that allowed for new office space to be offered at rates comparable to Midtown’s."
407,Mr. Cross said it was vital that the city throw its support behind major development projects to ensure that it remained attractive to businesses in an increasingly globalized economy.
408,"“With all those old buildings we have in aging Midtown, we have to find a way to build modern buildings to compete with London, Singapore and Tokyo,” he said."
409,"Mr. Cross said that as Hudson Yards grows, the city would take in more in property taxes that it could use to pay off the bonds that financed the subway extension."
410,"The groundwork for Hudson Yards was set in motion in the 1980s. When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority created a yard for commuter trains on the West Side, its chairman at the time, Richard Ravitch, knew the site could be valuable one day. He had the tracks spaced far enough apart that columns could be installed to support a deck."
411,"A decade later, the property became the centerpiece for an ambitious plan by a young investor named Daniel L. Doctoroff to attract the 2012 Summer Olympics to New York. The rail yard could be covered and support an Olympics stadium, which could also be the new home for the New York Jets."
412,"While the city debated the merits of hosting the Olympics and the economic impact of a stadium, Mr. Doctoroff, who became a deputy mayor under Mr. Bloomberg, and other city planners moved ahead with the broader redevelopment of the West Side."
413,"The area was rezoned, making room for towering buildings, and Mr. Bloomberg committed to the city to expanding the subway when the M.T.A. said it would not."
414,"“There wasn’t any genuine opposition to Hudson Yards at all,” said Peter J. Kiernan, a lawyer who helped write a 2007 study on the city’s finance plan for the subway extension."
415,"By the time New York lost the Olympics bid to London in 2005, the Far West Side was well along into becoming Hudson Yards. New apartment buildings were going up, and subway construction was about to start. In 2008, Mr. Ross swooped in to pay $1 billion to the M.T.A. to develop a project over the rail yards, salvaging a deal after the first-place bidder backed out."
416,"Hudson Yards would not exist in its current form without significant government assistance, especially the expansion of the 7 line, said Mr. Ravitch, who was initially skeptical of the city’s plan to pay for the subway expansion."
417,"“The M.T.A. didn’t have the money, and it wasn’t a priority,” Mr. Ravitch said last week. “Thank God it turned out to be a great success. It was worth what the city did for it.”"
418,"Still, the fallout from the Amazon deal may be having an impact on how the city approaches megaprojects in the future."
419,"Councilman Brad Lander of Brooklyn, a Democrat who is a founder of the Council’s Progressive Caucus, said it was smart to expand the No. 7 subway and create parks on the West Side."
420,"But tax breaks for specific companies are a different story, said Mr. Lander, who was an opponent of the Amazon deal."
421,"“We’re giving away tax breaks without paying close attention to what’s a good deal or not a good deal,” he said."

423,"As New York edges closer to adopting congestion pricing, a major obstacle could stand in the way: the suburbs, where many lawmakers and commuters see the plan as benefiting the city at their expense."
424,Leaders in Albany announced this week that they had reached a consensus that a congestion pricing plan to charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods was needed to raise billions of dollars for the failing subway.
425,"But the details have yet to be worked out, and Long Island lawmakers want revenue from congestion pricing to flow to the commuter trains their constituents ride."
426,[Driving into Manhattan may soon cost well more than $10. Here’s more on how congestion pricing would work.]
427,"“At the end of the day, congestion pricing for Long Islanders should mean a better Long Island Rail Road,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who leads an influential six-member Long Island delegation that is part of the Senate’s Democratic majority."
428,"But suburban demands for a generous slice of the congestion-pricing pie gloss over a stark financial reality: Long Island already benefits from a far larger pot of transit money than New York City, and its commuters who drive tend to be wealthier than most city subway riders."
429,"The Long Island Rail Road accounts for just 3.5 percent of all transit rides provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the railroad and the city’s public transit."
430,"Yet the M.T.A. subsidizes each ride on the Long Island Rail Road by $7.68, compared with $1.58 for everyride on New York’s subway trains and buses."
431,"Even the Metro-North Railroad that serves suburbs north of the city, which the authority also manages, gets less than the L.I.R.R. — $6.54 per ride."
432,"The Long Island Rail Road has also received nearly $3 billion for repairs and improvements since 2015, accounting for 9 percent of the M.T.A.’s five-year capital spending plan."
433,Another $4.8 billion went to two huge projects: a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal that will serve Long Island Rail Road trains and new tracks on Long Island for more trains.
434,"“In the past, they’ve gotten their fair share — and you could even say they’ve gotten more than their fair share because some of these megaprojects have been over budget,” said Jamison Dague, the former director of infrastructure studies for the Citizens Budget Commission."
435,"Still, many Long Island residents and officials say their trains have grown crowded and service has deteriorated with constant delays and cancellations. “Whatever is happening, it isn’t working,” Mr. Kaminsky said. “To ask them not to drive when mass transit may not be up to the task, I think, would be seen as unfair.”"
436,Legislators from the Hudson Valley have also called for congestion pricing revenues to be directed to the Metro-North Railroad.
437,"“We’ve just felt neglected and forgotten about by the M.T.A. for years,” said Senator David Carlucci, who represents parts of Westchester and Rockland counties, adding that he could not support any congestion pricing plan without dedicated money for Metro-North."
438,"A congestion plan backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio could raise about $1 billion annually in fees for driving into Manhattan from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for the transportation authority, which could also benefit suburban commuters."
439,"But transit officials say at least $40 billion is needed to turn the creaky subway, which carries an average 5.6 million riders every weekday, into a modern 21st century system."
440,"Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit, while those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive north past 60th Street would not have to pay."
441,"Suburban senators have called for exemptions or toll credits for crossings heavily used by commuters — the Robert F. Kennedy, the George Washington and the Governor Mario M. Cuomo bridges. They also want improvements in bus service in transit deserts, and for suburban commuters to be represented on a proposed committee to review M.T.A. capital projects."
442,"Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers and the majority leader, has said “there is a need for a dedicated stream of revenue to fix the crumbling M.T.A. but any fix must benefit all parts of the M.T.A.”"
443,"Providing too many exemptions or toll credits would undermine the goal of reducing traffic and could result in higher fees for others to ensure enough revenue is collected, state officials said."
444,"Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing, said he believed lawmakers were engaging in typical Albany negotiations since congestion pricing is part of the next state budget, which is due April 1."
445,"“They’re laying out their interests,” she said. “That’s very standard for this time of year.”"
446,"About 36,000 Long Island residents drive to work in Manhattan, including about 5,000 who participate in car pools, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Three times as many, or 108,000 commuters, take the train to work anywhere in New York City."
447,"Long Island drivers who would pay congestion fees are generally better off financially than subway riders who live and work in the city: Long Island drivers have a median income of $72,500 compared with $41,400 for subway riders, according to the analysis."
448,"Steve Levy, the executive director of the Center for Cost Effective Government, a conservative fiscal policy group on Long Island, said congestion pricing was simply another way to squeeze more money out of commuters and taxpayers and fails to address the M.T.A.’s “out-of-control spending.”"
449,"“Enough is enough,” he added."
450,"Even Long Island residents who support the idea of congestion pricing say it could create more problems. “In practice, there’s no way to make it work because the Long Island Rail Road is so broken,” said Jen Hosford, 45, a risk manager whose commute by train to Manhattan has never been worse. “If you’re going to add that many people, where are they going to go?”"
451,Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislators are nearing agreement on a more than $170 billion budget that could help the subways and reform election campaigns.
452,"But in Albany, nothing can be taken for granted. "
453,"The deal, which must be approved by Monday, the start of the fiscal year, includes a congestion pricing plan to help fund public transit and a voluntary system to match small political contributions six-to-one to increase competition in state elections."
454,"Though Mr. Cuomo, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader, and Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, have all committed to supporting these key measures, they haven’t reached a final agreement on the details. "
455,The congestion pricing plan to charge drivers more than $10 to enter Manhattan below 60th Street could generate $1 billion every year that could pay for $15 billion in bonds for major transit repairs.
456,"Making the plan a part of the budget helped pressure upstate and suburban legislators to support it. But the final version still needs to ensure that a clear majority of revenue goes toward the city’s subways, rather than suburban rail lines. The subways serve by far the most riders, have been underfunded and are in by far the worst shape."
457,"Reaching an agreement on public financing of elections could be harder. Many legislators, especially in the State Assembly, have opposed it. After public pressure, Mr. Heastie backed the measure. The plan is worth the fight. A similar system has worked well in New York City, where it has increased competition in elections, one way to improve the responsiveness of elected officials."
458,"One thing that needs to be included in the final deal is full funding for early voting, without shifting the cost to local election boards. Though the state approved much-needed legislation in January allowing New Yorkers to vote up to 10 days before an election, local election boards need funding to the changes."
459,"But the proposal includes elements that have little to do with budgeting and deserve more careful attention. One such proposal would give police departments expansive discretion to withhold arrest information. Cuomo officials say the proposal is meant to protect individual privacy by addressing a scurrilous practice in which private websites post mug shots, then demand payment to remove them. But the measure is far too broad, and could prevent the public from learning basic information about who is arrested and why. On Friday, efforts were underway to narrow the scope of the measure to limit it to the release of mug shots, according to a spokesman for Mr. Heastie."
460,This year’s state budget includes promising initiatives that can help move New York forward. Here’s hoping Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders can get it right.

464,"A poster hanging on the walls of New York City subway stations advertises a new book celebrating the life and work of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, calling the Supreme Court justice a “trail blazer” and a “history maker.”"
465,"On Tuesday, the advertisement at one Brooklyn subway stop included another message: an anti-Semitic slur and a swastika scrawled over her face."
466,"The New York Police Department’s hate crimes unit and officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority were investigating the incident, which came to wider attention after it was reported by a commuter on Twitter, officials said."
467,"The vandalism, which was swiftly condemned by city officials, came amid a  rise in hate crimes in New York City, driven in large part by anti-Semitic attacks and incidents. There were 86 hate crimes reported in the city this year as of March 10, an increase of 62 percent over the same time period last year, the police said. About 60 percent of those were anti-Semitic crimes, with 52 such incidents reported so far this year, compared with 32 by the same time in 2018."
468,"In 2018, hate crimes in New York City rose by 5 percent; anti-Semitic crimes alone rose 22 percent last year compared with the year before."
469,"The poster, which was hanging at the Nassau Avenue stop on the G line in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, was defaced with the phrase “Die, Jew” and another profane slur written in capital letters in what appeared to be black marker. Underneath the expletive, which was punctuated with an exclamation point, was a swastika drawn over Justice Ginsburg’s lips."
470,"The graffiti was removed from the poster on Tuesday afternoon, the transit authority said."
471,"“We have zero tolerance for hate and violence, and this is a horrendous example that has no place anywhere,” an agency spokesman, Shams Tarek, said in a statement."
472,Officials said they would share any available surveillance video with the police to assist them with their investigation.
473,The Police Department confirmed on Wednesday that its hate crimes unit was investigating the incident.
474,"The subway poster was advertising the book “The Unstoppable Ruth Bader Ginsburg: American Icon,” a photo history released in 2018 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Justice Ginsburg’s appointment to the Supreme Court in 1993."
475,"When she was confirmed, Justice Ginsburg, a Brooklyn native, became the second woman and first Jewish woman to serve on the Supreme Court. During her confirmation hearings, she spoke about facing anti-Semitism in her past."
476,"At one point during the hearing, she recounted a childhood experience of seeing a sign in front of a restaurant that read, “No dogs or Jews allowed.”"
477,"“One couldn’t help but be sensitive to discrimination, living as a Jew in America at the time of World War II,” she said."
478,"In an interview with The New York Times in 2015, she also spoke about facing anti-Jewish sentiment when she was trying to find a job after she graduated from Columbia Law School in 1959."
479,"“I had three strikes against me,” she said. “First, I was Jewish, and the Wall Street firms were just beginning to accept Jews. Then I was a woman. But the killer was my daughter Jane, who was 4 by then.”"
480,"In a tweet on Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Justice Ginsburg represented “the very best” of New York City and vowed that city officials would find and punish whoever defaced her portrait."
481,"The vandalism was the latest in a string of high-profile, anti-Jewish hate crimes in New York City in the last month. At the end of February, a 12-year-old boy was arrested and charged in connection with swastikas and other Nazi symbols on a public school playground in Queens."
482,"Weeks earlier, two men threw an object into the front window of a synagogue in Brooklyn at about 2 a.m. No one was injured, but the attack, which broke the window, was being investigated as a possible hate crime."
483,"The Jewish community in Brooklyn has been particularly on edge after a set of videos that showed Orthodox Jewish men being beaten, chased and choked in Crown Heights."
484,The graffiti found this week also came a week after a chalk drawing depicting a noose showed up on a wall at another Brooklyn subway station. Transportation authority officials worked quickly to clean it up and denounced the drawing as hateful imagery.
485,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
486,"Recently Mayor Bill de Blasio went to Iowa, not for the first time, presumably to vision-board a bid for the presidency despite his public equivocations. Over the course of two stops, one in Sioux City and another in Des Moines, roughly 65 people came out to see him, a number that might disappoint even organizers of a municipal town hall on new concepts in recycling. Never one to be deterred by absurdly long odds, he is on his way to Florida this weekend."
487,"Let’s take it as a matter of certainty that with a 43 percent approval rating in the city he runs and no reality-television franchise to explode his fan base, Mr. de Blasio has little chance of becoming the next president of the United States. Delusion often protects us from acknowledging life’s unsettling ironies. Six years ago, when he was elected the mayor of New York, in a landslide of the kind not seen since 1985, he was poised to become the country’s most prominent voice of the progressive left."
488,"It is easy to forget how concisely he delivered his message on the corrosive effects of inequality and how much it resonated when he campaigned in 2013, a moment when few politicians of his stature were branding themselves so definitively this way."
489,"And yet by the time of the Democratic National Convention in 2016, Mr. de Blasio was relegated to a minor speaking slot scheduled during rush hour on the East Coast. This was partly retribution for his slow reflex to endorse the Democratic nominee, but it made clear how little currency he actually had with a new and growing movement he was so crucial in fomenting."
490,"Now, even if he were to serve merely as a traveling salesman for a particular strain of liberal problem-solving, something he seems compelled to do, Mr. de Blasio could easily be a liability to Democrats in the 2020 election cycle."
491,"On the one hand, a new wave of progressives shares little of his comfort with real estate and other moneyed interests. This was clear when his initial support of Amazon’s expansion in New York was met with a fury he did not anticipate. He could not see that his relentless focus on the 25,000 jobs Amazon promised was misguided given low unemployment rates and the increasing number of technology jobs that have already come to New York. Good jobs are available to New Yorkers; what they don’t have is affordable housing, and that is a problem Amazon wasn’t going to solve."
492,"Beyond that, the mayor is especially vulnerable to attacks from the right that would, predictably, suggest that his administration has embodied the failure of so-called big government. It is hard to defend his disastrous handling of the New York City Housing Authority, which has been troubled and underfunded for decades but reached peak crisis during his tenure, with lies and obfuscations about lead paint inspections and the increasing debilitation of the buildings themselves."
493,"Just this week at a panel discussion on the future of Brooklyn, the urban planner and Yale professor Alexander Garvin, who oversaw the development of Lower Manhattan after the attacks of Sept. 11, argued that the city has passively and pointlessly waited for federal money to repair public housing — money that was never going to come — instead of pursuing innovative means of financing those repairs itself, through bond issues."
494,The troubled subway system and Mr. de Blasio’s unsuccessful Renewal schools initiative simply provide more bait for privatization hawks to discredit the viability of a liberal approach to accomplishing fundamental problems with infrastructure and education that plague the whole country.
495,"While blame for the dysfunctional transit system can largely be laid at the feet of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, the mayor’s inability to work with him as a grown-up has only made things worse. It took Mr. de Blasio until the last possible minute to get behind a congestion-pricing plan that could divert revenue to subway repairs."
496,The mayor is increasingly oblivious. This week he rode the subway and seemed surprised to discover just how exasperated New Yorkers are with their inability to get to where they are going without delays and hassles and endless anxiety.
497,"“What I gleaned is people really depend on their subways,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference later, sounding as if he were a tourist from Havana with limited access to the tens of thousands of words that have been devoted to this subject by the local press during the past few years."
498,"“‘Some days I get to work on time, some days I’m a half-hour late, 45 minutes late,’” Mr. de Blasio continued, recounting the conversations he had on the train. “You can hear the frustration.” That frustration has been within audible range for a very long time."
499,"Mr. de Blasio’s style seems particularly ill-suited to a moment when personality politics have entered a new and hypercharged phase, when the ability to create an obsession both among one’s own constituents and the opposition seems so essential to getting ahead. Mr. de Blasio has always dismissed the criticisms that he is too earnest, too arrogant, too unlikable, too aloof. But how does he plan to compete in a world of Donald Trump rage tweets and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez talking to voters as she sings in her kitchen or chops squash?"
500,"Somewhere he may have the knives to cut through, but they all lack the edge."

502,"It was a cold, drizzly Sunday morning in 1973, and I was at the Jon Vie bakery on Sixth Avenue in the West Village. The chocolate cheesecake was a specialty of theirs."
503,There were two customers there besides me: a man ordering at the counter and a woman standing next to me who was all bundled up.
504,"“Here you go,” the counterman said, handing a cake box to the man who was waiting. “Our last chocolate cheesecake.”"
505,The woman and I turned to each other in dismay.
506,“Not the last chocolate cheesecake!” we said at the same time.

520,Dear Diary:
521,I was walking along 60th Street with my 4-year-old son. We were going from Central Park to our apartment on Columbus Avenue.
522,An older woman with a white cane was navigating the busy sidewalk. I explained to my son that she was blind and that we should offer to help her. 
523,"We introduced ourselves, and she said her name was Shirley. She accepted our help gratefully. She said she was going to Roosevelt Hospital, not far out of our way."
524,"As we walked, Shirley told us about herself. She mentioned that she had taken the A train down from 165th Street for her doctor’s appointment, something she typically did on her own."
525,We got to the hospital and parted ways.
526,"Later that week, I brought my 8-year-old daughter to a play date in Washington Heights. It was going to be our first time in the neighborhood. As we rode uptown on the subway, I told my daughter about meeting the blind woman earlier in the week."
527,"We left the subway at 168th Street and started toward our destination. Within two blocks, I spotted Shirley."
528,“Shirley?” I called out.
529,"“Joel,” she said. “Is that you?”"

532,"Hey, Holden, I hear that you’re worried, concerned —Where are the ducks since the weather has turned?You’ve asked several cabbies, they simply don’t know,Where are the ducks and where do they go?"
533,"They’re lonely and cold and prob’bly depressed,It’s tough in this town when you haven’t a nest.When the trees are all bare and the temper’ture’s brutal.And the mood is despair and the journey is futile."
534,"But kiddo, take heart, because this is the crux:If you listen for quacking, you’ll see that the ducksAre here in the park and they haven’t flown far —They splash and relax in the grand reservoir."
535,"The ducklings, the drakes, the mallards, the hens,All the ducks in a row, our fine feathered friends.Dining on sushi, a marvelous feast,Central Park’s their address: West, Middle and East."
536,"So, hang in there, Holden, everything’s ducky,Both you and the birds are lovely and lucky.No need to wonder just where the ducks go,Look no further than here, and thank Jackie O."

538,Dear Diary:
539,I was on the subway platform at Times Square at rush hour. I was trying to slip through a tight corridor between a staircase and the tracks when a man in front of me stopped and stooped over.
540,"“What’s he doing?” I wondered, frustrated at having to pause."
541,I saw that he was reaching for a glove that couldn’t have been his: It was on the ground in front of him as he bent over.
542,"I looked around, trying to figure out whom the glove belonged to and what the man was going do with it. I was intrigued, but mostly out of self-interest. If he started asking around about whose glove it was, I wouldn’t get as far down the platform as I wanted before my train arrived."
543,"A man who looked like a construction worker started walking our way. The first man tossed the glove in his direction, like you would with a pal. The construction worker caught it, smiled, winked, turned around and walked away."

547,"ALBANY — After weeks of intraparty bickering, the New York State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Sunday signed off on a $175 billion budget that was wreathed with progressive initiatives, including changes to the cash bail system, a new tax on high-end homes and a groundbreaking plan to charge motorists to drive into Manhattan’s busiest stretches."
548,"The budget deal was immediately hailed as “transformative” by Mr. Cuomo, and it will clearly have an impact felt far beyond taxpayers’ wallets. The agreement included deals that will likely change the way millions of New Yorkers shop, commute and vote: bans on plastic bags from retail stores, billions in new funds for New York’s troubled subway system and a new paid three-hour break on Election Day."
549,"The budget’s progressive theme was a victory for Mr. Cuomo and the newly elected Democratic majority in the State Legislature, most notably Democrats who helped give the party control of the State Senate for the first time in a decade. They largely lived up to pledges to address big money in politics, raise taxes on the wealthy and overhaul a criminal justice system that disproportionately targets minority communities."
550,"But the deal announced in the wee hours of Sunday morning also showed the limits of those campaign promises. Activists criticized a plan to empower small campaign donors as halfhearted. A measure to tax luxury homes was refashioned at the last minute after the powerful real-estate industry intervened. And, perhaps most significant, hopes for legalizing the recreational use of marijuana were dashed, though lawmakers could still approve that later in the legislative session."
551,"Still, for veteran observers of Albany, the sheer variety of issues settled since January — from infrastructure to the environment, from voting rights to transgender rights — was a relief from years of divided government, when interests of Republicans in the Senate often stood in contrast to the state’s overwhelmingly Democratic electorate."
552,"“The process seems very similar,” said Blair Horner, the executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, and a former aide to Mr. Cuomo. “But the product is obviously very different because you have a new majority in the Senate.”"
553,"Most of the deals announced on Sunday were largely made behind closed doors, and left to the 11th hour: Voting was likely to push right up to, and perhaps past, the midnight deadline."
554,"Chief among the new policies was congestion pricing, which is likely to affect the habits of anyone who works or plays in Manhattan. Under the plan, the first of its type in the nation, vehicles traveling below 60th Street will be subject to a toll, revenue that will be funneled into the city’s beleaguered subways and other regional transportation needs."
555,"The congestion pricing deal deferred many of the difficult decisions — how much to charge drivers and who will receive exemptions — to the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority and a new traffic mobility review board. Eighty percent of the revenue will be directed to the subway and bus network, and 10 percent each to the Long Island Rail Road and the Metro-North Railroad."
556,"The agreement also calls for an overhaul of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the agency that oversees New York City’s bus and subway system. Mr. Cuomo, who effectively controls the authority and who has been heavily criticized for the subway’s shoddy performance, has scapegoated the agency in recent months. As part of the budget deal, the authority’s policies will be changed to encourage speedier capital projects and to increase oversight."
557,"A wave of new progressives in the Legislature believed the issue of criminal justice reform was of critical importance, and the new budget reflected that. Under the budget legislation, the state will eliminate cash bail for most misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes, though it will not be completely eliminated, as some of the Legislature’s more liberal members — still recalling the case of Kalief Browder, who took his own life after spending three years on Rikers Island because his family could not raise $3,000 bail — had hoped it would be."
558,Lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo also agreed to a number of changes to discovery — allowing defendants more access to evidence that prosecutors intend to use against them — and processes to ensure speedy trials.
559,"The compromise on bail, which came after law enforcement officials expressed concerns about the total elimination of such a system, is one of many compromises that appear in the budget."
560,"Another saw a proposed pied-à-terre tax, an annual recurring tax on second homes that were valued at $5 million or more, eliminated. Although the tax had the backing of state leaders, it evaporated under pressure from real estate interests and legal concerns."
561,"In its place, lawmakers and Mr. Cuomo agreed to a “mansion tax” coupled with a real estate transfer tax, two one-time levies that would be charged at the point of sale on multimillion-dollar homes. The tax rate would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of properties worth $25 million or more."
562,"A plan to ban plastic bags in the state was also included in the budget, but it makes a fee on paper bags optional, which some environmentalists worry will lessen the popularity of reusable bags. New York would be the second state, after California, to ban plastic bags. (Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.)"
563,"Mr. Cuomo trumpeted several other accomplishments, including a permanent property tax cap of 2 percent, something he had said was nonnegotiable, and a new tax on “internet marketplace providers” which he anticipated would generate $320 million a year to help fund the M.T.A. The state also approved a tax on opioid pills."
564,"The budget also increases education spending by more than $1 billion. Mr. Cuomo had initially proposed a number about $50 million lower; the Legislature had requested about $600 million more. Education is consistently one of the biggest spending increases, as well as spending commitments, in the budget."
565,"Mr. Cuomo, who has been criticized for sponsoring big-money fund-raisers, also announced a commission to develop a plan to provide up to $100 million annually in public financing for campaigns for legislative and statewide offices, including his own. The commission’s recommendations, due in December, would be legally binding unless the Legislature convened specifically to overrule them."
566,A small-donor matching program was a central demand of many of the new legislators who won seats last year by defeating better-financed incumbents.
567,"Under such programs, candidates can collect government assistance for their campaigns as long as they meet certain criteria. Such programs are usually intended to encourage small contributions, and don’t offer a match for large ones."
568,"And while the inclusion of public financing in Sunday’s budget seemed like a victory for proponents, many remained unsatisfied, noting that many details, such as the ratio of matching funds and contribution limits, remained undetermined. That has led some activists to worry that the commission’s recommendations would be weak. Asked why he had chosen to form a commission rather than allowing public hearings and a legislative solution, Mr. Cuomo said that the issue was “too complicated” to be taken up by the state’s 213 elected lawmakers."
569,"Still, if New York adopts a 6-to-1 matching system modeled after New York City’s, it would become the first state in the nation to match small donors’ contributions by a ratio of more than 1 to 1, according to Lawrence Norden, deputy director of the democracy program at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice. (Hawaii matches donations 1 to 1.)"
570,"The negotiations over the budget were the first of Mr. Cuomo’s more than eight years in office in which he dealt with an entirely Democratic-controlled Legislature, and they came at a time of increased financial stress for the state, which had its income tax revenue dip sharply in recent months."
571,"Mr. Cuomo consistently railed against the 2017 federal tax overhaul and the policies of President Trump for worsening the state’s financial problems, but still increased state spending to record levels. His administration also said it would codify protections of the federal Affordable Care Act, such as insurance exchanges and protections for pre-existing conditions, into state law."
572,"During a news conference in the Capitol’s ceremonial Red Room on Sunday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo likened the trouble caused by Mr. Trump’s government to those caused by “extreme weather” and “political extremism.”"
573,"“This is a difficult time for government,” the governor said. “It’s a difficult time for New York State.”"
574,"It was also difficult, at times, in Albany, as the new Democratic majorities in the Legislature flexed their independence and power, creating significant intraparty tension with Mr. Cuomo."
575,"During negotiations, the governor and other members of his administration repeatedly accused lawmakers of having unrealistic expectations and a lack of experience, a situation that was inflamed by the loss of a giant, multibillion-dollar Amazon deal in Queens in mid-February. Tension boiled over last week when a senior aide of Mr. Cuomo verbally attacked several newly elected lawmakers after they criticized Mr. Cuomo’s fund-raising habits, calling them “idiots,” preceded by a profanity."
576,"Still, Mr. Cuomo seemed to want to glide past such unpleasantness on Sunday, saying that “all Democrats are not the same,” and thanking the legislative leaders for their hard work."
577,"Indeed, even as his exhausted aides left the room, Mr. Cuomo stopped and spoke again."
578,"“This is the best budget that has been produced,” he said, as the room cleared, “since I’ve been governor.”"

580,"Good morning,"
581,"We’re covering the long-awaited results of the special counsel’s investigation into Russian election interference, the end of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate in Syria, and an abbreviated visit to Washington by Israel’s leader."
582,"The special counsel, Robert Mueller, found no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 presidential election, according to a summary of the key findings of his nearly two-year investigation that was made public on Sunday by Attorney General William Barr."
583,"The special counsel, Mr. Barr said, stated that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him” of illegally obstructing justice. Nevertheless, Mr. Barr and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, announced that there was insufficient evidence that President Trump had committed that crime."
584,Read: Here’s the four-page summary of Mr. Mueller’s findings. Democrats have called for the release of the full report.
585,"News analysis: The end of the investigation has lifted a cloud over Mr. Trump’s presidency and fortified him for the battles to come, our chief White House correspondent writes."
586,"The Daily: On today’s episode, two of our reporters discuss the findings."
587,"Calling the special counsel’s investigation an “illegal takedown that failed,” Mr. Trump said on Sunday: “It’s a shame that our country had to go through this. To be honest, it’s a shame that your president has had to go through this.”"
588,"The White House does not yet have the full report, a spokesman said, and it was not clear when, or even if, the president would get complete access."
589,What’s next? Federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other investigations that grew out of Robert Mueller’s work. The end of his investigation also offers clarity to the Democrats who hope to beat Mr. Trump in next year’s election. 
590,"Perspective: In an Op-Ed, the lawyer who drafted the regulations under which Mr. Mueller was appointed says that the attorney general’s unilateral conclusion that Mr. Trump did not obstruct justice makes it imperative that the public see the full report."
591,"Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, is supporting two new measures as part of an effort to tackle anti-Semitic hate speech and anti-Israel language, an issue that has divided Democrats in the House."
592,"The measures will be promoted at this week’s annual meeting in Washington of the largest pro-Israel advocacy group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. "

595,"An award-winning war photographer for The Times followed a handful of female recruits as they went through basic training at Parris Island, S.C."
596,"Perspective: In an Op-Ed, a woman who spent 20 years in the Marines says that the corps still has lower expectations for female recruits."
597,"Half of humanity lives in cities, the main generators of planet-warming gases. That means the big fixes for climate change need to come from cities, too. "
598,"Copenhagen is home to 624,000 people and aims to be carbon neutral — generating more renewable energy than the dirty energy it consumes — by 2025. The Danish city’s experience shows what’s possible, and what’s difficult."
599,"ISIS “caliphate” crumbles: A four-year battle to free territory in Iraq and Syria ended over the weekend, as American-backed forces seized the last village held by the militants."
600,"A fix for Boeing: Pilots have met with company executives to discuss proposed changes to the 737 Max, two of which have crashed in recent months."
601,Anti-Brexit march: Hundreds of thousands crowded London streets on Saturday to demand a second referendum over Britain’s departure from the European Union. Parliament has twice rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal plan but is set to consider it for a third time this week.
602,"Parkland grieves again: A survivor of last year’s mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., has been found dead in an apparent suicide, the second such death in a week."
603,"Cruise ship rescue: A Viking cruise ship that set out with more than 1,300 people limped into port in Norway on Sunday after experiencing engine trouble in rough weather. Earlier, some passengers were airlifted, one by one, from the ship’s deck. "
604,"Voting in Thailand: A pro-military party was on track today to capture an unexpectedly large number of seats in the weekend’s elections, probably allowing the army, which staged a 2014 coup, a license to continue its hold on power."
605,"Snapshot: Above, an imam recited the adhan, or call for prayer, on Sunday at the Linwood Mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. The mosque, one of two where 50 people were killed this month, reopened this weekend."
606,"Apple’s next act: The tech giant is set to unveil today a news and entertainment bundle that is expected to offer access to magazines, newspapers, music and, perhaps most intriguingly, original shows and films. Netflix is one of the big players that won’t be a part of it."
607,"N.C.A.A. basketball: It’s not a year for Cinderellas. In the men’s tournament, the round of 16 will include 14 of the top seeds, which hasn’t happened since 2009. The favorites have also dominated in the women’s tournament, the second round of which concludes today. "

614,"Also, your knees are the most taxed joint of the human body. Here are some ways to keep them healthy."
615,"Last week, Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The Times, wrote about the strange disparity in New York’s subway lines, exploring why lettered lines — notably the F — performed particularly badly. We noticed that the subway system skips a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain."
616,"The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero."
617,"There once was an H train — a shuttle line in Rockaway Park, Queens — but in 1992, it was changed to an S for shuttle."
618,"The K once ran along the C line in Manhattan, but the letter was retired in 1988."
619,"Once a letter disappears from the map, that doesn’t mean it’s gone forever. The W train, between Queens and Manhattan, was axed in 2010 and then reappeared in 2016 after the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which diverted the Q train to three new stations on Manhattan’s Upper East Side."
620,"As for the Z, transit advocates held a funeral for the line amid budget cuts in 2009, but it has survived (for now)."
621,"The Times recently asked members of Generation Z, the group that was born in the years around 2000, to describe their identity. Here’s what they had to say."

626,"BERLIN — In Germany, women are paid an average of 21 percent less than men, one of Europe’s widest gender pay gaps. In Berlin next week, for one day only, the public transportation system will offer them a corresponding discount."
627,"The BVG, which runs the city’s bus, tram and subway systems and is the country’s largest public transit authority, will offer women an unlimited day pass for 5.50 euros, about $6.20, instead of the regular €7."
628,"The Frauenticket, or women’s ticket, is limited to Monday, which campaigners in Germany have designated as Equal Pay Day, and the authority is calling the promotion “Mind the Pay Gap.”"
629,"“The women’s ticket not only challenges the discriminatory wage gap in our country, but also shows that the BVG itself is doing something about it,” Sigrid Nikutta, the authority’s director, said."
630,"Despite its reputation as a socially progressive country — and its long-serving female leader — Germany has the third-widest pay gap in the European Union, according to 2017 figures from the bloc’s statistical agency. Only the Czech Republic and Estonia, both much smaller countries, did worse. (It also lags the United States, where the figure was 19.5 percent in 2017.)"
631,"Quotas for the representation of women on corporate boards became law here in 2015, but the number of women in the national Parliament has declined since then, with the arrival of a male-dominated delegation from the far-right Alternative for Germany. There are now two male lawmakers for every female one."
632,"The city state of Berlin, which is governed by a coalition of progressive and socialist parties, has been actively pushing women’s rights, and for the first time this year made March 8, International Women’s Day, an official holiday in the city."
633,"Iris Spranger, a member of the city’s House of Representatives who campaigned for that measure, is also supportive of the transportation system’s public relations exercise."
634,"“The women’s ticket is an original idea to highlight the gender pay gap,” she wrote in an email. “The lively discussion alone shows that it was a good idea.”"
635,"According to Ms. Spranger, even more important than the ticket is the fact that the BVG has had an equal-pay policy since 2003."
636,"Equal Pay Day, which in Germany this year falls on Monday, has been around since 1988. It symbolizes the extra days into the new year that German women have to work to earn the same as men."
637,"The public transport system in Berlin attracts over three million riders a day and has rails spanning almost 300 miles. Its yellow subway cars have become symbols for the city, as have its cheeky ads."
638,"In one of its online ads for the women’s ticket campaign, the BVG says: “Gender-specific wage gap. Sounds stupid. Is stupid. We’ll close it.”"
639,"Men found using the special tickets, the authority said, would be treated like regular fare evaders and charged €60."
640,But in a city where day passes are largely purchased by tourists — regular riders tend to buy monthly tickets — few men seemed to be taking offense at the idea.
641,"“With the campaign, we also call on women to apply for jobs with us,” said Ms. Nikutta, the first woman to run the BVG and the first leader to make it profitable."
642,To the Editor:
643,"Re “New York Plan to Unjam Roads Opens a Path for Clogged Peers” (front page, April 2):"
644,"The population density of New York City creates the ideal conditions for a car-free zone. Residents can commute by subway and borrow cars for longer trips from shared lots, and defunct light-rail systems (trolleys) could be reinstated. The California Tomorrow Plan, published in the 1970s, lays out clear plans for going car-free."
645,"Lest we think that this change would require too large an investment in infrastructure, consider the changes wrought when cities from New York to Portland, Ore., paved over existing light rail lines (a change facilitated by carmakers)."
646,"Madrid just announced that it will go car-free in its city center, and Oslo has committed to ban cars from the city entirely by the end of this year. When a third of Paris went car-free for a day, air and noise pollution was significantly reduced. In America, Minnesotans are eyeing Norway as a potential model."
647,"As Wallace Stegner wrote of the California Tomorrow Plan in 1972, “The aim was nothing less than a plan for the good life within a growing and continuingly industrial state, without the depletion, pollution and deterioration in life-quality that uncontrolled growth has brought.” "

649,"When Hannah Ryles was a junior at a Tokyo high school in 2008, she was determined to attend David Lee’s junior prom."
650,"“I loved him,” Ms. Ryles said, “and nothing was going to stop me from being with him that night.”"
651,"Her father, Richard Ryles, a retired colonel in the United States Army, already knew that neither force nor negotiation would get his 17-year-old daughter to retreat from the idea of seeing Mr. Lee, a former classmate who was also 17."
652,"“There was no talking to Hannah when it came to David,” Mr. Ryles said. “She had already proved to us that she would move heaven and earth to see him, so we let her go.”"
653,"Though Ms. Ryles left heaven and earth intact, she did cross the Sea of Japan — roughly three hours by plane — to attend Mr. Lee’s junior prom, which was held in Shanghai."
654,"Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee had met as classmates at the American School in Japan, an international private day school in Chōfu, Tokyo."
655,"Over the course of a decade, Hannah Ryles and David Lee traveled more than 100,000 miles to maintain their relationship. Here are the routes they took to be together."

736,"“She was the new kid in school and I had a crush on her,” said Mr. Lee, recalling the start of eighth grade in September 2004. “She was so beautiful that I just couldn’t muster the courage to approach her and start a conversation.”"
737,"She also liked what she saw, hairdo aside. “He was this tall, lanky kid who wore nerdy glasses, and had this ridiculous bowl haircut,” Ms. Ryles said. “But he also had this remarkable confidence about him, which I observed in the second semester that year, when we ended up sitting at the same table in Japanese class.”"
738,"Ms. Ryles, the daughter of Melissa and Mr. Ryles, a career Army man, had moved with her parents to Japan from St. Louis in 1999. They lived on two military bases, Sagami Depot and Camp Zama, each two hours from Tokyo."
739,"Five years later, her family moved to the suburbs of Tokyo, in Setagaya, as Mr. Ryles was transferred to the nearby Hardy Barracks in Akasaka."
740,"Mr. Lee, the son of Jin Lee and Yu-Ching Lee, had enrolled at the American School the previous year. His mother, an information technology specialist with the United States Foreign Service, left Davis, Calif., with her family and traveled to Akasaka, as she was assigned to the American Embassy there. Her family was housed on its residential compound."
741,"Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee briefly dated other classmates, but eventually began waiting out each other’s relationship as they held a huge, not-so-secret crush on one another."
742,"Ms. Ryles’s was the first to break up, and a few days later, when Mr. Lee told her that his relationship had also ended, Ms. Ryles literally pounced on him. “I just kind of jumped on him and gave him this giant hug,” she said. “One half of that hug was meant for being sympathetic, but the other half was meant for celebration.”"
743,"They continued as friends before they began dating in April 2005, and soon after, “our mutual crush quickly blossomed into full-blown teenage puppy love,” Ms. Ryles said."
744,"They shared a first kiss at the ticket booth inside the Tameike-Sannō subway station, neither realizing that their young love was about to be thrown off course."
745,"By late summer, 2005, Mr. Lee’s mother had accepted a two-year assignment from the State Department that would take the family to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. At around the same time, his father accepted a job in Shijiazhuang, China, working as the chief executive of a Chinese-Indian joint-venture pharmaceutical company and commuting from Kuala Lumpur."
746,"“We were both very upset, but despite the geographical distance that was about to come between us, we weren’t going to let each other go without a fight,” Ms. Ryles said."
747,"They made a pact to keep in touch, and did that through hourslong Skype sessions, phone calls and emails."
748,"“I kept telling David that Hannah lived too far away,” said Mr. Lee’s mother, Jin Lee. “He would look so sad on occasion because he missed her, and I would say, ‘David, there are so many girls out there, why are you doing this to yourself.’”"
749,"But Mr. Lee would have none of it, and in the winter of 2005, he returned to Tokyo for a week to visit Ms. Ryles and other friends he had missed since his departure."
750,"The following spring, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee convinced their respective families to vacation in Thailand, both conveniently forgetting to explain the reason."
751,"“As soon as we arrived Hannah says to me, “Oh, by the way mom, David Lee and his family are here as well,” recalled Ms. Ryles’s mother, Melissa Ryles. “It was unbelievable.”"
752,"The two family vacations overlapped by a single day, so the former classmates made a plan to introduce their parents once they arrived in Bangkok, then sped off to spend their precious time alone."
753,"When Mr. Lee’s parents saw that Ms. Ryles had dyed her hair red and was sporting large hoop earrings, they sent Mr. Lee’s younger brother, Jamie, to spy on them. “I guess I wasn’t a very effective spy,” Jamie Lee said, “because all I was able to report to my parents was that Hannah and David seemed to be having the greatest time.”"
754,"Ultimately, the stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship while not knowing when they might see each other again took a toll, and Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, both 15, reluctantly agreed to start seeing other people. “I was heartbroken,” Ms. Ryles said. “That’s not what I wanted.”"
755,"In the summer of 2006, Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo but chose not to see Ms. Ryles, because the thought of seeing her with another boy was too much to bear. He decided to call her from the airport, just before boarding a flight back to Kuala Lumpur."
756,"Ms. Ryles was heartbroken again. “I felt as if he had stood me up,” she said."
757,"Though their pact had come unglued, neither could stay angry, or apart from each other for very long."
758,"In January 2007, they patched up their friendship via social media and by February were professing their unwavering love for each other."
759,"In April that year, Ms. Ryles, then 16, convinced her parents to allow her to visit Mr. Lee in Kuala Lumpur, where they committed to a long-distance relationship."
760,"That summer, Mr. Lee began living with his father in Shanghai — making that decision after his mother decided to take a new assignment in Bangkok — and adding another international stop on a dizzying romantic journey that “mile for mile, began proving how truly committed Hannah and David were to each other,” Mr. Ryles said."
761,"Indeed, Mr. Lee and Ms. Ryles continued to pursue each other aggressively. In 2008 Mr. Lee returned to Tokyo for a visit, and this time, the teenagers spent the better part of a week together, catching up on their lives while exploring the city."
762,"That spring, Mr. Lee visited Ms. Ryles once more in Tokyo, and she returned the favor by “sneaking out” to his senior prom in Shanghai. This meant crossing the Sea of Japan once more, this time without telling her family."
763,"“I told my parents I was going hiking with a friend in the mountains of Japan for three days,” said Ms. Ryles, who played hooky from school one morning to get a visa for her excursion, and paid for round-trip airline tickets with money she had earned as a babysitter and as a school-bus monitor."
764,"“I also told my parents that we would have no cellphone reception, so don’t bother trying to call us,” she said."
765,"They continued to creatively scheme and boldly plot new ways to continue to see each other. But no scheme was as creative and no plot as bold as the one they would hatch that summer, when they both enrolled in a summer volunteer program to teach English to elementary school students in Ayutthaya, Thailand."
766,"By now, each was 18 and a high school senior."
767,"They received approval from their parents, who did not know that their children were going together."
768,"“David’s parents were very liberal, while my parents were much more conservative, which is why I always had to make up stories to go places,” Ms. Ryles said. “My parents always trusted me, and though they might not have known I was sneaking out, it was always with David, I never took advantage of their trust for any other reason.”"
769,"For Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee, the experience offered a first taste of living together for three months in a house in rural Thailand they shared with a high school teacher from Texas, a French university student, and several others."
770,"One month after they returned from Thailand, Ms. Ryles visited Mr. Lee in China once more, and in the spring of 2009, they continued to rack up frequent flier miles as Mr. Lee managed to find a way to escort Ms. Ryles to her senior prom in Tokyo."
771,"After high school graduation, they decided to go to nearby colleges in the United States. Ms. Ryles went to Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, where she studied psychology, and Mr. Lee to Haverford College, less than a mile away, where he studied chemistry."
772,"They spent one semester of their junior year studying abroad together at the University of Melbourne, in Australia, then went on to Sydney, then New Zealand and on to the Great Barrier Reef before returning to their respective colleges, from which they each graduated in 2013."
773,"For the next two years, they lived together in Philadelphia, working as technicians in cancer research laboratories. Life was beautiful, but not quite as easy beneath a roof that did not include their parents."
774,"“We would come home from work smelling like mice from working in mouse research laboratories all day,” Ms. Ryles said. “Our apartment also had no working heat.”"
775,"She took on a second job as a waitress at an Italian restaurant, working nights and weekends to help pay bills."
776,"Both applied to medical school at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, where they were accepted."
777,"But before medical school began in 2015, Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee made yet another international voyage, a sentimental trip back to China and Japan, where they revisited the Tameike-Sannō subway station in Tokyo to recreate their first kiss."
778,"The next year, Mr. Lee proposed to Ms. Ryles in John F. Collins Park across from where they now live in Philadelphia in front of close friends and family. Mr. Lee’s parents and his younger brother, Jamie, as well as Ms. Ryles’s sister and brother-in-law, Elizabeth and Scott Downie, were all there to witness the moment. Afterward, everyone sat around a photo album that Ms. Ryles had been putting together since the day she met Mr. Lee, flipping through pages filled with pictures of their days in middle school, high school and college, and many other images from across a decade filled with more than 100,000 miles worth of sacrifice, commitment and dedication."
779,"“It’s like no other fairy tale I have ever heard of,” Mr. Lee’s father, Yu-Ching Lee, said."
780,"In May, Ms. Ryles will graduate from medical school and begin applying for obstetrician/gynecological residency programs, while Mr. Lee completes his Ph.D. in genomics and computational biology at the University of Pennsylvania."
781,"“Every day when I see Hannah’s beautiful face,” Mr. Lee said, “I’m reminded that life is an exciting, happy, sad, inspiring, scary, wonderful, beautiful adventure.”"
782,"Their adventure continued on Feb. 2 in Philadelphia, where Ms. Ryles and Mr. Lee were married in a self-uniting ceremony at Union Trust, an events space where the reception was also held."
783,"Ms. Ryles’s father presided over the ceremony, which included 112 guests, among them the bride’s paternal grandmother, Tomiko Fujiwara, 83, and her great-aunt in-law, Tamae Onodera, 76. Both women served as flower girls, each toting a basket filled with white rose petals that they scattered down the aisle ahead of the bride’s grand entrance."
784,"The bride, immaculate in a lace and ivory Mikado Lazaro dress, began to cry midway through her vows when she said to her new husband, “We’ve grown up together, navigated through stages in our lives together, and grown together into the people we are today.”"
785,"The groom, suave in a black tuxedo and a slick hairdo returned a bit of sentiment to his new wife. “Before I knew myself, I knew that I wanted to spend as much time with you as I possibly could, I couldn’t get enough of you,” he said. ""You have turned out to be perfect for me in ways that I couldn’t even imagine, and continue to discover every single day.”"

787,Good morning. 
788,"The special counsel found no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, Brexit remains a mess and Boeing may have rushed to finish its 737 Max 8. Here’s the latest: "
789,"The investigation led by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, found no evidence that President Trump or any of his aides conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. "
790,"The long-awaited report stopped short of exonerating the president of obstructing justice, according to the summary of findings made public by Attorney General William Barr on Sunday. "
791,"Obstruction of justice: Mr. Barr concluded that Mr. Mueller’s report, which he reviewed over the weekend, did not present sufficient evidence of a crime. "
792,"Analysis: Although Mr. Trump claimed that Mr. Mueller’s findings were “a complete and total exoneration,” Mr. Mueller explicitly said they were not. Still, a cloud had been lifted, wrote our reporter."
793,"What’s next? Democrats are demanding the full report, and they are conducting several investigations. Federal and state prosecutors are pursuing a dozen other inquiries that grew out of Mr. Mueller’s work."
794,"In the wake of a Brexit extension, hundreds of thousands of protesters overtook the streets of London this weekend, calling on lawmakers to break the political stalemate and hold a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U."
795,"The march reflected growing popular frustration over the gridlock, but few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote."
796,"What’s next? The E.U. gave British Parliament until April 12 to decide how to proceed. If lawmakers approve Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan by then, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22."
797,"If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a delay of up to two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed these options, too."
798,"Today, lawmakers will vote on amendments to the plan. "
799,How we got here: Britons who once simply wanted a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. are now willing to accept a no-deal Brexit.
800,"In order for Boeing to clinch a deal with American Airlines — and to keep the airline from ordering hundreds of planes from Boeing’s rival, Airbus — the aircraft manufacturer knew it would need to update its workhorse 737 Max 8 within six years."
801,"That competitive pressure to build the 737 Max 8 now threatens Boeing’s reputation and profits, after two deadly crashes of the jet in less than five months."
802,"The pace of the work on the 737 Max was frenetic, according to current and former employees who spoke with The Times. Prosecutors are investigating whether Boeing rushed, missed crucial safety risks or underplayed the need for pilot training."
803,"Inside Boeing: Engineers were pushed to submit technical drawings at roughly double the normal pace, and managers quickly pulled workers from other departments when someone left the Max project. "
804,"Over the weekend: About a dozen pilots and trainers from American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, as well as from two non-U.S. airlines, Copa Airlines and Fly Dubai, met with Boeing executives to discuss proposed changes to the 737 Max. Many of the pilots simulated flights under conditions similar to those believed to have brought down the two planes, and they were able to land safely. "
805,"President Xi Jinping of China visited Monaco and France this weekend as European leaders grappled with how to engage with China and benefit from its trade, while setting limits on its appetite for greater influence. "
806,"A divided front: Italy defied allies and became the first Group of 7 nation to sign on to China’s Belt and Road initiative on Saturday.  President Emmanuel Macron of France opposed the move, and he, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and representatives of the E.U. are expected to present a united front to Mr. Xi this week against what they consider China’s aggressive expansion into the continent. "
807,The memorandum of understanding that was formalized on Saturday provides a framework agreement for billions of euros in business deals between Italian and Chinese-state-backed companies. 
808,"Belt and Road: The project is an attempt by China to expand its influence and economic interests around the world, building out its global infrastructure. "
809,Algeria: Protesters are demanding the ouster of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika and his entire system — and demonstrations are growing larger and larger. 
810,"France: Thousands of police officers fanned out across Paris and other cities as “Yellow Vest” protests entered their 19th weekend. Though sporadic clashes erupted late in the day, violence dropped as protesters marched peacefully in the capital. "
811,"Norway: A cruise ship stranded off the country’s coast finally reached shore, a welcome sight for hundreds of passengers who had not been evacuated in a harrowing rescue operation. They arrived bruised and battered, hurt by falling objects and shattered glass on the rocking ship."
812,"Syria: The last bastion of the Islamic State’s caliphate fell to American-backed forces on Saturday after a four-year battle. It was a blow to the terrorist group, which once controlled land in the region the size of Britain, but ISIS remains a serious threat."
813,"The Netherlands: The primary suspect in a shooting aboard a Dutch tram that left three dead and five wounded confessed to the crime on Friday, prosecutors said. "
814,"North Korea: The country’s state media escalated calls for South Korea to distance itself from the U.S., as the U.S. sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North."
815,"Cambodia: Top E.U. officials visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to consider revoking a special trade deal because of the country’s deteriorating human rights record."
816,"Russia: A marathon across the frozen surface of Lake Baikal in Siberia attracts runners both for its exotic, ethereal beauty and the unpredictable, grueling conditions. “Baikal prepares new surprises,” said the founder of the race. “That makes it more interesting.”"
817,"Class divide: Human contact has become a luxury good. Tech-free private schools are booming, and things like quitting social networks have become a status symbol. “The richer you are,” writes our tech reporter, “the more you spend to be offscreen.”"
818,Tips for a more fulfilling life.
819,"Recipe of the day: You can always toss roasted broccoli with something delicious, like a Thai-style vinaigrette. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)"
820,Passion can be a gift or a curse. We have guidance on avoiding obsession as you pursue your most profound interests.
821,Knees are the body’s most taxed joint. Here are some ways to keep from injuring them.
822,"Last week, Emma Fitzsimmons, a transit reporter for The Times, wrote about the strange disparity in New York City’s subway lines, exploring why lettered lines — notably the F — performed particularly badly. We noticed that the subway system skips only a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain."
823,"The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero."
824,"There once was an H train — a shuttle line in Rockaway Park, Queens — but in 1992 it was changed to an S for shuttle."
825,"The K once ran along the C line in Manhattan, but the letter was retired in 1988."
826,"Once a letter disappears from the map, that doesn’t mean it is gone forever. The W train, between Queens and Manhattan, was axed in 2010 and then reappeared in 2016 as part of new service after the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which diverted the Q train to three new stations on Manhattan’s Upper East Side."
827,"As for the Z, transit advocates held a funeral for the line amid budget cuts in 2009, but it has survived after all (for now)."

833,Good morning.
834,"Congress finds out what’s in the Mueller report, Thailand’s military appears to have won elections and Brexit continues to confound a nation. Here’s the latest:"
835,Attorney General William Barr sent lawmakers a summary of the special counsel’s highly anticipated report on Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. The key findings will be made public later today.
836,"This much is clear: The Mueller report established no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but left it to Mr. Barr to determine whether President Trump's actions constituted obstruction of justice. Mr. Barr found that they did not."
837,"Our Washington Bureau is assessing the summary in greater detail now, and we’ll be updating the news story linked above and our live briefing."
838,"Impact: The report’s delivery “marked a turning point that will shape the remainder of Mr. Trump’s presidency and test the viability of American governance,” our chief White House correspondent writes."
839,"Other investigations: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued no further indictments but federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other inquiries that grew out of his work, meaning President Trump hasn’t yet emerged from a looming legal threat."
840,"Hundreds of thousands of protesters took over the streets of Central London on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to break the political stalemate and hold a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U."
841,"Few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote, however, so the march’s main impact may be as a reflection of growing popular frustration over the gridlock."
842,"What’s next? Officials in the E.U. gave the British Parliament until April 12 to decide what it wants to do, so Brexit will not take effect on March 29, the date set two years ago."
843,"On the table is Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan. If lawmakers approve it by the E.U. deadline, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22."
844,"If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a longer delay of possibly two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed all of these options, too."
845,"Today: Lawmakers are to vote on proposed amendments to Mrs. May’s plan, including one that would allow for a rapid-fire round of voting on alternatives."
846,"Analysis: Ellen Barry, our London correspondent, looks at how some Brexit supporters have shifted from the original goal of a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. to willingness to walk away from the bloc with no deal at all."
847,"A military-linked party seemed to have emerged as the winner of parliamentary elections, the country’s first vote since a coup in 2014."
848,"With about 90 percent of the ballots counted as of Sunday, Palang Pracharat, the military’s proxy party, had 7.5 million votes, the Election Commission said. Pheu Thai, the populist party toppled in the coup, had been widely expected to finish first, but was second with seven million votes."
849,"The remaining votes will be counted today, but it appears to be the first electoral failure since 2001 of a party aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, the polarizing former prime minister."
850,"Concerns: More than 5 percent of the ballots were invalidated, raising questions about the integrity of the results. And turnout was 66 percent, lower than the expected 80 percent."
851,"Democracy activists say the new military-backed Constitution worked in favor of the country’s armed forces, which has orchestrated more than a dozen successful coups over the years. Electoral rules blunted the power of some blocs, and the threat of jail time hung over leaders of anti-junta parties."
852,"The voting was for the lower house. The new Constitution gives the military the power to appoint all 250 members of the Senate, so its power in Parliament will be overwhelming."
853,A four-year military operation to push the terrorist group from Iraq and Syria ended on Saturday when American-backed forces took back the last speck of land in the region controlled by the group.
854,"The end of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, which at its peak was the size of Britain, is a major blow to the group. The group continues to exist, however, as a diffuse insurgency from Afghanistan to the Philippines, and experts say it is more powerful today than it was in 2011, enriched by years of collecting taxes in Iraq and Syria and returning to the guerrilla tactics it used in the past."
855,"By the numbers: The group has tens of thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria as well as followers around the world. Since last summer, it carried out at least 250 attacks in Syria. ISIS followers have carried out attacks in at least 25 countries since 2017."
856,"Recruiting: A modern, educated couple in the Philippines became key recruiters for the Islamic State, calling on followers to wage jihad in Muslim parts of the archipelago."
857,"On the ground: Hours after a U.S.-backed militia announced victory over the Islamic State in Syria, a local driver working with a team of journalists from NBC News was killed in an explosion in the area. It was not immediately clear whether the group had been targeted, or whether previously unexploded ordnance from heavy militia bombing might have been involved."
858,"Boeing: An investigation by The Times looks into how the aircraft manufacturer rushed to develop the 737 Max 8 to keep American Airlines from ordering hundreds of planes from its rival, Airbus, and how the frenetic pace played out for engineers and construction teams."
859,"New Zealand: The country banned the so-called manifesto of the man suspected in the Christchurch massacre, making it a crime to possess or distribute the content in an attempt to limit the spread of hateful ideas and foil his desire for notoriety."
860,"China-E.U. relations: President Xi Jinping secured Italy’s cooperation with his Belt and Road initiative and then headed to France to meet with European leaders, some of whom fear widening internal divisions over China’s increasing reach."
861,"Cambodia: Top E.U. officials visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to consider revoking a special trading deal because of the country’s deteriorating human rights record."
862,"North Korea: The country’s state media escalated calls for South Korea to distance itself from the U.S., as the U.S. sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North."
863,"Norway: A cruise ship stranded for nearly 24 hours by rough weather and engine trouble finally headed to shore, after about a third of the 1,300 people aboard were airlifted, one by one, to safety."
864,"Coming this week: Apple will unveil its video streaming service on Monday, and Lyft — Uber’s main rival in North America — will make its debut on the stock market on Friday in what could be the tech world’s biggest initial public offering since 2014."
865,"Russia: A marathon across the frozen surface of Lake Baikal in Siberia was a precarious endeavor through unpredictable and grueling conditions. “Baikal prepares new surprises,” said the founder of the race. “That makes it more interesting.”"
866,"Perspective: Calling Asian women “adorable,” “cute” or “beautiful” in professional settings is a form of racism that “dresses up its violence in praise,” the author R.O. Kwon argues in an Op-Ed."
867,Tips for a more fulfilling life.

881,"There is a lot to like in New York State’s $175 billion budget. Democrats, in commanding control of the Legislature for the first time in a half-century, agreed on Sunday on sweeping changes that had been blocked for years when Republicans ran the State Senate."
882,"New York City will become the first city in the country with congestion pricing, securing crucial funding for the subways in a long-delayed victory for mass transit over the automobile."
883,"Bail and pretrial detention will be eliminated for a vast majority of misdemeanors and nonviolent felonies, and prosecutors will have to turn over far more of their case files to defense lawyers before trial."
884,"Single-use plastic bags will be banned, putting New York in line with California and environmentally conscious cities and counties that have long had this common-sense measure. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislators killed New York City’s effort to ban the bags in 2017."
885,"One thing that hasn’t changed is the way the state budget is completed: behind closed doors, in the middle of the night, with the governor and legislative leaders slipping in all manner of surprises and pork."
886,"Chief among the victims of Albany deal-making this year was public financing of election campaigns, which would give candidates matching funds to make it easier for challengers to run and to empower small donors."
887,"Facing opposition from many Assembly members, legislative leaders and Mr. Cuomo punted, creating a new commission to fashion a plan instead. The budget requires the state to establish the public financing system but leaves critically important details to the commission, which will be made up of nine members appointed by Mr. Cuomo and senior lawmakers. It is to issue recommendations for the new system by Dec. 1. Those proposals will go into effect Dec. 22 unless a law is enacted before that date to block the plan."
888,"The commission could succeed — but only if Mr. Cuomo; Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader; and Carl Heastie, the Assembly speaker, move swiftly to appoint independent and knowledgeable people to the panel."
889,"To make the system useful for first-time candidates, it will also have to offer a substantial match for small-donor contributions. New York City’s public financing system, for example, offers a candidate $8 for every dollar raised."
890,Other provisions touted as major victories came with asterisks.
891,"The congestion pricing agreement, under which cars will pay tolls for entering the busiest part of Manhattan, directs 80 percent of the revenue raised to the subways, where it is most needed. But the plan left unclear how much sway New York City, as opposed to Albany, will have over how the program is run."
892,"The budget includes a $1 billion increase in education funding — but advocates said state leaders yet again failed to address the inequity in funding to New York City districts, the subject of a 20-year-plus court battle."
893,"Legislators approved a transfer tax on the sale of homes worth more than $2 million, with a sliding scale up to 4.15 percent for homes worth $25 million or more. The legislators agreed on the tax after scrapping what would have been a more lucrative, annual tax on thousands of those properties, known as the pied-à-terre tax, after an intense campaign from the real estate industry."
894,"In an eyebrow-raising move, Mr. Cuomo gutted the independence of the Public Authorities Control Board — the body that had the ability to reject the deal for Amazon to build a major complex in Queens — by allowing the governor to remove any board members he decides have acted beyond their powers. "
895,"Still, despite the messy way the budget was passed, it came with real gains."
896,"Public defenders, for instance, say that its criminal justice reforms will keep tens of thousands of people who are charged with nonviolent crimes from languishing in jail before they get a trial. The reforms were inspired in large part by cases like that of Kalief Browder, who spent three years at the city jail in Rikers Island without trial for allegedly stealing a backpack. The charges were eventually dismissed. Two years later, Mr. Browder committed suicide."
897,"Justine Olderman, executive director of the Bronx Defenders, a legal aid group, said the reforms enacted by Albany were the most promising she had seen in a 20-year career and could turn the state into a leader in criminal justice. "
898,"“It’s historic,” she said. “It’s like Christmas.”"

902,"It’s Thursday. The actor Ben Stiller rode the subway yesterday. Apparently, it was a big deal."
903,"Weather: The day will start bright and crisp, and will reach a high near 60. Tomorrow, cooler, with a good chance of rain."
904,Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday).
905,"My first journalism job was at the Queens Tribune, a local weekly newspaper. My second was at The New York Press, an alt-weekly that competed with The Village Voice. My third was at The New York Sun, a plucky daily broadsheet."
906,"The Sun closed in 2008, The Press in 2011 and The Voice in 2018. (The Tribune has not been online since late 2018.)"
907,New York City used to be awash in newspapers.
908,"At one point, there were at least seven dailies, including The Herald Tribune (closed in 1966) and New York Newsday (closed in 1995)."
909,"The internet was supposed to help news outlets find audiences, but sustainable business models remain elusive. The websites Gothamist and DNA Info were shuttered in 2017 after their staffs voted to unionize. (Gothamist later resurfaced at WNYC.)"
910,The Daily News  laid off half its staff last year.
911,It can feel like daunting times for the local news business.
912,Now comes The City. It’s a new nonprofit newsroom whose website debuted yesterday.
913,"The founding editor in chief is Jere Hester, a former Daily News editor. Its chairman is Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News."
914,“Reporting for New Yorkers” is The City’s slogan. (“Reporting to you” is BuzzFeed News’s slogan.) The City’s logo is a pigeon. Its ethos is unapologetically local.
915,The site is funded by philanthropies and foundations. Soon it expects to add revenue from live events and readers.
916,The results?
917,"An article about the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, spending $250,000 on travel and lodging over five years, far more than other local district attorneys."
918,A piece on a little-noticed deal struck by Mayor de Blasio that may lead taxpayers to pay more than $300 million for a fleet of ferry boats.
919,"And a story about a fatal construction accident in Brooklyn last year, and the penalties imposed on a subcontractor, with the headline “The Price of a Laborer’s Life: A $63,647 Fine.”"
920,"To help grab attention, The City’s first newsletter was written as an open (and friendly) letter to Mr. de Blasio, urging him to look into the ferry deal."
921,"“We want people to know that we’re here to do the kind of stories that reflect the concerns of New Yorkers, and are designed to hold decision makers accountable,” Mr. Hester said in an interview."
922,"“We’re here to fill some of the gaps that have been lost as local coverage has diminished,” he added. “We’re not looking to replace any other news outlet that’s out there.”"
923,"I’ve spoken to Mr. Hester previously about The City, and, in 2005, I interned for Mr. Smith. I’ll be rooting for their success, because we all benefit from a healthy news landscape."
924,"I’m not the only one who is glad to see The City. “This is great for local news and great for New York City,” Clifford Levy, The Times’s Metro editor, wrote on Twitter."

941,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
942,"In a city like New York, where cars crawl along congested streets and subways lollygag on old tracks, a “walk to work day” can sound ideal."
943,"Tomorrow, it’s official: National Walk to Work Day is April 5."
944,"The day is meant to encourage people to get a little more exercise. If helps make buses or trains less crowded, even better."
945,"According to a 2007 study, New Yorkers are among the fastest walkers in the world. On average, it takes only 12 seconds for New Yorkers to walk 60 feet; that’s about 3.4 miles per hour, and slightly faster than sitting on the M42 bus. According to a recent report, the M42 has an average speed of just 3.2 m.p.h. It’s the slowest bus in the city."
946,"And for those who could benefit from a reminder on how to walk in New York, The Times’s Steve Duenes wrote a poem for The New York Times Magazine in 2015. It’s appropriately called “How to Walk in New York.”"

952,"Born and raised in Queens, I brought my young family from California to New York to visit."
953,"When it was time to return, we got a cab to take us to the airport. It was warm out, so my 4-year-old was standing up in front of me, leaning on the cab door and looking out the open window."
954,"At one point, the cab picked up speed as it turned left off a southbound avenue onto a crosstown street."
955,The cabby said another cab seemed to be following us. He said the driver of the other cab was waving in our direction and had an angry look on his face.
956,"Our cab continued on, swerving in and out of lanes in an effort to stay ahead of the other cab. We were perplexed and somewhat nervous. Had we annoyed the driver of the other cab in some way?"
957,"After several blocks, we thought we were clear of the other cab, when suddenly it was right alongside us."
958,"The driver reached out his open window, grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it shut."
959,"“I saw the door wasn’t shut and your son was leaning on it,” he said. “I didn’t want him falling out.”"
960,And then he was gone.

965,"The road to the nation’s first tax on superluxury second homes may well have begun at 220 Central Park South, where a four-story, 24,000 square-foot penthouse, unfinished and unfurnished, recently sold for $238 million."
966,"That deal — the most expensive residential sale in United States history — seemingly set the stage for New York’s sudden embrace of a so-called pied-à-terre tax, a potential windfall for the city’s subway system and a small, subtle victory for those who believe Manhattan has become an unfettered playground for the rich."
967,"If the measure is passed and signed into law, New York would join cosmopolitan hubs like Paris, Singapore and Vancouver, which already charge fees on secondary or part-time homes. It would also be a prime example of how headlines and hard times can sometimes intersect with a political moment, giving an outre idea a chance to become policy."
968,"“When over six million New Yorkers are dealing with a crumbling and dysfunctional subway and the crisis in public housing, to see this opulence in the sky by someone who doesn’t even live here, struck a chord,” the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, said."
969,"The tax seems to be riding on a unique crest and confluence of several factors, including shaky tax revenue, uncertainty over the prospects for legal marijuana, and a general anti-rich, anti-corporate mood exemplified by the recent collapse of the Amazon deal in Queens."
970,"The outlook for the tax is good: Both houses of the State Legislature and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo support the proposal. Under the proposal, owners of second homes worth more than $5 million would be subject to a sliding tax surcharge and fees; homes that are valued more will incur higher fees and taxes."
971,"The financial impact could be significant. New York City has about 75,000 pieds-à-terre, according to a city estimate in 2017. Of those, about 5,400 residences were sold for $5 million or more, the threshold where the proposed pied-à-terre tax would begin to kick in."
972,"Mr. Cuomo estimated on Monday that the state could raise $9 billion in bonds off that revenue that would help fund repairs for the city’s troubled subway system. But the philosophical and psychological impact might be even more profound, offering a concrete, almost classist, rebuke to ultra-wealthy apartment buyers who sojourn in the city, enjoying its services and amenities, but often pay few taxes."
973,"“There’s a growing realization with Billionaires’ Row, and the super-talls, that a lot of these homes are vacant and viewed as sky-high security deposit boxes for very wealthy foreigners,” said State Senator Brad Hoylman, the Manhattan Democrat who has sponsored the tax legislation for several years. And, he said, “because of our system of laws, because of our fire and police, because we are a secure financial investment, they should be charged for that.”"
974,"The speed with which the pied-à-terre tax has become politically popular is also remarkable: The idea was floated by a liberal think tank and lawmakers in New York in 2014, but had repeatedly been shunted to death in committee by Republicans leading Albany’s upper chamber, and quietly ignored by Democrats leading the Assembly."
975,"The blue wave of November, however, changed the balance of power in Albany, with Democrats taking both houses of the Legislature, and unleashing a phalanx of progressives on the capital, part of a left-wing movement bent on correcting income inequality and pushing for higher taxes on the rich."
976,"Liberal supporters of the tax had long pointed to a range of problems associated with pieds-à-terre, including encouraging real-estate speculation, inflating property values and associated taxes and speeding up gentrification in once-affordable neighborhoods."
977,"Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat who carries the bill in that chamber, said longtime residents “are finding it hard to stay.”"
978,"“They made districts and parts of New York very livable and very attractive,” she said. “And they are driven out by people that don’t even want to live here.”"
979,"The bill’s sudden political momentum blindsided real estate executives, who fear the tax could irreparably damage the city’s high-end market, which is already experiencing a downturn."
980,"Jonathan J. Miller, chief executive of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel, said the market for high-end co-op and condo purchases has steadily declined since 2016, according to data provided by his firm. In 2016, 1,087 units sold for more than $5 million but less than $25 million. In 2017, the number dropped slightly to 1,075 units and decreased further to 849 units in 2018."
981,"John H. Banks, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful trade group, said that “nobody has done any analytics as to the impact on the broader economy” as well as the local real-estate market."
982,"“We are very concerned it’s going to have a huge chilling effect on high-end co-ops and condos,” Mr. Banks said in an interview on Tuesday, adding that he’d been taking calls from concerned members all week."
983,"“Five million dollars sounds like a lot; you can buy the biggest house in Montana,” said Dolly Lenz, chief executive of Dolly Lenz Real Estate and former vice chairwoman of Douglas Elliman Real Estate. “In New York, $5 million buys a two bedroom in Hudson Yards.”"
984,Ms. Lenz said she now spends more time in Florida looking at developments since many of her high-end clients are planning to move.
985,"“So many people have told me they are planning to transition to Naples, Miami or Palm Beach,” she said. “It may not be today, but soon.”"
986,"Others, including Governor Cuomo, disagree that the tax would scare away potential homeowners."
987,"“If they have money to buy a $5 million apartment, which is not their prime residence, and it’s their little Manhattan getaway, they can afford the tax,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview on Tuesday. “We need to fund the M.T.A.”"
988,"Indeed, with the state facing a shortfall in income-tax receipts, the pied-à-terre tax has become an attractive option, especially as other possibilities — marijuana legalization and congestion pricing — may stall."
989,"The real issue is that New York City needs to fix its property tax system, said Martha E. Stark, a professor at New York University’s Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service, and the city’s former finance commissioner."
990,"Under the city’s antiquated property tax system, co-ops and condos are not taxed at their true market value, but on the income generated by similar rental buildings."
991,"The $238 million apartment, purchased by the Chicago-based hedge fund billionaire Kenneth C. Griffin, is currently valued at $9.4 million, according to the Department of Finance. That comes out to less than 4 percent of the sales price. A property valued at that amount would pay approximately $516,000 in taxes per year, Ms. Stark said."
992,"If the property were taxed at the same rate as some single-family homes in Queens or Staten Island, the penthouse would produce around $2.4 million in property taxes."
993,A plan to revise the city’s property tax system is being studied by a tax reform commission.
994,"For early-adopters of such taxes, the increasing interest and new legislative traction has been satisfying. “It’s like a fine wine,” said Ron Deutsch, executive director of Fiscal Policy Institute, the left-leaning think tank which offered a white paper on the idea in 2014. “Sometimes it takes a little time.”"

996,It’s Wednesday. 🎤The singer Mariah Carey of Long Island is 49 today.
997,"Weather: Today is sunny, but the wind chill may make it feel as if it’s in the mid-20s or mid-30s. Thursday may be in the 50s. Friday may be in the 60s."
998,Alternate-side parking: In effect until April 18 (Holy Thursday).
999,"New York is poised to put in place the country’s first congestion pricing plan, which would charge drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan."
1000,"Many supporters and critics rely on neat, simple talking points when debating the proposal, which would help pay for repairs to the city’s subway system."
1001,[Here’s what else you need to know about congestion pricing.] 
1002,"So we spoke to two state lawmakers with more nuanced views: Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Long Island Democrat, and Assemblywoman Aileen Gunther, a Democrat representing an area northwest of New York City."
1003,Mr. Kaminsky:
1004, A Newsday article said you oppose the current bill.
1005,The current version. I think we’ll be able to get to a good version that both helps the region and helps Long Islanders.
1006,"What I’ve asked for, and what the Long Island senators have asked for, is a dedicated revenue stream outside of congestion pricing to fund infrastructure improvements to the Long Island Rail Road."
1007,"You’re asking people to get out of their cars, then the mass transit needs to work better. The railroads had its worst on-time record in nearly two decades. It’s a mess."
1008, Is congestion pricing a tax on low-income and working-class people?
1009,"Long Island people driving into the city, who are already paying a good amount to live on Long Island and commute, would certainly not see it favorably. I don’t know if they use the “tax” word. I don’t think anyone’s asking for this on Long Island. The question is, can there be a commensurate benefit to balance it?"
1010, Someone suggested an exemption for New York City residents. 
1011,[Laughs] I think different people have different regional needs.
1012, Is there a way to make congestion pricing just for the rich? Can only luxury vehicles be charged?
1013,The only specific on vehicles that has been brought up is an exemption for motorcycles.
1014, I’m sure the motorcycle lobby is happy about that.
1015,I was trying to think of a joke about popping a wheelie.
1016,"When people reflect in five years, what will this look like?"
1017,I think this is going to be commonplace in a lot of cities.
1018,Ms. Gunther:
1019, I wanted to talk to a critic of congestion pricing.
1020,"I’m not going to be very long-winded, because I represent Orange and Sullivan Counties. In Sullivan County, we have no mass transit at all. And we have a Short Line bus system that, if you worked in New York City, you have to leave at 4 o’clock in the morning or you’d be late for work."
1021,"We also already pay M.T.A. taxes in Orange County. And for the service, it’s pretty pathetic."
1022,No mass transit at all?
1023,"We do have a train that leaves at certain times of the day. And if there’s a problem on the track, you’re out of luck. There’s another word I could put in there, but I’m not going to."
1024, You could.
1025,I’m not going to. [Mocking voice] It’s so darn unladylike.
1026,"I care greatly about the environment. But at this point, we have to really go back and think about upstate, downstate. You can’t do mass transit in a piecemeal manner. We’re all taxpayers."
1027, How does congestion pricing affect your constituents?
1028,Orange County is the last county you can live in if you’re on the New York Police Department or the Fire Department of New York. We’re not talking about the richy Wall Street people. We’re not talking about those.
1029,"There are a lot of folks that are commuting and at crazy hours, but the frequency of the trains aren’t there."
1030,"Anyway, I got to go, ‘cause we’re working on this stupid bu — I shouldn’t say stupid budget. But we’re working on this impossible budget!"
1031, Do you consider congestion pricing a tax on the working class?
1032,It definitely impacts working-class people the most.
1033,"The world’s tallest politician: It’s City Councilman Robert Cornegy Jr. of Brooklyn, who is 6 feet 10 inches tall, according to Guinness World Records."
1034,A measles emergency was declared in Rockland County. It barred minors who are unvaccinated against the virus from public places.

1048,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
1049,"At the first newspaper that hired me, I wrote restaurant reviews. My editor offered a legitimate-sounding piece of advice: Because I wasn’t a food expert, I should skip writing about what the food exactly tasted like. Instead, she said, focus on the ambience, the setting and, heck, even the bathroom."
1050,"Thus began my nearly three years of inadequate restaurant reviews, in which I factually described the food, without saying much by way of recommendations. The food was never the main story; it was always the restaurant itself."
1051,"This came to mind when I was reading about John Donohue, who is attempting to draw sketches of every restaurant in New York City. A book of his sketches will be published in May."
1052,"As my colleague John Leland wrote, Mr. Donohue “rarely eats at restaurants, and has tried very few of the 102 included in his book or the ongoing array on his website.” The sketchbook is more of a time capsule of a quickly changing landscape. Restaurants come and go, but New York’s appetite is forever."
1053,"By the time Mr. Donohue put together his sketches for a book, Mr. Leland continued, “at least six of the restaurants were gone.” Some were replaced by other eateries, waiting to be sketched."
1054,It’s Wednesday — be sketchy.

1058,"We introduced ourselves, and she said her name was Shirley. She accepted our help gratefully. She said she was going to Roosevelt Hospital, not far out of our way."
1059,"As we walked, Shirley told us about herself. She mentioned that she had taken the A train down from 165th Street for her doctor’s appointment, something she typically did on her own."
1060,We got to the hospital and parted ways.
1061,"Later that week, I brought my 8-year-old daughter to a play date in Washington Heights. It was going to be our first time in the neighborhood. As we rode uptown on the subway, I told my daughter about meeting the blind woman earlier in the week."
1062,"We left the subway at 168th Street and started toward our destination. Within two blocks, I spotted Shirley."
1063,“Shirley?” I called out.
1064,"“Joel,” she said. “Is that you?”"

1069,"A plan to tax the rich on multimillion-dollar second homes in New York City has rapidly moved closer to reality, as legislative leaders in Albany and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have all signed off on the idea as a funding stream for the city’s beleaguered subway system."
1070,"Mr. Cuomo said on Monday there was a consensus among the state’s leaders, all Democrats, that a so-called pied-à-terre tax was a good idea, calling it the “only agreed-to new money” for a state facing a significant drop in tax revenue."
1071,"The purchase of a $238 million apartment on Central Park South by Kenneth C. Griffin, a hedge fund billionaire with an estimated net worth of $10 billion, may have helped make the legislation more feasible, proponents said."
1072,"“I think we have a mass transit system that is in crisis, public housing that is falling down around its residents and a yawning gap between the very wealthy and ordinary New Yorkers that is driving this conversation,” said Senator Brad Hoylman, a sponsor of his chamber’s pied-à-terre bill."
1073,"The $238 million record purchase was a visceral reminder that when wealthy buyers like Mr. Griffin purchase expensive apartments as second homes or investments, New York City and the state get less financial benefit than if the home were owned as a primary residence. If the buyers live out of state, they are not subject to state or city income taxes, and do not pay New York sales tax while outside the state."
1074,"Under the Senate’s bill, a pied-à-terre tax would institute a yearly tax on homes worth $5 million or more, and would apply to homes that do not serve as the buyer’s primary residence."
1075,"It was not immediately clear how much money the tax would raise; the office of the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, estimated that a pied-à-terre tax would bring in a minimum of $650 million annually if enacted today. And based on the expected revenue stream, Mr. Cuomo estimated that the state could then raise $9 billion in bonds, backed by the expected taxes paid by pied-à-terre owners."
1076,"The State Senate and Assembly were expected to include a version of the tax in budget proposals that are set to be released this week, although the exact details were still to be ironed out. And given the often-tumultuous process of negotiating the state budget, which is due April 1, it remains possible that the tax may not get approved this year."
1077,"But according to Senate leaders, the tax is long overdue."
1078,"“It is great that with a united Democratic Legislature and support from the governor, we can finally get this done,” said Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Democratic majority in the Senate, adding that a tax on “ultrarich second homeowners in New York City is common sense and something we have supported for years.”"
1079,"Mr. Cuomo said on Monday that with other potential sources of revenue in question — the possible legalization of marijuana, for example, has been slowed by political and practical concerns — other sources are now needed."
1080,"“If we did have marijuana passed, we wouldn’t have needed to substitute the pied-à-terre,” Mr. Cuomo said in remarks to reporters in Albany. “It’s a very tight box this year.”"
1081,"Mr. Hoylman said there were many pressing needs that could use an influx of recurring funds, and was agnostic about whether the money be placed in a dedicated revenue stream for something such as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
1082,"His bill would create a sliding tax surcharge. For properties valued between $5 million and $6 million, a 0.5 percent surcharge would be added on the value over $5 million. Fees and a higher surcharge would apply to homes that sold for more than $6 million, topping out at a $370,000 fee and a 4 percent surcharge for homes valued at more than $25 million."
1083,"Corey Johnson, the speaker of the City Council, said there is “wide support” among members for a pied-à-terre tax because of the condition of the city’s vital infrastructure such as the subways and public housing. The city may have to pass legislation creating the tax should the Legislature authorize it."
1084,"In 2017, New York City had 75,000 pieds-à-terre, up from 55,000 such units since 2014, according to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey. The share of vacant apartments that are classified as pieds-à-terre has held steady during that time at about 30 percent."
1085,"Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, said the tax would not be well received within the business community. She suggested that such a tax — combined with President Trump’s move to cap the amount of state and local income taxes that can be deducted on federal income taxes — could further push the wealthy to reconsider living here."
1086,"“A broad-based tax like the sales tax or the gas tax would be better received in the business community,” Ms. Wylde said."
1087,"But Moses Gates, a vice president at the Regional Plan Association, disputed the notion that New Yorkers would leave the city. The association believes that most wealthy pied-à-terre owners would pay the tax. If they chose to sell, then the property has the chance of being purchased by a full-time city resident, who would then be subject to income and sales tax."
1088,"“Either the housing is put back on the market for a full-time resident of New York City,” said Mr. Gates, “or folks who own extremely valuable residences contribute their fair share to making sure New York is the kind of city that provides a safe investment for high-end property.”"

1108,It’s Monday. The first official day of spring is two days away.
1109,"Weather: A slight chance of flurries early in the morning, but turning sunny and rising to the mid-40s."
1110,Alternate-side parking: In effect until Wednesday (suspended Thursday for Purim).
1111,"It’s one of the biggest real estate projects in the country in recent years, and one of the biggest in New York since Rockefeller Center was completed 80 years ago."
1112,And taxpayers helped pay for this new $25 billion neighborhood.
1113,Hudson Yards officially opened on Friday. Want to visit? Here’s everything you’ll need to know:
1114,Where is it?
1115,Hudson Yards was built above the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rail yards on the West Side of Manhattan.
1116,What buildings are there?
1117,"There’s a shopping mall between two office towers, 10 and 30 Hudson Yards. 50 Hudson Yards is to the north and under construction. Another office building is at 55 Hudson Yards."
1118,"Then there’s 35 Hudson Yards, which is 1,000 feet high and includes shops, offices, a hotel and apartments. And over at 15 Hudson Yards, a residential building, there are separate entrances for the wealthy condo owners and the subsidized renters."
1119,"The most eye-catching buildings are the Shed, a $500 million city-sponsored arts center, and the Vessel, a 150-foot-high, $200 million structure with 2,500 climbable steps."
1120,"There’s also a major dining complex, with restaurants run by celebrity chefs like Thomas Keller, David Chang, Michael Lomonaco, Costas Spiliadis and José Andrés."
1121,Half a dozen buildings are slated for construction west of 12th Avenue.
1122,Who built all of this? 
1123,"Mainly Stephen Ross, a billionaire developer who will move into a penthouse at Hudson Yards."
1124,How much did it cost?
1125,"The tax breaks and other government assistance for Hudson Yards have reached nearly $6 billion, according to public records and an analysis by the New School, my colleague Matthew Haag reported."
1126,That number is bigger than the $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that were part of the failed attempt to entice Amazon to open a campus in Queens.
1127,The Hudson Yards package included:
1128,• $2.4 billion to extend the No. 7 subway line
1129,• $1.2 billion for about four acres of parks and open space
1130,• $359 million in interest payments on bonds when revenue from the development fell short
1131,Some companies in New York City that planned to relocate to Hudson Yards were eligible for tax breaks:
1132,• $25 million for BlackRock
1133,• $5.5 million for L’Oréal USA
1134,• $14 million for WarnerMedia
1135,"Supporters of the project point out that the subway line and the park space benefit not only Hudson Yards, but also the neighborhood in general."
1136,[Read about the tax breaks and incentives behind Hudson Yards.]
1137,"Is Hudson Yards any good, architecturally speaking?"
1138,"The Times’s architecture critic, Michael Kimmelman, called the development a “relic of dated 2000s thinking, nearly devoid of urban design,” and akin to “glass shards on top of a wall.”"
1139,"“Hudson Yards glorifies a kind of surface spectacle — as if the peak ambitions of city life were consuming luxury goods and enjoying a smooth, seductive, mindless materialism,” he said."
1140,"The open space, he continued, “looks like it may end up being mostly a fancy drive-through drop-off for the shopping mall, a landscaped plaza overshadowed by office towers.”"
1141,[Read Mr. Kimmelman’s review.]
1142,"What does Mr. Ross, the Hudson Yards developer, say about the project?"
1143,"Mr. Kimmelman asked, half-jokingly, “Do you imagine this as a museum of architecture?”"
1144,"“Yes, that’s exactly what we’re doing,” Mr. Ross said. “We are creating a museum of architecture and a whole new way of life.”"
1145,"He added, “This is New York as it should be, with everything you want at your doorstep.”"
1146,"The debate between housing and gardens is a no-brainer, says the columnist Ginia Bellafante."
1147,#Maga Church: A doomsday prophet says the Bible predicted President Trump.
1148,"Welcome, refugees. Now pay back your travel loans."
1149,"A dominatrix moved into Bedford-Stuyvesant, setting off a gentrification struggle."

1162,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
1163,Many people rang in the new year in January.
1164,The Chinese New Year was in February.
1165,"The Persian New Year is celebrated Thursday. It is called Nowruz and coincides with spring, which begins on Wednesday."
1166,"Iranian holidays can be particularly difficult to celebrate in this country, as one Times op-ed contributor wrote last year: “While Chinese-Americans had Bruce Lee and Italian-Americans had Rocky Balboa, I had Ayatollah Khomeini and the hostage crisis.”"
1167,Awkward.
1168,"(Non-Iranians sometimes celebrate Nowruz, too, including former Mayor Michael Bloomberg.)"
1169,"On Friday, I spoke with Dr. Rosa Nouvini, who, like me, was born and raised in New York and is of Persian descent. She has been celebrating Persian holidays all her life and is steeped in the traditions."
1170,"Compared with New Year’s Eve, “Nowruz has a deeper meaning for me,” Dr. Nouvini said. “It’s more togetherness, about roots.” She grew up on Long Island, recalling that her mother “would start spring cleaning a couple of weeks before” the occasion."
1171,The cleaning isn’t just symbolic: Nowruz is often celebrated by visiting family members at their homes.
1172,How can you set up a Nowruz get-together at your house?
1173,"First, offer food. (New York Times Cooking has 22 easy-to-make recipes for the Persian New Year.)"
1174,"Second, put together a haft sin table, which contains seven items representing the things you’re grateful for and would like to see more of in the new year:"
1175,"• An apple, for beauty"
1176,"• Garlic, for good health"
1177,"• Vinegar, for patience"
1178,"• Hyacinth, for spring"
1179,"• Sweet pudding, for fertility"
1180,"• Sprouts, for rebirth"
1181,"• Coins, for prosperity"
1182,"The tables in my family also have mirrors, representing a look into the future, and goldfish (real, or the snack), representing life."
1183,Or include something else to nibble on. All that cleaning can make a person hungry.
1184,It’s Monday — get your haft sin table ready.
1185,Dear Diary:
1186,"We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave."
1187,"The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang."
1188,"He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music."
1189,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

1193,"If you’ve seen media coverage of the 29-year-old first-year representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, it would be easy to think that she’s the first of her kind. Democrats and Republicans alike appear to be in a perpetual state of slack-jawed bewilderment as they watch her stand up to powerful lobbyists, stomp on shibboleths and clap back at her trolls on Twitter."
1194,"But Ms. Ocasio-Cortez would be the first to tell you that she hails from a long line of defiant, outspoken congresswomen from New York. (And, of course, they aren’t just New Yorkers; Lori Lightfoot is preparing to be the first African-American woman and first openly gay person to serve as Chicago’s mayor, running largely as an outsider candidate.) As the saying goes, history never repeats itself, but it often rhymes."
1195,"The story is in the photos from The New York Times archive. Beginning with Ruth Baker Pratt, who won her house seat in 1929, a series of New York women would fight their way onto Capitol Hill, defying expectations and breaking down barriers. Next came Edna Kelly, Brooklyn’s first congresswoman, who, among other things, helped establish the principle of equal pay for equal work."
1196,"The 1970s ushered in a golden age of congresswomen from New York. There was the inimitable Bella Abzug, the lawyer and civil rights activist who served three loud, proud terms from 1971 to 1977 for New York’s 19th District. “I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine,” she once wrote, “and knock the crap out of the political power structure.” One can only wonder what she would have done with Instagram Live and 280-character tweets."
1197,"Gov. Mario Cuomo said of Ms. Abzug in 1998, “She was a New Yorker, and for a New Yorker, any day without a really good fight is regarded as a lost opportunity.” He was right: Whether navigating the A train or pushing through rush hour traffic in Midtown, you can’t make it in New York without learning to throw a few elbows. The same goes for stepping into a national political arena dominated and designed by men."
1198,"Time and again, women candidates have been met with derision or dismissed as “long shots” — in many cases, both. Take Elizabeth Holtzman: In 1972, the then-31-year-old stunned the whole of Washington when she upset a powerful 50-year male incumbent in the Democratic primary, becoming the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. (Sound familiar?)"
1199,"And, of course, you can’t talk about women in politics without talking about Shirley Chisholm, a once-in-a-generation force for change who represented her Brooklyn district from 1969 to 1983. As she put it, “My greatest political asset, which professional politicians fear, is my mouth, out of which come all kinds of things one shouldn’t always discuss for reasons of political expediency.” Despite her fearlessness — or, more aptly, because of it — opponents dismissed her, she said, as just a “little schoolteacher.” (She had been an educator before taking office.)"
1200,"There is a counterintuitive advantage in being the underdog, though, and New York women have a long record of turning their challenging positioning into a superpower."
1201,"That takes a balancing act: Be attractive, but not too attractive. Smile, but be taken seriously. Get things done, but never appear threatening. And those expectations are compounded for women of color."
1202,"Just think about the kinds of photo-ops women in public life are asked to pose for — baking pies, tending a garden, etc. — and the way they subvert them to hit back at the male power structure. Look closely at the above photo of Geraldine Ferraro (who served in the House from 1979 to 1985) and you’ll see the words “Clean up politics. Elect women.” emblazoned on her apron. Or Representative Susan Molinari gamely standing tall on a booster next to Chuck Schumer during a television taping. These photos have a kind of cheeky strength. But looking at them, I can only wonder what private costs these women faced as they made space for the rest of us to follow in the public sphere."
1203,One thing that is clear: These New York women never let narrow notions of what a leader should look like stop them from getting things done.
1204,"And get things done, they did. In 1972, Ms. Chisholm was the first woman of any color and the first African-American to make a serious run for president on a major-party ticket. She also co-founded the National Women’s Political Caucus with Ms. Abzug and a host of others. And Ms. Holtzman sat on the House Judiciary Committee as it presided over the Watergate investigation in 1974. In 1984, Ms. Ferraro was the first female vice-presidential candidate and sponsored the Economic Equity Act in 1981, a bill that helped strengthen the financial rights of widows and divorcées, and permitted homemakers to save with individual retirement accounts."
1205,"In both image and impact, these women are gritty, determined. But the photos that strike me most are the ones in which tenderness and honest vulnerability are on display. You see it in Ms. Chisholm’s unvarnished joy as she waves from a car window while campaigning, in Ms. Holtzman’s satisfied and knowing smile, and in the warmth with which Nydia Velázquez, the first Puerto Rican woman elected to Congress, embraces her father."
1206,"These images are also a powerful reminder: Thriving in a world created for men doesn’t have to mean shying away from all that makes you a woman. When criticized for talking about her signature red lipstick, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez put it this way: “I derive power from my femininity. And any attempt to make femininity trivial or unimportant is an attempt to take away my power.” In the face of a white and male majority ready to cast anything feminine as frivolous, this small act is itself a kind of defiant rebellion."
1207,"Is it any wonder New York produces the kind of women who are defined by their nerve? As a native New Yorker and the product of New York City public schools, I know that this city forces you to face each day with bravery — or you’ll never make it onto a crowded subway car intact."
1208,"What’s more, each new generation of New York women inherits the legacy of those who came before. Our streets are stamped with the heel prints of women who were never expected to succeed but did anyway. Just look at the unlikely stories of Ms. Chisholm, Ms. Holtzman, Ms. Velázquez and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Just look at the women that charge by you on any given city block, who strenuously hoist strollers up subway staircases, and who give you a piece of their mind whether you like it or not. Just look at the girls gathering in tight circles on a city playground, sharing secrets — and building their plans for world domination."
1209,"Audrey Gelman is the chief executive officer and co-founder of The Wing, a network of work and community spaces designed for women with locations in New York City, Washington, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles. Ms. Gelman previously served as deputy communications director for Comptroller Scott Stringer’s campaign and is a native New Yorker."

1211,By Jessica Grose
1212,"If you’ve ever had a sick baby, you probably know what it feels like to fall down a panicked, late-night internet black hole. Most of what you find just isn’t helpful, and it probably makes you feel less knowledgeable, not more. "
1213,"We’re introducing a new Parenting section at The Times with the hopes of addressing that problem. The section will cover issues related to fertility and pregnancy, babies, kids — and your life with them. And we’ll help you find your way through the dark with evidence-based solutions, relying on the deep reporting of our staff and the advice of vetted experts. "
1214,"We’ll also give you personal stories that resonate, and daily parenting news on topics like how to raise independent little ones in a world of snowplow parents or the scientists working to find the cause of SIDS. "
1215,"Our website, parenting.nytimes.com, begins in May."
1216,"Ahead of the launch, we’re starting a newsletter on March 27: sign up here for weekly notes from me with the latest parenting news and guidance from The Times. "
1217,"We want the newsletter to be a place where parents can connect, where we can share the highs and lows of dealing with little weirdos every day. This is why we want each newsletter to include a reader-submitted Tiny Victory."
1218,"Tiny Victories are meant to celebrate those small moments of triumph in the long days of parenting. We want to hear about the ingenious way you headed off a toddler meltdown on a long car ride, or how you persuaded your youngster to take a bite of something foreign instead of just tossing it on the floor.

1220,“I finally remembered to bring stickers to keep my 23-month-old entertained on the subway ride home from day care. It saved me from the screaming and the trying to get out of his stroller thing he usually does each time.”

1226,Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.
1227,"It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery."
1228,"The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning."
1229,"New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic."
1230,The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.
1231,"Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees."
1232,"Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks."
1233,"His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit."
1234,Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.
1235,"State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely."
1236,"Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond."
1237,"Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere."
1238,"Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone."
1239,But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.
1240,"After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing."
1241,"Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”"
1242,"Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing."
1243,"The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels."
1244,"Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later."
1245,"“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”"
1246,"One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates."
1247,"London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution."
1248,"Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h."
1249,"Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."
1250,"In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home."
1251,"But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted."
1252,"And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars."
1253,Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.
1254,"Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians."
1255,"Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic."
1256,"“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”"
1257,"Every one of Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s facial features is intensely expressive, and that includes both eyebrows. But it’s her mouth that holds center stage at the SoHo Playhouse, where her fabled — and genuinely fabulous — “Fleabag” opened on Thursday night."
1258,"That mouth has been incarnadined in the deepest red, so it seems to have an autonomous life that’s at odds with the cool, pale skin that surrounds it. And it rarely stays the same shape during this one-woman play about sex, longing and what churns beneath them, directed with finely gauged precision by Vicky Jones."
1259,"Ms. Waller-Bridge’s lips shrink to the size of a postage stamp to evoke a subway pickup her character calls Rodent Face (handsome only from the eyes up). They morph into a rapt rectangular gape to summon a guinea pig listening to rock music, and curve into an alarming, complicitous leer to tell us about eating “a very slutty pizza.”"
1260,"Then there’s that open, teeth-exposing, wonder-filled smile that poises sheer delight on the brink of a bottomless despair, two states of feeling that somehow both negate and enhance each other. The same ambivalence infuses the ever-surprising sentences that fall from her mouth like jewels and toads in a fairy tale."
1261,"Emotions never come singly in “Fleabag,” in which Ms. Waller-Bridge’s onstage alter ego (the title character) describes grieving, fornicating, drinking and insulting her way through contemporary London. You are possibly already familiar with the title and basic story of “Fleabag.”"
1262,"That’s also the name of Ms. Waller-Bridge’s BBC 3 television series, which won her a clutch of awards after debuting in 2016 and began its second British broadcast season this week. But the “Fleabag” that has set up camp in New York through April 14 is a 65-minute monologue first seen five years ago at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. That show became the basis for the series, which was picked up in the United States by Amazon, and it made Ms. Waller-Bridge — who went on to create the demented rom-com “Crashing” and the peerless spy drama “Killing Eve” — a name to reckon with in the entertainment industry."
1263,"Much of “Fleabag” the play was recycled in the television show’s first season, which gave animate form to people described in the monologue by a cast that includes, if you please, Olivia Colman (and for the new season, Fiona Shaw and Kristin Scott Thomas). I would like to be able to tell you that if you’ve seen the series, you needn’t bother with the play, which is already sold out."
1264,"I’m sorry. I can’t. Onstage, “Fleabag” throbs with a concentrated, combustible vitality that a camera is incapable of capturing, even with pore-probing close-ups. Sitting in a merciless spotlight, Ms. Waller-Bridge never leaves the long-legged chair, on a small red rug, that is the production’s set (designed by Holly Pigott, with lighting by Elliot Griggs)."
1265,"But, oh, the places she takes us, the hilarious heights and the despondent depths (or do I mean the opposite?). Fleabag is a restless and unhappy hedonist whose best friend and business partner (in a guinea pig-themed coffee shop) was recently killed in a traffic accident that was probably a semi-suicide attempt."
1266,"The show begins with Fleabag being interviewed for a clerical job, and it establishes her contradictory approach to others, including the audience, equally ingratiating and antagonistic. The interviewer is a man, who it emerges has recently been accused of sexual harassment."
1267,"“That won’t get you very far here anymore,” we hear his recorded voice saying to Fleabag, when she starts to remove her sweater, revealing she has only a bra on underneath."
1268,"Fleabag swears this flashing of flesh was inadvertent. Then again, pretty much everything she does is an act of self-sabotage, even when it’s in the name of self-gratification. “I’m not obsessed with sex,” she says. “I just can’t stop thinking about it. The performance of it. The awkwardness of it. The drama of it.”"
1269,"She masturbates a lot, inspired by online images of everyone from Zac Efron to Barack Obama, “especially when I’m bored or angry or upset. Or happy.” And she registers all possible flickers of desire in the eyes of the men she sees, on the streets, in the subway, in her cafe."
1270,"In most best-selling confessional memoirs, such hypersexuality would be traced to a primal woundedness — preferably caused by a single traumatic incident or abusive relationship — and (or) a misogynistic society. Ms. Waller-Bridge doesn’t traffic in clear-cut causes and effects."
1271,"Yes, the script includes a late revelation about a life-wrenching act of betrayal. But Fleabag seems to have been behaving in much the same manner long before that act occurred. And yes, the show takes place against an internet-shaped landscape of vast and mutable carnality. (Listen to her listing the varied names of the porn sites she visits.)"
1272,"But while Fleabag is very much a woman of her time and place, a self-described “bad feminist” who exploits and is exploited by what surrounds her in the urban here and now, she can’t be entirely defined by them. Think of her as one of the great novelist Jean Rhys’s lost, promiscuous heroines transplanted to the 21st century, but with a devouring sense of humor that goes far beyond irony."
1273,"Ms. Waller-Bridge understands that we are all laws unto ourselves, governed by our own special imps of the perverse. That universal distinctiveness is what’s meant by the saw “character is fate,” and it’s the source of both the deepest comedy and tragedy."
1274,"Ms. Waller-Bridge deploys an ace stand-up’s sense of timing to plumb this most profound of paradoxes. Fleabag segues with canny purposefulness among earnest wistfulness and dismissive flippancy, scorching pain and echoing, hollow silence, giving equal weight to each."
1275,"More than any current work of theater I can think of, “Fleabag” operates on the principle that no emotion is pure and simple. Society and sanity demand that we not acknowledge this in our daily interactions, and we do our best to adhere to a formula of true or false, thumbs up or thumbs down."
1276,"In contrast, “Fleabag” keeps all contradictory shards and shades of feeling in play at the same time. That’s why it’s so gloriously disruptive."
1277,"The show concludes with an abrupt insult, the commonest of angry epithets. Yet in Ms. Waller-Bridge’s rendering, an ugly, unprintable two-word exclamation somehow encompasses self-destructiveness, self-assertiveness, self-consciousness — and the unconditional thrill and muddle of simply being alive."

1279,"As a man shopped with his wife in the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx on Friday, a woman stepped up to them and said she hated white people. Then she attacked, kicking the man and spraying him with pepper spray, the police said."
1280,"The next day, the same person, who is black, approached a man and a woman in the same neighborhood, asked the woman if she was white and then immediately sprayed her in the eyes."
1281,"On Saturday, police arrested Thomas Heard, a 37-year-old from the Bronx who identifies as a transgender woman, and charged her with multiple hate-crime felonies and misdemeanors in connection with the two attacks."
1282,"Police were also questioning Ms. Heard, who also goes by the name Tasha, about seven similar pepper spray attacks in Manhattan on Friday, which were committed by a woman matching her description."
1283,"Four of the attacks took place in Harlem and on the Upper West Side, the police said. Two of the attacks occurred in subway stations. These incidents are also being investigated as possible hate crimes, the authorities said."
1284,None of the victims were seriously injured.
1285,"Ms. Heard’s arrest comes amid a rise in reported hate crimes throughout the city. Hate crimes rose 5 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, with crimes targeting black people because of their race rising 33 percent and anti-Semitic hate crimes rising 22 percent. That upward trend has continued in the first two months of the year."
1286,"Ms. Heard has been arrested more than 60 times since 2002 on charges including prostitution, sexual misconduct and disorderly conduct, police said."
1287,"In the Bronx, Ms. Heard was charged with assault and menacing as a hate crime, both felonies, among other charges. She was arraigned Sunday and held on $30,000 bond."
1288,"On Monday, Ms. Heard’s neighbors in Belmont said they often hear yelling and fighting from inside her apartment, but they believe she lives alone."
1289,"The first Bronx attack took place on Friday at 2 p.m. A 55-year-old white man was walking with his wife along a busy commercial section of East 187th Street, when Ms. Heard stopped them, used an obscenity to announce her hatred for Caucasians and then sprayed the man in the face with pepper spray, the police said."
1290,"On Saturday, the police said, Ms. Heard accosted a man and a woman at 4:30 p.m. as they walked together near the corner of Crotona Avenue and East 187th Street. She asked the woman if she was white, then sprayed her in the face with pepper spray, the police said. She also brandished a “sharp object” as a weapon, the police said."
1291,"Ms. Heard’s lawyer, Suzanne McElwreath, did not immediately return messages from a reporter on Monday."

1293,"Early Monday, hundreds of thousands of New York City parents looked outside to find the streets slushy and wet, but hardly impassable."
1294,"The problem? On Sunday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio had canceled school for Monday, warning of a potentially dangerous storm with up to ten inches of snow."
1295,"In the morning, the decision immediately began to look like a miscalculation; 1.1 million students were home from their 1,800 schools for a few inches of slush. Even the city’s unreliable subways were running normally."
1296,Good thing NYC kids didn’t have to go to school today.  Manhattan got slammed. #Snowmageddon pic.twitter.com/FPWyXkuIrs
1297,"It is a fact of New York City politics that a mayor is only as popular as his most recent snow day decision. For decades, parents have scolded mayors for keeping schools open in big storms and closing them in small ones."
1298,But Mr. de Blasio seems to be an especially popular target for parents’ anger.
1299,"So far, in his five years in office, Mr. de Blasio has called seven snow days. In the decades between 1978 and 2013, there were only 11. Some parents praised former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s reluctance to close schools, but he was also chastised and criticized."
1300,"Sensing the growing frustration — or perhaps taking note of his Twitter mentions — Mr. de Blasio defended himself on Twitter around 10 a.m., saying his administration opted to make “an early decision” so that working parents could plan ahead."
1301,"“For this mayor the safety of our kids is the first and last question in the decision,” Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s spokesman, said on Monday. “The mayor gets as much real-time expert forecasting as he can, he drills those running the buses and the plows, and he makes the call with as much time as possible for parents to plan. This is a no-win dynamic for any mayor.”"
1302,Mr. Phillips also noted that snowfall totals were higher in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan.
1303,That wasn’t enough to placate frustrated New Yorkers.
1304,"When Mr. de Blasio made his decision on Sunday night, meteorologists and city officials were predicting that the New York area could see as many as ten inches of snow by 7 a.m. As the wintry mix began to fall with temperatures just above freezing, those estimates decreased."
1305,"Ultimately, while some areas around the city saw snowfall totals close to a foot, the National Weather Service reported that only five inches of snow fell overnight in Central Park, and totals were closer to two inches in parts of Brooklyn and Queens."
1306,The decision to shutter the nation’s largest school system is a particularly unenviable choice any mayor must make.
1307,"On one hand, the city is loath to close schools because the vast majority of New York City public school students are low-income, and many working families cannot work from home or afford a babysitter. With the city’s homeless student population at a record high, school can be the only place where vulnerable children get a hot meal all day."
1308,But recent history shows just how ferocious the response can be when schools are left open in a bad storm.
1309,"When an unexpectedly messy snowstorm hit New York and New Jersey last November, some students with special needs were stranded on their school buses for 10 hours without food or access to a bathroom as snow and ice accumulated. Furious parents wondered why their children were not let out of school before the snow started falling."
1310,"The mayor was forced to apologize for his bungled handling of the storm, which likely influenced the decision to close schools on Monday."
1311,"And just a few weeks after the mayor took office in 2014, the city was hit with nearly a foot of snow and Mr. de Blasio kept schools open. He faced a torrent of criticism from everyone from the United Federation of Teachers president to Al Roker."
1312,"Mr. de Blasio’s then-schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, defended their decision by declaring, “It’s a beautiful day.” The comment landed her days of unflattering coverage on the front pages of the city’s tabloids."
1313,"Mr. de Blasio was not the only local official who shuttered schools on Monday. In New Jersey, where Gov. Philip D. Murphy declared a state of emergency, school districts began announcing closures or delayed openings as early as Sunday evening."
1314,"Schools in the cities of Hoboken, Secaucus and Jersey City, all just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, were all closed on Monday. In suburban Bergen County, about 30 school districts opted to close for the day; roughly an equal number opted to open late. In adjacent Essex County, a handful of districts gave students a snow day, while schools in neighboring districts opened with a delayed start."
1315,It was a patchwork approach — different schools in different districts doing different things — that caused confusion and consternation among parents weary of weather-related disruptions to their family’s routines.
1316,"Snow day decisions involve a complicated calculus of politics and logistics. New York City’s response to the most recent storm typically influences the next decision; if the mayor was seen as overly alarmist over just a few inches, he may be more hesitant to cancel schools, but if he took heat for mismanaging a storm, it is easier to make the case for an abundance of caution."
1317,"A morning snowstorm can be particularly tricky for schools because a massive fleet of yellow buses have to leave their depots, typically before the sun rises, and pick up tens of thousands of students. Those buses then interfere with the 1,600 snow plows the mayor said would comb the streets overnight. Heavy snow can impact subway service, and New Yorkers are familiar with city buses skidding and sliding across avenues in bad weather."
1318,"Then there is the question of unreliable forecasts: Mr. de Blasio defended his administration’s response to the November storm by noting that the forecast only called for an inch of snow, when six inches that fell during rush hour — an especially inconvenient time — paralyzed the city."
1319,"With the start of spring just a few weeks away, Mr. de Blasio was likely also betting that it would be the only snow day of the season. In the past, the city has been more hesitant to close schools early in the winter."
1320,"At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr. de Blasio said that he and the schools chancellor had decided to close schools in order to protect children."
1321,"“It indicated the kind of situation that was going to hit right as the school buses were rolling, and potentially very intense accumulation around that time,” he said. “It just did not look like a safe situation for kids based on the information that we had.”"
1322,"A widespread blackout enveloped much of Venezuela in darkness on Thursday night, stopping subway service in the capital and causing problems around the country, which has been plagued by power failures as its economic crisis has worsened."
1323,"The power failure appeared to be more severe than others, however, and the government of President Nicolás Maduro moved quickly to blame its opponents."
1324,"The minister of electrical power, Luis Motta Domínguez, said on state television that the blackout was caused by an “attack” on the Guri Dam, a large hydroelectric facility in east Venezuela. Information Minister Jorge Rodríguez, also on the state news network, said that right-wing “criminals” had committed “sabotage” to the dam’s system of generation and distribution."
1325,The officials did not say how much of the country had been affected by the blackout.
1326,"Mr. Maduro accused the United States of orchestrating the power failure, writing on Twitter, “The electrical war announced and directed by the imperialist United States against our people will be defeated.”"
1327,Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late Thursday that the responsibility rested with Mr. Maduro’s government.
1328,"“The power outage and the devastation hurting ordinary Venezuelans is not because of the USA,” he wrote on Twitter. “It’s not because of Colombia. It’s not Ecuador or Brazil, Europe or anywhere else. Power shortages and starvation are the result of the Maduro regime’s incompetence.”"
1329,"Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader whom the United States has recognized as Venezuela’s leader, also linked the blackout to the government authorities."
1330,"“How do you tell a mother who has to cook, an ill person who depends on a machine, and a laborer who needs to work that they’re in a powerful country without light?” he asked on Twitter. He added: “The light will come with the end of the usurpation.”"
1331,"On social media, many used the hashtag #SinLuz, or Without Light, to share photos and video of cities in nearly total darkness, and of Venezuelans, unable to use public transportation, walking in large numbers through city streets lit only by car headlights. Local news reports showed large traffic jams caused by failed traffic lights."
1332,"Venezuela has suffered periodic power failures for months, as its electrical system has deteriorated along with much of the country’s infrastructure. Though it was once one of South America’s most prosperous nations, its economy has collapsed because of mismanagement and corruption, leaving people starving and without medical supplies. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country on foot."
1333,"The economic crisis spawned a political one in January, when Mr. Guaidó declared himself president and was formally recognized as the country’s leader by several dozen nations, the United States among them. American officials imposed additional sanctions on Mr. Maduro’s government and have tried to deliver aid, which the Venezuelan authorities — accusing the Americans of trying to force regime change — have largely blocked at the borders."
1334,"LONDON — Three suspicious packages that appeared to contain homemade bombs capable of igniting a small fire were found Tuesday in and around transport hubs in London, the authorities said."
1335,The three packages were described as similar: all midsize white envelopes with padded manila envelopes inside.
1336,"The London Metropolitan Police said that a counterterrorism unit had been called in, and was treating the incidents as linked, but that it was “keeping an open mind regarding motives.”"
1337,"No one was injured, but the police issued warnings for people to be vigilant around city transportation hubs."
1338,"“These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened,” a police statement read."
1339,"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the incidents."
1340,"“While transport services continue to operate as normal,” he said, “I urge all Londoners and visitors to our city to remain vigilant, and report any potential suspicious packages to the police.”"
1341,"Just before 10 a.m., the police received a report of a suspicious package at the Compass Centre, an office building on the grounds of Heathrow Airport."
1342,"Employees at the building opened the package, “causing the device to initiate,” and part of the envelope to burn, the police said."
1343,"The building was evacuated and remains closed, but flights at Heathrow were not affected. The office building is outside the airport’s security perimeter."
1344,"Less than two hours later, at approximately 11:40 a.m., the British Transport Police were called to investigate another suspicious package, this one in the mail room at Waterloo Station, a bustling rail terminal in central London."
1345,"That package was not opened, and officers rendered the device safe. The station was not evacuated and train services continued to operate normally."
1346,"Then, at 12:10 p.m., the police were called to a report of a suspicious package at the offices at City Aviation House, which is on the property of London City Airport. That package, too, was not opened, the building was temporarily evacuated."
1347,Flights to and from that airport were not affected.
1348,The authorities issued advisories to transport hubs across London to “be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.”
1349,"The Irish police are also involved in the investigation into the incident. According to British and Irish news reports, at least one of the packages had an Irish stamp on it."
1350,"A spokeswoman for An Garda Siochana, Ireland’s national police service, said it was assisting the Metropolitan Police but would not elaborate further."
1351,"While the motive behind the transit center packages is still unknown, London has been target of terrorism many times over the last 15 years."
1352,"On July 7, 2005, suicide bombers killed 52 subway and bus travelers in London. In 2017, there were various deadly attacks on pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, on London Bridge and near the Finsbury Park Mosque. And a bomb that partially exploded on a commuter train that year burned 23 people."
1353,"Late last year, a parliamentary report detailed a “litany of errors” by the authorities surrounding those incidents."
1354,"Concerns about digital privacy — What is Facebook doing with our data? How are advertisers tracking our interests? How can we stop the breaches that put our personal information at risk? — have received much-needed attention in recent months, but there’s another aspect of privacy that should be on our minds, too: Many of us underestimate the ways in which ubiquitous technology like search engines on a smartphone in the hands of a stranger can compromise our privacy in our everyday lives. "
1355,I teach information privacy to law students. I gave my class an optional exercise to complete over spring break that illustrated the difference between the privacy we think we have when we’re in public and the privacy we actually have. 
1356,"The instructions were straightforward: At some point in the next two weeks, try to determine a stranger’s identity, in a public place, using only Google search on your phone, based on things the stranger said loudly enough for lots of others to hear and things that are displayed on the person’s clothing or bags, like logos or a monogram."
1357,"[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]"
1358,"The activity was designed to illustrate a theory explored by Irwin Altman in the 1975 book “The Environment and Social Behavior: Privacy, Personal Space, Territory, Crowding”: People will assume anonymity in public and then reveal various levels of private information given what they believe their environment to be and what tools might be available to manage disclosure. "
1359,"For instance, if you are in a quiet doctor’s waiting room or even a full but quiet subway car, you might (though we’ve all been around those who don’t) wait to make a call to a friend, knowing you’ll be easily overheard. That discretion might fade away, however, in a noisy subway car or in an airport. In such places, you know people can still hear you, but you’re relying on another mechanism to protect your privacy: obscurity. Privacy by obscurity, as Woodrow Hartzog and Evan Selinger have written, “is the idea that when information is hard to obtain or understand, it is, to some degree, safe.” I wanted to demonstrate to my students how the most common of technologies can be used to shatter the perceived protections of obscurity and, in turn, reveal the admittedly thin mechanisms by which privacy is actually protected."
1360,"After describing the exercise and its goals, I was met with some skepticism. A few students found it to be “creepy” — a reaction I was quick to point out revealed their own notions about how public space was private. I assured them that the goal was not to eavesdrop on a purposefully private conversation, or to do any “digging” on the person, or to share or do anything with the information they found out. This was to be purely an exercise in whether people can actually be private in public places and whether they expect to be."
1361,"The project has had fascinating results. A number of students have written to me over the course of the break describing their experiences. A student who had been against the need for privacy regulation, arguing in class that those who have nothing to hide shouldn’t care who’s watching or listening, was particularly shocked. Sitting on an airplane, she listened to the man in front of her on the phone arranging his pickup from the airport. He revealed enough in that conversation that she was able to find his name. “It’s actually crazy when you think about all of the things that are really NOT private!” she wrote to me in an email. "
1362,"Another wrote to say he’d de-anonymized a man in a loud conversation on the train. He overheard the man’s first name and typed it in combined with the name of the college on his shirt. The student explained in his email to me that even without a last name, he was able to find the stranger’s college major, minor and year of graduation. It helped that in one photo he was wearing the same outfit he wore that day on the train. "
1363,"People outside my classroom have had experiences similar to those of my students. This week, I tweeted a short thread describing the assignment. “This reminds me of a time at a Starbucks,” a user replied. “This dude was having like a fight with his accountant or something. Kept, loudly, repeating his SSN and full name on the phone. After the third time I wrote it down, and handed it to him.” "
1364,"Another Twitter user said the exercise reminded her of her mother’s rule to “never use a full name in public,” noting “most people who grew up in a small town had a similar rule, no?” Many probably did. We’ve always known that in a tight-knit community, a bar where everybody knows your name, or a tiny cafe with only three tables, every stray comment made is likely to be overheard and can become a permanent part of the speaker’s reputation. But today you can be in the stands of a major league ballpark and anyone with a smartphone and Google can connect the words you say “privately” in public to other aspects of your identity — your employer, your last vacation, your hobbies, your hometown, your friends. "
1365,"Does this exercise demonstrate that there’s no more privacy? No, but it does mean that you might have to make it happen for yourself. “If someone wants true privacy in this day and age your actions for achieving it must be intentional,” a user replied to my thread. “You have to work for privacy.”"
1366,"Networked technology has, as Helen Nissenbaum has written, “altered the meaning of public information” and made privacy in public a value to be protected. The exercise was a reminder that norms, not laws, govern a lot of this day-to-day personal privacy. There’s nothing illegal about Googling the guy loudly talking on his cellphone in line behind you at the grocery store, plugging whatever identifying details he provides into the search engine to learn more about him. But most of us don’t do it — why not? In part because it takes time and energy, but mostly we don’t do it because it’s a little “creepy,” as my students pointed out. The feeling of creepiness is the reaction to a norm being broken, a norm that values our individual ability to be private in public."
1367,"Norms are notoriously mercurial and thin protections, but we can do more to educate people and help preserve them, like decreasing the use of internet-connected devices and facial-recognition technology. But perhaps the most significant thing we can do is also the most personal: Treat every place as if it were a small town, and give everyone the privacy that you would give to your neighbor — and that you would want your neighbor to give to you. Also, if you decide to take a call when your plane is on the runway, keep your voice down. "

1369,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
1370,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
1371,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1372,A bus company has called lawmakers in New York asking for an exemption. A mayor in New Jersey warned drivers they might be tolled twice when they leave the state. Truckers are putting together a lobbying strategy. And taxi drivers have written a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seeking a reprieve.
1373,"One battle over congestion pricing is over. But now that the plan is officially coming to New York City, the next fight has begun: Who will pay, how much will it cost and who might get a break?"
1374,"The outcry began almost immediately after Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers reached a deal last weekend to make New York the first city in the country to enact congestion pricing. Starting in 2021, drivers entering the heart of Manhattan could pay $11 to $25, money that will be used to pay for improvements to the city’s troubled subway."
1375,"State leaders were careful to avoid including too many details in the legislation, in part over concerns that it would be harder to pass. Instead, they left many of the difficult decisions to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a yet-to-be-appointed six-member “traffic mobility review” board."
1376,But that has opened the way for various groups to try to influence the outcome in the months ahead and to make their case for exemptions and discounts.
1377,"“We will be having discussions with the panel to educate them on the trucking industry and the challenges they have when it comes to delivering in the zone,” said Kendra Hems, the president of the Trucking Association of New York. “We feel very strongly that the industry should be exempt from paying.”"
1378,But state officials and transit advocates say allowing too many loopholes could prevent the city from achieving its two major goals: reducing congestion and raising $15 billion for public transit.
1379,"“The intent is not to have a whole list of exemptions,” said Robert Mujica, the state budget director. “You’re trying to discourage people from driving into the zone — that’s the only way to reduce traffic.”"
1380,But that will not deter people from trying.
1381,"“Every constituency in town is going to ask for a special exemption and carve out, but part of what makes congestion pricing work is that it’s fair and applies broadly,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
1382,"The stakes are high to get it right. New York could serve as an example for other cities, like Los Angeles and Philadelphia, that are also considering the idea. If it is a debacle, other cities might abandon their plans."
1383,"In London, where congestion pricing began in 2003, the toll has risen to about $15 per day, from about $8. Residents who live in the zone get a discount, as do owners of low-emission vehicles. Taxis and other ride-hailing cars are exempt."
1384,"The New York legislation included only a broad framework: The congestion zone is below 60th Street in Manhattan, except for the West Side Highway and F.D.R. Drive, two busy roadways on each side of the island. Emergency vehicles and those carrying disabled people are exempt. People who live in the zone and earn less than $60,000 a year can receive a tax credit."
1385,The framework has left ample room for complaints.
1386,"Leaders in New Jersey say its drivers could get gouged. Gov. Philip D. Murphy asked Governor Cuomo for a discount for those who use the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest bridge."
1387,"Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, said on Twitter that New Jersey should seek revenge by tolling New York drivers to pay for upgrades for New Jersey Transit, the state’s sputtering commuter rail and bus network. If some bridges and tunnels are discounted and not others, he said, that could lead to major traffic jams at certain crossings."
1388,"“If you selectively exempt people based on politics, that’s a big issue for us,” Mr. Fulop said."
1389,"The backlash in the region has been swift. About 54 percent of New York City voters oppose congestion pricing and more than half believe it would not reduce traffic, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released on Tuesday."
1390,"Drivers will likely pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business hours, and less at night and on weekends, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam who was one of the architects of the congestion pricing plan. But if the authority starts handing out exemptions, that would likely push up tolls for everyone else to $15 or more."
1391,"“I think there should be just about no exemptions,” he said. “People using their cars contribute to congestion. It doesn’t matter what group they belong to.”"
1392,"But even Mr. Schwartz has not been able to escape the calls for exemptions from friends and neighbors in northern Manhattan. “People are calling me asking for their own personal exemptions — even neighbors of mine,” he said. “I’m not terribly popular at the moment.”"
1393,"Sean Hughes, a spokesman for Coach USA, which operates hundreds of buses in Manhattan daily, said he has been calling, emailing and meeting with state lawmakers to make a case for exempting buses. Mr. Hughes said buses reduce congestion by carrying people who would otherwise be driving."
1394,"“Busing is a form of mass transit that is a solution to congestion,” he said. “We should be exempt.”"
1395,"Several motorcycle clubs have also pressed state lawmakers for an exemption or discount, with their members saying that they should not have to pay the same fees as drivers since their two-wheelers contribute less to congestion than cars."
1396,"“One car can take the space of six bikes,” said Joseph Notovitz, 64, a branding specialist from Long Island who regularly rides his motorcycle to and from Manhattan and weaves around cars trapped in gridlock."
1397,"The transportation authority, the sprawling agency that oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads, will determine the tolls and exemptions based on recommendations by a “traffic mobility review” board. The authority’s board, which has representatives from across the region, must also approve the tolls."
1398,"The authority will appoint the mobility board, which must include one member recommended by New York City’s mayor. One member must live in the area served by the Metro-North Railroad and another must live along the Long Island Rail Road. Its findings are due around November 2020."
1399,"Mr. Mujica said the mobility board will review a traffic study analysis of bridges and tunnels and consider public input before deciding whether to credit drivers who already pay tolls. The board, which will likely have members with experience in public transportation and finance, will also come up with a plan for taxis and ride-hail vehicles, including Uber."
1400,"Uber, the popular ride-hail app, has been a key booster for congestion pricing. The company says it has spent more than $2 million to support the proposal. Uber has paid lobbyists more than $1 million in New York since 2017 and spent nearly $200,000 on television ads and phone calls to support congestion pricing last year, according to state records."
1401,"Uber officials say congestion pricing is the best way to relieve traffic in the city, instead of blaming Uber for congested streets and imposing a cap on new ride-hail vehicles. Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, declined to comment on whether Uber might seek an exemption from the congestion toll."
1402,"State Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said that he is pushing for a credit for Long Island commuters who use the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge on the way into Manhattan. “These people should not get double tolled,” he said."
1403,"The authority’s bridges and tunnels division will technically oversee the tolling program. Its acting president, Daniel DeCrescenzo, along with the new M.T.A. chairman, Patrick Foye, will have considerable power over the plan. So will Mr. Cuomo, who appointed Mr. Foye and has taken near total control over the transit agency."
1404,"Taxi leaders are writing a letter to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Foye asking for an exemption for an industry that has already been decimated by the rise of Uber. Nicolae Hent, a Queens taxi driver, said the new tolls in Manhattan could add up to hundreds of dollars a month."
1405,"“It’s another nail in the coffin,” he said. “Of course, I’m going to fight.”"
1406,"It is heartening to hear that Gov. Andrew Cuomo was at least able to get Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, on the phone."
1407,"The Times reported that the governor has had “multiple phone conversations with Amazon executives, including Mr. Bezos, over the past two weeks.”"
1408,"The conspicuous absence of Mr. Bezos, both in public and private, during the process to bring part of his company’s new headquarters to Long Island City, Queens, was perfectly illustrative of the collapse in communication among all parties that scuttled the deal last month."
1409,"There is no indication that Amazon is open to reopening talks about the project. But if a few tête-à-têtes might revive a deal worth $27 billion in potential tax revenue over the next two decades and 25,000 jobs, it’s certainly worth a try."
1410,"An open letter that ran as a full-page ad in The Times on Friday, promised that Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio would help shepherd the project through the community development and approval process, hopefully with far more transparency and far better communication than there was during the first go-round. "
1411,"In another development, State Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, an outspoken critic of the deal, is no longer nominated to to sit on the Public Authorities Control Board, which would have the ability to deep-six any final deal. "
1412,"The open letter, which was signed by more than 70 unions, current and former elected officials and business and community groups, acknowledged that the public debate was more like a one-sided shouting match. “We know the public debate that followed the announcement of the Long Island City project was rough and not very welcoming,” the letter said. “Opinions are strong in New York — sometimes strident.”"
1413,"But vigorous democracy and vigorous capitalism should be able to coexist. That would be an important lesson for Amazon, which pressured city officials in Seattle — its hometown — to repeal a business tax for housing and homeless service."
1414,"Those opposed to the New York project — a distinct minority of people in the city and the state — were not without cause for rage. The subways are rickety, the schools are dysfunctional, the rent is too damn high and getting higher. And the deal included $3 billion in tax benefits for a trillion-dollar corporation."
1415,"But progressives shouldn’t stand athwart progress, yelling stop. It’s not like that $3 billion can now be applied to city needs, as some seemed to think; it vanished along with the $27 billion in tax revenue that could, in fact, have helped address city needs. If New York has any hope of remedying its problems, it will need a robust tax base spread across many sectors. Real-world progressive governance requires revenue. "
1416,It would be good to see the governor and the mayor working the phones with Amazon. Let’s hope they’re also talking with their constituents — friend and foe alike — to make sure that a solid foundation is ready if the company decides to reconsider.

1420,Hope you had a bustling week and are looking forward to some adventurous listening this weekend. 
1421,"In memory of Michael Gielen, the searching conductor who died last Friday at 91 — read David Allen’s superb obituary — hear one of the selections David chose: Beethoven’s “Missa Solemnis,” rendered with cleareyed power."
1422,"Listen as you go about chores, or take the subway, or drive to the bank. You’ll be glad you did."
1423,"On Wednesday, I was at the Metropolitan Opera for the return of “Samson et Dalila” with a fresh cast — notably the galvanizing mezzo-soprano Anita Rachvelishvili. "
1424,"It was clear from the start that the Samson, Aleksandrs Antonenko, was struggling; after intermission, the Met announced that he was ill with a cold, and would be replaced by Gregory Kunde."
1425,"It’s not easy to jump into the middle of a performance, but Mr. Kunde did it with stylish ease. Now 65(!), he’s moved on from specializing in bel canto earlier in his career to the heroic roles of Verdi and Puccini. But he’s hardly ever sung at the Met. Hopefully that changes now."
1426,His success brought me back to an already classic recording of Rossini’s “Armida” made from 1993 performances in Italy. Here’s Mr. Kunde combining memorably with Renée Fleming:
1427,This week our critics reviewed the return of “Das Rheingold” to the Met; the New York recital debut of the pianist Beatrice Rana; the umpteenth Carnegie concert by the great violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter; and two concerts from Esa-Pekka Salonen and the Philharmonia Orchestra of London.
1428,"In darker news, the musicians of the Chicago Symphony have gone on strike, largely over proposed changes to their pension plan."
1429,"And Christine Goerke spoke with Michael Cooper about taking on Brünnhilde at the Met, where she was once in the young artists program. “I think if you talk to anyone who’s ever been a young artist in any house, it’s always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,” she said. “I’m going to be 50, and I still feel like I’m 24.”"
1430,Enjoy the weekend! ZACHARY WOOLFE
1431,"The night after Beatrice Rana’s New York debut, on the same stage (Zankel Hall), the fun was doubled in a fascinating program of exciting works for two pianos, performed by the formidable Kirill Gerstein, who can play anything, and Thomas Adès, an eminent composer who is also accomplished pianist. "
1432,"Recently they were with the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the premiere of Mr. Adès’s Piano Concerto, written for Mr. Gerstein. (They bring that work to Carnegie Hall on Wednesday.) At Zankel, they began with Debussy’s “En Blanc et Noir,” a late work, from 1915, which in this starkly beautiful and steely performance seemed not far removed from the shock-and-awe radicalism of Stravinsky’s “The Rite of Spring” (1913). "
1433,"Turning to Stravinsky, they played Shostakovich’s rarely-heard arrangement of the “Symphony of Psalms.” With the chorus part (a setting of psalm texts) divided between the pianos — and without the distraction, so to speak, of the score’s dark, percussive orchestral sonorities — the modernist daring of Stravinsky’s harmonic language came through stunningly. The program also included Mr. Adès’s stream-of-consciousness Concert Paraphrase from his opera “Powder Her Face,” and ended with an account of Ravel’s “La Valse” that had this showpiece sounding dangerous. Don’t believe me? Here they are playing it in Paris in 2016. ANTHONY TOMMASINI"

1439,"Mayor de Blasio looks like he’s running for president. No, seriously."
1440,"Even though a recent poll said most city voters are against the idea, Mr. de Blasio, who must leave office at the end of 2021 because of term limits, seems intent on joining the Democrats’ crowded field of White House contenders."
1441,[Read more about Mayor de Blasio’s presidential preparations.]
1442,"To understand this better, I spoke to The Times’s J. David Goodman, who has covered City Hall and now writes about the influence of money in politics."
1443,Our conversation was lightly edited for clarity and brevity.
1444,What are the signs that Mayor de Blasio is serious about running?
1445,He’s traveling and he’s fund-raising.
1446,"He’s traveled before, but there is a very explicit targeting of early primary states in his cross-country travel these days. You look at that and say that’s the kind of thing you would do. You have to get there."
1447,You need to get surrogates and win those local activists over so they don’t go with the other candidates. And you need to meet the money that isn’t available in New York City.
1448,"If people are going to write you a big check, generally they want to meet with you in person."
1449,Does running for president enable Mr. de Blasio to do something that he couldn’t do otherwise?
1450,"In the 2016 race, he tried to have an influence on the presidential conversation without being a candidate. It didn’t quite work."
1451,He may think that the way to do that this time is to actually be in the race. You saw that last time around with Bernie Sanders. He had far more influence as a candidate than you imagine he would have had if he tried to just have a political action committee and support some candidates in 2016.
1452,Maybe that’s what Mr. de Blasio is doing.
1453,"Running for president also helps stave off the effects of being a lame duck. He has to leave City Hall at the end of 2021. Already you’ve had people talking about the next mayor’s race, and it makes the mayor seem a little less powerful."
1454,What exactly is the influence the mayor wants to have? What does his fingerprint on 2020 look like? 
1455,"That’s a good question. He’s focused on affordable housing, universal prekindergarten and early education. He’s also talked about universal health care."
1456,"The trouble for him is that a lot of his ideas have been taken up, and people go further now."
1457,What would be the de Blasio signature issue to move the Democratic Party in a way that it’s not already moving? I think he has to answer that question.
1458,"I think his argument now is, liberalism works, and I did it in a big city and I’ll do it for the rest of the country. And he can make that argument in a way that a senator can’t as effectively, someone who hasn’t been an executive."
1459,But that’s not how presidential campaigns are won. They’re won on ideas and inspiration. The mayor has ideas. I’m not sure he’s always inspiring.
1460,Where do you think he would announce?
1461,I don’t have a good answer for that. What do you think?
1462,Maybe in front of his home in Park Slope?
1463,"Seventy-five percent of New Yorkers don’t want him to run, according to a Quinnipiac poll. What if people booed him at his announcement? Which could happen. It’s New York."

1520,"Good morning. I was wandering around one of those huge Midtown steam-table restaurants the other day, a wide, glass-fronted store with hot- and cold-food stations set around the perimeter for sandwiches and wraps, burgers and cheesesteaks, pasta and rice bowls, and two immense, segmented food tables in the middle. The whole place was crowded with men in Windbreakers. The aisles were tight with them, stamping around, waiting on griddled meat, spooning fried fish into plastic clamshells."
1521,"The hot bazaar was filled with what looked to be 1,100 different lunch options. There was sliced turkey breast and chicken teriyaki. There were barbecued ribs; fried shrimp and steamed pork dumplings; slices of meatloaf; lobes of baked salmon; tubs of vegetarian fried rice; sweet, glistening maduros; pan-fried noodles; mashed potatoes. The other set of troughs, dedicated to cold food, was equally laden with picnic prep. So here was mock crab and sliced watermelon and baby corn and sliced chicken cutlets and damp, soy-flecked tofu and vegetable “sushi” and drifts of blue-cheese crumbles and leaf piles of lettuce and wan tomatoes stacked vertically, like files in the offices upstairs. The list went on and on."
1522,"I found the whole thing overwhelming, mostly on account of all the people, the glaring, the coiled anger, as if we were all standing in a subway car resenting the other guy’s backpack. I bought nothing, spun out onto the sidewalk and then spent the rest of the afternoon regretting it. Turkey and fried plantains, pork dumplings and watermelon? That is one of my favorite meals."
1523,"Here’s another and if it, too, could come from a Midtown deli, it’s what I want to cook for this weekend’s feasting, a homage to the steam tables of Manhattan, to their abundance and joy: clams in black bean sauce to start, followed by grilled baby back ribs slathered in barbecue sauce, with a Burmese-style slaw on the same plate, with sesame noodles and spicy fruit salad (above)."

1581,"The building, a $475 million “flexible art space” (and feat of architectural engineering), has a small theater, galleries and a large performance space “that sits under an enormous silvery puffer jacket of shell,” Mr. Cooper said."
1582,"But what makes the Shed really stand out is its telescoping shell, which “can roll back and forth on rails,” he said. “When extended, it doubles the footprint of the Shed, creating a huge indoor space.”"
1583,"He added, “When it is rolled back over the main building, it exposes a large public plaza for outdoor performances or public space.”"

1596,"Federal prosecutors have written to Judge Caproni, saying that despite the credit card issue, he had been “a productive and helpful cooperating witness in an important public corruption case that sent a powerful deterrent message.”"

1624,"My Times colleague Nick Corasaniti, a Smorgasburg fan, offers this advice:"
1625,"• Show up hungry but don’t immediately hop in a long line, even if a short rib topped with chimichurri is at the queue’s end."
1626,"• Instead, grab a snack from a lineless vendor (an ice pop or some dumplings, perhaps?), and do a lap while you nibble. Survey whether the stalls are crowded by Instagramming mobs (maybe stay away) or satisfied finger-lickers (maybe follow suit)."
1627,• Bring a friend (or an audiobook) to keep you company.
1628,"On Saturdays, Smorgasburg is at East River State Park and features about 100 vendors, according to the organizers. On Sundays, it’s at Prospect Park and has about 80 vendors."

1644,Part of what makes this weekend’s official opening of the Shed so momentous is the sheer breadth of its programming.
1645,That is also what makes it a bit overwhelming.
1646,"Over the course of its inaugural season, the Shed — the low-lying, eye-catching, $475-million arts center amid the towers of Hudson Yards — will present concerts by Björk, a history of African-American music and exhibitions featuring the works of emerging New York City artists. It will pair Gerhard Richter with Steve Reich, Ben Whishaw with Renée Fleming, kung fu with the songs of Sia."
1647,"Here, we offer a guide to navigating the Shed, which officially opens on Friday: what’s on each floor, where to pause for a meal or a drink, and even how to get inside the building in the first place. "
1648,"ENTRANCES Take your pick. The main entrance, on the south side of the building at West 30th Street, leads to the Shed’s lobby, restaurant and shop. It’s situated directly underneath the High Line. There is another entrance on the north side, facing the Hudson Yards Plaza."
1649,COAT CHECK The north entrance will take you directly here. 
1650,"SUBWAY The closest line is the 7; the entrance is just north of the Shed, between 33rd and 34th Streets, on the Hudson Yards plaza."
1651,ESCALATORS These run along the south side of the building. Stairs and elevators are also available. 
1652,"1. LOBBY Here you’ll find ticket sales for the Shed’s programming, along with a shop (by McNally Jackson) and Cedric’s at the Shed, a restaurant and bar by Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group. Cedric’s will be open to the public throughout the day."
1653,"2. LEVEL 2 GALLERY Saturday through June 2, this capacious space will host “Reich Richter Pärt,” an installation that pairs the visual art of Gerhard Richter with live musical performances of original scores by Steve Reich and Arvo Pärt. The Richter-Pärt collaboration is an import from the Manchester International Festival; but Mr. Reich’s contribution, a musical analogue of Mr. Richter’s “Patterns” series, is a premiere."
1654,"3. THE McCOURT When the Shed’s signature shell is extended over the plaza, the building adds a cavernous space ideal for big concerts. (This is where Björk will perform in May.) And that’s exactly how the Shed officially opens on Friday: with the five-concert series “Soundtrack of America,” an exploration of the influence of African-American music on contemporary culture. It was conceived by Steve McQueen, will spotlight up-and-coming musicians, and runs through April 14."
1655,"4. THE PLAZA If the shell is nested over the building, however, the plaza is in the open air, and open to the public. Here the Shed has a permanent installation, Lawrence Weiner’s text-based work “IN FRONT OF ITSELF.”"
1656,"5. LEVEL 4 GALLERY Opening here on Saturday, and on view through May 30, is an exhibition of new and recent work by the artist Trisha Donnelly."
1657,"6. KENNETH C. GRIFFIN THEATER Inaugurating this 500-seat space is “Norma Jean Baker of Troy,” which runs from Saturday through May 19. The genre-blurring work, by the poet Anne Carson, is a monologue for Ben Whishaw, with sung interludes by the superstar soprano Renée Fleming."
1658,"7. THE SHOPS Beyond this retail space’s razzle-dazzle are dining options from reliably talented chefs like Thomas Keller (TAK Room), David Chang (Kawi), Costas Spiliadis (Estiatorio Milos) and José Andrés (Mercado Little Spain). The Snark Park offers changing exhibitions, and more art is to be found inside Neiman Marcus (including a wall of photographs by Bill Cunningham)."
1659,8. THE VESSEL Thomas Heatherwick’s Instagram magnet requires tickets for timed entry. (They can be booked online.) It has been compared to a shawarma and a trash can; what will it look like to you?
1660,9. EDGE The observation deck at 30 Hudson Yards — a spear-shaped cantilevered balcony that sticks out 65 feet from the skyscraper — is opening soon.
1661,"10. THE HIGH LINE Before Hudson Yards there was the High Line, designed in part by Elizabeth Diller, the same architect behind the Shed. Visitors can come and go from the elevated park, whose northernmost stretch surrounds Hudson Yards, near the Shed’s main entrance at 30th Street."

1663,"ALBANY — After months of frenzied lobbying, bitter infighting, late-night bill drafting and secretive negotiating, New York’s $175 billion state budget is finally here."
1664,You could call it the budget of progressive priorities. It’s the first budget in a decade to be negotiated between all Democrats — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Democrat-led State Senate and Assembly — and it will turn many long-neglected liberal priorities into reality.
1665,"But you could also call it the budget of compromises. Even as activists cheered the inclusion of certain issues, they also said some measures did not go far enough, or delivered on certain promises in name only."
1666,Here’s your guide to the deals that will shape life in New York this year and beyond.
1667,"The idea of charging drivers of vehicles that enter the busiest parts of Manhattan had been around for decades. But lawmakers from outside Manhattan always shot it down, worrying that their constituents would pay a price without reaping benefits."
1668,But now the subway crisis has reached a tipping point. 
1669,"Mr. Cuomo, who has been hammered by political opponents over the transit system that he controls, made congestion pricing a must-have in negotiations. Democrats campaigned on a promise to fix the subways, and even many legislators from outside Manhattan rallied behind the plan as a way to help the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "
1670,"“We’re at the point where the Assembly members understand the need to fund the M.T.A.,” Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker, said last week."
1671,"Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had pushed instead for a tax on the wealthy, agreed that congestion pricing was the only viable way forward."
1672,New York City will become the first city in the country to introduce congestion pricing.
1673,"The pieces seemed to be in place this year for legalizing recreational marijuana. Mr. Cuomo, who had long been skeptical of what he called a gateway drug, finally announced his support for legalization in December. And Mr. Cuomo is known for getting what he wants in Albany."
1674,But it quickly became clear that people had wildly different visions for legalization.
1675,"Well-financed medical marijuana companies wanted a stake. So did progressive black lawmakers, who opposed any bill that did not guarantee returns for their communities. Some suburban legislators did not want legalization at all — they worried about public safety and health effects."
1676,"Even though activists made a huge last-minute push — hundreds of people walked through the Capitol last week, chanting loudly for legalized marijuana — it was ultimately not included in the budget."
1677,"There’s still a chance that it could be passed separately in the remaining months of session. But it may be harder to force a vote without a looming budget deadline. And while there’s always next year, 2020 is an election year and few lawmakers are keen on taking controversial votes while up for re-election."
1678,"One of the most striking outcomes of last year’s election was the number of incumbents who were unseated, in spite of deeper pockets and, in many cases, party support. "
1679,"The challengers who replaced them vowed to push for a small-donor matching system, which would elevate the voices of everyday New Yorkers over megadonors, and could encourage more upsets in the future. "
1680,"That predictably unnerved some longtime politicians. After all, why would anyone want to change a system that had allowed them to win? Mr. Heastie said earlier this month that he wasn’t sure he had the votes to push through public financing. "
1681,"Hence the compromise: The budget guarantees a small-donor match system but leaves the details to a newly created commission, which would determine key details like the ratio of the match and contribution limits."
1682,"The commission could create a program like New York City’s, which matches donations 6 to 1. That would make New York the first state in the nation to have an active, robust matching program. Or it could create a toothless program that effectively keeps the old system in place."
1683,"""It's possible the commission could create a successful program,"" said Jessica Wisneski, co-director of Citizen Action of New York, a grass roots group. Or, she said, ""It could be a cynical attempt to kill reform."""
1684,"After Kenneth C. Griffin, a hedge fund billionaire, bought a $238 million penthouse in Manhattan — the most anyone had ever paid for a home in the United States — simmering anger around income inequality turned into sudden momentum for a pied-à-terre tax, which would tax ultraluxury second homes above $5 million."
1685,"But the powerful real estate industry, which has funded many officials’ campaigns, sprang into action. They especially opposed the recurring nature of the tax, which developers warned would devastate the high-end market. Tax experts also said that the proposal would be difficult to implement on top of the city’s antiquated property tax system."
1686,"So a compromise emerged, yet again: Instead of a recurring pied-à-terre tax, the state will raise the so-called “mansion tax” and the real-estate transfer tax on multimillion-dollar properties. Those taxes will be one-time fees and raise a combined $365 million."
1687,That’s less than some people had predicted a pied-à-terre tax would raise. But it also sends a clear message that those who can afford to pay will be expected to do so. 
1688,"In other words, real estate showed again that it has power in Albany. But maybe less than before."
1689,"Mr. Heastie, the first black Assembly speaker in state history, memorably said in January that he would have “been a failure as a black man if we did not reform the criminal justice system.” On Sunday, he could celebrate some major changes."
1690,"While cash bail will not be abolished entirely, as some had wanted, it will end for all but certain violent felonies. Mr. Cuomo’s office estimated that 90 percent of people charged with a crime would no longer be jailed before trial. "
1691,"Prosecutors will also be forced to reveal possibly exculpatory evidence to the defense far earlier in the discovery process, and speedy trials will be guaranteed."
1692,"These are all major victories for advocacy groups and public defenders, who have noted that New York’s discovery laws had previously ranked fourth worst in the nation. Rebecca Brown, director of policy at the Innocence Project, called Sunday’s package “transformational.”"
1693,"When it comes to describing how Mr. Cuomo felt about the sudden collapse of the plan to bring Amazon to New York City, rage might seem too gentle."
1694,"He called the deal’s opponents “ignorant” and “superficial.” He blasted them as politically motivated and insincere. He even suggested that the Senate Democrats had engaged in a form of “government corruption” by nominating a vocal opponent of the deal, Senator Michael Gianaris of Queens, to a board with possible veto power over it."
1695,"And he continued to make his anger known on Sunday, through a provision of the state budget that gives him “full discretion to immediately remove” a member of the board that Mr. Gianaris was nominated for, if the governor found that member was “acting, or threatening to act,” in any way that went beyond just fiscal analysis."
1696,"“It was never, ‘You come and you use your political wisdom.’ There was a very limited legal role,” Mr. Cuomo said on Sunday. “And a person who is acting outside their legal role should not be in that role.”"
1697,"Everyone (except perhaps the Republicans) was declaring victory on Sunday. And to a certain extent, everyone could."
1698,"Mr. Cuomo could claim victory on almost every priority he had outlined in his State of the State budget in January. He got a permanent property tax cap, a (limited) plan to publicly finance campaigns and bail reform. He could also tout another timely budget, a special point of pride."
1699,"The Senate and Assembly majorities could credibly claim to have made those policies possible, after years of being waylaid by a Republican-led Senate. They also were most likely not upset by the $10,000 pay raise that comes with a timely budget (though what “timely” means is a matter of some debate.)"
1700,"Liberal activists, who had spent the frenzied last week of the budget negotiations pacing the Capitol’s halls, meeting with legislators and hosting raucous rallies, could point to concrete outcomes."
1701,"But Albany’s longtime power brokers didn’t leave empty-handed either. They successfully talked legislators out of the pied-à-terre, and a fully formulated public financing program. Full-fledged ethics reforms to address pay-to-play scandals and strengthen freedom-of-information laws went unaddressed."
1702,"“It’s a mixed bag,” said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York, a government reform group. “A more open, lengthier process probably would have given us a stronger result. "
1703,“But I don’t want to undercut the fact that we’re at least talking about these things and at least moving some reforms.”
1704,"Turkey has entered a recession, recording two consecutive quarters of falling economic growth, according to government figures released Monday, casting a blow for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ahead of critical local elections at the end of the month."
1705,"Mr. Erdogan has led Turkey through 18 years of continuous growth — making it a leading emerging market — but much of the growth of the last few years has come through unrestrained borrowing. The lira also plunged in value in mid-2018, amid global investor concerns and a sharp fall in consumer demand."
1706,"The Turkish Statistical Institute announced that Turkey’s gross domestic product shrank by 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from the previous quarter, after seasonal adjustments. That fall followed a decline of 1.6 percent in the third quarter. A recession occurs, by some definitions, after two quarters of contraction."
1707,"A global economic slowdown has reduced demand for Turkish exports and raised the cost of credit for its businesses. Growth in the European Union, Turkey’s most important market, has slowed to a crawl while Italy is in recession and Germany close to one."
1708,"Economists had been warning of a recession for months as foreign investment in Turkey dried up over growing concerns about the rule of law as well as about its economic policies. Turkey’s growth was fueled in part by the availability of cheap foreign credit, but that credit flow has slowed, as in other emerging markets, after the Federal Reserve in the United States raised interest rates."
1709,"The government has been subsidizing big infrastructure projects like bridges, subways and Istanbul’s new airport, planned as the world’s busiest. Many businesses have borrowed in foreign currencies, which means their debt burdens rose as the lira fell."
1710,"By the end of the year, Turkish private-sector companies owed more than $250 billion in foreign debt, or nearly one-third the size of the country’s economy."
1711,"For all of 2018, Turkey still achieved growth of 2.8 percent, but the economy took a precipitous turn midyear as the lira weakened. Investment agencies have revised Turkey’s credit ratings, and Turkey’s banks have almost stopped lending."
1712,"Borrowing has become more expensive for Turkey and other emerging markets because investors have become wary of the risk, while rising interest rates and buoyant stocks have lured money back to the United States. Turkey has also been particularly hard hit by President Trump’s trade war. United States tariffs on Turkish steel imports are 50 percent, double the duties on steel from other countries."
1713,"Bankruptcies, meanwhile, rose in the last months of 2018, and inflation has remained over 20 percent for months."
1714,"Mr. Erdogan has ruled out turning to the International Monetary Fund for funds, emphasizing that he had taken Turkey out of an earlier program with the fund and paid off its debts. He has instead courted investment from Arab gulf countries and reduced some public spending."
1715,"Since a failed coup d’état two years ago that attempted to topple him, Mr. Erdogan has assumed more power over government agencies, including economic policy. He was re-elected in June and has brought all branches of government under the presidency."
1716,"He appointed his son-in-law, Berat Albyrak, as minister of finance and Treasury and through him has kept close control of the Central Bank. When Mr. Erdogan commented just before the election that he intended to be more involved with the bank, the lira sank to record lows."
1717,"The Central Bank halted the rout by lifting rates, but its integrity was in question. The Turkish currency lost 28 percent of its value in 2018."
1718,"The currency’s decline, as well as other factors, has hit Turks in their pocketbooks. Mr. Erdogan, who is personally leading his Justice and Development Party’s campaign for local elections, has opened subsidized markets stalls around the country to sell cheap vegetables to ease discontent."

1720,"It’s Thursday — and it is World Poetry Day! Enjoy these recommendations from David Orr, who writes the On Poetry column for the Book Review."
1721,"Weather: Grab the umbrella. Expect rain early in the day, throughout the afternoon and into the evening."

1723,"Visiting the American Museum of Natural History often feels like a New York rite of passage, whether you’re a student on a field trip, a tourist escaping the rain or a 20-something taking a hiatus from the Bushwick scene."
1724,"For decades, the museum has educated and entertained. But now it is acknowledging that some of its exhibits have also offended."
1725,One of the solutions: labels.
1726,What is happening at the museum?
1727,"As my colleague Ana Fota wrote, a diorama there depicts an imagined 17th-century meeting between Dutch settlers and the Lenape, a Native American tribe inhabiting New Amsterdam (now New York City)."
1728,"Critics said the diorama depicted cultural hierarchy, not a cultural exchange. The women did not wear impractical skirts that dragged behind them. Canoes would have been in the water next to the European ships."
1729,"To address that, the museum added 10 labels, identifying problems with the diorama and correcting the record."
1730,What prompted the change?
1731,"The labels were quietly added in October, after three years of protests from Decolonize This Place, a group urging institutions to acknowledge how marginalized people were represented. The museum consulted with outside experts but not the protest group."
1732,"Amin Husain, a visual artist and member of Decolonize This Place, said the labels work on this diorama “because it honors the fact that that was there to begin with, so it references the harm that has been perpetuated over the years. And then it says, ‘We’re going to tell you how that was wrong.’”"
1733,The group has said that more needs to be done. It has asked the museum to re-evaluate other exhibits and to move a statue of Theodore Roosevelt outside the building.
1734,"“That has a Native figure and an African figure subjugated to a Roosevelt president, on a horse,” Mr. Husain said. “Put it in the museum itself, and then label it.”"
1735,"Natasha Singh, 34, another visual artist and member of Decolonize This Place, said she wanted to see “complete systematic changes of the museum.”"
1736,What else in town should be changed?
1737,"A lot, Ms. Singh and Mr. Husain said. They are not alone."
1738,"When city officials discovered that there were only five statues depicting real women in public spaces, they rushed to plan at least five more."
1739,"Last year, focus turned to a statue of a 19th-century surgeon who conducted experimental operations on female slaves. It was moved from Central Park to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, where the surgeon was buried."
1740,"No other dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History are immediately slated to get new labels, but a review is underway of its Northwest Coast Hall, according to a museum spokesman."
1741,Ana Fota contributed reporting.
1742,The Times’s Graham Starr reports:

1780,"When the train pulled into the station, I looked up and down the platform to find her, but I didn’t see her."
1781,The train operator poked his head out the window. His smile was as bright as the sun.
1782,“Who are you looking for?” he said.
1783,"“Jackie,” I said."

1796,"The Church of the Redeemer, which was built in 1866 in Brooklyn’s Boerum Hill, mirrored the Gothic style of medieval churches in Europe. The condominium building rising in its place, however, looks toward Japan for inspiration."
1797,"Ryoko Okada, a principal and director of interior architecture and design at ODA New York, said she tapped into the Japanese aesthetics of “wabi-sabi,” or the art of finding beauty in imperfection, when designing 561 Pacific."
1798,"“It’s about finding natural materials that have an unconscious aesthetic,” she said of the many warm brown and gray materials she chose. The wood, stone, concrete and steel used in the interior all have knots and grains with very subtle imperfections, some of which will also change over time, she said. “It’s about celebrating what’s naturally incomplete.”"
1799,"Ms. Okada, a native of Japan, said the wooden slats found in the entryway of the 63-unit building resembles “koshi,” or wooden lattice entryways and window coverings found in traditional wooden townhouses in Japan called “machiya.” It allows some light in, but also keeps the entryway private, Ms. Okada said."
1800,"The hallway in the ground-level lobby lounge is made with light gray concrete-look porcelain tile, with dark solid wood and metal inlays separating each slab. This is inspired by “tobi-ishi,” or steppingstone, and “roji,” a lush, garden path that leads to a teahouse. Both are Japanese design features that make you consciously focus on where you are walking and block the outer world."
1801,"“I thought it would be great if residents can use the same thought process, where you can consciously start decompressing from the outside chaos when you get home,” Ms. Okada said."
1802,"The building is in a particularly hectic area, just a block from the major traffic intersection of Atlantic, Flatbush and Fourth Avenues, and close to the Barclays Center and the Atlantic Terminal and Atlantic Center shopping complexes."
1803,"Developed by Adam America Real Estate, the 12-story building will offer studios from $550,000, one-bedrooms from $850,000, two bedrooms from $1.375 million, and three-bedrooms from $2.275 million. Over a third of the apartments will come with private outdoor space. Sales start later this month."
1804,"Building amenities include a gym, a playroom, a rooftop sun deck with barbecue and dining stations, and bike storage. Sixteen parking spaces will be available for purchase for $150,000 each."
1805,"The building, expected to be finished early next year, will also have about 7,000-square-feet of ground floor retail space available."
1806,"Like other parts of the city, the Brooklyn condominium market was slower in the fall and winter months, but the mood has been rather upbeat from the start of the year, said Brendan Aguayo, senior vice president and a director at Halstead Property Development Marketing, the firm in charge of sales. Mr. Aguayo said he has seen a large increase in traffic, demand and deal velocity as interest rates have stabilized."
1807,"“Brooklyn condominium buyers are very sophisticated,” Mr. Aguayo said, noting their desire for “everything,” including high-end interior finishes, proximity to transportation and a vibrant neighborhood."
1808,"Being within easy walking distance to Park Slope, Fort Greene, Gowanus and Downtown Brooklyn will likely appeal to many buyers, Mr. Aguayo said."
1809,"“I think this building is on the forefront of the shift happening on Fourth Avenue and the renaissance of this corridor,” he said, referring to an anticipated rezoning of nearby Gowanus."
1810,"“Wabi-sabi embraces the imperfect and accepts that change happens,” Ms. Okada said when describing the building’s Japanese design inspiration. It’s a notion that works extremely well for a calm, welcoming home, but is undoubtedly hard for some neighbors to swallow as their immediate surrounding gets denser."
1811,"For those nostalgic for the Episcopal church that once stood here, one relic remains. A well-preserved mosaic tile that signaled the prominence of the church, which closed in 2010, still exists in the northwest subway exit on the corner of Pacific and Fourth Avenue."
1812,"For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here. Follow us on Twitter: @nytrealestate."
1813,"Land where there was none before. A careful ratio of places to live, work, eat and recline on lawns. A sense of being in New York, but not quite of it."
1814,"At first blush, Hudson Yards and Battery Park City, cities-within-a-city on the western edge of Manhattan, would seem kindred spirits."
1815,"But Hudson Yards, which is to wrap up by 2026, will have taken 18 years to complete its gleaming clump along 10th Avenue — and it remains to be seen how quickly the rest of the neighborhood will develop. Battery Park City, which lumbered across the finish line in 2011, took 45 years to fully form."
1816,"Battery Park City stretches across more space along the Hudson River in the financial district, but a similar number of buildings make up the two master-planned, mixed-use communities, which have both also enjoyed tax breaks and other public benefits."
1817,"Why Hudson Yards was able to come together quickly, relatively speaking, has a lot do with how the approach to creating whole-cloth neighborhoods has changed over the years, as the private sector has stepped in to fill voids left by the government, according to city officials, brokers and developers."
1818,"But also, vibes have changed. What was architecturally appealing a few decades ago now seems staid. Planners say that if the past was about fitting in, the present is all about standing out. In the end, they add, Battery Park City and Hudson Yards represent very different theories about development."
1819,"“Hudson Yards represents the 21st century, and Battery Park City represents the end of the 20th century,” said Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University. “They are just totally different.”"
1820,Both Hudson Yards and Battery Park City hatched from efforts to remake once-industrial areas that were not living up to their potential. 
1821,"Dirt unearthed during the construction of the first World Trade Center in the mid-1960s, plus sandier fill, allowed Battery Park City to essentially be sewn onto the edge of Manhattan, creating a bumped-out shoreline where rotting piers for fruit and vegetable shipments had stood before. "
1822,"But to make the 92-acre swath more than just a park required a huge investment: in sea walls, water pipes and electrical lines. And constructing that infrastructure fell to the state, which had to borrow a lot of money to make it happen. In 1972, the Hugh L. Carey Battery Park City Authority, the neighborhood’s quasi-public governing body, had to sell $200 million in state-guaranteed bonds — considering inflation, about $1.2 billion in 2019 dollars — to set the table for development."
1823,"But by 1979, there was still almost nothing to show for it. (The barren and beachy terrain drew sunbathers for years.)"
1824,"With payments on those bonds coming due, and little in revenue to pay its debt, the Authority had to sell even more bonds, $65 million worth, to avoid default. Doubling down on their bet, officials were buying time until rent-producing structures went up. It wasn’t until 1982 that the first building, the Gateway apartment complex, with 1,712 units, opened."
1825,"Hoping to avoid another dragged-out process, the city took a different tack with Hudson Yards, a 28-acre parcel being developed by the Related Companies and Oxford Properties Group at the heart of the neighborhood of the same name, where other projects are also underway."
1826,"Most of the Hudson Yards site is ribbed with railroad tracks, by way of the John D. Caemmerer West Side Storage Yard, where Long Island Rail Road trains rest before heading back to Nassau County."
1827,"To create the development site, the tracks had to be covered. But the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the property, wisely avoided building that platform itself, said Tom Wright, the president and chief executive of the Regional Plan Association, an urban research group."
1828,"By punting to Related and Oxford, which paid $1 billion for the rights to the site and built the deck, the M.T.A. made sure taxpayers wouldn’t be on the hook, said Mr. Wright, whose group supports the project."
1829,"“Battery Park City required the public to take on a lot more risk,” he said. But with the Hudson Yards model, “whether Related goes belly up, or not, is not our problem.”"
1830,"As a private entity, Related, the lead developer, was also able to work relatively quickly and avoid being subjected to shifts in public opinion. If the M.T.A. had been responsible for building the platform, for example, a subway crisis might easily have diverted its attention and stalled the project."
1831,"A bit of forethought also worked in the project’s favor. In the 1980s, when the Transportation Authority was undertaking a $196 million project to turn a defunct freight depot into the 30-track Hudson Yards rail yard, Richard Ravitch, who was then the chairman, realized the air above the new yard had great potential."
1832,"So he added enough space between the tracks to allow columns to stand between them, while also fortifying the ground to support huge weights. The groundwork for Hudson Yards was laid."
1833,"In 2008, the state received six proposals to develop the site and initially awarded development rights to Tishman Speyer, which controls Rockefeller Center. But as the Great Recession gathered steam, Tishman, which lost a key anchor tenant, Morgan Stanley, soon backed out, and Related took over."
1834,"Having fewer people calling the shots may also have helped. Battery Park City was constructed by a parade of companies, including Milstein Properties, LeFrak Organization and Zeckendorf, plus commercial builders."
1835,"But Hudson Yards is the result of a single company, which is a huge advantage, said Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor under Michael Bloomberg who pushed hard for the rezoning that created Hudson Yards as part of the city’s unsuccessful bid for the 2012 Olympics. "
1836,"“What’s very different is that one developer built the commercial and residential and retail space,” said Mr. Doctoroff, who has firsthand knowledge of both places. Early in his career, he worked at 200 Vesey Street in Battery Park City for Lehman Brothers, the investment bank that was one of the neighborhood’s first office tenants. He is now chief executive of Sidewalk Labs, a city-focused technology company headquartered at 10 Hudson Yards, the area’s first commercial tower."
1837,"As part of the Olympics proposal, a football stadium that would have become the home of the New York Jets would have been built on the western half of the train yards, but state officials spiked the plan in 2005 in the face of community opposition."
1838,"Mr. Doctoroff said he is still proud that the rezoning of the broader Hudson Yards neighborhood has allowed warehouses, parking lots and billboards to give way to stylish modern towers."
1839,"While Battery Park City may embody the lessons of the urbanist Jane Jacobs, who favored short blocks, Hudson Yards can feel derived from her opposite, master builder Robert Moses, whose approach was often big and muscular."
1840,The fits-and-starts history of Battery Park City is also evident in its varied designs.
1841,"Plans for Battery Park City went through multiple iterations. It started with a 1966 “towers in the park” plan for apartment buildings to house World Trade Center employees that Ada Louise Huxtable, the architecture critic for The New York Times, called “sterile high-rise towers in vacuous open space.” The plan estimated about 90,000 residents, a far cry from the 16,000 there today. "
1842,"By 1969, the Authority had scrapped that plan in favor of a more architecturally ambitious one, from Philip Johnson and other architects, that featured a mix of six-sided towers and smaller buildings with walls that sloped like pyramids. A third version in the 1970s added more offices, but was revised again in 1979 because corporations had started migrating to the suburbs to escape a crime-troubled metropolis."
1843,"“I think the original designers were people that didn’t like the city very much, because they kept giving a cleaned-up view of what the city could be,” said Stan Eckstut, the architect who, along with Alexander Cooper, was tapped for that fourth version."
1844,"Aiming for a traditional extension of Manhattan, Mr. Eckstut aligned streets with existing ones in the financial district, while creating small blocks, in a Jacobs-type gesture."
1845,"Today, Battery Park City is probably best known for its brick-and-stone buildings, many from the 1980s, after developers finally came around, although there are exceptions, like the parabolic Visionaire, a condo high-rise built in 2008. The last two apartment buildings to go up, in 2011, were the rentals Liberty Luxe and Liberty Green. "
1846,"Many blocks have an unvarying appearance, the urban equivalent of a subdivision, and critics have pounced on that conformity."
1847,"Rent-regulated housing is a modest percentage of the total. But a portion of payments collected by the Authority — residents don’t pay property taxes, but fees that are similar — goes to New York City to be spent on affordable housing development elsewhere in the city, though it has been tapped for other purposes. Last year, the city took in $197 million, according to the Authority."
1848,"People who work in Battery Park City are clustered in Brookfield Place, a warren of interconnected office buildings interspersed with shops formerly known as the World Financial Center, whose enclosed, climate-controlled walkways evoke, in a sense, Johnson’s vision. Also inside is the Winter Garden, an airy, skylighted space with 16 palm trees that holds events like Best Brews, a New York-focused craft-beer tasting."
1849,"In 2015, after a four-year, $300 million effort, landlord Brookfield Properties revealed a renovation of the retail spaces, including Le District, a 30,000-square-foot French-style market and Hudson Eats, a food hall dedicated to New York-only restaurants."
1850,"Brookfield also installed high-end shops, but the mall’s anchor tenant, a multilevel Saks Fifth Avenue department store, closed this winter after less than two years. Competition for upscale shoppers is stiff because Westfield, a sprawling mall in the nearby Oculus transportation hub, is a quick walk away."
1851,"Outdoor green spaces include Teardrop Park, whose rocky walls recall the Catskills, and Rockefeller Park, whose wide-open lawns offer Hudson views."
1852,"“The sentiment seems the same between us and Hudson Yards. It’s ‘I want to be in a Manhattan that doesn’t feel like Manhattan,’” said Wesley Stanton, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate."
1853,"“But from a sales perspective, it’s very different,” Mr. Stanton said. While apartments at 15 Hudson Yards, a condo that opened this winter, average $3,300 a square foot, he noted, prices in Battery Park City are lower, as at the Ritz-Carlton condo, where units average $2,300 a square foot."
1854,"The blocks at Hudson Yards, by contrast, don’t feel as plugged into the street grid. The view ahead when walking west on West 31st Street, which ends at the development, is of the site’s soaring seven-story mall and the tall logo of its most prominent tenant, Neiman Marcus."
1855,"Streets like West 33rd will eventually bisect the site, and there are other ways in. But the site poses an inconvenient hindrance, in the form of that platform, which in places is the equivalent of three stories in the air, Mr. Doctoroff said. If parts of the site feel like a Moses-style superblock akin to Lincoln Center, that’s likely the explanation, he added."
1856,"Since 2012, when Related broke ground, buildings have been slow to arrive. But last month, much of the first phase, between 10th and 11th Avenues and West 30th and West 32nd Streets, opened to the public. The second phase stretches west to the West Side Highway, and the platform over that portion of the rail yards has yet to be built."
1857,"Inside the mall, upscale shops like Cartier, Rolex and Molton Brown line conventional-looking corridors. Dining options seem light years ahead of the food courts of old, including Thomas Keller’s TAK Room, David Chang’s Kawi and the Drug Store, a “nonalcoholic bar.” There is also a compact outpost of Citarella, the gourmet grocery chain, while Battery Park City leans on a pair of Gristedes."
1858,"Trees and greenery, for now, are limited. But public spaces that recently opened include Vessel, a shiny sculpture that encourages climbing, and the Shed, an all-purpose and telescoping arts center. "
1859,"There was hardly free rein at the site, said Marianne Kwok, a director of the architecture firm KPF, which has worked from the get-go on the platform, site plan and buildings. Designers had to sift through “two telephone-book-size books of rules and regulations,” said Ms. Kwok, who analyzed Battery Park City, among other neighborhoods, for inspiration."
1860,"Unlike in Battery Park City, each Hudson Yards building had to have a singular appearance; some towers angle and others curve. Every corporate tenant “wants to have brand,” Ms. Kwok said. Indeed, Hudson Yards is also a far cry from the homogeneous Rockefeller Center, the 1930s complex considered a master-planning pinnacle. “Individuality is now what’s desired,” she said."
1861,"It may be working. A hefty 82 percent of the office spaces in the eastern half of the site, which is mostly commercial buildings, has been spoken for, even though some of the buildings are not yet open, according to Related."
1862,"Tackling mostly offices first was an important decision, Mr. Moss said. “The game plan is genius,” he said, adding that an office tower can be filled with a handful of tenants, unlike an apartment building, which needs hundreds of them and can take much longer to fill."

2042,*The Hudson Yards development site compared to the Battery Park City neighborhood | **Projected | ***Includes about an acre of city park between Hudson Yards Nos. 50 and 55
2043,By The New York Times
2044,"Now Related has a nice critical mass to publicize the residential buildings on the unbuilt western half, he said, dismissing criticisms that the affluent enclave is not for everyday New Yorkers: “They took a rail yard and made it a productive part of the city’s economy.” "
2045,"Overall, Related will have to build 1,300 units of housing that are affordable, or reserved for those in certain income brackets. Those units can be built on site or elsewhere."
2046,"Less public money has flowed to Hudson Yards, the development, than to Battery Park City, but the amount spent in the neighborhood has not been insignificant. The city has had to pay $359 million in interest on bonds for infrastructure projects, although property taxes are supposed to start covering that debt now that buildings are open."
2047,"Assessing the success of the condos is tougher. The first building, 15 Hudson Yards, went on the market two and a half years ago, and is only 60 percent sold. And 35 Hudson Yards began selling its units, which start at $5 million, in March."
2048,"Battery Park City has a ferry stop, but no subway service. But at Hudson Yards, a four-year-old 7 train stop is on site. Brokers remain confident that the subway service will be key to the project’s success, even as critics have called the $2.4 billion transit project, which sits near several Related buildings, a pricey subsidy."
2049,"Criticism of change doesn’t surprise Roger Del Valle, a prop stylist who has lived in Manhattan since 1995 and owns a studio in the Flatiron district, but is hunting for a home in Hudson Yards."
2050,"“I know people have mixed feelings about Hudson Yards,” said Mr. Del Valle, who has visited the mall and enjoys its “spark.” “But it’s a part of New York City now. And ignoring it is not going to make it go away.”"

2053,It’s Monday. 
2054,Alternate-side parking: Suspended on Monday and Tuesday for snow removal.
2055,"Weather: The snow has moved out of New York City and the surrounding area. Still, temperatures across the region are forecast to remain close to freezing this morning, which may mean hazardous conditions on area roads throughout the day and into the evening."
2056,"Watch out for ice, especially slippery streets and walkways."
2057,"As of 10 a.m., at least 10,000 homes and businesses were without power across New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, according to local utility companies."
2058,"Morning commute: With the snowfall stopping well before rush hour, the subways ran without significant weather-related delays through the morning commute. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro North also reported good service."
2059,"New Jersey Transit did not report any major cancellations or delays to service but advised commuters to check its website throughout the day for information. It also said it was allowing customers to use their tickets or passes on rail, light rail, buses and private carriers."
2060,"All New York City public schools are closed today, and many other school systems around the region are closed or opened late."
2061,The City University of New York also announced it would be closed.
2062,[Was Mayor de Blasio too quick to close city schools?]
2063,"The snow: Up to 10 inches of snow had been expected to fall overnight, and officials had warned that the most intense precipitation could come just before the commute."
2064,"Around 4 a.m., the wintry mix began tapering off."
2065,"In Central Park, 5 inches of snow had fallen by 6:48 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. Parts of New York and New Jersey had more than a half-foot of snow, the weather service said, and snowfall totals were close to a foot in parts of Connecticut."
2066,Get the latest snowfall totals here.
2067,"By midmorning, the lingering clouds will clear. Expect a high near 38 and a windchill that could make it feel in the 20s."
2068,"If you’re cranky about your Monday morning, it could be worse."
2069,There’s a major cold snap across much of the central and eastern regions of the country. Temperatures in the Midwest were expected be 20 to 30 degrees below normal. Subzero wind chills were forecast in the Northern Plains.
2070,"The bottom line: Wear your boots, and layer up. And expect longer commutes this morning."
2071,"Last year, Amazon announced plans to open a major campus in New York City."
2072,"On Valentine’s Day, it called the whole thing off."
2073,"Then, Governor Cuomo began a campaign to woo it back."
2074,Here’s what you need to know:
2075,"• The Times broke the news that Mr. Cuomo had spoken to multiple Amazon executives by phone over the last two weeks, including the company’s owner, Jeff Bezos. That they even took his calls after the deal’s collapse is a ray of hope for supporters."
2076,"• The Times also reported that a prominent critic of the plan, State Senator Michael Gianaris, is no longer set to join an obscure state panel that could have given him veto power over the deal. Leroy Comrie, a Queens state senator, recently replaced Mr. Gianaris as the nominee to the panel, known as the Public Authorities Control Board."
2077,"• The day after that news broke, a full-page ad appeared in The Times, signed by more than 70 prominent supporters, urging Mr. Bezos to reconsider. The ad said Mr. Cuomo would “take personal responsibility for the project’s state approval.”"
2078,"• On the day the ad appeared, Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview that Mr. Gianaris and another prominent critic of the deal, Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, were “irrelevant because there are other ways the state can get it done.”"
2079,"• As one Albany reporter humorously noted, Mr. Cuomo’s latest push seemed to resemble an article from the satirical news outlet The Onion, which pictured the governor furiously chasing down a limousine carrying Mr. Bezos."
2080,"The takeaway: This is not all about Amazon. The company hasn’t commented, and Mr. Cuomo said he had no reason to believe the deal was back on. But Mr. Cuomo is signaling to other businesses: New York is still primed for deals that create jobs."

2101,"Mardi Gras, which ends Tuesday, is a celebration of the decadent. So is New York."
2102,"And yet, Mardi Gras’s famous dessert — the king cake — never really arrived in New York."
2103,The cakes are large yeasted pastries (more of a cinnamon roll than a birthday cake) topped with icing and glittery sprinkles. A plastic baby is hidden inside the loaf. Whoever gets the slice with the figurine inside is “king” for the day and obligated to host next year’s Mardi Gras party.
2104,"“No one has a king cake” in New York, said St. John Frizell, a restaurateur who lived in New Orleans for a decade before moving here in 1999."
2105,"He was exaggerating, but only a little. A handful of New York establishments sell it, including Whole Foods and some fancy bakeries."
2106,"Yet, finding good king cake is hard. One man jokingly wrote on Twitter that he was quitting his job “to open a full-time king cake bakery in NYC because I can’t find a single place that reliably sells them.”"
2107,"By now, it’s too late to order the real stuff from New Orleans. And even the delicious-looking substitutes offered by the Doughnut Plant are, somehow, not quite the same."
2108,"When asked if he served king cake at his restaurant in Red Hook, Mr. Frizell laughed."
2109,"“You would never see it at a restaurant,” he said. “You do want to experience it, not for the taste but for the sensation of sharing with friends and family at Mardi Gras time.”"
2110,"If you’d like to try making a king cake for your house party, try this New York Times Cooking recipe that serves up to 12."

2125,"Though “The Devil Wears Prada” may have been unintentionally documentary, not every viper pit cliché about fashion and its affiliates holds true. The loopy, fragile and gifted individuals who populate that world also often operate as an extended family, albeit a loose-knit and occasionally dysfunctional one. Seldom is this more evident than when trouble befalls one of their own."
2126,"Such is the case with Pat Cleveland, 68, a superstar model celebrated for her catwalk swirls, her irrepressible spirit and her occasionally dotty New Age pronouncements. Not long after a stellar March appearance in a Tommy Hilfiger show during Paris Fashion Week, Ms. Cleveland returned to France from her home in southern New Jersey — she and her husband, the former model Paul Van Ravenstein, raise peacocks there — to film a L’Oréal ad with her daughter, Anna Cleveland, also a model, and was taken ill. "
2127,"A doctor at Le Meurice hotel prescribed pain relievers for what were thought to be ordinary stomach complaints and suggested she check back with him in the morning. By then her condition had worsened, and she was advised to check herself into the American Hospital of Paris immediately."
2128,"“The doctor there said, ‘We just got you in time,’” Mr. Van Ravenstein said this week in a Skype call from the French capital, where Ms. Cleveland is recovering from emergency surgery for colon cancer. “She could have died.”"
2129,"Because the model’s basic Medicare coverage did not encompass treatment outside the United States, Mr. Van Ravenstein said, the couple was abruptly confronted with staggering medical costs. “We’re normal people, and it’s not like we have huge funds,” he said. “I was talking to friends, and they said we should do a GoFundMe, that it’s absolutely normal these days.”"
2130,"Establishing a page on the crowdfunding platform on March 31, Mr. Van Ravenstein soon found himself overwhelmed by the generosity of Ms. Cleveland’s extended fashion family and the alacrity with which it rushed to her assistance. “The response has been incredible,” he said."
2131,"With donations ranging from $5 to $10,000, the GoFundMe drive raised more than $100,000 in two days toward a projected goal of $150,000. Funds flowed in from family, friends, fans and a donor list that reads like a Who’s Who of fashion: the designers Anna Sui, Kim Jones, Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen, Thierry Mugler, Kimora Lee Simmons and Elsa Peretti; the models Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen, Marisa Berenson, Marpessa Hennink and Lineisy Montero; the photographers Inez van Lamsweerde, Vinoodh Matadin, Roxanne Lowit and Steven Klein; the stylists Patti Wilson, Frans Ankone and Katie Grand; and the D.J.s Mia Moretti, Marjorie Gubelmann and Michel Gaubert."
2132,"Acknowledging that the industry is not renowned for its charity, Mr. Van Ravenstein said that when it came to his wife’s illness, “people said, ‘Look, this is our sister, our Pat. We have to help her.’ She has touched a lot of lives in her career.”"
2133,"And it is true that in the five decades since a Vogue editor spotted an 18-year-old Ms. Cleveland on a subway platform, fascinated by her style, and recommended that she sign with Wilhelmina Models as one of the first African-American beauties to join a major agency, she has remained a constant and often jubilant presence in the industry, a favorite of artists, photographers and designers alike. "
2134,"Antonio Lopez drew her. Karl Lagerfeld danced with her on the cafe tables of Paris. Halston considered her first among his so-called “Halstonettes.” The photographers Richard Avedon, Guy Bourdin and Steven Meisel all immortalized her on film. "
2135,"“She is the all-timer superstar model,” André Leon Talley, the longtime Vogue eminence, once wrote of Cleveland, adding, with typical hyperbole, that in her heyday she was considered “the Josephine Baker of the international runways.”"
2136,"Before her recent illness, that heyday could be said to have extended to the present since, in recent years, Ms. Cleveland experienced a substantial late-life comeback, finding herself cast for a many runway shows besides Mr. Hilfiger’s and hired to star in advertisements, including the one she was scheduled to shoot for L’Oréal before her emergency hospitalization."
2137,"“It was a total shock because we’re vegans, we don’t drink, we don’t smoke, we live in the country and feed our peacocks,” Mr. Van Ravenstein said, adding that Ms. Cleveland’s doctors are expected to release her from the hospital this week so that she can return to the United States for chemotherapy."
2138,"“She’s doing well, she’s strong and she’s going to beat this,” he said. “And already she’s thinking about using this as a platform to talk publicly about the uninsured girls in the business that don’t have the backup that she has.” "
2139,"“Or course, she feels the passion and concern and heartfelt support she’s gotten is beautiful,” he added. “But she also knows that not everybody is so lucky.”"
2140,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together."
2141,The first things I noticed when I got to the St. Regis Hotel in Midtown Manhattan were the unmarked police cars out front. I wondered if Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo had already gone inside.
2142,"That might make casually strolling into his $25,000-per-couple fund-raiser on the top floor a little more complicated."
2143,"The whole event had been a closely-guarded secret. The invitation included a date and a time but no location. To find out where it was happening, an R.S.V.P. was needed. Or, in my case, a helpful source."
2144,I had made plans to show up at the fund-raiser a few weeks earlier when I was reporting on an article about what people often call “the circuit” in Albany: simultaneous fund-raisers that take place within walking distance of the State Capitol when the Legislature is in session.
2145,"During that reporting, I learned that Mr. Cuomo would be having a fund-raiser in New York City on March 14. The timing struck me: The governor and state lawmakers would be in the midst of deciding the state budget, due on April 1. At the very least, it seemed like a convenient time to ask people for political contributions."
2146,"[Read: A Secretive Dinner Where $25,000 Buys Access to Cuomo (and Filet Mignon)]"
2147,I guessed that some of those who would be donating to Mr. Cuomo — like those who go on the circuit in Albany — would have a strong financial stake in various elements of the budget. I wanted to know who would be there.
2148,"I began to ask around to find the address and eventually learned that the somewhat cloak-and-dagger affair would be held in a space on the 20th floor of the St. Regis, a luxury hotel where the cheapest rooms run about $1,000."
2149,"Cocktails were at 6 p.m., dinner 30 minutes later. The governor would be making a speech."
2150,"I knew that I would not be able to sit for dinner without a ticket, but hoped that I could blend in with the crowd for cocktails. So the evening of the event, March 14, I wore a suit, boarded the E train and set off."
2151,"Naturally, the subway was delayed."
2152,"When I got to the hotel, I walked straight inside, asked for The Roof — which is actually an indoor ballroom-style space — and took the elevator up with a couple of French tourists."
2153,"Once on the 20th floor, I immediately ran into a lobbyist I knew, who seemed surprised to see me. Because of the train delay, I arrived at about 6:15 p.m. and many of the guests had already entered. There was no way to blend in with the crowd because there was no crowd; just a phalanx of young staff at a check-in table."
2154,I had no choice but to introduce myself.
2155,"“Hi, I’m David Goodman with The New York Times. Can I go inside?”"
2156,"No way, one man said. News media not allowed."
2157,"I asked to speak to a press person, but none was available. I asked the staffers who they were with and they said “the campaign.” I asked for what Mr. Cuomo was campaigning. President in 2020? Re-election in 2022?"
2158,They could not say.
2159,"Before I turned to go, I noticed the table in front of me had the name tags of more than 30 invited guests. I took out my phone and snapped a picture, thinking I would be told to stop. No one said anything. I took two more and then left."
2160,"After that, I posted on Twitter about the event but did not let on that I had names of some of the guests."
2161,The list proved to be a gold mine. I began looking into each name.
2162,"Some I recognized, like John Catsimatidis, the politically-involved supermarket magnate. Others were unfamiliar. I began with simple web searches to find out who they might be. Then I called them and asked if they had attended. If they did, I got them to describe the scene as they remembered it. A few were invited but said they did not attend."
2163,"There were executives whose companies are right now lobbying the state. There were union heads with ongoing state business. Joining them at the fund-raiser was the state budget director, who, Mr. Cuomo’s staff said, happened to be in New York City that day."
2164,"For most who were there, the fund-raiser was an unremarkable event."
2165,"But for me, its very banality for those involved was the reason to show readers, who might never attend such an event, what it entails. This sort of thing, perfectly legal but held in secret, is commonplace in the American political system — one big-dollar fund-raiser among many."

2167,“It takes strength to be an empathetic leader.”
2168,"— Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, of New Zealand, who’s been guiding her country through a crisis after a mass shooting last week"
2169,"In the hours after the shooting, she wore a black head scarf while comforting victims’ families, embracing and grieving alongside them. "
2170,"When President Trump asked her what he could to to help, she responded: “Sympathy and love for all Muslim communities.”"
2171,"And on Wednesday, just six days after a man gunned down worshipers in two New Zealand mosques, killing 50, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made a swift gesture: banning military-style semiautomatic weapons."
2172,"“We are one, they are us,” she said of her country’s Muslims, many of whom are migrants or refugees. That unifying cry has become a symbol of her response. "
2173,"In the aftermath of the massacre, Ardern has strayed from the usual post-attack script — drawing international praise for her ability to mix empathy with concrete action, shaping her path as a compassionate but defiant and decisive leader. "
2174,"Ardern, 38, the youngest female world leader, “has set high benchmarks for messaging and leadership during this crisis,” Sushil Aaron, a New Zealand-based journalist, wrote in a Times Op-Ed this week."
2175,"Her plan for immediate policy changes “stands in stark contrast to the stalemate and resistance to change that has stymied similar calls for restrictions on firearms in the United States,” Damien Cave, The Times’s Sydney bureau chief, and Charlotte Graham-McLay reported from Christchurch, where the attack took place."
2176,"In her address to Parliament this week, Ardern opened with the Arabic greeting “as-salamu alaykum,” meaning “peace be upon you.” "
2177,"She continued by calling the shooting a terrorist act — and by refusing to speak the suspected shooter’s name. “He is a terrorist,” she said of the man, who had espoused white supremacist ideology. “He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless.”"
2178,"Meanwhile, Ardern confirmed that victims and their families would receive financial assistance from the New Zealand government, and she called for a global effort to eradicate right-wing extremism. "
2179,"“We cannot think about this in terms of boundaries,” she said."
2180,It didn’t take long for leaders across party lines and around the world to recognize and applaud Ardern’s approach. 
2181,"She “has won the hearts of Pakistanis for her compassion and for her leadership,” Mohammad Faisal, the spokesman for Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, wrote on Twitter. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, recalled that, in a visit to his city last year, Ardern had stressed “the importance of inclusivity and equality in society.”"
2182,"Even Judith Collins, a New Zealand politician and an opponent of Ardern’s party, called the prime minister’s work “outstanding” and praised her for wearing a head scarf. "
2183,"“It is a mark of respect,” Collins said. “I thought it was the right thing to do.” "

2197,Our guide to film series and special screenings happening this weekend and in the week ahead. All our movie reviews are at nytimes.com/reviews/movies.
2198,"AMOUR OR LESS: A BLIER BUFFET at the Quad Cinema (through March 21). Imagine “A Clockwork Orange” as a screwball comedy, and you would be pretty close to Bertrand Blier’s “Going Places” (on Friday, Tuesday, Thursday and March 16), which stars Gérard Depardieu and Patrick Dewaere as thugs who drift across France stealing money and cars and assaulting women, usually without consequence. Was Blier celebrating their behavior? Critics disagreed. Pauline Kael called the film an “explosively funny erotic farce,” while Roger Ebert said it was “the most misogynistic movie I can remember.” In the Quad’s career-reviving Blier series, “Buffet Froid” (on Friday, Sunday, Tuesday and March 21), first shown in 1979, holds up better. A pitch-black comedy that borrows heavily from Luis Buñuel and Albert Camus and perhaps looks forward to “After Hours,” the movie casts Depardieu as an unemployed man who may or may not have knifed an accountant in the subway, a murder that — like all the others in this movie — is treated as no big deal by his neighbor, a police inspector (the director’s father, Bernard Blier). “Get Out Your Handkerchiefs,” which won Blier an Oscar in 1979, will get a full run beginning on March 15.212-255-2243, quadcinema.com"
2199,"CANADA NOW 2019 at IFC Center (through March 10). This annual sampling of movies from our neighbor to the north always reflects the diversity of Canadian cinema. “Edge of the Knife,” screening on Saturday, is set in 19th-century British Columbia and is said to be Canada’s first Haida-language feature, with an all-Haida cast reviving two near-lost indigenous dialects for the film. Other titles such as the documentary “Hugh Hefner’s After Dark: Speaking Out in America” (on Friday), about two TV shows the Chicago-born Playboy magnate spearheaded, are Canadian productions in disguise.212-924-7771, ifccenter.com"
2200,[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.]
2201,"‘EMPIRE’ at the Whitney Museum (March 9, 1 p.m.). In a cinematic career known for offscreen intimations of oral sex (“Blow Job”) and movies with Edie Sedgwick in her undergarments (“Poor Little Rich Girl,” “Beauty #2”), Andy Warhol made what is perhaps his most notorious film in “Empire” — which simply captured Empire State Building from shortly after 8 p.m. until nearly 3 a.m. one night in July 1964. (Jonas Mekas, who died in January, was part of the small crew who helped film the movie from the 41st floor of the Time & Life Building.) “Empire” treats time itself as a variable: According to the Museum of Modern Art, when projected, the film is meant to be slowed down so that it runs slightly more than eight hours. The Whitney is screening “Empire” this Saturday as part of its exhibition “Andy Warhol — From A to B and Back Again,” which includes a large sampling of Warhol’s moving-image output.whitney.org/exhibitions/film"
2202,"‘GIRL 6’ at Alamo Drafthouse (March 11, 7 p.m.). This 1996 feature from Spike Lee, with a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows a struggling actress (Theresa Randle) who takes work as a phone sex operator. Currently unavailable to stream, the film was not one of the director’s biggest hits critically or commercially, but even mixed reviews suggest it has its upsides. “Bold colors, a dance track of Prince songs, a parade of wild costumes, good-humored sexual teasing and warmly inviting cinematography by Malik Sayeed all contribute to this comedy’s high-energy party mood,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.718-513-2547, drafthouse.com/nyc"
2203,"SEE IT BIG! COSTUMES BY EDITH HEAD at the Museum of the Moving Image (through March 10). The museum’s retrospective on the legendary costume designer closes with a weekend of Hitchcock. Grace Kelly and Cary Grant don their best (and Grant, his cat-burglar suit) on the French Riviera for “To Catch a Thief” (on Friday), while Tippi Hedren is impeccably well dressed for both the avian attacks in “The Birds” (on Saturday and Sunday) and for safecracking in “Marnie” (on Saturday and Sunday), in which Head’s tailoring is just one element of the sophisticated color scheme in Hitchcock’s depiction of repressed trauma.718-784-0077, movingimage.us"
2204,"Sometimes, when life throws you a curve, it can be a golden opportunity. Jasmit Singh Rangr was happily settled in Manhattan, running Rangr Studio, the design practice he founded in 2004, when in 2014, his wife, Abigail Dillen, was offered a vice president’s job at her longtime employer, Earthjustice, that required moving to San Francisco."
2205,"“I loved being in New York,” Mr. Rangr said. But at least the move would allow the couple and their now-6-year-old son, Sher, to leave what he described as their “dismal little Upper West Side rental.”"
2206,"Ms. Dillen — who is now the president of Earthjustice, a nonprofit that uses the court system to protect the environment — suggested looking in the Berkeley Hills. After going through the now-common experience of finding a house, only to be outbid by someone with lots of ready cash, the couple discovered a bank that would lend them the money to buy an empty lot (preferably one with a view, which would maximize resale value). Through a combination of dogged research and luck, they found property that they could buy for its appraised value rather than the market price. And on this steeply sloping site, Mr. Rangr designed a spare, light-filled house that measures 2,850 square feet, but takes maximum advantage of a view that includes the Bay Bridge, the Golden Gate Bridge and Mount Tamalpais in Marin County. He and his family moved in, in late 2016."
2207,"The multimillion-dollar view notwithstanding, the couple’s budget was tight, and Berkeley’s seismic and energy codes are strict. Mr. Rangr’s design manages these givens seamlessly. From the street, you see only the top floor of the three-story house. It contains an entry space with a powder room and a closet, and an open living-dining-kitchen space. The floor below contains a master bedroom, a child’s room and a guest room, as well as two bathrooms. The bottom floor, which is reached by an interior stairway and stone steps that lead down the hill from the entrance, contains Mr. Rangr’s office; its small open kitchen and a bathroom also make it suitable for guests or an au pair."
2208,"Mr. Rangr, who is fond of creating what he calls “inhabitable interstitial spaces,” conceived of the living area as a glass-enclosed version of a screened porch, inspired by the verandas of the houses his family occupied in India. (They moved to London when he was 8.) This glass box “captures the sun’s heat and makes us open the patio doors to cool the space off — at all times of the year,” he explained, eliminating the need for air-conditioning. The space is cantilevered to deepen its connection to the surrounding landscape and view. “At the front wall, you’re literally over air,” Mr. Rangr said. In addition, his use of three square, full-height windows on the west wall — rather than a single horizontal window — creates the sensation that the view extends beyond the frame. He needed to put people “not just in front of the view, but somehow in the view,” he said."
2209,"On the bright south side of the space, sliding glass doors open to a deck. Clerestory windows on the east (street) side of the house, above the kitchen, admit morning light and cooling breezes. The house has radiant-heated floors and LED lighting throughout, with indirect lighting used liberally; Mr. Rangr says it illuminates spaces more evenly, requiring less artificial light, and therefore less energy. Solar panels on the roof allow the building to consume just “one-third the energy that a house this size should use,” he said."
2210,"Mr. Rangr chose inexpensive materials, like a fire-rated stucco for the exterior, and Alaskan yellow cedar for the decks, windows and living room floors and ceiling. The lowest grade of wood “adds texture to the strict geometry of my designs,” he said; he used a whitening stain to neutralize its yellow tone. Notes and shopping lists can be written directly on the whiteboard laminate cabinet fronts. Relatively inexpensive subway tiles are in the bathrooms. And the living room bookshelves (wood, with aluminum standards) are from a company that makes laboratory storage components. While they are not flexible enough for frequent reconfiguring, “they have a very elegant bracket system,” Mr. Rangr said."
2211,"To make the house conform to the same high seismic standards as hospitals, he used state-of-the-art damper frame technology, working with ZFA Structural Engineers, a Northern California firm. The house is more likely to be habitable after an earthquake, and the technology minimizes damage to windows and finishes."
2212,"For her part, Ms. Dillen asked only for a spacious closet. “My skills are around the two-dimensional,” she said. “Jasmit’s sense of space is something I’d never mess with; that’s part of the reason I fell in love with him.”"
2213,"Impressed by this house, Mr. Rangr’s aunt and uncle commissioned one for themselves nearby in Berkeley, and he is also at work on a mixed-use project in Buffalo, as well as a beach house in Costa Rica. Each embodies his belief that “the program, the client’s wants, and the landscape and climate dictate the design.”"
2214,“Eighty percent of the architecture is already there on the site; you just have to find the other 20 percent.”
2215,"Brie Larson is bringing Captain Marvel to the big screen in the latest film from Marvel Studios. Her adventure is set in the 1990s, but the exploits of Captain Marvel date to 1939, when Billy Batson followed a stranger into a subway and was granted powers by a wizard to transform himself into the mighty hero. Since then, many men and women have borne the name Captain Marvel, as well as a sexually fluid alien. Here is a colorful selection."
2216,"In 1939, Billy Batson, an orphaned newspaper boy, turned into the Fawcett Comics hero Captain Marvel with one magic word — Shazam! No villains could stop him, but a later lawsuit nearly did. National Comics (the forerunner of DC Comics) thought Captain Marvel, who was strong and could fly and sometimes outsold “Superman,” was too close to the Man of Steel and cried copyright infringement. Fawcett retired the character in 1953, but nearly 20 years later, DC licensed him for new comics. Still, the series could not be called Captain Marvel, because Marvel had grabbed the trademark for its own hero in 1966. These days, Batson goes by Shazam (he cannot say his own name lest he transform) and will get his own film, starring Zachary Levi, next month."

2218,"Bursting on to the scene in 1966, Mar-Vell started out as a spy for the alien Kree race before siding with Earth. This version of the hero was originally a silver-haired hunk, but editors feared his hair color made him look old. He was given a spiffy new costume and later a dye job, leaving him with his better known golden tresses. Sadly, he lost his battle with cancer in 1982. More shockingly, Mar-Vell has remained dead, despite comics’ love of resurrections. His genetically engineered son, Genis-Vell, burst onto the scene as Legacy but later took the name Captain Marvel, bearing it until he was killed in 2006. Spoiler: Mar-Vell has an unexpected role in the new film."
2219,"In 1967, Carol Danvers was introduced as an Air Force officer who encountered the alien Captain Marvel. In 1976, Danvers became Ms. Marvel, whose costume was a variation of Mar-Vell’s, albeit more revealing. She later lost her memories and powers, and alien experiments transformed her to Binary, who gets in a spectacular revenge punch against the woman behind her earlier woes. Danvers then became Warbird, joined the Avengers and struggled with alcoholism, before finally taking on the mantle of Captain Marvel (with an appropriate military-inspired uniform)."
2220,"Introduced in 1982, Monica Rambeau worked for the New Orleans harbor patrol. An encounter with cosmic energy infused her with the ability to convert her body into any form of energy. She joined the Avengers to better understand her abilities and excelled, eventually mastering her powers and becoming chairwoman of the team for a time. Rambeau was Captain Marvel for 14 years. She ceded the name to Mar-Vell’s son and became Photon (and, later, Pulsar and Spectrum). The “Captain Marvel” film includes a character named Maria Rambeau (played by Lashana Lynch), an Air Force pilot whose call sign is Photon and who has a young daughter named Monica."
2221,"This alien hero crash-landed on Earth in 2000 and quickly found himself at odds with Doctor Midas, who was obsessed with the energy that gave the Fantastic Four their powers, and Hexus, a corporation that became sentient (and evil). Noh-Varr joined the Avengers as Captain Marvel and later became known as the Protector. As a space-faring Kree, the triple-jointed Nor-Varr has a fluid view of sexuality. “We consider these things carefully,” he once told his Young Avengers teammates. “I was aboard an exploratory vessel, after all. Exploratory does have multiple meanings. The Kree are efficient like that.”"
2222,"When her series began in 2014, Kamala Khan was a Muslim teenager living in Jersey City and a big fan of the Carol Danvers version of Captain Marvel. When Khan’s powers activated, she became the local hero Ms. Marvel, telling her idol in a feverish dream: “I want to be you. Except I would wear the classic, politically incorrect costume and kick butt in giant wedge heels.” Since then, Khan has expanded her reach globally with the Champions, a squad of teenage superheroes, and seems likely to be promoted to Captain one day. In the meantime, maybe fans will get a big-screen cameo? At a news conference last month, Brie Larson was asked which hero she would like to meet in a sequel. “My dream would be that Ms. Marvel gets to come into play,” she said."
2223,"The charms of Bushwick, Brooklyn, had already started to wear thin for Ryan Cheal when the L train shutdown was announced in 2016. So he started looking for a new place last summer, about six months before repairs were scheduled to begin."
2224,"His girlfriend, Kelly Godzik, lived a few blocks away and was also dreading the looming shutdown, but had no plans to move, as her lease wasn’t up soon and she really liked her roommate."
2225,"But subway and real estate realities often can lead couples down unanticipated paths. Ms. Godzik was browsing listings on Mr. Cheal’s behalf when she came across a one-bedroom in a new building by the Broadway Triangle — an area where Bushwick, Williamsburg and Bedford-Stuyvesant meet — a short walk from the J, M and G trains. And she decided to accompany him when he went to see it. "
2226,"“Our jaws were dropping when they showed us this place,” said Mr. Cheal, whose previous apartment had been a rough-around-the-edges three-bedroom share that rented for $3,000 a month."
2227,Ms. Godzik felt her resolve to stay at her current place — also shabby and soon to be in the boondocks of Brooklyn — melt away.
2228,"“Coming in, everything was so shiny; no one has lived here before. All the places we’d lived before were pretty beat up, walls not repainted between tenants,” Ms. Godzik said. “We were like, ‘Get us out of the Bushwick dingy hole.’”"
2229,"$3,000 | South Williamsburg, Brooklyn"
2230,"Occupations: Ms. Godzik is a freelance marketing operations and project manager at Condé Nast; Mr. Cheal is a property manager for a family-owned residential real estate company.Apartment aesthetics: The big windows, high ceilings and light gray cabinets caught the couple’s attention when they first toured the apartment. “We really like the California aesthetic. The first trip we took together as a couple was to Malibu,” Ms. Godzik said. “We’re obsessed with light, airy, macramé.”Keeping the apartment light and airy: “We didn’t want it to be too crowded. Living with roommates, we realized how easily things could get cluttered,” Ms. Godzik said. “We were like, ‘Let’s only bring in things that have a purpose.’”"
2231,"Moving in together was a big step, but after seeing the building’s rooftop, which would be outfitted with a number of barbecues come spring, the couple conferred for only a few minutes before deciding that they wanted the apartment. But only if there wasn’t a broker’s fee."
2232,"“I feel like if you’ve lived in New York long enough you can figure out how to find a nice place that doesn’t charge a fee,” Ms. Godzik said."
2233,"“If there had been a broker’s fee here, we probably would have passed, on principle,” said Mr. Cheal, who works as a property manager for a residential real estate company in Manhattan, and had recently walked away from a well-priced apartment in Williamsburg after the broker told him the fee was a whopping 20 percent."
2234,"Not only was this apartment no-fee, but when they sat down to talk about how much money they would need to provide up front, the broker said the building was partnering with a new company, Obligo, that covered the cost of the security deposit for financially qualified tenants in exchange for a small monthly fee for the duration of the lease, in their case $15. (Through the company, they also authorized the landlord to charge up to the full deposit if there were damages to the apartment.) All they needed to put down was the first month’s rent of $3,000."
2235,"“We used the money we would have paid for a security deposit to furnish the apartment,” said Mr. Cheal, who was more than happy to leave behind his apartment and also his broken-down Ikea furniture — “college-kid-like junk” — on the curb in Bushwick."
2236,The couple had been living in their apartment for about four months when it was announced in January that the L train wouldn’t be shutting down after all.
2237,"“When we found out, we were like, ‘What? We’ve been lied to,’” Mr. Cheal said."
2238,"“One of my friends on the L train had been able to negotiate her rent down $300 a month,” Ms. Godzik said."
2239,"Once they recovered from their surprise, however, they agreed that although the shutdown had been a major factor in their decision, they were happy they made the move. Their new neighborhood, populated by many Orthodox Jewish families, is much quieter than the previous one, where drunken arguments often spilled out from the bars into the streets. "
2240,"And after years of living in scuffed-up shares, they love having an apartment where the only issue has been the pilot light in the oven going out."
2241,"“We both made a big step up, apartment-wise,” Mr. Cheal said."
2242,"“And we both like living together,” Ms. Godzik added."
2243,"The only problem is the transit situation. Before they moved in, Ms. Godzik thought she could take the J train to Fulton Street — a smooth commute to her job at the World Trade Center, where she works in marketing for Condé Nast. But the nearby Lorimer J train stop is local, and the J train doesn’t always run local."
2244,"“So depending on whether it’s running local or not, getting to work every morning is kind of a crapshoot,” she said."

2250,"I was coming out of the subway elevator with my son in his stroller, when I saw a rat on the platform barely two feet away."
2251,"A rat is one of the few things that can truly unnerve me. So there I stood, clinging to the stroller and weighing my options."
2252,"A man standing nearby was watching in amusement. He chuckled, smoothed his black mustache, approached the rat calmly and watched it for several seconds."
2253,"Then, with a small, graceful jeté of his left black boot, he sent the rat sailing off the platform, through the air and onto the tracks, where it landed safely. "
2254,"The man looked down, smiled and shrugged. Then he turned toward me, took a small bow, turned again and walked away. "
2255,I hurried to squeeze onto the uptown express.

2257,Dear Diary:
2258,"Most Tuesdays, I pull into a spot on Riverside Drive at the corner of 116th Street just before noon. I sit there for a half-hour reading until alternate-side is finished, securing a space that lets me see my car from the vestibule of my apartment when I get upstairs."
2259,"On a recent Tuesday, I wasn’t able to pull onto the block until 12:15. There were no empty spaces left when I got there. I drove laps around the neighborhood until I found a spot 10 blocks away."
2260,"Later in the day, I was looking out the window and I saw an empty spot. By the time I got my sneakers on, it was gone. Taking a chance, I walked the 10 blocks to my car anyway. After doing more laps, I eventually found a spot on Riverside two blocks from my window. "
2261,"Crossing the street toward home, a spot ahead of me opened up. It was not only in view of my apartment but would also allow me not to move my car for an extra day."
2262,A couple in a car nearby saw me turn back. They rolled down their window.
2263,"“You want that spot?” they said, pointing toward the space I had my sights on."
2264,"“Yes,” I said. “Do you?”"
2265,They shook their heads.
2266,"“Hurry, hurry,” they said before driving away."
2267,"I pulled out quickly, but when I got to the space, another car had already pulled in. Despondent, I started to pull away."
2268,The driver of the car that had pulled into the spot rolled down the window and waved. It was the same couple.
2269,"“Hurry,” they said before driving away. "

2272,A lithe young man in tight jeans got on the A train. He was carrying a boom box and a bag. 
2273,"He pulled out a pair of sparkling red high heels, put them on and proceeded to fly around the car, twirling on the vertical poles and hanging from the horizontal ones."
2274,"He pulled a woman much younger than me into a sensuous dance. As I moved to the beat, I wondered whether she had been waiting there to accompany him. "
2275,"After she sat down, he turned toward me and held out his hand. We danced together for a few minutes in a kind of semi-ballroom style."
2276,"“Take a bow,” he whispered, bending me backward as though I were Ginger Rogers."
2277,I sat back down. What a ride.

2293,It took only a few months to repair the vandalism at a Jewish cemetery near St. Louis in 2017. But finding and then sentencing the man who did it took years.
2294,"The man, Alzado M. Harris, 35, was sentenced to three years of probation in St. Louis County Circuit Court on Thursday for toppling 154 headstones in the cemetery in University City, Mo., in February 2017, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney’s office, Josi Nielsen, said on Monday."
2295,"Earlier this month, Mr. Harris pleaded guilty to felony charges of institutional vandalism, according to court records. He must also pay $5,000 in restitution, maintain full-time work and take an anger management course, the records show."
2296,"“We are grateful that the case has been solved, and resolved,” Anita Feigenbaum, the executive director of the cemetery, Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, said in an interview on Monday."
2297,"On the morning of Feb. 20, 2017, the headstones were found pushed over and disembodied from their foundations at the cemetery in University City, which has a population of about 35,000. The cemetery is more than 100 years old, and Ms. Feigenbaum said the headstones had been made of marble, granite and other materials and hand-carved with English, Hebrew or Yiddish."
2298,"The authorities scanned video surveillance, but it did not cover the southeast corner of the cemetery, where the headstones had been overturned, she said. They also examined DNA from a jacket that was discovered under a toppled headstone, said Ms. Feigenbaum, who was kept informed as the investigation progressed."
2299,"The DNA led to Mr. Harris after investigators matched samples on the jacket with a sample obtained from his previous criminal record profile, authorities told The St. Louis Post-Dispatch in 2018."
2300,"The authorities said Mr. Harris was drunk and angry when he did it, the newspaper reported."
2301,The police department and Mr. Harris’s lawyer did not immediately return requests for comment on Monday.
2302,"The vandalism in 2017 came amid a series of anti-Semitic attacks, bomb threats and other acts of vandalism against Jewish centers across the country, sending ripples of concern throughout the Jewish community."
2303,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation had been prepared to join the investigation if it turned out to have involved a possible federal civil rights violation, a spokeswoman for the bureau, Rebecca Wu, said on Monday."
2304,"But “no information came to light suggesting” a potential violation, Ms. Wu said in an email."
2305,"In the first two months of 2017 before the University City vandalism, at least 53 Jewish community centers around the country had received bomb threats, including centers in Albuquerque; Baltimore; Birmingham, Ala.; Milwaukee; and Wilmington, Del., according to the J.C.C. Association of North America at the time. Some of them had reported being repeatedly threatened."
2306,"Reports at the time included swastika graffiti found on some college campuses as well as the New York City subway, according to a report in The Times that year."
2307,"“He was not motivated by hate, but the incident had impact as if he was,” the Anti-Defamation League of St. Louis said in a statement last year, commending the investigation that led to Mr. Harris’s arrest."
2308,"A week after the vandalism in Missouri, the police in Philadelphia found about 100 toppled headstones at the Mount Carmel Jewish Cemetery there."
2309,"The Chesed Shel Emeth Cemetery, which began accepting burials in 1893, was founded by Russian immigrants whose aim was to give Jews access to a proper burial no matter their financial means, Ms. Feigenbaum said. There are now about 22,500 plots."
2310,"Cemetery administration officials got wind on Feb. 19, 2017, that something was amiss, she said, when visitors reported seeing some overturned headstones. The news alone was not so startling — tree branches, bad weather or storms can affect plots in a cemetery."
2311,"But the next day, the groundskeeper went out to explore, Ms. Feigenbaum said, and found headstone after headstone upended. The damage was not scattered, such as might be seen after a storm."
2312,"The groundskeeper contacted Ms. Feigenbaum, she said."
2313,"“At first he was like: ‘No, there are more than 50 down. It was no weather. Something happened,’” Ms. Feigenbaum said. “I called the police even before I got there.”"
2314,"“It wasn’t like one here, one there,” she said. “It was condensed in one area, so it had a significant impact. It looked deliberate.”"
2315,"Survivors of relatives buried in the cemetery searched the grounds, clutching slips of paper describing where relatives were buried to see if their plots were affected."
2316,Ms. Feigenbaum said the authorities told her that Mr. Harris had squeezed in through a chained gate. Video surveillance failed to cover the spot.
2317,"The Jewish community swung into action to repair the headstones, she said. That meant trying to track down families and survivors, both in the United States and other countries, which was a search complicated by scope, generations and time. Many of the headstones marked graves from the 1920s through 1940s, she said."
2318,They were also obligated under Jewish law to replace the headstones with exact replicas.
2319,"“Being an Orthodox Jewish cemetery, we have to adhere to Jewish law as well,” she said. “If you can’t find the family, you have to replace it with the exact same, or better.”"
2320,"Muslim and Christian communities raised funds, she said. Schoolchildren painted small rocks, which in Jewish tradition are placed on or near headstones as markers. There were organized vigils and cleanups. The plots were repaired before the summer of 2017, she said."
2321,"“It really affects every religion and every single person,” Ms. Feigenbaum said. “Everybody has somebody who passed away. It happened to hit a Jewish cemetery at a time of possible and increasing attacks out there. That is why you saw communities coming out.”"
2322,MEMORIES OF THE FUTURE By Siri Hustvedt
2323,"Siri Hustvedt is known, rightly, as a novelist of ideas, so it’s not surprising to come across a concept in her new novel, “Memories of the Future,” that’s so hard to wrap your mind around you could look it up and still not understand it, unless you happen to be particularly good at math. It’s Minkowski spacetime, a geometric model of special relativity that unites space and time in four dimensions (three of space, one of time). I should state for the record that spacetime comes up only once and is discussed for less than a page. But I would argue that it’s an important page."
2324,"To back up: “Memories of the Future” is lightly fictionalized memoir or, in the term of the moment, autofiction. In it, Hustvedt tells two tales. The first is about SH, a 23-year-old Minnesotan of Norwegian extraction who comes to New York City in 1978 to try her hand at a novel. Note the initials: Hustvedt is also from Minnesota, also of Norwegian descent, also came to New York in 1978 and so on. It’s “a portrait of the artist as a young woman,” in Hustvedt’s words. The second is the story of how the first one came to be told. Almost 40 years later — that is, in 2016 — SH discovers a journal from 1978 that she thought she had lost. She and her sister are moving their 92-year-old mother from the independent-living wing of a retirement complex to the assisted-living wing, and there it is, a black-and-white Mead composition book entitled “My New Life” in a box of old stuff her mother had saved. “I greeted it as if it were a beloved relative I had given up for dead,” SH says. Inside lie fragments that allow her to resurrect her younger self: a diary whose entries often begin “Dear Page,” passages of the novel she’s trying to write, doodles and drawings. And off we go."
2325,"The young SH is a charmer. If you came to New York in the late ’70s, as I did, to experience the beauty and terrors of the city in its ruins and its glory days, she will make you nostalgic. She certainly has that effect on the older SH. The young woman is the kind of enthusiast who hops on the creaky floorboards upon taking possession of a dank one-bedroom apartment in a dubious building. Freedom! Possibility! Also a neighbor who moans loudly at night, over and over again, what sounds like “amsah.”"
2326,"Young SH takes stabs at her novel, a mystery with the cheerful unreality of not-very-good young-adult fiction. She reads Wittgenstein and Bergson and roams the streets and rides the subway. The older SH makes wistful lists of the city’s now-vanished detritus: “faded signs, tattered awnings, peeling posters and filthy bricks” on the old Upper West Side, and the peep shows and “silhouettes of naked women with jutting breasts and long legs” in the old Times Square. There are bookstores: the Coliseum, Gotham Book Mart, Books and Company, the Eighth Street Bookshop."
2327,"Eventually, the young SH makes friends, goes to poetry readings and clubs and becomes obsessed with figuring out what’s going on with her moaning neighbor. Pressing a stethoscope to the wall, SH eavesdrops and takes notes. “Amsah” turns out to be “I’m sad.” As the woman progresses from lamentation to self-argument in growls and higher-pitched replies to some sort of cultlike ritual, it becomes clear that the neighbor’s story is the stuff of a novel that the young SH is too inexperienced to realize is writing itself next door."
2328,"But the neighbor is a MacGuffin, a distraction from what strikes me as the real substance of the book: the narrator’s ruminations on the nature of memory and time. After a while, I was finding it helpful to think of “Memories of the Future” as an essay rather than a novel. The best essays record the tacks and turns of an interesting mind, and Hustvedt — also an accomplished art critic and essayist — is never not interesting. Her acts of mind are more bracing than the story of SH, which feels thin and sepia-toned, like a photograph put through one of those antiquing apps."
2329,"“I am interested in understanding how she and I are relatives,” the narrator says in one of her better digressions, and one answer she contemplates is: in Minkowski spacetime. I asked a physicist friend to help me visualize this, and he said, “Think of sliced bread.” “Imagine all of space at one moment of time is like a giant slice of bread (perhaps an infinitely large slice of bread),” he emailed. “A loaf of such slices, with a peculiar way of laying out distances, would be akin to Minkowski spacetime: Each slice represents space at one moment of time, and by putting all the slices together in temporal order, you get spacetime.” In other words, in spacetime what’s past is also present and future. Or, as Hustvedt puts it, “Over there in Minkowski spacetime, the still girlish ‘I’ and the much older ‘I’ coexist, and in that startling 4D reality, the two of us can theoretically find each other and shake hands or converse together.”"
2330,"This time-defying preservation of selves, this dream of plenitude without loss, is like a snow globe from heaven, a vision of Eden before the expulsion. Mathematically demonstrable but emotionally impossible, it’s dangled just in front of us like a bauble we can’t have but can’t stop reaching for. Except that Hustvedt finds a way to give it to us. I won’t tell you how, but I will say that the ending manages to be quite moving and unconvincing at the same time, a recapitulation of the tonal contradiction that pervades this sometimes incisive, sometimes sentimental novel, or memoir, or whatever we decide to call it."
2331,"It was 2 a.m. at a onetime brewery in Brooklyn, and Shangela, a multiseason star from “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” swirled and strutted in a glittery red gown, lip-syncing to “Toy,” the bubbly Eurovision winner by Netta."
2332,"As she executed a flawless death drop, a deafening roar rose from the crowd of 400, a mix of gender-nonconforming Brooklyn club kids and muscular men in tank tops, leather harnesses and tight jeans, who recorded her every move with their phones."
2333,"Similar scenes unfold every weekend at 3 Dollar Bill, a massive space in East Williamsburg that bills itself as the largest L.G.B.T.-owned and -operated nightclub in New York City. It opened last year and first made a splash with a popular party called Sutherland, and has since expanded to include events hosted by night life veterans like Susanne Bartsch, comedy nights and even a flea market."
2334,"It may surprise clubgoers to learn that the person behind all this debauchery is a petite middle-aged former bartender from Ireland, who can often be found wielding a broom or a paintbrush at the club. To her, 3 Dollar Bill is more than just another gay bar."
2335,"“I don’t have kids, so I want this place to be my legacy,” said Brenda Breathnach, 54, on a recent Saturday night in her spotless basement office at the club. “I can see it being a fabulous queer place.”"
2336,"Her unlikely journey from Irish immigrant to night life impresario began in 1994, when she left Dingle, a small port town in Ireland, to work with her brother at a pub in the Bronx called An Beal Bocht Café. She stayed there for a decade but yearned for a place of her own. In 2004, she took over an Irish sports bar nearby and renamed it Dr. Gilbert’s, after an Irish song. It was not a great fit."
2337,"“I was gay and I was sober, and I just wasn’t liked,” Ms. Breathnach said. “I took over, but they never took to me.”"
2338,"One day in 2011, while scanning Craigslist, she saw a for-sale posting for a Manhattan bar. It was for the Phoenix, a divey gay bar on East 13th Street in the East Village. “The Phoenix was dead,” she said. “I went in there on a Friday evening, and there were two customers.”"
2339,"She bought the bar, and after giving it a pub-style makeover and a fresh coat of paint, brought it back to life. And, unlike in the Bronx, her new customers embraced her."
2340,"Everyone, she said — “the old people and the young people” — was grateful. They “were always telling me they were very thankful to have that space,” Ms. Breathnach said."
2341,"The experience left her wanting more, so she began to search for a bigger place. Working with two business partners from An Beal Bocht Café, she came across the former Otto Huber Brewery on Meserole Street, about a block away from the Montrose L subway station. Dating from the 1860s, the complex of enormous red brick buildings had brewed a variety of lagers until it shuttered in the 1950s."
2342,"Though her partners thought the space was too big and needed a daunting amount of work to get it up to code, her enthusiasm won them over and they signed a 25-year lease. After a two-year gut renovation, a new sound system and lighting, the club opened last June. The 10,000-square-foot space features a raw concert hall with 50-foot ceilings, disco lights and a triangular stage."
2343,"The first party, Sutherland, took off immediately and generated a lot of buzz, both positive and negative, for its strict policies of no phones and no photos. (Patrons had to check their phones or seal them in special pouches.) “It’s a great, magical digital detox,” Tad Haes, one of the founders, said in an article in Out magazine."
2344,"With seven nights a week to fill, Ms. Breathnach began looking to diversify her lineup in the fall. Around that time, Frankie Sharp, 38, a promoter who hosted the popular Westgay party in the West Village, visited the club and was impressed. “It reminded me of an illegal warehouse space that was legal,” Mr. Sharp said. “It could be for theater, a cabaret, immersive theater, a live band, a place you record podcasts.”"
2345,"The two hit it off. “It was really amazing how we just bonded,” Ms. Breathnach said. “He wasn’t drinking, either, and that meant something to me. He knows parties and he knows a lot of the big-name drag queens, rappers and a lot of people I don’t know.”"
2346,"In December, Mr. Sharp rebooted Westgay there. He also brought in Ms. Bartsch, the long reigning queen of downtown night life, and Ty Sunderland, a younger promoter known for his Heaven on Earth party at China Chalet."
2347,"“It’s amazing I’m doing parties in Brooklyn,” said Ms. Bartsch, who hosts a monthly party at 3 Dollar Bill called Play Now. “I never thought I would, but here I am.” She, too, was charmed by Ms. Breathnach’s down-to-earth, motherly manner. “She’s not some bottle service, cocaine-snorting owner,” Ms. Bartsch said."
2348,"In addition to hosting the big parties, Ms. Breathnach wants 3 Dollar Bill to serve as an L.G.B.T. community space, with workshops for dance, music and art. She considers it all payback for those grateful patrons at Phoenix."
2349,"“I could be in 20 Irish bars and nobody’s going to say, ‘Thank you for having this bar for me,’” she said. “There’s no way I would open another straight bar.”"

2351,"New York already holds Guinness World Records for the most billionaires and for being the most Instagrammed city. Now the city can claim another record: the world’s tallest politician, thanks to Robert Cornegy Jr., a city councilman who represents Brooklyn."
2352,"A former professional basketball player who was part of the 1984-85 St. John’s University men’s basketball team that advanced to the Final Four, Mr. Cornegy, 53, officially tops out at 6-foot-10, according to an average of measurements provided by three doctors at Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn."
2353,"“What I went through to get this measurement was borderline ridiculous,” said Mr. Cornegy, who will receive the designation on Wednesday at a ceremony at City Hall. “But I think it was worth it to bring that designation to New York — and Brooklyn.”"
2354,"Getting certified as “the world’s tallest politician (male)” was no easy feat. Guinness requires the record-holder to submit official height verification. Mr. Cornegy went to his former trainer at St. John’s University, but Guinness did not like the tools the trainer used. He then turned to the doctors at Interfaith, which is in his Council district."
2355,"Mr. Cornegy received three measurements on the same day in January, but at different times and in varied poses. “Medically, there can be variations in height depending on certain factors,” said Dr. Mazin Khalid, who has practiced internal medicine at Interfaith for five years and provided one of the measurements."
2356,"Mr. Cornegy’s height was recorded while he was lying on the floor, which generally produces a greater measurement because it relieves pressure on the vertebrae, and while he was standing with his heels and shoulders against a wall."
2357,"“He’s very tall,” Dr. Khalid said. “It took three people to take the measurement.”"
2358,"Guinness officials said Mr. Cornegy is now the official record-holder, besting Sir Louis Gluckstein, a London politician who died in 1979, by two and a half inches. (The most recent record-holder was Archie Hamilton, a 6-foot-6 former member of the British Parliament, who slightly eclipses another New Yorker: the almost 6-foot-6 Mayor Bill de Blasio.)"
2359,"“When I first started this, I said there is no way I’m the tallest politician in the world. There must be an ambassador in Africa who is seven feet,” said Mr. Cornegy. “But when I found out the previous record-holder was only 6 foot 7 inches, I had to give it a shot.”"
2360,"Being that tall has personal costs. Mr. Cornegy paid a contractor to put his toilet at home on an eight-inch platform. “I want to see what it’s like for my feet to swing,” he said."
2361,"Custom suits cost $700 and stylish shoes, at size 17, are at least $400, he said. Most cars are too small, so Mr. Cornegy rides the subway from his district in Bedford-Stuyvesant to City Hall. But unless he can get a seat, he spends most of the ride hunched over."
2362,"“I have a moment of anxiety when the train pulls into the station,” he said."
2363,"When talking to constituents, Mr. Cornegy, who has a master’s degree in organizational leadership, has learned to stand back at least three feet to make it easier for people to look up at him."
2364,"Mr. de Blasio is the only local politician who comes close to seeing Mr. Cornegy eye to eye. The mayor was signing a bill in 2014 when Mr. Cornegy, then newly elected, walked into the room. “Look who’s here. Rob Cornegy, my archnemesis,” Mr. Cornegy recalled the mayor saying. But the two tallest men in New York politics get along pretty well."
2365,"“I look up to Council member Robert Cornegy, because of his contributions to our city, and because I don’t really have a choice,” Mr. de Blasio said in a statement."
2366,"It is entirely possible that in some corner of the world, an elected official may be even taller than Mr. Cornegy; Guinness record holders generally self-report their feats of stature. Indeed, beneath the Guinness online entry for Mr. Cornegy, two commenters suggested that a member of the Croatian parliament, Pedja Grbin, deserved the record; he is listed in some accounts as being 6-foot-11."
2367,"But Mr. Cornegy is safe from one potential challenger: Glenn Jacobs, the former professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now a mayor in Tennessee. His wrestling biography suggested he was seven feet tall, but he has said in interviews that he is 6-foot-8."
2368,"Now Mr. Cornegy, who is the chairman of the Housing and Buildings Committee, has his sights on other goals. He was in the running to become the speaker of the City Council in 2017, but he failed to garner enough support, falling to Corey Johnson. Mr. Cornegy, who by law must leave the Council when his current term expires, said he plans to run for Brooklyn borough president in 2021."
2369,He said he hopes his world record might inspire young people.
2370,"“Being the world’s tallest politician shows you can make tremendous contributions to society, no matter how you look physically,” Mr. Cornegy said."
2371,"Tanitoluwa Adewumi, age 8, skidded around the empty apartment, laughing excitedly, then leapt onto his dad’s back. “I have a home!” he said in wonderment. “I have a home!”"
2372,"A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton."
2373,"“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”"
2374,"I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter."
2375,Now the story gets even better.
2376,"After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing — in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani."
2377,"[Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]"
2378,"The family settled on one of the more modest and practical housing offers: An anonymous donor paid a year’s rent on a two-bedroom apartment near Tani’s current school. The apartment is clean, comfortable and freshly painted, without being luxurious, and the Adewumis gaze adoringly at their new kitchen."
2379,"“I want my mom’s cooking again!” Tani mused as he explored the apartment. It was bare, but another donor had offered furniture, sheets and towels. Someone else was sending 100 chess books."
2380,Heartfelt thanks to all my readers for this generosity: I truly have the best readers.
2381,And now the story gets even better.
2382,"The Adewumis have decided that they will not spend a cent of the $200,000 GoFundMe money on themselves. They will take out a 10 percent tithe and donate it to their church, which helped them while they were homeless, and the rest will be channeled through a new Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation to help African immigrants who are struggling in the United States the way they were a week ago."
2383,"“Anybody who is coming from Africa who is in the position we were in, we will help them,” Mr. Adewumi said, acknowledging that details need to be worked out."
2384,I asked them how they could turn down every penny of such a huge sum. Didn’t they want a celebration dinner? New iPhones? A vacation?
2385,"“I’m a hardworking guy,” Mr. Adewumi explained. He has two jobs: He drives for Uber with a rented car and sells real estate through Brick & Mortar. Someone has now offered him a free car so that he can keep more of the money he makes driving, and Tani’s mom was just offered a job as a health care aide at a hospital."
2386,"I asked Tani if he was O.K. with seeing the $200,000 disappear. He shrugged. “I want to help other kids,” he said. “I don’t mind.”"
2387,"Surely, I pressed him, there was some material object he coveted. There was a long silence. “Maybe a computer,” he acknowledged."
2388,"The family was tempted by the offers of full scholarships at top private schools. But Tani and his parents decided that while he might accept such a scholarship for middle school, he would be loyal and stick with the public elementary school, P.S. 116, that taught him chess and waived his fees for the chess club."
2389,"“This school showed confidence in Tanitoluwa,” his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, told the P.S. 116 principal, Jane Hsu. “So we return the confidence.” And then, overcome with emotion, the mom and the principal hugged."
2390,"There’s a risk that a triumph like this leaves the impression that charity is the solution rather than a way to fill gaps: Fundamentally we need comprehensive systems in place to support needy kids. We would never build a bridge or subway with volunteers and donations, so why entrust an even more urgent cause — homeless children — to charity?"
2391,"Tani thrived because everything fell into place: a good school, a dedicated chess teacher and devoted parents committed to taking their son to every chess practice. The challenge is to replicate that supportive environment for all the other Tanis out there with public services and private philanthropy alike."
2392,"One challenge I face is that readers often want to donate just to a particular individual I write about, without addressing the larger social problem. So it’s thrilling to see Tani and his parents use their good fortune to help other anonymous kids in need. In that, there’s a lesson for all of us."
2393,"“God has already blessed me,” Mr. Adewumi told me. “I want to release my blessing to others.”"

2395,"SATURDAY PUZZLE —  Another creative Steinberg Saturday, which at some point may become a trademarked term. Today we have a low-word-count grid whose appearance reminds me of either Gromit or maybe the Were-Rabbit, enough that it could have been one of those diagramless puzzles that we get every few months. I’ve been seeing creatures in a lot of grids lately, so maybe I’m just losing it."
2396,"As always, Mr. Steinberg’s cluing is unassailable, clever and subtle. Although stacks are more imposing to look at, there is something symphonic about entries that form pyramids like the ones we have today, the way they swell and subside, and I thought there was a high-enough level of difficulty to make solving the puzzle as satisfying as its craftsmanship."
2397,"So many nice touches in the clues today, for entries like FANBOY, LAWYERS, JAW, DJS, and HI ALL. One of my very favorites was ALIEN and I got a bit stumped by LOBAR, inexcusably, as it’s evergreen crossword fill fodder."
2398,"8A: This is a great clue that pushed me into an attempt to contort some version of “the Dating Game” into this little spot, simply because I so clearly remembered that “spin” that brought the three contestants into view at the beginning of each segment. That’s a move on a set — here we have a whole set that moves, because it’s a vehicle, the CASH CAB. I loved this show and used to keep a bit of an eye out for the actual cab while trooping around Manhattan — it just seemed like such a fun surprise. Is it an interesting notion to put a game show on the subway? Hm. This is a clip from “Celebrity” CASH CAB but the intro is pretty typical. "
2399,"17A: I had this island confused with Easter Island, or Rapa Nui, which is actually kind of a neighbor in the Pacific Ocean. VANUATU is an independent nation as of 1980, and considered by some to be where bungee jumping began. Despite the usefulness of that U at the end, we don’t see this entry very often."
2400,"31A: This was so cunning — Mr. Steinberg isn’t referring to a room or ward that you might move to within a hospital, but SOLID FOOD, which you move to after you start to heal up after some awful experience. If this entry made you think of mathematical solids, there was a grid 15 years ago that had this theme. "
2401,"35A: There weren’t many names in the grid today and for some reason this one was easy enough for me, and I’m so-so at history. I thought it might be because of a recent puzzle sighting but HORACE GREELEY was only an entry once before, back in 1984. "
2402,"37A: This is a debut and a term that I was vaguely familiar with — it’s a bit cultish in meaning, although inarguably a terrific 15-letter pick for a crossword. Very generally speaking, it’s an outdoorsy effect that indoorsy people seek out and pay more for in fashion — DISTRESSED DENIM. Denim is as storied and fussed over in fashion as silk and lace, since it’s one of those traditional American epitomes of cool, and if you choose to get specific with it you can fall down a rabbit hole (and land in Japan, apparently, where a whole prefecture is known for denim)."
2403,"52A: They aren’t the same, but your “time machine” has enough letters in common with your TELEPORTING that you could definitely ruin the bottom of your grid for a little while. "
2404,"4D: This clue looked cryptic, and it’s enough in that vein to be unusual — three “T”s in a row, a series of TRUES I guess. "
2405,"7D: If you’re a rosé lover you may have noticed BLUSH WINES in wine stores or restaurants (I am far more used to seeing rosé on a menu these days but “blush” definitely rang a bell). Blush is a comparatively recent creation in the history of wine and apparently was used primarily as a descriptor for White Zinfandel, which was a byproduct of an attempt to create a richer version of standard (red) Zinfandel wine back in the 1970s. "
2406,"21D: I think of New York City as rolling in pugs, but I just learned that they’re not even in our top 10 (perhaps I’ve been lumping them in with Frenchies all this time because of their similarly stertorous respiration style). Anyhow, the pugs I know are sort of like basketballs with legs in stature, so I don’t think of them as TOY DOGS, but that is the group that they show in."
2407,"When I started constructing, very few grids used left-right symmetry. The only explanation I can think of is tradition — to me, left-right symmetry is just as elegant as rotational symmetry, and it also makes many otherwise-impossible themes doable. Left-right symmetry feels especially underutilized in themelesses, so I decided to try my hand at a 62-worder with a pattern I (unsurprisingly) hadn’t seen before. I started with DISTRESSED DENIM, a lively 15 whose middle letters seemed very friendly for a bottom stack. "
2408,"When constructing, I always tackle the most open sections first, since they tend to have the most constraints. My construction flow thus proceeded from the middle to the bottom to the upper left (where I needed 7-letter entries ending in the unfriendly letters B and U) to the upper right. I hope you enjoy this crunchy Saturday!"

2412,"Harry R. Hughes, a Democrat whose landslide victory in the 1978 election for governor of Maryland delivered a decisive rebuke to the culture of corruption epitomized by two of his predecessors, Spiro T. Agnew and Marvin Mandel, died on Wednesday at his home in Denton, Md. He was 92."
2413,His daughter Elizabeth Hughes said the cause was complications of pneumonia.
2414,"After Mr. Agnew, who had resigned to become vice president, pleaded no contest to felony tax evasion in 1973, and Mr. Mandel, his successor, was convicted of racketeering in 1977 (the conviction was later overturned), Mr. Hughes promised Maryland voters an honest and understated administration. That is largely what he delivered."
2415,He collaborated with neighboring states to protect Chesapeake Bay from pollution; raised gasoline taxes to pay for road repairs; appointed a record number of women and minorities to state posts; aggressively pursued drunken drivers; expanded the prison system; restructured formulas for financing public education and for imposing taxes to make both more equitable; and presided over the celebration of the state’s 350th anniversary.
2416,"Beginning in 1971, as Maryland’s first secretary of transportation, he transformed modest Friendship Airport into Baltimore-Washington International and successfully lobbied for the Metro SubwayLink in Baltimore, which opened in 1983."
2417,"Barred from seeking a third term as governor, he sought the Democratic nomination for a United States Senate seat in 1986 when the Republican incumbent, Charles Mathias, retired."
2418,"But he was dogged by what some considered the state’s sluggish response to the savings-and-loan crisis, which left taxpayers with a bill for protecting deposits and heralded a nationwide financial debacle. Most depositors eventually recouped their money."
2419,Representative Barbara Mikulski won the Democratic Senate primary with nearly 50 percent of the vote; Mr. Hughes ran third with less than 15 percent.
2420,"He retired from politics to practice law and became board president of what is now the Harry R. Hughes Center for Agro-Ecology at the University of Maryland in Queenstown, a research operation. (It was named for him in 2006.)"
2421,"“He was the change agent in Maryland at a time of fairly widespread corruption — a man for whom the question of integrity in government and public service was a deeply held moral issue, not a political issue,” Parris Glendening, who was governor of Maryland from 1995 to 2003 and is now the president of Smart Growth America, an environmental group, said in a telephone interview. “And since he was governor, no one runs for statewide office without a plan to protect Chesapeake Bay.”"
2422,"“He was one of the best governors,” Mr. Glendening said, “and one of the least appreciated.”"
2423,"Harry Roe Hughes was born on Nov. 13, 1926, in Easton, Md., on the shore of Chesapeake Bay. His father, Jonathan Longfellow Hughes, worked for an electric cooperative and at one point was on the congressional payroll through political connections. His mother, Helen (Roe) Hughes, taught high school English and French."
2424,"Harry was steeped in politics early on. When he was not yet 6 years old, he argued the merits of the 1932 presidential candidates with his maternal grandfather, a staunch Republican. He supported Herbert Hoover; Harry championed Franklin D. Roosevelt."
2425,"“I have to say,” he recalled in his memoir, “My Unexpected Journey” (2006), written with John W. Frece, “my political views have been fairly consistent ever since.”"
2426,"He enlisted in the Navy at 17 and was still in flight school when World War II ended. In 1949, after earning a bachelor of science degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, he pursued his dream: spending a summer with the Easton Yankees, a Class D farm club of the New York Yankees."
2427,"Mr. Hughes’s baseball career was short-lived. He said that while he had become disillusioned over the lack of teamwork, two obstacles prevented him from becoming a great pitcher: his fastball and his curveball."
2428,"In 1951, he married Patricia M. Donoho; she died in 2010. In addition to his daughter Elizabeth, his survivors include another daughter, Ann Fink; a grandson; and three great-grandchildren."
2429,"After a primary campaign that cost him $156 and was propelled by the popularity he had gained from his college baseball exploits, he represented his home district, Caroline County, in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1955 to 1959. He then served 12 years in the State Senate."
2430,"As a lawmaker, he voted to open public accommodations to black people and cast the deciding vote on a bill that guaranteed at least one legislator from each county."
2431,"In 1964 he lost a congressional challenge to Rogers C. B. Morton, the Republican incumbent, whose record on civil rights was considered mixed. After his defeat, Mr. Hughes was elected State Senate majority leader and Democratic state chairman."
2432,"He did not seek re-election in 1970, but Governor Mandel named him to the newly created position of transportation secretary, to coordinate a half-dozen previously autonomous departments that were often at odds. He quit in 1977 after charging that undue influence was being exerted to steer a Baltimore subway contract to a politically potent campaign contributor."
2433,"In 1978, in a stunning upset, Mr. Hughes toppled Blair Lee III, who had become acting governor when Governor Mandel was imprisoned, for the Democratic nomination for governor. Mr. Hughes defeated the Republican candidate, J. Glenn Beall Jr., that November with 71 percent of the vote. It was the largest victory margin in a Maryland governor’s race."
2434,"The first time John Stonehill was invited back to his girlfriend’s house, he headed straight for the refrigerator. It was stainless steel with a water and ice dispenser. It told him that his girlfriend, Rachel, was financially comfortable."
2435,"The contents were revealing, too: a bottle of wine, a bottle of champagne, hummus, olives, fresh fruits and vegetables. “I came away knowing a great deal about her,” Mr. Stonehill said. “Refrigerators are filled with clues about the people who own them.”"
2436,"“In Rachel’s case, it told me she liked to entertain and could probably create a quick and shareable snack for friends who unexpectedly popped by.”"
2437,They’ve been married for nine years.
2438,"“Refrigerators are great cheat sheets because you can learn a lot about a person,” Mr. Stonehill said."
2439,"That idea gave rise to what he calls “refrigerdating.” He’s discussed it on morning talk shows, including “The Doctors,” and helped Samsung, the electronics giant, come up with a Refrigerdating app to prove we are what we eat."
2440,"The app works with Samsung’s Family Hub refrigerator, which sells for around $3,000 and has a screen in the door that can show you the contents of your fridge. The idea is that you can look at your phone while you’re at the store to find out if you’re out of milk."
2441,"But the dating app lets you see the inside of someone else’s fridge. Instead of seeing photos of potential mates and judging them on superficial factors like their looks, you’re treated to glimpses of their inner selves: Would you swipe right on someone’s leftover Thai takeout or a bowl of fresh berries?"
2442,"The site cautions users not to style their fridges before taking the pictures, because,“cheating and relationships don’t go together well.” It suggests not choosing only fridges that look just like yours. And it recommends sending a personal message that reveals something about yourself and flatters the refrigerator’s owner. Perhaps, for example, you could compliment a condiment and say that it reminds you of your semester abroad."
2443,"“We’re all dating detectives,” Mr. Stonehill said. “Nothing says more about who we are than what we eat and drink.”"
2444,"Gleaning information from what we eat may be an unusual way to meet a mate, but does it reveal who we really are? "
2445,"Perhaps it can provide some clues. A study in the journal Appetite found, for example, that risk takers tend to like spicy food. "
2446,And researchers from North Dakota State University reported that people with a sweet tooth tend to have sweet personalities — they were more likely to volunteer to help clean up their city after a major flood.
2447,"Another study from the journal Appetite showed how bitter taste preferences might be associated with antisocial personality traits. Those with the strongest preferences for bitter foods, the authors wrote, showed “the most robust relation to everyday sadism and psychopathy.”"
2448,"According to Dr. Alberto Ascherio, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, there’s a link between eating certain foods and depression."
2449,"He was the senior author of a 12-year-long study published in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity that found that certain foods known to cause inflammation are tied to depression in women."
2450,"The study tracked 43,685 women, ages 50 to 77, and found that those who rarely consumed wine, coffee, olive oil and vegetables and who regularly drank sodas and ate red meat or refined grains were 29 to 41 percent more likely to be depressed than those who followed a more healthful diet."
2451,"“These results converge with parallel findings on the relation between diet and physical health,” Dr. Ascherio said. “From a public health perspective, it is reassuring that what is good for the body is also good for the mind.”"
2452,"So if what we eat can affect our moods and may be linked to personality traits, is it an accurate predictor of romantic compatibility?"
2453,"Peggy Policastro, a faculty member in the department of nutritional sciences at the N.J. Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health at Rutgers University does not subscribe to the belief that you are what you eat."
2454,"“We might have preferences for some foods that we grew up eating,” she said, “And although some food choices may tell us something about your cultural background, not everyone purchasing Goya beans is Latino.”"
2455,"Dr. Policastro does agree with Mr. Stonehill that a shopping cart filled with fresh fruits and vegetables suggests that you care about your health. “And if you see a shopping cart filled with different desserts, you might assume that someone is planning a party,” she said. “It, however, doesn’t reveal much about that person’s personality.”"
2456,Mr. Stonehill begs to differ. He recalled one date’s refrigerator that was so overcrowded with food it reminded him of being on the subway at rush hour. He felt that pursuing that relationship would have been too chaotic for him.
2457,"Of course, some couples can be compatible even if their refrigerators seem mismatched. My husband, for example, describes himself as an “opportunarian” for his “I’ll eat anything” attitude. I don’t eat meat and can be quite fussy about food. When we were dating, his meat-filled refrigerator didn’t bother me and he liked the fruit and vegetables that filled mine. "
2458,We never forced our preferences on each other. But we do have at least one food issue in common: We share a deep dislike for meatloaf.
2459,"BERLIN — Germany’s most notorious far-right politician, Björn Höcke, a man who has called the Holocaust memorial in Berlin “a monument of shame,” was furious when he woke up one morning to find a section of the memorial built to scale outside his bedroom window."
2460,It was November 2017. Mr. Höcke sued the artist who had secretly rented the neighboring property and prepared the stunt over many months. He tried to have him evicted. He even launched criminal proceedings against him. But to no avail. The rental lease is open-ended.
2461,And the replica of the Holocaust memorial remains.
2462,"But where civil and criminal proceedings have failed, a state prosecutor has stepped in, it emerged Wednesday. The prosecutor’s office in Mr. Höcke’s eastern home state, Thuringia, is investigating the artist, Philipp Ruch, on suspicion of “forming a criminal association,” a legal provision known as Paragraph 129, which gives the state far-reaching surveillance rights and is normally applied to criminal groups and suspected extremists."
2463,"The investigation, which was revealed in the answer to a routine parliamentary question, is now raising questions about whether the law is being leveraged by far-right sympathizers to crack down on their opponents. Mr. Höcke’s party, the far-right Alternative for Germany, the country’s third-largest party in Parliament, is particularly strong in the former Communist East of the country."
2464,"“We have to ask the question: Is there a political intention that overlaid the judicial intention?” said Steffen Dittes, the lawmaker of the Left Party who made the parliamentary request to see a list of all those who were being investigated under Paragraph 129."
2465,"In the reply he was sent, there were a dozen investigations listed in two tables. In one table, designated for terrorist suspects, groups like the Islamic State and the Shabab came up repeatedly; the other table included a group of Holocaust deniers, far-right and far-left extremists — and then: “a group of action artists.”"
2466,"“It sends a devastating political signal,” Mr. Dittes said."
2467,"Mr. Dittes noted that the investigation of Mr. Ruch was opened in November 2017, a week after he had unveiled the replica memorial and just a couple of days after Mr. Höcke had publicly accused Mr. Ruch and his artist collective of being “a terrorist association.”"
2468,"Mr. Dittes also said that the prosecutor in charge of the investigation had built a reputation for being soft on far-right offenders, for example letting it slide when a notorious German song about “a subway to Auschwitz” was sung at an Alternative for Germany election rally in 2017."
2469,"“This does not look like a mistake or an exception,” Mr. Dittes said."
2470,"Martin Zschächner, the prosecutor in Thuringia in charge of the investigation, denied that it was politically motivated. Speaking in a telephone interview, Mr. Zschächner said he was investigating Mr. Ruch because he was suspected of illegally “spying” on Mr. Höcke."
2471,"“On their internet page they said they wanted to spy on him, so the question is whether that happened or was planned,” Mr. Zschächner said. Sixteen months later, he said, the investigation was still continuing."
2472,"Meanwhile, the domestic intelligence service of Thuringia concluded long ago that neither Mr. Ruch nor his artist collective, the Berlin-based Center for Political Beauty, was extremist. “It’s political art, not extremism,” said Stephan Kramer, who heads the agency."
2473,"Mr. Ruch aims to offend. He has been sued countless times over his art, but so far he has never lost a case. And never before has anyone raised any suspicions of him being a criminal or involved in extremist activity, he said."
2474,"“That is the scary part,” Mr. Ruch said in an interview on Wednesday. “They could be observing me, tapping my phone, following me around because they don’t like my art and my politics.” He plans legal action against Mr. Zschächner."
2475,"The idea of making a replica memorial outside of Mr. Höcke’s house came to Mr. Ruch in January 2017. That month, Mr. Höcke spoke at a rally in Dresden and questioned the guiding precept of modern Germany — the country’s culpability in World War II and the Holocaust — calling on Germans to make a “180 degree” turn in the way they viewed their history."
2476,"Germans were “the only people in the world to plant a monument of shame in the heart of their capital,” he had said, referring to the Holocaust memorial in Berlin."
2477,"In addition to building the replica memorial, Mr. Ruch and his colleagues pretended to monitor Mr. Höcke’s family home from a fake spy room with old electronic equipment that was also open to visitors."
2478,"Sometimes, the artists would dress up as spies in trench coats and filmed Mr. Höcke’s house. Once, they even rifled through his trash to get a DNA sample in order to determine Mr. Höcke’s own racial purity. (It turned out he has Polish and Portuguese ancestry.)"
2479,"Another time, they offered 5,000 euros, or about $5,620, to anyone willing to provide a witness statement that Mr. Höcke has written under a pseudonym for a newsletter associated with a convicted neo-Nazi who lives two villages away."
2480,Mr. Ruch defended these measures as stunts aimed at raising awareness about how extremist Mr. Höcke’s views were in his opinion.
2481,"Two years later, Germany’s domestic intelligence office has in fact put Mr. Höcke and a number of other prominent members of the Alternative for Germany under observation for suspected extremism."
2482,"“What we did as fiction the state is now doing in reality,” Mr. Ruch said."
2483,Mr. Ruch has known since February that he was the subject of some investigation because a government-sponsored organization that had invited him to speak at a conference abruptly disinvited him on Feb. 12.
2484,"In a letter, the organization said it had been informed by the Interior Ministry about a criminal investigation regarding his person."
2485,"Mr. Ruch himself had not been informed that he was under investigation. It was only when Mr. Dittes contacted him last month that he began to make enquiries. But when he requested to see his file, he was denied access “because the investigations are still ongoing.”"

2487,"Francis Smith, an 83-year-old resident of East Harlem, stood at the end of a checkout counter at a local supermarket on Saturday, pulled out several plastic bags from her hand cart and began bagging her items."
2488,"A store employee helped her stuff paper towels into a worn, white plastic bag from Target that she had brought from home."
2489,"“I always carry extra plastic bags and never throw them away or waste any,” said Ms. Smith. “I understand that they do harm to the environment, but these ‘single-use’ bags can be used a lot.”"
2490,"Her reaction, and many like it, came after New York lawmakers agreed last week to impose a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags from most retail sales. The plan was included in the state’s $175 billion budget that was announced early Sunday."
2491,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo first proposed the ban, which could begin as early as next March, a year ago. New York is now the second state to impose such a rule; California banned plastic bags in 2016. Hawaii effectively has a statewide ban since all counties in the state bar the use of plastic bags."
2492,"New York’s ban allows for several exceptions, like wrapped deli meat, restaurant takeout bags and plastic garbage bags. The bill also allows counties to charge an optional 5-cent fee for customers who want brown paper bags, which has caused environmentalists to worry that reusable bags would become a less popular option."
2493,"Still, many city residents in lower-income neighborhoods, while appreciative of the environmental considerations, appeared wary about how the ban would impact their daily routines. One frequent question: Who would really bear the brunt of the legislation?"
2494,"To save money, many people said their families reused plastic bags as trash or recycling bags, or used them to bring lunch to work."
2495,"“I know this neighborhood is going through a change, but there’s still a lot of people here who can’t afford to take on more, and it’s a luxury to have the choice,” said Ms. Smith, who has lived in East Harlem for more than 60 years."
2496,"“Sometimes politicians mean well,” she added. “But unless they live in this type of community they wouldn’t know how a change like this could feel.”"
2497,"In January 2018, Suffolk County on Long Island began charging shoppers 5 cents per plastic bag, and usage dropped. In the first year of the added fee, grocery stores reported an 80 percent decrease in the distribution of single-use bags."
2498,Residents were forced to change their habits. Will city residents adjust as easily?
2499,"On the Lower East Side, Tony Strong, 51, stood against a fence in front of the La Guardia Houses, chatting with a friend, with two carts packed with bagged items and extra plastic bags beside them."
2500,"“We like to keep our plastic bags in our cubby cabinet and when we need to carry something, we reuse them,” he said as he pulled several used plastic bags out of his hand cart."
2501,"“I actually think they should keep them,” he said of the state’s ban. “But our government sometimes just doesn’t give us the choice. They do it, and we just have to adjust.”"
2502,"A manager of a bodega above the Kingston Avenue subway station in Brooklyn said using less plastic would be better for the city and that the store even tried selling reusable totes in the past, to no avail."
2503,"One resident of Manhattan’s Chinatown said she loved the ban, but predicted that her neighborhood would have a difficult time adjusting. Plastic bags, she said, are so prevalent in Chinatown that they were almost iconic."
2504,"Michael King, 44, wheeled a shopping cart out of a Foodtown grocery store in Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and then, one by one, lifted several plastic bags with the handles wrapped tightly around his fingers — three bags to a hand."
2505,Mr. King thought the plan seemed designed to “change grocery shopping culture” by steering it to online grocers.
2506,"“You’re actually dictating how I shop if I have to bring a bag with me,” Mr. King said. “See me, I’ve got one, two, three — five, six bags. So you’re telling me I have to leave my house with 20 bags if it’s Thanksgiving time?”"
2507,"The only beneficiaries, Mr. King said, would be big web-based retail delivery services like Amazon and FreshDirect. “They’re ready,” he said."
2508,"A fruit vendor on the Upper East Side, who supports the ban, said plastic bags should have been banned years ago. New Yorkers, he said, have become overly reliant on them."
2509,"“It’s embedded in them psychologically,” said Erdal Ozcan, 30, who lives in New Jersey but sets up his fruit stand on the corner of 86th Street and Second Avenue. “One box of blueberries, they want one bag. One cherry tomato, boom, one bag."
2510,"“People in this city might be upset for the first month, but hey, it’s the rules and they’ll get used to it,” he added, instinctively yanking a plastic white bag off a hook each time a customer purchased an item. “Yeah, the people here won’t like it, but who cares? It’s not for the people. It’s for the future, for the environment.”"
2511,Many New Yorkers understood that the bill was intended to improve environmental sustainability.
2512,"On 125th Street in Harlem, Nana Yaw, a 57-year-old sidewalk vendor from Ghana, was setting up his table with African jewelry, trinkets and statuettes. According to Mr. Yaw, in order to be more environmentally conscious, he has used paper bags for years."
2513,"“It’s important for the vendors to be into this, too — that’s how this part of the industry will change,” he said. “And as for the customers, as long as you give them something to carry their things, they will take it.”"
2514,"CHICAGO — Ever since Jussie Smollett, a star of the television series “Empire,” first claimed in January that he was the victim of a bizarre hate crime on a Chicago street, the case has taken one baffling twist after another, attracted wide attention on social media and inflamed passions on all sides. The police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime and made arrests, but later came to doubt Mr. Smollett’s account. He was accused of staging the incident, arrested and indicted, only to have prosecutors unexpectedly drop the charges on Tuesday. "
2515,Here are some key questions about where the affair stands now. 
2516,One aspect of the case is known to be in federal hands: a threatening letter mailed to Mr. Smollett in the weeks before the Jan. 29 incident that he reported as an attack. 
2517,"Prosecutors have said the F.B.I., which has jurisdiction over crimes committed using the mail, was conducting a forensic analysis of the letter. It came in an envelope with “MAGA” written in the left corner, an apparent reference to President Trump’s campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.” It also contained white powder; tests found it to be a painkilling drug. It is not clear whether the analysis has been completed. "
2518,"A law enforcement official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said on Thursday that the F.B.I. had previously opened a hate crime investigation while assisting local authorities with the case. It was unclear whether that investigation remained open or whether the F.B.I. had taken any additional steps."
2519,"On Thursday morning, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that there could be wider federal involvement: “F.B.I. & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!”"
2520,The F.B.I. declined to comment about a possible investigation.
2521,"The mayor of Chicago, Rahm Emanuel, reacted angrily to Mr. Trump’s Twitter message. Noting that the president had stirred controversy in 2017 with his response to the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., Mr. Emanuel said on WGN radio that Mr. Trump should “just sit this one out.”"
2522,"The mayor is unhappy, but is there anything the City of Chicago can do now?"
2523,"The city’s Law Department sent Mr. Smollet a letter on Thursday demanding “immediate payment” of more than $130,000 — the cost of overtime for more than two dozen detectives and police officers who investigated the case."
2524,"The city, the letter says, takes “seriously those who make false statements to the police, thereby diverting resources from other investigations and undermining the criminal justice system.”"
2525,"The Law Department said its demand for the payment — precisely $130,106.15 — is permitted by a city ordinance which allows the city to be reimbursed for costs in cases in which people have made false statements."
2526,"Bill McCaffrey, a spokesman for the Law Department, said the city had used the ordinance a number of times before, including when a doctor stabbed himself in 2011, but told the police that he had been attacked."
2527,"The city might take further legal action if it does not receive payment within seven days, the letter said."
2528,"Ms. Foxx, who promised to be a reformer when she was elected state’s attorney for Cook County in 2016, took herself off the case in February, saying that she had had conversations about the incident with a relative of Mr. Smollett. She also exchanged emails with Tina Tchen, a prominent Chicago lawyer and former aide to Michelle Obama. Ms. Tchen has said she sought to put Ms. Foxx in touch with the Smollett family over the family’s concerns about how the incident was being portrayed in public. "
2529,"At the urging of a Smollett relative, Ms. Foxx also contacted Eddie T. Johnson, the superintendent of the Chicago Police Department, and suggested that the F.B.I. take over the investigation. "
2530,"The police say Mr. Smollett hired two brothers to stage an assault on him, and gave them a check for $3,500, with the promise of another $500 later. The police have a copy of the check, surveillance video of the brothers’ movements before the attack, and phone records showing that they spoke with Mr. Smollett an hour before the incident, and then again an hour afterward."
2531,"In a document prepared for a bail hearing, prosecutors said they also had video of the brothers at the scene, text messages with Mr. Smollett, and the brothers’ testimony relating how Mr. Smollett had recruited them and how he had visited the scene of the incident with them the night before to prepare."
2532,"One unusual clue was an empty bottle of El Yucateco hot sauce, found at the scene more than a week after the incident. According to the police investigative report, detectives showed it to one of the brothers, who said “that it appeared to be the bottle he filled with bleach and poured on Smollett” during the incident. "
2533,"The police say that Mr. Smollett was upset over his pay for his role in “Empire,” and was seeking publicity. His salary has not been made public; it has been estimated in media reports at $65,000 to $100,000 an episode. "
2534,"“The stunt was orchestrated by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary,” Mr. Johnson, the police superintendent, told reporters in February. “So he concocted a story about being attacked.”"
2535,"At roughly 2 a.m. on Jan. 29, Mr. Smollett told the police, he was attacked by two masked men on a sidewalk near his home in an affluent neighborhood of downtown Chicago, as he was returning from a walk to pick up food at a nearby Subway sandwich shop. He said the two men yelled homophobic and racial slurs at him, slipped a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him. Mr. Smollett, who is black and gay, told the police that the men had yelled, “This is MAGA country.” "
2536,"Mr. Smollett has maintained throughout the affair, and said again on Tuesday after the charges against him were dropped, that he had told the police the truth. "
2537,"When I heard that federal prosecutors were charging 50 people in six states for a college admissions bribery scheme and read the accounts that followed, outlining all of the other extensive, mostly legal, help that applicants from rich families get, it underscored how different the admissions experience was for me and my high school classmates in Canarsie."
2538,"The Canarsie neighborhood of eastern Brooklyn is an hour subway ride from the gleaming skyscrapers of Manhattan and a world away from the door-opening privileges enjoyed by the children of households in “good” school districts (much less the dirty-rich families implicated in the bribery scandal.) Many of us came from low-income families, and few had parents who had attended college. We vaguely knew that college was crucial for future success, but we had little understanding of how to get there — and no idea how difficult it would be to navigate the process."
2539,"We all knew of the SAT, for instance, but had no concrete idea of how to prepare for it. We knew that you had to apply to college, and for financial aid, but didn’t know the necessary or “smart” steps. When you’re 17, and pretty much doing it all on your own, the sight of all the hurdles you have to jump can be demoralizing, even paralyzing."
2540,"Most public schools in the United States don’t have a single staff member dedicated to helping students apply to college. Instead, that duty falls on school counselors who have an enormous range of other duties, like assisting teenagers in crisis and making referrals to social welfare support services, coordinating school events, and working with students with learning disabilities. A 2017 survey by the National Association for College Admissions Counseling, found school counselors spend only about 20 percent of their time on college admissions."
2541,"Nationally, the average counselor-to-student ratio is 1 to 464. According to a report released this year by the A.C.L.U., 1.7 million students attend schools that have police officers roaming the halls but no counselors. At my high school, most of us wrote our college essays without adults or savvy older relatives to advise us what topics would make us more attractive candidates."
2542,We were also on our own when it came time to fill out the dreaded Free Application for Federal Student Aid: the document you have to fill out if you need financial aid — which was the case for nearly everyone in my high school. And the Fafsa can be numbingly complex for families without a high level of financial literacy — which was also the case for nearly everyone in my high school.
2543,"The Fafsa is pages upon pages of details about your parents’ finances. I had never filed taxes, so I didn’t know what half of the terms meant. It was scary because there was so much at stake."
2544,"At the time, I was living with my sister, sleeping on her couch, because my mom was in a homeless shelter. I almost missed out on qualifying for aid because I couldn’t get the forms I needed from my mother, who was still my legal guardian."
2545,"There were days I had to skip school to get to I.R.S. and Social Security offices when they were open. (I learned only much later that because I was technically homeless, I might have been able to receive a waiver, and not had to submit all those forms.)"
2546,I was not alone — many of my friends and classmates also had difficulty getting the forms and the information needed to apply for financial aid.
2547,"But the stress doesn’t stop when you submit the Fafsa. Instead of celebrating when we received acceptance letters, and announcing them online to virtual cheers, we anxiously awaited financial aid award letters and wondered if we’d be able to afford to enroll. And the fortunate among us who got into state schools were then prompted to apply to “opportunity programs” that help disadvantaged students pay for college. That meant submitting separate applications with additional essays and financial aid forms that require even more financial documentation than the Fafsa."
2548,"I came to realize that, in every step along the way, we had to do more because we had less. So, the summer before my senior year, I attended a summer program in New York City, run by an organization called College Access: Research and Action, that trained me to work as a peer college counselor in my high school."
2549,"I would sit with my classmates for hours as they made their way through the applications. When the time came to review complicated loan offers, we did our best to decipher the terminology in the contracts, and to steer students away from the many predatory offers we received. The wide scale of such predation is an interlocking harm that sows even further distrust of financial institutions in working-class communities."
2550," My experience and that of two other peer counselors is chronicled in the documentary “Personal Statement,” which will be screened on Capitol Hill next month. We hope the tangible, harsh realities depicted in the film will help those who witness it see the urgency of the issue."
2551,"Right now, the system feels like it is crafted to keep low-income students like us out of college. If it is, it’s working: Only nine percent of people from the lowest income quartile receive a bachelor’s degree by the age of 24, compared to 77 percent for the top income quartile."
2552,"That some rich families bribe their children’s way into college is the least of our problems. We’re more concerned by the college guidance gap and the maze of applying for financial aid. It shouldn’t be that difficult, fiscally or strategically, to get college advice and to fill out the Fafsa. Higher education’s admissions system should be designed to support our success, not to suppress it."

He and his older brother bought a building in TriBeCa, gutted and rebuilt it, and opened a recording studio there. He lived on the top floor. Later, Mr. Ferguson bought a two-bedroom condominium in SoHo, where he lived with his wife, and sold the TriBeCa building."

2559,"Still, he thought the family would stay put for the long haul. But then “life happened.” His son was diagnosed with autism. Mr. Ferguson and his wife divorced, sharing custody of their two young children. He ended up in a smaller two-bedroom in the same building. "
2560,"For three years, the children shared a bedroom when they were with him. And the smaller footprint made a big difference. "
2561,"“The kids were getting bigger and older, and needed their own rooms,” he said. Kate is now 6 and Owen is 7. “I wanted to give them a backyard.”"
2562,"So he began looking for more space, planning to spend somewhere in the low $3 million range. He was hoping for a three- or four-bedroom home, preferably with outdoor space for the children and his dog, Biko. He knew that would be hard to find in Manhattan, so he headed to Brooklyn."
2563,"Mr. Ferguson liked the feeling of the Williamsburg waterfront. But he knew that driving to and from the West Side of Manhattan, where he picked up and dropped off the children, would be arduous."
2564,"He was also intrigued by Red Hook, which had a similar waterfront vibe. He started driving around the neighborhood and visiting open houses. An old maritime village, Red Hook is known these days for its two big retailers, Ikea and Fairway Market. It is a transit desert, with no subway station. But it had one great advantage for Mr. Ferguson: The nearby Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel (now the Hugh L. Carey Tunnel) made for quick access to the West Side."
2565,"One prominent option was 160 Imlay Street, the six-story, 70-unit former New York Dock Company warehouse, dating to 1910, currently undergoing conversion to condominiums. "
2566,"The location was adjacent to the docks at Atlantic Basin, with views of Governors Island, the Statue of Liberty and Lower Manhattan. But with assorted development and transit plans for the area, which was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Mr. Ferguson was concerned about enduring years of construction in the area and possibly losing the view. "
2567,"Also, the massive building was nowhere near ready for occupancy. "
2568,"“Eliot was concerned that there were really big delays,” said his agent, Suzun Bennet, a licensed sales associate at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices New York Properties. “It wasn’t at a stage that we could get a clear idea of what he would be buying.”"
2569,"He checked out a few of the neighborhood’s houses, primarily charming, two-family brick buildings dating to the late 1800s. One on Coffey Street was asking $2.25 million. He was reluctant, though, to spend so much on a house that needed extensive renovations to make it a single-family home."
2570,"“I have done several very large projects and don’t have the time or energy to do it again,” he said. “I just kind of wanted to find something that was already done.” (The Coffey Street house later sold for $2.15 million.)"
2571,"Mr. Ferguson also found himself unhappy with flipped houses. “The build quality was an issue,” he said."
2572,"Then he discovered the King & Sullivan townhomes: 22 single-family houses, each with three stories, four bedrooms and three bathrooms, plus a backyard, roof deck and a driveway. (Three are still for sale.)"
2573,"“He was relieved to have found something that would work for him,” Ms. Bennet said. “This is the best of the brownstone world and the new-development world — a brownstone without all the traditional problems.” And it was 2,800 square feet, double the size of his condo."
2574,"In a flood zone like Red Hook, new buildings must be several feet above grade. Each house also has a drainage system, said the listing agent, Paul Johansen, a licensed associate broker at Stribling & Associates. "
2575,"“We future-proofed the building by raising the first floor nearly three feet from the ground plane and bringing all mechanical systems above this level,” Mr. Johansen said. (Buyers also need flood insurance.)"
2576,"Late last spring, Mr. Ferguson bought his house for $3.3 million. Monthly taxes are in the high $1,400s."
2577,"He hesitated to let go of his old place. “I wanted a lifeboat in case the whole Red Hook thing didn’t work and it was a disaster,” he said. But within a few months he realized how much he liked the neighborhood, so he sold the condo."
2578,"Living in a house is both harder and easier, he has discovered. Three floors means a lot of stairs, which he initially gated for the children’s safety. But he doesn’t need to take the dog down and up in an elevator several times a day; Biko just runs outside and back in."
2579,"And the children can use the school playground across the street during nonschool hours. “We go there all the time,” Mr. Ferguson said. “A lot of people would not want to live across from a school and hear the sound of kids screaming, but that sounds good to me.” "
2580,"Otherwise, his new block is quiet and calm. “There is no traffic, there is no honking,” he said. “I can get out on the stoop, and it feels like a much smaller world, which is refreshing.”"
2581,"As for the children, they still share a bedroom. But they’re afraid of the dark, so they rarely use it. "
2582,"“Even if I put them in their beds to sleep,” Mr. Ferguson said, “they sleep in my bed.”"

2585,"DC Comics’s latest superhero spectacle, “Shazam!,” which opens this weekend, follows the comedic adventures of Billy Batson (Asher Angel), a teenage boy who transforms into an adult superhero called Shazam (Zachary Levi). A buff, lightning-bolt-emblazoned man-boy, Shazam isn’t as well-known now as he used to be. But he is one of the most important heroes in comic history."
2586,"Shazam first appeared in Whiz Comics No. 2 in 1939, quickly becoming one of the most popular comic book characters of the 1940s. In his prime, he regularly outsold Superman and Batman. And he was the first comic book superhero to appear on film."
2587,"Back then, however, he went by the name Captain Marvel, which is a bit confusing, particularly given the debut of Marvel’s “Captain Marvel” last month. That may also help explain why Shazam feels a bit unfamiliar today."
2588,"[Our critic called “Shazam!” a “nice change of pace for a big-screen mega-comic, if not a revolutionary shift”]"
2589,"Early box office predictions indicate that may be changing. Still, who is this guy? And what’s with the Captain Marvel thing? Here’s a primer on Shazam’s history."
2590,"In 1939, Fawcett Comics was looking to capitalize on the superhero boom created by characters like Superman. The writer Bill Parker came up with the idea of a team of superheroes, each of whom possessed the power of a different mythological figure. The idea was ultimately revised to just one character with all of those powers, and thus was born Shazam."
2591,"Parker originally called him Captain Thunder, but that name was already trademarked, so he switched to Captain Marvel. (A competitor, Timely Comics, did not rebrand as Marvel Comics until 1961.) The artist C.C. Beck was the illustrator, and he continued to draw Captain Marvel throughout the 1940s."
2592,[Read the history of Marvel’s Captain Marvel here]
2593,"In his first appearance, Billy is an orphaned paperboy who meets a wizard in a mysterious subway station. After learning about Billy’s sad life, the wizard declares that he is too old to keep fighting crime and asks Billy to take his place. He endows Billy with the power to turn into Captain Marvel any time he says the word “Shazam,” which is an acronym for the “immortal elders” who give him his powers: Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles and Mercury."
2594,"The fact that Captain Marvel was secretly a kid made him a favorite among young readers. “Whiz Comics” No. 2 sold 500,000 copies, and the character’s own series, “Captain Marvel Adventures,” first came out in 1941, the same year he made his big screen debut."
2595,"That film debut, in March 1941, was the 12-part live-action Republic Pictures serial “Adventures of Captain Marvel.” It is considered the first comic book superhero film, and it beat the first animated Superman cartoons to the big screen by six months."
2596,"In that version, Billy is a young explorer on an expedition to Siam, where he encounters the wizard. As Captain Marvel, he is tasked with protecting the world from the Golden Scorpion, an ancient and dangerous device sought by scientists and criminals. “Adventures of Captain Marvel” feels somewhat primitive and surprisingly violent by today’s superhero standards (Captain Marvel kills a lot of people), but it’s worth viewing to see how far the genre has come."
2597,"In 1951, National Comics Publications successfully argued that Captain Marvel was a copyright infringement on Superman because of their similar powers, costumes and artwork, signaling an end to a legal battle that began a decade earlier. (National had even tried to block the release of “Adventures of Captain Marvel.”) Fawcett paid National $400,000 in damages and was forced to cancel all of its superhero publications. No new Captain Marvel comics were produced for the next 22 years."
2598,"In 1972, DC Comics acquired the rights to Fawcett’s characters and began producing new Captain Marvel stories the next year. Marvel Comics, however, had meanwhile trademarked the name, creating its own Captain Marvel in 1967. DC was permitted to call its superhero Captain Marvel, but it was not allowed to use the name on any marketing or titles featuring the character. DC decided to sell its Captain Marvel books under the title “Shazam!”"
2599,"A children’s television series based on DC’s Captain Marvel, titled “Shazam!,” debuted on CBS in 1974. In the series, Billy (Michael Gray) travels around the country in a motor home with an adult companion (Les Tremayne) solving problems each week by turning into Captain Marvel (played by Jackson Bostwick and later John Davey). The show had a very low budget, so Captain Marvel appeared only very briefly in each episode."
2600,"The show lasted three seasons. A short-lived animated series featuring Captain Marvel, called “The Kid Super Power Hour With Shazam!” followed in 1981, and lasted 12 episodes, but that was his last starring role for a while."
2601,"Through the 1980s and ’90s, DC further integrated Captain Marvel into its comic universe, giving the character appearances in “Justice League,” “Kingdom Come” and his own continuing series, “The Power of Shazam!,” which lasted from 1995 to 1999. He returned to television in a 2005 episode of “Justice League Unlimited.” Playing on the fraught history between Captain Marvel and Superman, the character is introduced as a big fan of Superman, but the two heroes eventually come to blows."
2602,"The episode includes a fun Easter egg for comic book fans, as Captain Marvel’s hometown is named Fawcett City after his original publisher. Captain Marvel also makes several appearances in the Cartoon Network series “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and in several of DC’s direct-to-video animated films."
2603,"In 2011, DC Comics relaunched all its comics with the New 52 initiative. New 52 was an attempt to simplify decades of complicated comic book history, and Captain Marvel received an updated origin story by the writer Geoff Johns, along with an official name change to Shazam."
2604,"The new “Shazam!” film incorporates multiple elements of the back story introduced by Johns. In 2018, DC debuted a new “Shazam!” comic book, the character’s first continuing series in nearly 20 years. Shazam may never again overtake Superman in popularity, but the box office and critical success of the new film should ensure that a whole new generation will know his name."
2605,"Miche Griffin grew up on a farm near Nashville, dreaming of a more exciting life. “As a kid, I was drawing pictures of my loft in New York City,” she said. “Somewhere deep inside, I knew I needed the distraction and the busyness that the city offered.”"
2606,"She arrived in the East Village nearly 30 years ago, feeling like a pioneer and a risk-taker. “That was when Tompkins Square Park was full of tents, and one guy had cooked his girlfriend and fed her to the homeless people,” she said. “That was what I moved to.”"
2607,"Ms. Griffin eventually settled with her partner in a two-bedroom rental in a walk-up building, above a restaurant on a busy East Village block, and their daughter was born not long after. Her partner died about a decade later. "
2608,"Three and a half years ago, their daughter left for college in New England. She was never a city girl at heart, Ms. Griffin said. Even as a child, she agonized about homeless people, and complained that the playground was too loud and disorienting. When she moved away, “She said, ‘I don’t think I’ll live in New York City again.’”"
2609,"With her nest empty, Ms. Griffin, now 51, was ready to upgrade, downsize and escape a block that was increasingly noisy and crowded. “What used to be professionals or bohemians was turning into a party neighborhood,” she said. “It was like a fraternity party, and it is not conducive to daily living.”"
2610,"And the apartment was no longer much of a gathering place. “Ours was the apartment that all the kids came to, and when my daughter went to university it was like I lost five kids and not one,” she said. “I thought it would be healthy for me to have a clean slate.”"
2611,"Ms. Griffin, who works in the field of corporate relocation for international clients, went on the hunt for a one-bedroom with a monthly rent of up to $4,000 for herself and her German shorthaired pointer, Sacha."
2612,"She was willing to live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which had a similar vibe to her beloved East Village, and where she figured she could get a nicer apartment on a better block for a similar rent. She didn’t feel too old for the neighborhood. “My personality totally fits,” she said."
2613,"She had been eyeing the Lewis Steel Building, a converted steel factory with exposed brick and industrial style on North Fourth Street. Most one-bedrooms there were in the low $3,000s."
2614,"At that point, Williamsburg was preparing for the L train to close for repairs. Ms. Griffin works from home, so she thought she could function day to day without the train. But then she reconsidered, fearing she might feel disconnected or spend too much on cabs. "
2615,"“The apartment was right, but the location wasn’t,” she said. “The East Village was the one place I belonged.”"
2616,"She liked the central location of the glassy Avalon Bowery Place, completed more than a decade ago, near the corner of Houston Street. It was across from a Whole Foods Market, with convenient subway access. But her budget would get her only a studio there. “I need to be able to separate my bedroom from my live-work area,” she said."
2617,"A friend from the Tompkins Square Dog Run mentioned the Niko, a brand-new rental building about as far east as possible, at the corner of Avenue D. The size was appealing — a not-overwhelming 12 stories — with a panoramic view from the roof deck."
2618,"Ms. Griffin found herself liking the area, which was more residential and less crowded than she was used to. It felt like the East Village she had known three decades earlier."
2619,"She considered her daily routine. “Rite Aid is right downstairs, and the grocery stores are less expensive,” she said. A Citi Bike station was across the street, and the M14D bus stop was a block away. Both East River Park and Tompkins Square Park were quick trips, for walking Sacha. "
2620,"“She was ready to move to a nice place that was new, where she is not going to have any issues,” said the leasing agent, Adrienn Feher of MNS Real Estate."
2621,"Ms. Feher showed Ms. Griffin a one-bedroom with a terrace, thinking she might like it for the dog, but it was on a low floor with less light than she wanted. Besides, Ms. Griffin knew she would walk Sacha more often if she didn’t have her own outdoor space. She picked a sunny one-bedroom on a higher floor, with windows facing Avenue D. "
2622,"She arrived last fall. “It’s the first time I’ve lived somewhere where everything works,” she said."
2623,"Her rent is $3,475 a month (the building is currently offering two months free on new leases, so her monthly payment came to $3,089 over the lease term). Amenities, slated to be $100 a month, are currently free."
2624,"Ms. Griffin easily fit her Indian teak table in the large living-dining area. “I cook a ton — it’s a passion,” she said. “That is my social life. I am not out at bars.”"
2625,"And she found an unexpected advantage to living so far east: “I get to places quicker because I am right beside the F.D.R. When I was more central, I would get stuck in traffic.”"
2626,"In her new, calmer spot in the East Village, Ms. Griffin has met many neighbors. The building staff — including her first-ever doorman — is friendly, “which was very appealing to me, being an empty nester,” she said. People greet one another on the street. If she is short of change at the deli, she pays the next time. "
2627,"“I forget I am not on a porch in the South,” she said."

2631,"Near the High Line in Manhattan, more than 250 people gathered at The Park, a restaurant, last week to hear about a Democratic mayor’s long-shot bid for the presidency."
2632,"The New York City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, worked the crowd, boasting about the mayor’s accomplishments, and how he had done a “tremendous amount” to “create jobs” and move “the conversation nationally” to important issues."
2633,"But the mayor in question was not Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, population 8.6 million. It was Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., population 102,245."
2634,Both men are considering a presidential run but only one of their potential candidacies seems to be taken seriously.
2635,"Mr. Buttigieg, 37, has raised money from more than 65,000 individual donors, qualifying him to participate in the first Democratic debate in June. A recent poll of the Iowa caucus by Emerson Polling placed Mr. Buttigieg in third among Democrats."
2636,"Mr. de Blasio, 57, has appeared before small crowds in early primary states such as Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire, and came in last in a recent Quinnipiac University poll that asked which New York politician would make the best president."
2637,"“Bill de Blasio’s Embarrassing Quest for National Fame,” was the headline on a recent article in The New Republic about Mr. de Blasio’s travels to early primary states."
2638,"Even in New York, Mr. Buttigieg, perhaps unsurprisingly, seemed to be the mayor of choice for a White House bid."
2639,"“Mayor Pete is fresh, he’s untainted,” said Michael Zorek, 58, who attended a fund-raiser Friday for Mr. Buttigieg in Chelsea with his wife, Shelly Friedland, 53, a lawyer; the couple lives on the Upper West Side. “He has an entirely different story than any other politician in our lifetime.”"
2640,Mr. Buttigieg (pronounced BOOT-edge-edge) is gay and married and a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who speaks Arabic. He gained exposure in 2017 after a failed run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
2641,"“Mayor de Blasio’s record here is mixed,” Ms. Friedland chimed in. “I don’t think he’s terrible, but I don’t support him moving to another job.”"
2642,"Katie Held, 35, a tech product manager who has lived in Manhattan for four years, said Mr. Buttigieg has “East Coast values with a Midwestern knowledge.”"
2643,"Asked about a potential de Blasio campaign for president, Ms. Held said, “No. Stay where you are. Work on that.”"
2644,"Ever since Mr. de Blasio unexpectedly emerged from a clump of Democrats to become mayor in 2013, he has sought to broaden his message and profile to a national audience."
2645,"Mr. de Blasio quickly achieved his signature accomplishment, universal prekindergarten, but his tenure has been marred by increased homelessness, the continued deterioration of the city’s public housing stock and scrutiny over some of his fund-raising techniques."
2646,He has even been blamed for the city’s troubled subway system although he is not in charge of it.
2647,"Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. de Blasio, said comparing Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. de Blasio was “apples and oranges” because the mayor is not a candidate. Mr. Casca, it should be noted, previously worked for Bernie Sanders on his 2016 presidential campaign and in his Senate office, and is one of two City Hall aides helping the mayor with his presidential aspirations."
2648,"Rebecca Katz, a former special adviser to Mr. de Blasio who is not currently attached to his exploratory bid, said that the mayor “has a progressive record to run on that is strong, but of all the candidates he has the busiest day job.”"
2649,"“Bill de Blasio put almost as many kids through pre-K last year as who live in South Bend,” she added."
2650,But there is no question that Mr. Buttigieg has generated more buzz; his recent visit to Manhattan was his third fund-raising effort in New York City.
2651,"“To have an openly gay mayor to now be considered the hottest ticket in town running for president is a very, very exciting thing,” said Mr. Johnson, who is gay."
2652,Why not Mr. de Blasio?
2653,"“I think Bill has accomplishments to point to like universal pre-K,” Mr. Johnson said. If Mr. de Blasio runs, “there needs to be a message that inspires people.”"
2654,"Mr. Johnson stressed that he has not endorsed anyone for president yet; that was also the case for Phil Walzak, a former top de Blasio adviser who attended Mr. Buttigieg’s fund-raiser at The Park."
2655,"“Mayor Pete has a compelling story and message,” said Mr. Walzak, now the top spokesman for the Police Department. But he added that Mr. de Blasio “has a real record to run on.”"
2656,"Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College, said that there was a general sense that Mr. de Blasio “has not been terribly successful at managing New York City.”"
2657,"He added: “He started out very well, made good appointments, did pre-K, a major achievement, and family leave. The first six months to a year made you hungry to see what was coming next, and the answer was bupkis.”"
2658,"Mr. de Blasio has offered a different view of his tenure; on a recent trip to New Hampshire, he highlighted initiatives like universal prekindergarten and a push to make mental health services more broadly available as things that should become national priorities."
2659,"All of these efforts are going “full steam,” the mayor said recently, in response to a question of how he would respond to New Yorkers wondering why he was in South Carolina or Iowa. The fact that Mr. Buttigieg is getting more attention will not deter him, the mayor said."
2660,"“I don’t pay a whole lot of attention to what other folks do,” he said."
2661,Mr. Buttigieg also declined to speak specifically about his fellow mayor.
2662,"“At a moment where the party is really trying to figure out what its future will be, the bigger the range of options, the better off we’ll be,” Mr. Buttigieg said just before leaving New York for South Carolina."
2663,"Still, it was somewhat telling that Mr. Buttigieg had been introduced by Mr. Johnson, Mr. de Blasio’s City Hall colleague."
2664,"“One of the most attractive qualities in politics is authenticity, and a good story and a level of enthusiasm and charisma, and I think Mayor Pete has shown that through the course of this short campaign,” Mr. Johnson said. “His message has been inspiring for people, and people at this moment in time want to be inspired.”"

2666,"Words are written on it, steelworkers’ words like “OK to weld” that do not speak to what happened in the place where it is going."
2667,"They are written on the last steel beam for one of the last major construction projects at the World Trade Center site, brand-new metal bound for a place where 18 years ago ruined girders became symbols of destruction."
2668,"At some point in early April, truckers will haul the 374,000-pound, 34-feet-long, 12-feet tall beam over the George Washington Bridge and down the West Side Highway under a police escort. It has been lying on its side on a trailer in a parking lot in New Jersey. One of the trucking-company executives involved in the move said the tolls would probably cost about $700."
2669,"When it arrives in Lower Manhattan, it will play an important role at a performing arts center, holding the place up — literally. It is to be the linchpin of a building that will have three theaters close to 1 World Trade Center, so close that the beam will be fitted into two slots in the concrete foundation of that 1,776-feet-tall tower."
2670,"The designers say the beam and six smaller ones already in place will act like massive stilts, distributing the weight of the new arts complex, officially known as the Ronald O. Perelman Performing Arts Center."
2671,"The beam has a name. “Big Boy, we sometimes call it,” said Maggie Boepple, the president of the arts center. “Who was the Greek god who held up the world? Big Boy is our Atlas. Unfortunately, he’ll be in the dark very soon. He will be covered by concrete and very expensive fire-retardant paint and some foam.”"
2672,"Ms. Boepple was so excited about the beam that she went to New Jersey for a first look with colleagues on the arts center team. “I spent two years looking at things on a piece of paper,” said Matthew Wilson, the construction manager. “It’s good to see it.”"
2673,"Ms. Boepple said she was “almost weepy, and I’m not like that.”"
2674,"Unlike the office towers and the Cortlandt Street subway stop on the No. 1 line, which was buried under debris on Sept. 11, 2001, the arts center is not a replacement for something that was destroyed. The trade center complex never had an arts center."
2675,"But Daniel Libeskind’s 2003 master plan for the site called for one, and the architect Frank Gehry did two mock-ups, a building that was a series of rectangular shapes, like shoe boxes stacked atop one another. There was talk of possible tenants, including the New York City Opera, the Signature Theater and the Joyce Theater."
2676,"The City Opera filed for bankruptcy, the Signature moved to West 42nd Street, the Joyce stayed put in Chelsea, Mr. Gehry’s blueprints were put aside and the arts center seemed slow to evolve."
2677,"Ms. Boepple said it could not have taken shape sooner, because it will occupy space that had been used for a PATH station until Santiago Calatrava’s World Trade Center Transportation Hub opened in 2016."
2678,"But according to Frank Sciame, the chairman of the construction company that will build the Perelman structure once the beam is in place, it had an influential champion: John C. Whitehead, a well-connected former investment banker who was the chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, a state entity that was given the mandate to rebuild the trade center site."
2679,"Mr. Sciame said that when stakeholders were wrangling over real estate and federal aid, tax breaks and insurance payments, Mr. Whitehead told him, “Do not touch the performing arts center. Without the performing arts center, ground zero and Lower Manhattan will never be revitalized.” (Mr. Whitehead died in 2015.)"
2680,"The current plan was eventually created by the Brooklyn-based firm REX and its principal, Joshua Ramus, who was formerly a partner of Rem Koolhaas. The marble-skinned cube will be a flexible performance space with maneuverable walls that can be joined in different ways, forming three small-to-medium-size theaters, or a single 1,200-seat one. There are 13 possible combinations."
2681,"When the project is completed in 2021, there will be a restaurant and cafe in the lobby. Ms. Boepple said she had heard from people who work in the office towers at the trade center that “what they wanted was a place to come and hang out and get away from the corporate atmosphere.” She said she was borrowing “the whole concept of hanging out” from the Young Vic Theater in London. “It’s open all day long,” she said, “and it’s always full.”"
2682,"So far, the center has raised 84 percent of the $390 million construction cost. Mr. Perelman, a billionaire, jump-started the project with a $75 million donation in 2016, less than a year after he stepped down as chairman of Carnegie Hall, where he had clashed with its staff and other board members. (He said in 2016 that his donation was not related to his departure from Carnegie Hall.)"
2683,"Last year, the center hired an artistic director, Bill Rauch of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, who has a reputation for commissioning intriguing projects. Some arts executives say one challenge the Perelman could face is standing out, considering the competition for audiences from spaces like the Shed, in the new Hudson Yards complex."
2684,"The project is unusually complicated because the theater will sit not on the ground but on top of a structure owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Ms. Boepple said it houses nine kennels for Port Authority police dogs and a messenger center for 1 World Trade Center, among other things."
2685,"For the beam, the New Jersey parking lot, down the road from a landfill and a truck-overhaul garage, is a stop on a journey that began in Columbia, S.C., where it was fabricated. John McCafferty of J. Supor and Son, the company that will carry the beam into Manhattan, said it had taken eight weeks to negotiate a route. City agencies turned down several possibilities, he said, and the clearance on some turns will be tight."
2686,"“There are times where you’re talking about an inch,” Mr. McCafferty said."
2687,"Ms. Boepple walked around the beam in the parking lot, delighted. “Over and over, the structural engineers did these calculations, and we had all the naysayers — ‘Can’t be done, can’t be done,’” she said."
2688,"One batch of calculations showed that the beam could bear a load of more than 6,600 tons. Another, less essential set showed that 6,600 tons was slightly more than the weight of 900 elephants."
2689,"“Big elephants,” Ms. Boepple said. “We’re not talking about babies. Adults.”"
2690,"Airplanes, with their cramped quarters and crowded conditions, would seem improbable settings for sexual assaults, but recent news accounts show they do happen."
2691,"A Detroit-area man who was convicted of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger during an overnight flight was sentenced to nine years in prison, and two men were charged in separate cases last year. In August, a female passenger described on Twitter how a man masturbated sitting next to her for hours."
2692,"And this week, two flight attendants for JetBlue filed a lawsuit in federal court against the airline and two of its pilots, alleging that the pilots drugged both attendants during a layover and that one of the pilots raped one of the women and a co-worker."
2693,"Laura Palumbo, communications director at the National Sexual Violence Resource Center in Harrisburg, Pa., said there was every reason to believe that sexual assaults and harassment on flights had started getting increased attention thanks to the #MeToo movement and after a 2016 report that Donald J. Trump, decades before he became president, sexually assaulted a businesswoman on a flight. (He denied the allegation.)"
2694,"Definitive figures about sexual assaults on flights are elusive because no clearinghouse for data exists, the figures that are collected are scattershot and sexual assaults are the most underreported of violent crimes, experts said."
2695,"The F.B.I. tracks only the cases that are reported to it, and the federal Department of Transportation says it forwards such reports to the relevant airline, not to other federal authorities."
2696,"Ayn Dietrich-Williams, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I.’s Seattle field office, which started an awareness campaign about in-flight sexual assaults, said the number of such assaults reported to the bureau climbed to 63 in the 2017 fiscal year from 38 in the 2014 fiscal year. It dropped to 39 in the 2018 fiscal year."
2697,"One-fifth of flight attendants said they had received a report of passenger-on-passenger sexual assault while working on a flight, according to a 2017 survey by the Association of Flight Attendants-C.W.A. Law enforcement officials were contacted or met the plane less than half the time, the survey found."
2698,"The International Air Transport Association, an industry trade group, collects figures about disruptive passengers, a label that covers an array of behavior, including physical touching and racial slurs."
2699,"However, not every airline is an association member, not every member submits data and the filings are voluntary, making it “likely that the statistics significantly underestimate” the reports, the association said."
2700,"Investigations can also be a jurisdictional maze, depending on which agency an assault is reported to, Ms. Palumbo said. It is not unusual for victims to return home and file a report with their local police department, which might then say it does not have the authority to follow up."
2701,"“For victims and survivors, every barrier to making this report increases the likelihood that they just will give up and not report,” she said."
2702,"Considering the crowded, confined space on a plane, wouldn’t an assailant fear being caught?"
2703,"Kris Macomber, an assistant professor of sociology at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C., said the attacks were an extension of what women have long endured in other public spaces, such as streets, buses and subways. Any fear predators might have about getting caught is overcome by their perceived sense of control."
2704,"We also live in a “era of distraction” in which passengers watch movies, listen to music or take sleep medications, making intervention by fellow passengers less likely, Professor Macomber said."
2705,Ms. Palumbo said attacks had been known to happen in broad daylight and to passengers in aisle seats where they would be visible to even more potential witnesses.
2706,The F.B.I. said offenders would test victims’ boundaries by pretending to brush against them to see if they react or wake up. The agency suggested keeping the armrest down between you and your seatmates no matter how friendly they might appear.
2707,"Tammy Yard-McCracken, the owner of Personal Defense Industries in Virginia and a certified conflict communication instructor, recommended that passengers be mindful about what they divulge to strangers."
2708,"“Everything you say is information,” she said. “People don’t think about what they say in casual social settings.”"
2709,"She recalled overhearing a woman tell a seatmate that the previous six months had been tough because of a divorce. “That’s intel to somebody who is target hunting,” she said."
2710,"If you want to politely end a conversation with a stranger, say you need to catch up on reading or work and take out a book or a laptop."
2711,"You could also put in earbuds, which Ms. Yard-McCracken described as “the universal signal that I’m not talking to other people.” If you are trying to ditch someone who you no longer want to talk to and signal you are going to end the chat, put in the buds and leave the music off."
2712,"If a person makes you uncomfortable or is invading your personal space, ask to be relocated, Ms. Palumbo said. Don’t hesitate to press the call button for a flight attendant or leave your seat to seek one."
2713,Ms. Yard-McCracken recommended responding to transgressions of social norms by setting boundaries.
2714,"Ask the person to stop the intrusive behavior: “Can you please stop touching my leg?” If it persists, escalate to a “command statement,” such as, “I need you to stop touching my leg.”"
2715,"Failing that, use a “statement of consequences,” such as, “If you don’t stop touching my leg, I will call a flight attendant.”"
2716,"Rory Miller, a former corrections officer who has written books about self-defense, suggested calling attention to yourself."
2717,"“If you just say it loudly enough that everyone looks at you, ‘Hey you pervert, keep your hands off me,”’ he said, “everyone looks and keeps on looking. ‘Pervert’ is a magic word for self-defense.”"
2718,A Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill last year included the creation of a sexual misconduct task force.
2719,"The flight attendants’ union has spearheaded action on the issue. The union’s international president, Sara Nelson, said executives from airlines such as Alaska, United and Spirit had made it clear they have zero tolerance for sexual harassment of their staff or passengers."
2720,She said a cultural change was needed at every level — from flight crews to air traffic controllers and airport personnel — that sexual harassment and assaults will be taken seriously.
2721,"“Ultimately, this is not going to get resolved by putting this on the victim to solve it,” Ms. Nelson said. “It really does take everyone speaking up and saying this has got to be different.”"
2722,"Two months ago, the hedge fund magnate Kenneth C. Griffin paid a record-breaking $238 million for a penthouse on Central Park South, and it wasn’t even what most people would call home. Mr. Griffin is from Chicago, where he can put his feet up in a penthouse he bought for $59 million, or in one of the rooms on two floors he bought for $30 million in a hotel there. He also has a $60 million Miami condominium and a $122 million London mansion. "
2723,"The New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer, estimates about 5,400 properties in the city are worth more than $5 million and are not the owner’s primary residence. Some, like Mr. Griffin’s pad, are luxurious pieds-à-terre for out-of-towners. Many others were bought by shell companies that don’t reveal their true owners, meant to allow overseas tycoons to stash money out of sight."
2724,"At a time of soaring inequality and towering infrastructure needs, taxing these gleaming penthouses is an enticing idea. The logic is straightforward: It is one way in which New Yorkers can benefit from the desire of other people to visit the city that New Yorkers own and operate."
2725,New York certainly needs the money.
2726,"There’s the added benefit that so-called pied-à-terre taxes are politically palatable. Sending a higher tax bill to wealthy homeowners who don’t live, pay taxes or vote in New York will be far more popular with lawmakers than broader assessments on wealthier residents, such as raising income taxes on millionaires or property tax rates on all luxury homes. Democrats, having won full control of the state government in November’s elections, are seriously considering a pied-à-terre tax in this year’s budget."
2727,"The proposal, which could be revised, would allow New York City to impose an additional tax on homes that are not an owner’s primary residence and are worth more than $5 million. These properties would be taxed on an ascending scale, from 0.5 percent on a market value of more than $5 million, up to 4 percent on the values above $25 million. Mr. Stringer estimates the tax could generate roughly $650 million in annual revenue based on current conditions. "
2728,"Cities that have adopted such taxes have seen drops in prices and construction of high-end homes. New York City would almost certainly see similar results — it’s just a question of by how much. In cities that have tried it, other factors also affected prices. Still, the tax is one small way to make New York City a little fairer and raise revenue that could be used for the city’s subways, schools or affordable housing."
2729,"It’s no substitute, though, for more difficult reforms of the property tax system. "
2730,"Rental apartment buildings bear a disproportionate share of the city’s tax burden while multimillion-dollar brownstones and co-ops and condos at the high end of the market get steep breaks. In 2017, for example, the owners of a $500,000 home in Elmhurst, Queens, had a $4,297 tax bill — the same as a $9 million home in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, according to data from the city’s Finance Department."
2731,"Home buyers who need a mortgage in New York pay a mortgage recording tax, while wealthier buyers who purchase property in cash pay none. Mr. Stringer, the comptroller, has proposed eliminating the mortgage recording tax and instead increasing the transfer taxes on high-priced properties. That would put New York in line with other cities better at capturing revenues from the super wealthy. “They’ve gotten a free ride in New York,” Mr. Stringer said."
2732,"In terms of generating a new revenue stream, when funds are urgently needed, the pied-à-terre tax is a good start. "
2733,"Many governments worldwide have moved to capture a piece of soaring real estate prices through similar schemes. Paris has a tax aimed at second homes used as investment properties. So does Melbourne. In 2016, Britain imposed a 3 percent surcharge on the purchase of second homes."
2734,"While the British tax raised 1.68 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) from 2016 to 2017, higher taxes on home sales in general may have contributed to a slowdown in the real estate market, according to a report from the London School of Economics. It’s also widely believed that turmoil over Brexit could have weakened the market."
2735,"Housing sales around Vancouver, British Columbia, which recently adopted several new taxes on nonresident buyers and the owners of empty homes, declined by more than 30 percent in 2018, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Yet that decline could also have been caused, or exacerbated, by rising interest rates. Vancouver officials said they expected one of the taxes, a 1 percent levy on vacant homes, to raise $38 million annually."
2736,"The Real Estate Board of New York, an industry lobbying group, says the proposed tax would cripple the housing market, where luxury sales already sharply declined last year. The industry group also says the tax would bring in about half the revenue the comptroller estimates. "
2737,"Concerns about the tax’s effect on the real estate market are worth considering, since the industry has provided New York with tax revenue and jobs. But the money the tax would generate, even if less than now estimated, makes it worthwhile."
2738,"With the state projecting lower income tax revenue, and the fate of an effort to legalize — and tax — marijuana in question, the pied-à-terre tax is gaining steam. Lawmakers are pushing to include the proposal, sponsored by State Senator Brad Hoylman and Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, in the state budget. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said the revenue should go toward the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "
2739,Wealthy people from around the world who invest in New York City real estate reap rewards on that investment because of the goods and services the city provides. Asking them to pay more is common sense.

2742,"When the Islamic State raised its black flag over the Syrian city of Raqqa in early 2014, it began its transformation from fringe regional player to fearsome global threat. By the end of that year, it had seized large stretches of territory in Iraq and Syria, creating a rogue state the size of Britain."
2743,"Now, the last of that territory — a sliver of land along the Euphrates River in southeastern Syria — has been retaken. Thousands of fighters remain in the region, but they have gone underground, carrying out quick strikes in the region and continuing to promote their ideology worldwide."
2744,Here are some of the major moments in the group’s evolution: 
2745,"The Islamic State traces its roots to Al Qaeda in Iraq, an offshoot of the terrorist group that attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. The Iraqi affiliate started an insurgency that pushed Iraq to the brink of civil war in 2006 and 2007, before it suffered defeat at the hands of American troops and local militias. "
2746,"By 2013, remnants of the Qaeda affiliate had rebranded themselves the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and had identified opportunities in Syria, which was in the third year of its civil war. The Islamic State leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, was the architect of the group’s push to seize territory and declare its own state. "
2747,"In Syria, the group exploited the power vacuum created when rebels wrested large parts of the country’s north and east from the government of President Bashar al-Assad. The Islamic State pushed out moderate rebels, easily seizing strategic territory. "
2748,"The group pushed into the northeastern Syrian city of Raqqa that year and consolidated control by January 2014, making the city its capital. "
2749,"Even then, many in the Western world had not heard of the group. That would not last long. "
2750,"In the spring and summer of 2014, the Islamic State rampaged across eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq, seizing city after city, including Mosul, Iraq’s second largest. The Islamic State officially declared its “caliphate” in June of that year and urged foreign fighters to come to the region to take up arms. "
2751,"Days later, Mr. al-Baghdadi, who had not been seen in public for years, delivered remarks in the Great Mosque of Mosul, reaffirming himself as the leader, or caliph, of the self-declared state. "
2752,"As the Islamic State grew, it lured recruits to the region for its jihad and attracted supporters who carried out attacks worldwide. At the height of its power, the Islamic State had an estimated 40,000 recruits from 100 countries. "
2753,"The group’s propaganda reach grew with its territorial ambitions. In 2014, it began publishing a slick online magazine, Dabiq, to bolster support for its ideology and activities. "
2754,"The world watched in horror as the Islamic State released a stream of videos showing the killings of international journalists and aid workers seized in Syria. It began in August 2014 with footage of the beheading of James Foley, an American journalist who had been held by the group for two years. The clips appeared to be a response to the start of American airstrikes against the group. "
2755,"The executions were a small fraction of the atrocities the Islamic State carried out. Violence against local residents was widespread and systematic. Photos and videos of gruesome crucifixions, mass beheadings and stonings regularly surfaced online at the height of the group’s power. "
2756,"The Islamic State also targeted minority religious groups, including the Yazidi, taking thousands captive and making sex slaves of women and girls. "
2757,"Rampaging across Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State destroyed churches, shrines and sites, including the ancient Roman city of Palmyra. It looted areas for profit and defaced others for fame as part of a campaign targeting places of religious and historical value. "
2758,"In late 2014, the Islamic State destroyed St. Elijah’s Monastery in Mosul, considered Iraq’s oldest Christian site. The group posted videos and photographs of the destruction of Palmyra in 2015, and of the beheading of a scholar who had worked to preserve the Unesco heritage site. "
2759,"The extremists shared clips of fighters shooting at and bulldozing Hatra and Nimrud, ancient sites in northern Iraq, that same year. "
2760,The Islamic State extended its reach into Europe with a series of terrorist attacks in 2015 and 2016. 
2761,"While most of the group’s attacks still occurred in Syria, Iraq and neighboring nations, the violence in Europe demonstrated the Islamic State’s ability to reach Western targets. Some were directed by the group, though most were simply inspired by its ideology. The expansion of the group wasn’t just a geographic one but a tactical one that allowed ISIS to extend its reach at little cost or risk to the group. "
2762,"and A hostage-taking at a kosher supermarket in a Paris suburb in 2015 was linked to the group. In November 2015, coordinated attacks on a nightclub and several cafes in Paris that killed 130 people were traced to the group. Months later, attacks on the airport and subway system in Brussels that killed dozens were attributed to the Islamic State."
2763,"Dozens of later attacks — on a Christmas market in Berlin; a Bastille Day celebration in Nice, France; an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England; two locations in London within three months; the Istanbul airport; a nightclub in Orlando, Fla.; and a San Bernardino, Calif., office building, among others — were inspired by the group, even as it began losing territory at home. "
2764,"Beginning in 2016, the Islamic State lost ground nearly as quickly as it had captured it. "
2765,"In Iraq, security forces backed by the United States, and elsewhere Iranian-backed Shiite militias, ousted the group, retaking Mosul in mid-2017 and officially declaring the group defeated in the country by the end of the year."
2766,"American-backed, Kurdish-led forces regained territory in Syria, including  Raqqa in October 2017. Along Syria’s eastern border, forces backed by the Assad government and Russia also took back territory. But many of the cities once held by the Islamic State are shells of their former selves. In Raqqa, two-thirds of the city was destroyed in the coalition fight against the group. In Mosul, centuries-old mosques and markets were reduced to rubble. "
2767,"But even as territory has been wrested from the Islamic State, the group has continued to spread its ideology online and encouraged supporters to carry out attacks worldwide. While the state it once declared has largely disappeared, it remains a significant threat, experts say. "

2771,"In the 1920s, Katheryn Pettygrew, a New Yorker with a Southern pedigree, bought an abandoned mill 10 miles east of Greensboro and used salvaged lumber and bits of the original machinery to convert it into a private retreat. After she made it over, the property became known as the Katydid Mill, but she described it as “Grand Central Station” in a 1939 article published in the Indianapolis Star, because of the number of people who dropped by to ogle. The house was also featured in a 1940 issue of American Home Magazine. It is about 25 minutes from Winston-Salem, N.C., 35 minutes from Durham and one hour from Raleigh."
2772,"Size: 3,700 square feet"

Arched doorways lead to the living and dining rooms, each richly paneled, with a bay window and a working limestone fireplace."
2788,The ornate plaster living room ceiling was cast from the London home of the antiques dealer Charles Duveen and painted to create the look of staining from leaky garrets.

2804,"On a trip to Costco about four years ago, Jailine Peña López, now 18, asked her mother to buy her a little white table and a little red chair."
2805,"The set was made for children, but it meant a lot to Ms. López, who until then had done her homework on the bed, the bus or the subway. As she and her mother moved from place to place in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, she cherished the miniature furniture because it gave her a space all her own."
2806,"“The table and the chair became a motivation for me to keep going and keep doing my homework and pursue my dream of higher education,” she said."
2807,Her drive paid off. Ms. López is a star student at the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics and has participated in extracurricular activities like the Model United Nations.
2808,"And she is one of 10 students chosen this year for The New York Times College Scholarship Program, which means she will get up to $15,000 in financial assistance for every year of college, as well as mentoring and internship opportunities with The New York Times Company."
2809,"The scholarship, which is financed by reader donations and an endowment fund, has helped hundreds of students afford tuition at top-tier universities."
2810,"This year’s winners shared their experiences with homelessness, poverty and abuse. They described family members’ struggles with mental illness and addiction. They recalled traumatic experiences that, ultimately, motivated them to fight for change."
2811,"“I just want to stop the cycle, because it’s just too much pain,” said Davina Scott, 19, who witnessed devastating violence growing up in Jamaica and systemic injustice in Queens, where she lives now. She has been accepted to Howard University and wants to study political science and criminal justice."
2812,"Anchal Malh, 17, was evicted from her home in Queens on the night before her 12th birthday. Despite a period of homelessness, she excelled in school. This year, she will become the first woman in her family to attend college. For girls in future generations, she said, “it’s my responsibility to make sure that they have a woman in the family to look up to.”"
2813,"Melanie Earle, 17, was involved in a car crash four years ago, leaving her with post-traumatic stress that she struggled to talk about for a long time. She hopes to use her scholarship to pursue mechanical engineering, humanitarian studies and maybe a language or two."
2814,"Jaylen Campbell, 17, earned top grades in middle school but was frustrated when his efforts did not improve life for his family in Brooklyn. So he collected bottles and cans on the street to recycle for a nickel apiece. Now he feels the academic work is paying off. Another scholarship has taken him to China, and in college, he wants to study engineering and use it to improve people’s lives."
2815,"Nefertari Elshiekh, 18, worked several jobs to support her family and still became an honor student. She was so grateful for the education she received that she is determined to become an elementary schoolteacher — and to fight for fair educational policies."
2816,"Hanah Jun, 17, watched her mother struggle with mental illness while she and her grandmother did their best to stay afloat in Queens. But Ms. Jun also excelled as a volleyball player and musician, participated in student government and held part-time jobs. She is passionate about the environment and open-minded about her career. “I just want to help people,” she said. “I think that through everything, I’ve developed a very strong sense of empathy.”"
2817,"Ms. Jun and several other scholarship winners described their favorite young adult novels or comic books with infectious enthusiasm, explaining that they found role models in fiction when they could not find them in real life.

2818,"Salma Elsayed, 17, a model student who taught English to girls in Egypt in 2017, was struck by news reports of teachers going on strike across the United States. “The issue of education in this country is constantly something I think about, and the disparities that students face,” she said."
2819,"Derek Rodriguez, 17, said news reports about children being separated from their parents at the United States border with Mexico struck a raw nerve. He could relate. His stepfather was taken away by immigration agents who stormed his home when he was 5. “That was the point when I had to grow up,” he said."
2820,"Mr. Rodriguez wants to become an international businessman and see the world. Ms. Elsayed, inspired by activists in her own community, is considering running for office."
2821,"Runnie Exuma, 17, has creative ideas about what she might like to study in college — something that combines technology, humanities and the arts. And as an activist, she has already worked for racial justice and immigrants’ rights. “Any activist work I do is connected in a way,” she said. “It’s a struggle that we’re all fighting for.”"
2822,"These students know a scholarship will not make their problems disappear. When Ms. Jun learned in late February that she was a winner, she was in the parking lot of a funeral home, mourning her mother’s death. Ms. Scott said that her half sister, Latrar Scott, 25, went missing more than a year ago and still had not been found. And while Mr. Campbell’s achievements have earned him travel opportunities and academic accolades, he still collects bottles from time to time to raise extra money for his family."
2823,"“I still want to help with groceries,” he said."
2824,"The students are following in the footsteps of nearly 300 others who entered The New York Times College Scholarship Program before them, like Dextina Booker, 25, who was a member of the 2011 cohort."
2825,"Ms. Booker earned her bachelor’s degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is pursuing a master’s in integrated design and management. Ultimately, she plans to go into academia."
2826,"During her undergraduate years, she learned to appreciate everything she has overcome — not only because the difficulties made her stronger, but also because they gave her a useful perspective. “A lot of the ideas that I come up with stem from my background, from the people I know and the things they need,” she said."
2827,Ms. Booker added that the scholarship’s mentorship opportunities made her feel less alone among college classmates who had grown up in relative privilege.
2828,"“Having someone there who understands even the basic things about you — you feel seen,” she said. “It feels like you’re not alone.”"
2829,"As glass condominium towers continue to push their way into city skylines like sunflowers squeezing up through walled gardens, some homeowners and developers have come to a realization: Floor-to-ceiling glass may provide breathtaking views, but it cuts down on opportunities for displaying art. And because art collectors represent a significant portion of the small pool of people who can afford homes in such buildings, that can be a problem."
2830,"“The trajectory of wealth is very basic,” said Leonard Steinberg, a New York broker with the creative job title of chief evangelist at the real estate company Compass. “It starts with going out to expensive restaurants and ordering fancy wine and impressing your guests,” he said, before moving on to luxury cars, homes and investments. “Then what do you do to get status? You buy art.”"
2831,"To cater to wealthy people amassing Warhols and Murakamis, a number of developers are designing condo towers specifically with art display in mind. At 100 East 53rd Street in Midtown Manhattan, for instance, where apartments start at $2.45 million and run past $9 million, the development company RFR commissioned the architecture firm Foster & Partners to design some units with the vibe, and wall space, of a downtown gallery."
2832,"“I would love to be recognized as a developer who creates spaces that are really geared for an art collector,” said Aby Rosen, a co-founder and principal of RFR and a prominent art collector himself. “I’m a big advocate. Art does something to you. It connects you with history. It connects you with the desire for culture.”"
2833,"On a recent tour of the loft-style units, Mr. Steinberg, whose company is handling sales and marketing for the building, pointed to the uninterrupted expanses of concrete walls and also to the polished concrete floors. “It’s the kind that you may see when you go to a Gagosian Gallery or Paul Kasmin gallery,” he said."
2834,The ceilings are finished with fluted concrete panels separated by slots that allow lighting to be installed and arranged to illuminate particular works. The exterior glass filters ultraviolet rays to help protect precious pieces.
2835,"“These spaces have contemporary high-rise benefits, but all the attributes of a downtown loft — without the creaking floors and subway rumble,” Mr. Steinberg said."
2836,"To hammer that point home, one of the model units is staged as a gallery rather than a home, with a trove of contemporary works from Mr. Rosen’s collections, including large-scale canvases by Damien Hirst, Andy Warhol and Jonas Wood, and sculptures by John Chamberlain,  Urs Fischer and Jorge Pardo. The building’s focus on art extends to the lobby, too, where residents are greeted by a site-specific work by Rachel Feinstein that depicts New York City icons, including the Empire State Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, commissioned specifically for the building."
2837,"This art-friendly attitude has attracted buyers like Ingrid Cincala Gilbert, principal of the art consulting firm Cincala Art, who bought one of the building’s more conventional units, with white-oak floors and drywall."
2838,"“The vision that Aby Rosen had for making art an important character in the story of the building was really compelling to me,” Ms. Cincala Gilbert said, noting that many of her clients had art display in mind when buying real estate."
2839,"“More and more these days my clients are interested in living with their art, as opposed to having to store it,” she said. “The trouble is sometimes this can be at odds with contemporary architecture, with the emphasis on transparency and expansive areas of exterior glass, and also open floor plans. Sometimes, this can really restrict or remove altogether opportunities for art.”"
2840,"That may help explain why floor plans for apartments at 160 Leroy Street, which the developer Ian Schrager conceived with the architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, and which are priced from $4.5 million to $50 million, are labeled with room types and also with wall locations where works might be displayed."
2841,"“We thought it would just be an interesting thing, as an assist, to let prospective buyers know where would be great places to hang art,” Mr. Schrager said. “We thought that collecting art would be something that a lot of our buyers would be focused on.”"
2842,"At 180 East 88th Street, where apartments start at $1.295 million and run past $6 million, the development company DDG is building a 50-story masonry skyscraper with punched windows, which leaves more wall space for art than a building with a glass curtain wall. Units are equipped with picture rails that allow buyers to install art on chains."
2843,"“You see museums such as the Met hang art that way,” said Joseph A. McMillan Jr., the chairman and chief executive of DDG. “We have heard buyers say that there’s nowhere to put their art” in glass towers, he noted. “So this really does help serve that.”"
2844,"David Mann, the founder of MR Architecture & Décor, said that creating places to display art was also a priority when his firm designed the condos in a new glass tower at 111 Murray Street, where units are priced from $2.5 million to $40 million."
2845,"His firm sought to create wide expanses of interior walls that are not interrupted by doors, he said, so that “there are larger planes that can hold a bigger piece.”"
2846,"Rather than buy a preconfigured apartment to show off an art collection, many collectors go the custom route and work one-on-one with an architect or interior designer to address their specific needs."
2847,"For one collector in Midtown Manhattan, Mr. Mann’s firm recently renovated an apartment where plump sofas by Mario Bellini now float in the middle of the living room. The liberated wall space is devoted to works by Bruce Nauman, Deborah Kass and Donald Judd. In the study, low, wall-mounted bookcases also free up display area."
2848,"Some projects, Mr. Mann said, are in complete thrall to a collection. “We have clients who have important works where we have actually started the project by isolating where they will go,” he said, “and then building the rooms around them.”"
2849,"For one such collector, Mr. Mann designed a wall with ideal proportions to display a Minimalist masterwork by a renowned artist (he declined to disclose the artist’s name to protect his client’s privacy). Mr. Mann added recessed lighting in the ceiling above, arranged the furniture to funnel views toward the artwork and spent days experimenting with wall paint to find the most complementary shade of white."
2850,"All other design decisions were secondary, he said. The art was “the most important thing.”"

2852,"ALBANY — When state leaders rallied this month behind a proposal to tax luxury second homes in New York City, it seemed to encapsulate the goals of the Capitol’s new Democratic leadership: The bill would simultaneously help pay for public transit, vex real estate developers and target the überwealthy."
2853,"The sudden momentum for the tax surprised even supporters of the proposal, which for years failed to gain traction. But it was especially unexpected to the real estate industry, which had not been consulted on the idea, had not expected it to go anywhere, and had not mobilized against it."
2854,The industry wasted little time.
2855,"Developers hired well-connected lobbyists and presented legislators with printouts of economic analyses. They wrote opinion pieces and warned that the high-end market, already weakened, would collapse under the weight of a recurring surcharge."
2856,"By Friday, the proposal was dead. In its place, lawmakers were discussing a one-time fee on all real estate transactions over $3 million, although that threshold was still fluid."
2857,"Legislative leaders said the replacement proposal would achieve the same ends of making the wealthy contribute more to the city’s upkeep. But the abrupt rise and fall of the so-called pied-à-terre tax also illustrated the challenges in translating progressive rhetoric into policy, and the continuing influence of the traditional powers in Albany."
2858,"“I don’t think there’s a question that real estate has driven politics, really, forever,” said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, one of the bill’s sponsors. “So it’s not a shock.”"
2859,"The purchase of a $238 million apartment on Central Park South by Kenneth C. Griffin, a Chicago-based hedge fund billionaire with an estimated net worth of $10 billion, had lent the pied-à-terre tax political viability. But logistical concerns soon emerged, as regulators would have had to determine whether someone was using a home as a primary or secondary residence."
2860,"The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, said a transfer tax at the time of sale would be easier to administer."
2861,"“People could play games as to whether it’s their primary” residence or not, Mr. Heastie said, adding that a transfer tax afforded the “ease of the transaction.”"
2862,"He added that the revenue generated, which would go to the city’s subway system, would be “roughly the same.”"
2863,"But there is disagreement on just how much revenue that would be. Mr. Heastie estimated that the new tax could bring in between $300 million and $400 million, equivalent to the $370 million that the Real Estate Board of New York (Rebny), an industry group, projected that the pied-à-terre tax would have brought in. But the New York City comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, had predicted that a pied-à-terre tax would bring in a minimum of $650 million annually."
2864,"Senator Brad Hoylman, a sponsor of the original bill, suggested on Friday that the real estate industry’s narrative had won out."
2865,"“We know that the real estate industry was very present over the last couple of weeks,” he said. “I think they did a number on the pied-à-terre.”"
2866,The industry’s mobilization was noticeable.
2867,"William L. Zeckendorf, of the firm Zeckendorf Development, wrote in Crain’s that the proposal would hurt the economy. Last week, Mr. Zeckendorf walked the halls of the Capitol alongside a hired lobbyist, Patrick B. Jenkins, and an economist from Rebny. Mr. Jenkins is a close friend of Mr. Heastie, the Assembly speaker; the two were college roommates."
2868,"Public lobbying disclosures show that Mr. Zeckendorf’s company hired Mr. Jenkins’s firm for just two weeks, from March 15 to April 1, for $5,000."
2869,"A who’s who of real estate also made personal overtures to lawmakers, with six developers calling Mr. Hoylman over the past two weeks."
2870,"When they met with individual lawmakers, industry members handed out printouts showing that the pied-à-terre tax would capture far less revenue than Mr. Stringer had predicted."
2871,"On March 13, the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group, called the tax “appealing but problematic.” The commission’s board of trustees includes several Rebny members. By Tuesday, Assembly counsels were telling rank-and-file members that the pied-à-terre tax was likely unconstitutional."
2872,"Ms. Glick said she had realized by Thursday that the bill was dead; that same day, real estate industry insiders were referring to the push for the tax in the past tense."
2873,"[The $238 million penthouse, and the hedge fund billionaire who may rarely live there.]"
2874,"“The recurring pied-à-terre tax proposal lost momentum after people began to understand that it would reap far less than initially estimated and that the city had no ability to implement the tax,” Rebny’s president, John H. Banks, said in a statement. “Most importantly, people realized that a recurring pied-à-terre tax would have a devastating impact on New York City’s economy.”"
2875,"Mr. Hoylman offered a different assessment: “They basically went to the playbook of how to kill a bill and flipped through every page,” he said, adding that he had not yet seen any replacement bill language."
2876,"“You do wonder who is writing it,” he added."
2877,"Legislative leaders emphasized that they were not backing off from taxing the wealthy, a fact that did appease supporters of the pied-à-terre tax. But they remained disappointed at the apparent ease with which the real estate industry was able to steer the conversation from one policy to another, demonstrating its outsize influence in Albany, even with Democrats in control."
2878,"Michael Kink, the executive director of the Strong Economy for All coalition, a group of unions and community organizations, said a pied-à-terre tax “zeros in on the global ultrarich,” while a transfer tax on expensive properties could also affect families in gentrifying areas of Brooklyn or Queens looking to sell their longtime homes."
2879,"“If I had my druthers, it would be to do the pied-à-terre tax because it does target nonresidents,” said Ron Deutsch, the executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed think tank."
2880,"But others said the argument for a pied-à-terre tax over a transfer tax, for the sake of political optics, proved that the latter was a better idea."
2881,"“I’m not sure what the goal of the pied-à-terre was except to say, we don’t like people coming into the city and having a house they don’t stay in all the time,” said Martha Stark, the city’s former finance commissioner."
2882,"“I know it has a little bit of appeal in that it’s taxing people who are überrich,” she said. “I just don’t see this as being a feasible and implementable tax in terms of how it was structured.”"
2883,"Still, Mr. Hoylman said he would claim an increased transfer tax as a victory."
2884,"“This would never have happened last year,” when the Senate was controlled by Republicans, he said."
2885,"Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said the death of the pied-à-terre tax showed political rhetoric meeting reality."
2886,"“As much as the political winds are blowing against landlords, real estate is still a very important industry in New York,” she said."
2887,"If Dave Attell ever retires, as he has periodically hinted for years, what will become of club comedy?"
2888,"Comics will still work clubs, of course. But in an era when the savvy career move is to diversify into podcasts and video while playing a variety of rooms, Attell, 54, is the rare elite stand-up who advertises himself, with a mixture of pride and self-deprecation, as simply a club comic. More important: No one alive makes a better argument for the aesthetic of New York club comedy, with its tussling crowd work, quick setups and ruthless punch lines that go for the gut."
2889,"For 32 years, he has performed nearly every night of the week, making him a longer-running fixture in this city than “The Phantom of the Opera,” and one that has aged better, although you might not know it at first glance."
2890,"On a cold weeknight this month at the Comedy Cellar, where he often appears on the late show, he walked onstage looking rumpled, sporting a baggy winter coat and a headwear situation that resembled a Russian nesting doll: After removing a hoodie that covered his customary black baseball cap, which he took off to reveal yet another hat, he began his set with a knowing quip: “I look like I just came here to get warm.”"
2891,"Attell has been describing himself like this for decades. “I have a gym in my building,” he said in his 1996 HBO half-hour. “Does anyone else live in the Y?”"
2892,"Attell actually has had a successful showbiz career, which includes host of cult shows on Comedy Central (“Insomniac”) and Showtime (“Dave’s Old Porn”), along with brief stints on “The Daily Show” and “Saturday Night Live.” But he’s more revered by peers than the public. He has never put out specials as frequently as he could have. His easygoing double act, “Bumping Mics” with Jeff Ross, which debuted last fall on Netflix, was his first release since 2014."
2893,"What Attell does best doesn’t lead to fame and fortune these days. It’s not just that he’s an old-school performer in a media landscape biased toward novelty and provocation. Making noise in the crowded comedy scene today means going personal, political or controversial. Attell generally avoids all three. You can watch him for hours and learn next to nothing about his life or his deepest convictions outside an abiding faith in punchy jokes."
2894,"He has one of the quickest minds in comedy, and gently insulting audiences is critical to his act, adding tension, unpredictability and a change of pace. At a terrific 90-minute or so show in December at Caroline’s, where I sat in the front row, he treated me like a speed bag, jabbing me with punch lines about my glasses (“Isaac Asimov’s grandson”), posture (“Stephen Hawking’s stunt double”) and snack-food preference. When I said rice cracker, he responded, “What’s your favorite porn — homework?”"
2895,"At his core, Attell is a high-octane, no-frills joke machine, a delivery system for punch lines, some improvised, but a vast majority rigorously honed. With a compulsive work ethic, he tests the same jokes for years, tweaking words repeatedly to find the funniest sound. He doesn’t add many act-outs to sell a line or weave bits into a story to build comic momentum. If you transcribe his jokes and read them aloud flatly, they remain funny."
2896,"His comedy doesn’t carry a message, but it does have a specific mood and texture that has shifted over the years. He built his reputation on a dirty and dissolute image, focusing on sex toys, drinking and ornate literary descriptions of testicles. (My favorite might be when he compared them to a “tent no one knows how to fold up.”)"
2897,"If you listen closely to his 2014 Comedy Central special, “Road Work,” you can hear the roots of some of the button-pushing humor of Louis C.K., albeit in quicker form. “Ever do a bunch of mushrooms, think you’re having a pillow fight, but it turns out to be a live baby,” goes one joke."
2898,"Attell isn’t as raunchy as he once was. As he has gotten older, he has added more jokes about food and pets. He will still predict how a night might end for audience members based on what they’re drinking, but now that he’s sober, there aren’t as many punch lines about Jägermeister."
2899,"He has his off nights, and his crowd work can be tentative. (Jeff Ross is a good match, prodding him to take more risks.) But there are moments when I see Attell perform that I think he is only now entering his prime, something this famously self-critical comic would probably disagree with."
2900,"Stick around long enough, and you acquire a certain gravitas, no matter how ragged and unpretentious you may be. Attell is far too wedded to the economical structure of hard jokes to veer off into the poetic flourishes of Dave Chappelle, and he seems to have little interest in waging culture wars."
2901,"But see him perform enough, and a theme emerges: close attention paid to the lonely and overlooked figures of our society, particularly in an unforgiving city. He has a wonderful bit imagining the guy who sells fruit on Sixth Avenue at 4 a.m. and another extended metaphor in which he pictures himself carrying a lantern through a thick fog, saying “fog things” like “Friend or foe?”"
2902,"His material has the landscape of a Tom Waits song, crusty and cynical, inspiring bleak laughter that sounds as if it might turn into a cough at any moment. Attell has built a comic world that perfectly fits the character he has long played onstage, one with a past he can plumb for a few extra laughs."
2903,"Around midnight at the Comedy Cellar another night this month, Attell invited his audience to imagine the loneliness of a worker making Subway sandwiches in an empty restaurant. After setting the scene more economically than I have, with him waiting for his food, he describes watching this employee and deciding to make “his smallest dream come true.”"
2904,"With a conspiratorial glance to one side, he said, “Take the gloves off.” Then he hit the audience with two more punch lines, instructing this sad sack to live his best life. “Raw dog it. Put the mayonnaise wherever you want.”"
2905,"Like New York itself, Dave Attell is not as dirty as he used to be, but he can still make a joke about cold cuts sound deliriously filthy."
2906,"Jordan Peele’s new horror movie, “Us,” is an expansive philosophical hall of mirrors. Like his 2017 hit, “Get Out,” this daring fun-until-it’s-not shocker starts from the genre’s central premise that everyday life is a wellspring of terrors. In “Get Out,” a young black man meets a group of white people who buy — at auction — younger, healthier black bodies. What makes “Get Out” so powerful is how Peele marshals a classic tale of unwilling bodily possession into a resonant, unsettling metaphor for the sweep of black and white relations in the United States — the U.S., or us."
2907,"“Us” is more ambitious than “Get Out,” and in some ways more unsettling. Once again, Peele is exploring existential terrors and the theme of possession, this time through the eerie form of the monstrous doppelgänger. The figure of the troublesome other — of Jekyll and Hyde, of the conscious and unconscious — ripples through the story of an ordinary family, the Wilsons, stalked by murderous doubles. These shadows look like the Wilsons but are frighteningly different, with fixed stares and guttural, animalistic vocalizations. Dressed in matching red coveralls and wielding large scissors (the better to slice and dice), they are funhouse-mirror visions turned nightmares."
2908,"The evil twin is a rich, durable motif, and it winds through “Us” from start to finish, beginning with a flashback to 1986 at a Santa Cruz, Calif., amusement park. There, a young girl (the expressive Madison Curry) and her parents are leisurely wandering the park. The girl is itsy-bitsy (the camera sticks close to her so that everything looms), and she and her parents maintain a chilly, near-geometric distance from one another. She’s clutching a perfect candied apple, a portentous splash of red and a witty emblem both of Halloween and Edenic forbidden fruit. Movies are journeys into knowledge, and what the girl knows is part of the simmering mystery."
2909,"The Wilsons, a family of four headed by Adelaide (a dazzling Lupita Nyong’o) and Gabe (Winston Duke), enter many years later, introduced with an aerial sweep of greenery. The bird’s-eye view (or god’s-eye, given the movie’s metaphysical reach) evokes the opener of Stanley Kubrick’s “The Shining,” a film Peele references throughout. A true cinephile, Peele scatters “Us” with nods and allusions to old-school 1970s and ’80s movies including “Goonies,” “Jaws,” “A Nightmare on Elm Street.” (One disturbing scene suggests that he’s also a fan of Michael Haneke.) But “The Shining” — another story of a grotesquely haunted family — serves as his most obvious guiding star, narratively and visually."
2910,[Read about Lupita Nyong’o and her work on the movie.]
2911,"Peele likes to mix tones and moods, and as he did in “Get Out,” he uses broad humor both for delay and deflection. There’s a cryptic opener and an equally enigmatic credit sequence, but soon the Wilsons are laughing at their vacation home. It’s a breather that Peele uses for light jokes and intimacy (Duke’s amiable performance provides levity and warmth) while he scatters narrative bread crumbs. There’s a beach trip with another family, this one headed by Kitty (a fantastic Elisabeth Moss) and Josh (Tim Heidecker), who have teenage twin girls (cue “The Shining”). At last, the movie jumps to kinetic life with the appearance of the Wilsons’ doubles, who descend in a brutal home invasion."
2912,"The assault is a master class of precision-timed scares filled with light shivers and deeper, reverberant frights. Working within the house’s tight, angled spaces — soon filled with fluid camerawork and bodies moving to dramatically different beats — Peele turns this domestic space into a double of the funhouse that loomed in the amusement park. After much scrambling and shrieking, the Wilsons and their weird twins face off in the living room, mirroring one another. Adelaide’s shadow, Red (the actors play their doubles), takes charge and splits up the Wilsons, ordering her husband, daughter and son to take charge of their terrified others while she remains with Adelaide."
2913,[Read Jason Zinoman’s essay on why this is the golden age of grown-up horror.]
2914,"A vibrant, appealing screen presence, Nyong’o brings a tremendous range and depth of feeling to both characters, who she individualizes with such clarity and lapidary detail that they aren’t just distinct beings; they feel as if they were being inhabited by different actors. She gives each a specific walk and sharply opposite gestures and voices (maternally silky vs. monstrously raspy). Adelaide, who studied ballet, moves gracefully and, when need be, rapidly (she racks up miles); Red moves as if keeping time to a metronome, with the staccato, mechanical step and head turns of an automaton. Both have ramrod posture and large unblinking eyes. Red’s mouth is a monstrous abyss."
2915,"The confrontation between Adelaide and Red testifies to Peele’s strength with actors — here, he makes the most of Nyong’o’s dueling turns — but, once Red starts explaining things, it also telegraphs the story’s weakness. “Us” is Peele’s second movie, but as his ideas pile up — and the doubles and their terrors expand — it starts to feel like his second and third combined. One of the pleasures of “Get Out” was its conceptual and narrative elegance, a streamlining that makes it feel shorter than its one hour 44 minutes. “Us” runs a little longer, but its surfeit of stuff — its cinephilia, bunnies of doom, sharp political detours and less-successful mythmaking — can make it feel unproductively cluttered."
2916,"Peele’s boldest, most exciting and shaky conceptual move in “Us” is to yoke the American present with the past, first by invoking the 1986 super-event Hands Across America. A very ’80s charity drive (one of its organizers helped create the ’85 benefit hit “We Are the World”), it had Americans holding hands from coast to coast, making a human chain meant to fight hunger and homelessness. President Reagan held hands in front of the White House even while his administration was criticized for cutting billions for programs to help the homeless."
2917,"In “Us,” the appearance of unity — in a nation, in a person — doesn’t last long before being ripped away like one of the movie’s masks. Peele piles on (and tears off) the masks and the metaphors, tethers the past to the present and draws a line between the Reagan and Trump presidencies, suggesting that we were, and remain, one nation profoundly divisible. He also busies up his story with too many details, explanations and cutaways. Peele’s problem isn’t that he’s ambitious; he is, blissfully. But he also feels like an artist who has been waiting a very long time to say a great deal, and here he steps on, and muddles, his material, including in a fight that dilutes even Nyong’o’s best efforts."
2918,"Early on, Peele drops in some text about the existence of abandoned tunnels, mines and subways in the United States. I flashed on Colson Whitehead’s novel “The Underground Railroad,” which literalizes the network of safe houses and routes used by enslaved black Americans, turning it into a fantastical subterranean passageway to freedom. In “Us,” Peele uses the metaphor of the divided self to explore what lies beneath contemporary America, its double consciousness, its identity, sins and terrors. The results are messy, brilliant, sobering, even bleak — the final scene is a gut punch delivered with a queasy smile — but Jordan Peele isn’t here just to play."
2919,MIDNIGHT IN CHERNOBYL The Untold Story of the World’s Greatest Nuclear Disaster By Adam Higginbotham
2920, MANUAL FOR SURVIVAL A Chernobyl Guide to the Future By Kate Brown
2921,"Catastrophes happen when a large system gets so out of sync with its environment that a tiny tweak can crash it to the ground. It’s happened to oil rigs, spacecraft and mines. Afterward, committees blame the people who did the tweaking. But what matters is how the system became unstable and crashed, the atmosphere that caused it and the aftereffects. In these two books about the April 1986 explosion of the No. 4 reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, “Midnight in Chernobyl” focuses on the first and second, “Manual for Survival” on the third."
2922,Electricity is easy to create in small amounts. A hamster on an exercise wheel can make a little light bulb flicker. A generator and some gas powers a house. But the vast quantities of energy demanded by modern cities require huge steam turbines that operate 24 hours a day. One way to heat the water to create the steam is to burn fossil fuels. Another is using heat created by nuclear fission.
2923,"The Soviets, who built the first nuclear power plant in 1954, considered themselves the finest reactor engineers in the world, and masters of gigantic engineering projects. Their rapidly expanding infrastructure desperately needed electrical power, especially in the Soviet Union’s industrialized western region, far away from Siberia’s fossil fuel deposits. Planners thus decided to build colossal reactors. These included a set of four at Chernobyl, about 100 miles north of Kiev, intended to be “the greatest nuclear power station on earth.” Its No. 1 reactor was completed in 1977, No. 4 in 1983."
2924,"Adam Higginbotham’s “Midnight in Chernobyl” is a gripping, miss-your-subway-stop read. The details of the disaster pile up inexorably. They include worn control rod switches, the 2,000-ton reactor lid nicknamed Elena, a core so huge that understanding its behavior was impossible. Politicians lacked the technical knowledge to take action, while scientists who had the knowledge feared to provide it lest they lose their jobs or lives."
2925,"Higginbotham captures the nerve-racked Soviet atmosphere brilliantly, mostly through vivid details about the participants. Schedules were impossible, production quotas demanding, workers sloppy, budgets insufficient, rules disregarded. Warnings that the design was unsound were ignored. While the 1979 accident at Three Mile Island prompted American engineers to re-examine reactor designs, the Soviets did not bother. In 1957, one Soviet reactor had a radioactive contamination accident, as did Chernobyl No. 1 in 1982. These and other accidents were covered up. A design fix was planned, but implementation at No. 4 was postponed until its first safety test in April 1986."
2926,"Higginbotham, who has written for such publications as The New Yorker and The New York Times Magazine, follows the postponed safety test minute by minute. A neglected step caused the reactor’s power to plunge, and frantic attempts to revive it created an unexpected power surge. Poorly trained operators panicked. An explosion of hydrogen and oxygen sent Elena into the air “like a flipped coin” and destroyed the reactor. Operators vainly tried to stop a meltdown by planning to shove control rods in by hand. Escaping radiation shot a pillar of blue-white phosphorescent light into the air."
2927,"The explosion occurs less than 100 pages into this 366-page book (plus more than 100 pages of notes, glossary, cast of characters and explanation of radiation units). But what follows is equally gripping. Radio-controlled repair bulldozers became stuck in the rubble. Exposure to radiation made voices grow high and squeaky. A dying man whispered to his nurse to step back because he was too radioactive. A workman’s radioactive shoe was the first sign in Sweden of a nuclear accident 1,000 miles upwind. Soviet bigwigs entered the area with high-tech dosimeters they didn’t know how to turn on. Investigations blamed the accident on six tweakers, portrayed them as “hooligans” and convicted them. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (Unscear), which is to radiation studies something like what the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (I.P.C.C.) is to assessing human-induced climate effects, struggled to make sense of changing and confusing information."
2928,"Kate Brown’s “Manual for Survival” has a different style and emphasis. Its aim is to be an exposé of the attempts to minimize the impact of Chernobyl. The disaster was less an accident, says Brown, a historian at M.I.T., than “an exclamation point in a chain of toxic exposures that restructured the landscape, bodies and politics.” Unscear’s publications were cover-ups, and radiation-related maladies are “a dark horseman riding wild across the Chernobyl territories.” Brown undertook the book so as not to become “one of those duped comrades who found out too late that the survival manual contained a pack of lies.”"
2929,"Around 2014, Brown began interviewing people in the affected areas, and sought measurements of radioactivity in such things as wool, livestock and swamps. Her stories are affecting, yet it is hard to evaluate memories and anecdotes. It is also hard to evaluate measurements. These are meaningful only within the tangled web of factors that radiation epidemiologists consider — including type and time-span of dose, pathways through the body, susceptibility of individual tissues and background radiation — as well as health issues like alcohol, obesity and stress."
2930,"Radioactivity is present in different amounts in everything from muscles to masonry. Higginbotham notes that the granite in the United States Capitol “is so radioactive that the building would fail federal safety codes regulating nuclear power plants.” Brown writes that permitting an annual dose of five millisieverts (a dose unit) in one Chernobyl region is “cruel” and implies that its inhabitants should be relocated. Yet that’s less than the background radiation in many populated areas. According to a recent study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, the average annual radiation dose in the United States (including medical diagnostics) is 6.2 mSv, while many studies put the annual dose in Denver at over 10 mSv, with no noticeable increase in cancer rates. Brown plays down reports of relocation’s psychological and social effects. Immigrants and refugees may have a different perspective."
2931,"One wonders about Brown’s suggestions of conspiracies. She writes darkly that “the medical section of the U.S. Army report on physical damage in Hiroshima is missing in the U.S. National Archives.” Given that so much data is now available online, isn’t it possible this is due to incompetence or sloppiness? Are Unscear’s sometimes flawed publications cover-ups, or do they indicate the difficulties of incorporating changing data of varying degrees of reliability into the best available models? Brown endorses the work of antinuclear activists like Ernest Sternglass, many of whose claims that radiation causes everything from high infant mortality and crime rates to low SAT scores have been discredited. Brown is credulous of sources that share her opinions, skeptical of those that don’t. This gives the book the flavor of a polemic. Not all accusers of the scientific infrastructure are holy. Their claims need to be evaluated with the same diligence that scientists do theirs."
2932,"Neither book is about nuclear power. The Chernobyl story is indeed as little about nuclear power as the Bhopal catastrophe is about the pesticide industry. Yet the issue looms, for the fossil fuel alternative has disastrous long-term effects. Brown notes that the founders of Kiev built the city on a bluff to repel invaders. It’s a haunting image. Today’s threats are pollutants that cannot be stopped by bluffs, and we create these threats ourselves to drive the turbines that sustain our towns. To keep these modern invaders at bay requires separating fact from fiction, and depending on expert advice. Will we avert catastrophe by honestly judging the benefits and risks of each energy source without hiding their costs — and will politicians have the guts to act on those judgments? Not yet."
2933,"SUNDAY PUZZLE — On the one hand, the punny title for this breezy puzzle is a natural; on the other hand, it made me laugh at myself a little. First I sort of bristled, considering how the term “hysteria” targets my gender, and how aware we are becoming of so many women’s unsung contributions to math and computer programming, among other subjects. But it also made me think of that “Teen Talk” Barbie that famously said “math class is hard!”  back in the ’90s, and how that inspired the Barbie Liberation Organization. "
2934,"Besides, the theme examples from Adam Fromm today are so amusing and tight that I have thrown away my math baggage. In an era when I look to the calculator on my phone to come up with an 18 percent tip on a $50 lunch tab, I consider my personal 2019 mathematics brush-up challenge finito, simply by solving this grid."
2935,"I thought there was a lot of verve and toughness in the filler clues today. A handful of names tripped me up, like SIRI (which made me feel old! I wrote in “Jude”), NIKI, AIDAN, GIOTTO and ROSITA, who did not make her appearance on “Sesame Street” until 1991. I really loved the inclusion of SHMOO and SHOOP, and I thought that ANNI was a very sly little hat tip to the whole puzzle."
2936,"8A: It’s possible that the mention of this parkway, the TACONIC, evokes the same frisson of dread that math does among some of us — it is an early motorway, started in the 1920s, that has earned a reputation for being challenging to drive. "
2937,"46A: I had “seller” here till the near end, a perfectly logical choice, but letters two and three would not jibe with their crosses — a hairstyle and another “seller,” actually, this one of “Famous Bowls” (football competitions? kitchenware?). A fishmonger is also a SCALER — that hairstyle is a FADE (a popular choice for many of you, I’m sure) and that “Bowl” is KFC fried chicken (in a bowl, with well-known mashed potatoes, notorious corn, celebrity cheese and some paparazzi gravy on top). "
2938,"103A: Usually this scientist is clued as a winner of the Nobel Prize, or more specifically a “conditioned reflex researcher,” or my favorite from 1973, “Russian dog man.” If you are specifically referring to dog training, then I can do what PAVLOV did just by bringing home, I don’t know, a Famous Bowl every day at 3 p.m. for a week or two. My dogs found a piece of moldy cheese under a bush in my neighborhood almost two years ago and they still leave trails of drool when we walk down that street. I know, that’s a little different, but I still find it poignant that they continue to hope for more cheese. "
2939,"43D: This piece of a motor is pretty recognizable if you look at one of those blown-out parts images, but I didn’t think of the STATOR as unmoving (and the name itself didn’t come to mind, either). "
2940,"51D: Coincidentally, this exact route was on my mind this week, because at some point I was alerted to this recent photo essay, a very moody look at “The LONELIEST Road in America.” I don’t often see this part of the United States in person, but the allure of wide-open spaces is tangible when you are packed jowl to jowl on a subway car, inching through a tunnel. Or gripping your steering wheel grimly on the Taconic while S.U.V.s hurtle past you, come to think of it."
2941,"Sometimes the Sunday theme is a big secret you need to figure out before you get anywhere, like the proverbial duck the size of a horse. Sometimes it is a bunch of little duckling-size horses that you have to corral one by one, like today’s puzzle. There are seven across clues, at 22, 39, 47, 67, 86, 95 and 116, that each present a cryptic equation. Our job is to solve them, and we get no credit for showing our work."
2942,"They all rely on various mathematical operations, I guess, although 95A is really more a notation thing, I guess, if that’s what you would call a decimal. Put your pun hat on for the BB in “3.BB” and you’ll get it: THREE (3) POINT (.) SHOT (BB, as in BB gun)."
2943,"86A is algebraic, with a variable divisor — X — and four $ signs, making a CASH DIVIDEND (how much we can’t say, but it’s money)."
2944,39A is the purest form of a balanced equation — “x — y = x — y.” True — both sides are the SAME DIFFERENCE.
2945,"My favorite, which had no actual numbers, was one of the occasional puzzle tricks that I remember thinking of once in the past, probably at one of those family meetings where everyone somberly discusses what to do when the piano falls through the ceiling and we need to know how to settle all the unforeseen debts (the piano was supposed to be full of rare coins, but they were worthless, all lead slugs). It is at 116A, and if you recognize “Esq.” as the lawyerly suffix then you can see what this is POWER OF ATTORNEY — “X” raised to the power of “Esq.” — an exponential quantity of lawyers."
2946,"As long as you went to junior high school and know your West Coast newspapers and your satanic numerology, you will ace the rest of this test. "
2947,"I wish I understood how my brain works. A decade ago I saw a photoshop contest on the theme of “scary road signs,” whose entries included one enforcing a speed limit of the square root of 666. I haven’t the foggiest idea why my brain held onto that image, or why it dragged the memory out kicking and screaming 10 years later just for the sake of generating a “root of all evil” pun. Once it did, though, and because every dang thing becomes a theme in this hobby, there was no way I wasn’t going to run with it. (It wasn’t until writing this blurb that I went looking for the original image, only to discover that it actually showed the square root of 677. I give up, brain.)"
2948,"This represents my second attempt at the concept after the first was rejected by Will, who liked the theme but not the execution; some but not all of the theme entries in that original go-round relied on homophones, like SINE OF THE TIMES (sin[AxB]) and HALF A GOOD DAY (. 5 x 12/25), which proved inconsistent. The do-over is much tighter over all with a minimum of wince-and-hide-my-eyes fill, which isn’t to say that I wouldn’t love to gut the SW corner another six times. The fill went relatively quickly, although the nipping and tucking portion of the process dragged on for quite a while. You’d think I’d have learned by now to hack away at the center first, where everything crashes into everything else Michael Bay-style, but old habits die awfully hard. And yes, I was a math major before switching to English, which is as good an explanation not only for this puzzle but also for why I do this in the first place. Such is life."

2953,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo typically uses his State of the State address and his budget speech to showcase new, flashy policy ideas (Green New Deal! Legalizing marijuana!), but his budget amendments get none of that. There isn’t even a news conference. "
2954,"Instead, the so-called 30-day amendments — a series of fixes and tweaks issued a month after the proposal — arrive, largely unheralded, in a packet of dense legalese posted to the governor’s website."
2955,"But the amendments’ low profile belies their importance. They can move up or push back a program’s start date; add or eliminate large sums of state spending; even, in some cases, throw in new ideas entirely, without lawmakers’ or the public’s notice. "
2956,"Mr. Cuomo has been on a rampage to “blow up” the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which controls the city’s flailing subways and commuter trains. Without an overhaul, the governor said, the agency would continue to stew in its own bureaucracy and lack of accountability. (The M.T.A., a state agency, is controlled by Mr. Cuomo.)"
2957,The updated budget provides the first hints of what that blowup would look like.
2958,M.T.A. board members would be forced to step down when the elected official who appointed them leaves office. The agency would be required to come up with a “comprehensive reorganization plan.” The governor would also add a layer of bureaucracy by creating an “expert panel” to oversee and approve the M.T.A.’s spending. 
2959,"“We have to consolidate the functions at the M.T.A.,” Mr. Cuomo said in a recent radio interview. “Bring in a different culture. Make the board functional and operational.”"
2960,"The panel would also be in charge of structuring a much-debated congestion pricing plan, which would raise money for mass transit by charging people who drive into parts of Manhattan."
2961,"The bill states that the panel can issue the congestion pricing rates “no sooner than Nov. 15, 2020” — even though Mr. Cuomo has called on lawmakers to pass congestion pricing this year. Mayor Bill de Blasio joined that call for the first time last week."
2962,"The restructuring plan could give Mr. Cuomo (even more) significant control over the M.T.A., after years of him denying or downplaying that influence. The governor suggested in the radio interview that he would ask legislators to consider changing how the agency’s board members — of whom Mr. Cuomo controls a plurality but not a majority — are chosen."
2963,"Some lawmakers have already expressed skepticism. State Senator Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat, said the scope and purpose of the expert panel, as well as the governor’s long-term plans for the M.T.A., remained unclear."
2964,"“There are many still unanswered questions, and numbers that don’t necessarily add up right,” she said. “But I certainly agree that we have a crisis for mass transit funding, and dramatic solutions must be implemented.”"
2965,"What do seatbelts have to do with state spending? Unclear. But they’re in the budget anyway, in the form of a proposal to make back-seat passengers wear them. "
2966,"Currently, it’s illegal in New York to ride without a seatbelt in the front seat, and in both the front and back for anyone under 16. "
2967,It’s not contested that rear seatbelts save lives: A 2007 study found that crash mortality could be reduced by as much as 75 percent for people in the back seat if they wore seatbelts. 
2968,"But that doesn’t explain why the proposal was in the budget, rather than introduced as a separate bill. Except that this is how the budget in Albany is always done: crammed with nonfiscal matters that the governor or other lawmakers want. After all, it’s harder to reject any one policy when it’s tied to a $170 billion budget for the entire state. Ah, transparency."
2969,"One of the perhaps most unexpected amendments was Mr. Cuomo’s proposal to close up to three prisons by September, an idea he had made no mention of in earlier speeches."
2970,"The governor celebrated the idea as a common-sense step toward criminal justice reform, especially given the state’s declining prison population. The state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision would decide which prisons to close, and the closures would not cause layoffs, Mr. Cuomo said in a news release. "
2971,"But Republican lawmakers and corrections officers accused the governor of trying to sneak the closures under their noses, endangering public safety."
2972,"“Closures do not in any way equate to a decrease in number of incarcerated people,” said Michael Powers, the president of the state’s correctional officers union. “Closures mean consolidating the same number of incarcerated people into a smaller area, making remaining prisons overpopulated.”"
2973,"Still, the proposed closures are likely to be among the least contentious criminal justice issues before the Legislature in coming weeks. Democrats in both the Senate and Assembly have promised to reduce or even end cash bail, ensure speedy trials and guarantee defendants’ access to evidence — measures that divide not just along partisan lines, but even cause disagreement among Democrats. "
2974,"Talk about whiplash. First, Mr. Cuomo’s budget promised a 2 percent bump to Medicaid reimbursement rates, much to the joy of hospitals and other health care providers. "
2975,"Then, the reversal came: The amended budget cut reimbursement rates, after Mr. Cuomo announced in February that the state was facing an unexpected $2 billion shortfall. "
2976,"The new budget would reduce state funding to hospitals by more than $500 million — a gross loss of more than $1 billion after the loss in federal matching funds, according to Bea Grause, president of the Healthcare Association of New York State."
2977,Overall healthcare spending would still rise by $200 million.
2978,"Still, advocates said the budget would make the biggest cuts to hospital spending since Mr. Cuomo took office. But Ms. Grause said she was confident her group could talk the cuts down."
2979,"“It’s the opening play in a larger negotiation,” she said."
2980,"If this sounds somewhat familiar, that’s because it is. Mr. Cuomo last year signed a law requiring opioid manufacturers and distributors to pay into a $100 million annual fund, which would be used to pay for substance abuse treatment programs. "
2981,"But in December, a state judge shot that down, ruling that the law as written would obstruct interstate commerce. "
2982,"So this year, Mr. Cuomo is trying again. This time, he is structuring the fee as a tax rather than a fund, and more important, explicitly allowing manufacturers to pass the cost on to patients — a provision that last year’s law prohibited."
2983,"That has raised concerns about hurting people who genuinely need the medication. “The proposed tax is effectively a tax on pain,” said Lewis Davis, an economics professor at Union College who studied the proposal at the request of a group of pharmaceutical research companies. "
2984,"But Senator Peter Harckham, the Democratic chairman of the Senate’s Committee on Alcoholism and Substance Abuse, said he supported the change as a necessary concession to the goal of fighting the opioid epidemic."
2985,"“Unfortunately it’s the way that the courts will allow it,” he said. "
2986,"The Legislature would study possible exceptions for some patients, he added. “But if this is an impetus to change the conversation from opioids to other medications that are not as dangerous, then let’s use it as such."""
2987,"Robert W. Sweet, who as Mayor John V. Lindsay’s top deputy worked to end some of the most rancorous conflicts in 1960s New York, and who as a longtime federal judge struck down a state ban on begging on the streets, died on Sunday in Ketchum, Idaho. He was 96."
2988,"His son Robert Jr. confirmed the death. Judge Sweet, who lived in Manhattan, also had a home in Ketchum, where he was on vacation. At his death he was a senior federal judge in the Southern District of New York."
2989,"Mr. Sweet was Mr. Lindsay’s chief deputy mayor (and had been his former Yale Law School roommate) from late 1966 through 1969, representing the mayor in tense labor disputes."
2990,"These included a teachers’ strike in 1967 that kept most of the city’s one million public school students out of school for two and a half weeks, and a nine-day sanitation workers’ strike the next year that left garbage piled up throughout the city."
2991,"Those fights, largely over wages and working conditions, were nothing new in New York City’s long history of labor relations. But three later strikes by the teachers in the fall term of 1968 proved far more intractable, because they revolved around who would control the schools."
2992,"The strikes, which emptied classrooms for a total of eight weeks, grew out of a plan intending to improve public education by decentralizing the city’s school system. Pilot projects had been set up in three school districts, including Ocean Hill-Brownsville, in a predominantly black and Puerto Rican area of Brooklyn."
2993,"The strikes were called after the district’s board had summarily moved to transfer a group of teachers and administrators out of the district. Ten of the teachers resisted, but the board persisted even after a trial examiner for the school system did not find enough evidence to support the board’s accusations that the 10 had tried to sabotage community control or had done unsatisfactory work."
2994,"The teachers’ union saw itself in a must-win fight to protect its members’ rights and discourage such actions by other local boards. Many supporters of the district’s leadership, which was largely black, saw the strikes as an effort by a largely white and heavily Jewish union to squelch community control. Anti-Semitic and racist accusations punctuated the conflict."
2995,"Mr. Sweet, on Mr. Lindsay’s behalf, sought to persuade the union, the district’s leadership and the Board of Education to compromise. Though he won praise for his low-key manner and his ability to relieve tensions in the negotiations — Sid Davidoff, an assistant to the mayor, told The New York Times that Mr. Sweet “can deal with anybody, even an adversary, in almost a friendly way” — only the state was able to end the conflict. It suspended the district board, and the involuntary transfers were made subject to grievance procedures in the union’s contract."
2996,"Mr. Sweet’s cordial negotiating manner — the “Sweet schmooze,” City Hall colleagues called it — was also an asset in Albany, where he often traveled to appeal for more state financial aid for the city."
2997,"Mr. Sweet stepped down as deputy mayor at the end of 1969, after Mr. Lindsay was elected to a second term, and returned to private law practice as a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. President Jimmy Carter named him to the United States Court for the Southern District of New York, in Manhattan, in 1978."
2998,"One of Judge Sweet’s major rulings came in 1992, when he declared that the state’s law against begging on the streets was an unconstitutional violation of free speech."
2999,"While the government has a “valid interest” in preserving public order, he said, “the interest in permitting free speech and the message that begging sends about our society predominates.”"
3000,"He added, “A peaceful beggar poses no threat to society,” while “aggressive panhandling” could be prosecuted under existing laws."
3001,"The ruling was upheld on appeal. In 1996, New York City enacted its own ban on aggressive panhandling. Panhandling remains illegal in the city’s subways and buses and at Transit Authority stations."
3002,"Perhaps Judge Sweet’s most controversial words were expressed off the bench. In a 1989 speech at the Cosmopolitan Club in Manhattan, he called for legalizing heroin, crack cocaine and all other illegal drugs."
3003,"The war on drugs was “bankrupt” and futile and overwhelming the courts, he maintained. If legalized, he said, the drugs could be produced by pharmaceutical companies, regulated like alcohol and kept unlawful for minors."
3004,"Those advocating legalization expressed gratification at having a federal judge on board. Critics argued that Judge Sweet was defeatist, and that heroin and crack were more addictive than alcohol."
3005,"In another prominent case, Judge Sweet, in 2003, dismissed a lawsuit that sought to hold the McDonald’s Corporation liable for obesity and ill health in teenagers."
3006,"‘If a person knows or should know that eating copious orders of supersized McDonald’s products is unhealthy and may result in weight gain,” Judge Sweet wrote, “it is not the place of the law to protect them from their own excesses.”"
3007,"He went on to note: “Nobody is forced to eat at McDonald’s. (Except, perhaps, parents of small children who desire McDonald’s food, toy promotions or playgrounds, and demand their parents’ accompaniment.)”"
3008,"Robert Workman Sweet was born in Yonkers on Oct. 15, 1922, the son of James and Delia (Workman) Sweet. His father was a lawyer."
3009,"Mr. Sweet attended the Horace Mann School in the Bronx and the Taft School in Connecticut before graduating from Yale in 1944. He spent two years in the Navy, commanding a submarine chaser in the Atlantic, his family said. He graduated from Yale Law in 1948."
3010,"That same year he married Lois Clapp. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1973 he married Adele Hall Leopold, a daughter of Dorothy Schiff, at the time the publisher of The New York Post. Ms. Sweet was assistant publisher of The Post under her mother and later headed the Dorothy Schiff Foundation. Adele Sweet died in December at 93."
3011,"In addition to Robert Jr., Judge Sweet is survived by two daughters, Deborah Given and Eliza H. Sweet; another son, Ames; seven grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; six stepchildren; and many step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren."
3012,"After law school Mr. Sweet worked largely in private practice for 17 years. He was also active in Republican Party politics and served as Manhattan borough coordinator in Mr. Lindsay’s first race for mayor, in 1965. The victorious Mr. Lindsay brought him to City Hall as his executive assistant, and made him chief deputy mayor after a year."
3013,Among Judge Sweet’s many former law clerks was former Gov. Eliot Spitzer of New York.
3014,"In his later years Judge Sweet was an avid figure-skater, beginning many days with a morning skating session at the Chelsea Piers Sky Rink in Manhattan. He started skating after his wife Adele, a skater herself, gave him figure skates as a birthday present."
3015,"“Figure skating is often precarious at any age, and the fact that the judge does this at 92 is extraordinary,” an instructor, Marni Halasa, told Corey Kilgannon of The New York Times one morning in 2015 for an article about the judge’s hobby."
3016,"The judge proceeded to practice a fox trot ice-dance routine as well as maneuvers like swing rolls, 3-turns, Mohawk turns and crossovers."
3017,Judge Sweet saw parallels between skating and judging.
3018,"“You really have to pay attention to detail, and it requires balance and hard work,” he said. “It doesn’t make me a better judge or anything like that, but working hard at anything makes you better.”"
3019,A case before the Supreme Court this term could significantly affect whether densely populated cities like New York have the right to set their own gun policies.
3020,"At a glance, New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. City of New York is a limited dispute. It pits residents who have “premises licenses,” which allow them to possess guns only at their homes, against a New York City ordinance that restricts their travel with their weapons to shooting ranges and clubs within city borders. If the petitioners — a gun advocacy group along with three of these individuals — prevail, those with premises licenses will be allowed to take their handguns with them to out-of-town ranges. Not a big deal, right? Actually, it is. The case has implications far broader than sport shooting. If the court decides against the city, New York City and other cities around the country could become far more dangerous places."
3021,"As a university professor and the research director of a Southern gun violence prevention organization, I’ve spent the past eight years tracking how state and local-level court rulings and legislation promoted as limited in scope lead to sweeping changes in the ways people buy, carry and use firearms. Time and again, I’ve found that seemingly modest relaxation of local gun laws like the one at issue in New York undercut the ability of cities and communities to set their own regulations, and alter ways that people live and die."
3022,"For instance, in 2007, pro-gun politicians in Missouri repealed a seemingly arcane 1921 law governing the purchase of concealable firearms. Supporters of the repeal (backed by the National Rifle Association) pitched the change as simply easing a tedious and outdated requirement that prospective gun buyers fill out paperwork in person at sheriff’s offices. But this modest action was the first rumbling of an avalanche. "
3023,"Missouri gun proponents built on the repeal to legalize “permitless carry” by anyone 19 years of age or older, nullify local gun-control ordinances, expand “stand your ground” protections and empower citizens to carry weapons into restaurants, bars, streets, schools and seemingly everyplace else. The police even lost the ability to disarm anyone carrying a firearm unless the individual was under arrest. The inability of local government to make gun laws threatened to turn Missouri into the “Wild West,” in the words of an exasperated City Council member in Webster Groves."
3024,"In Tennessee, N.R.A.-supported politicians pushed through legislation allowing guns in parks. Only after passage did people discover that the law weakened the state’s ability to restrict weapons at concerts and state fairs. A 2017 law in Arkansas permitted guns on college campuses — which made guns legal at Southeast Conference football games and other large sporting events. So-called guns-in-trunks laws in Ohio and some other states allowed employees to store guns and ammunition in their vehicles while at work — followed by jumps in the number of guns stolen out of cars. Sweeping open-carry legislation in Texas meant public libraries could not keep guns out of the stacks."
3025,"While these changes expand gun rights for certain people, they invariably lead to significant increases in  injuries and deaths. Right-to-carry laws correlate with increases in violent crime and rising homicide and suicide rates, and also raise the likelihood that incidents of conflict like road rage or domestic arguments will turn fatal. For instance, homicides committed with guns in Missouri increased by 25 percent in the three years after the 2007 repeal, and more Missouri guns were recovered in crimes in neighboring states. Gun suicides rose over this period as well. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that states with the weakest gun laws and highest rates of gun ownership invariably have the highest rates of overall gun mortality. A recent study found that they also have higher rates of mass shootings."
3026,"Beyond the direct health effects, allowing guns in public spaces changes how we interact with one another. My research shows that people become more wary when they think a stranger might be armed — a mistrust that fuels further gun sales. Racial tensions and stereotypes often accompany this anxiety. “I see white guys walking around Sam’s Club with guns on their hips,” an African-American man in Missouri told me, which he saw as armed racial intimidation."
3027,"In an ideal world, New York City might serve as a model for effective gun policy. Gun-related injuries and deaths have been falling for the past decade — not coincidentally, over the same period that the city got serious about gun laws. New York has remarkably low rates of gun trauma for a United States city of its size. Municipal and state laws and regulations also effectively limit gun trafficking. "
3028,"Much of this success results from policies that would most likely be in jeopardy should the Rifle and Pistol Association case go against New York — for instance, restrictions on where people can carry guns and prohibitions on tourists’ bringing weapons into the city. Perhaps most important, regulations governing how people carry guns in New York City differ from those applied in parts of the state that have long and respected traditions of firearm ownership, such as in upstate New York."
3029,"At stake in cases like Rifle and Pistol is the possible nationalization of disastrous policies from pro-gun states — not just loosened gun laws but also pre-emptions of how state or local governments can decide what works best. If the Supreme Court rules in favor of the plaintiffs in any one of these types of cases, the decision could signal that more significant gun control laws might not withstand legal challenges. Additionally, the justices could expand Second Amendment protections beyond the home, an issue left open in previous Supreme Court decisions, and could open the door to overturning longstanding laws governing concealed-carry, gun permitting and other restrictions enacted at the local and state levels."
3030,"The current composition of the court suggests we should brace for decisions that upend local and state regulations in favor of nationally mandated policies that make it ever easier for people to purchase and carry guns. The nomination of President Trump’s first court appointee, Neil Gorsuch, was buoyed by a $1 million ad campaign by the National Rifle Association. And his second appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, wrote a 2011 circuit court dissent in which he argued that Washington, D.C., could not ban semiautomatic rifles on its streets because the right to bear arms superseded its interest in public safety."
3031,"Missouri, Tennessee and Washington are not New York City. People are generally not allowed to carry guns around New York City, to safeguard the delicate and at times tense choreography that gives the city its charm. New Yorkers cram into crowded subway cars, brush by one another on busy sidewalks and drive haltingly through traffic-filled streets. This bustle of the everyday builds on often unspoken communal understandings of neighborliness and trust."
3032,"But imagine a New York where more and more of your neighbors carry guns. If the Supreme Court sides with the complainants in Rifle and Pistol, you won’t need to imagine."

3037,It’s Tuesday.
3038,"Weather: Sunny skies. The temperatures will get into the mid-40s, but the windchill may have you reaching for a scarf."
3039,Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 21 (Purim).
3040,"The real estate mogul Harry Macklowe erected 42-foot-tall photographs of himself and his new wife on a Park Avenue building last week for the whole world — including his ex-wife, who lives nearby — to see."
3041,It was the latest example of how New York has been uniquely shaped by the idiosyncrasies of the superrich.
3042,"Sometimes the results, like vanity addresses on buildings, are seemingly harmless. Other times, they have changed how New York looks and feels."
3043,Here are a few other instances:
3044,Stephen A. Schwarzman’s library
3045,"In 2008, the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman donated $100 million to the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, resulting in his name’s being inscribed on the building five times. Soon it will be six."
3046,Robert Moses’ two-mile detour
3047,"The Northern State Parkway on Long Island bypasses the neighborhood of Wheatley Hills because, according to the historian Robert Caro, very rich residents persuaded the master builder Robert Moses to redesign his roadway plans."
3048,Barry Diller’s park
3049,"Initially, the plan for a new park on the West Side of Manhattan was modest, and the billionaire Barry Diller was tapped to help fund it. “He embraced the notion, but brought in his own experts and commissioned a space age structure,” The New York Times reported in 2017."
3050,"Before Mr. Diller got involved, the park was projected to cost $35 million; its budget has since ballooned to $250 million."
3051, Jeff Bezos’ planned helipad
3052,"When Amazon was looking to open a major campus, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio lured it with nearly $3 billion in tax incentives and waterfront property in Long Island City. “They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive,” The Times’s J. David Goodman reported last year. (Could you imagine him taking the 7 train?)"
3053,The company eventually backed out of the whole deal because of local opposition.
3054,Donald J. Trump’s properties
3055,"Of course, this list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning Donald J. Trump, whose eponymous developments proliferated throughout New York City for decades before he became president. Even Wollman Rink in Central Park has the Trump name on it."
3056,"Since the 2016 election, there has been a push to strip his name from some buildings and even a state park."

3059,Black lawmakers in New York say they’ll block marijuana legalization unless their communities benefit from what could be a $3 billion industry.
3060,State lawmakers are backing a pied-à-terre tax on multimillion-dollar second homes in New York. They say it will help fund the city’s ailing subway system.

3073,It’s hard to overstate the revolutionary impact that bicycles have had on mankind.
3074,"Paved roads were made for cyclists, not drivers, one author has argued."
3075,"The Times’s Natalie Angier wrote, “Bicycles also gave birth to our national highway system.” And Ms. Angier also noted that suffragist Susan B. Anthony said, “I think it has done more to emancipate women than any one thing in the world.”"
3076,"There are, of course, more recent examples of the impact of bicycles."
3077,"In 2008, an East Harlem resident, Dulcie Canton, had not just one but half a dozen jobs: dog-walking, cat-sitting, fine-arts modeling, coffee shop barista, just to name a few. And she biked to each of them. Why? “I was struggling to make MetroCard money,” she said in a recent interview."
3078,"“I thought of cycling as a way to save money, going to my gigs,” Ms. Canton said. Besides, she added, “mass transit is crazy.”"
3079,"So, she hopped on her bike and rode. Later, Ms. Canton connected with other female cyclists of color through groups like Black Girls Do Bike and Brown Bike Girl. “I felt like I found my family,” she said."
3080,"Ms. Canton now works as the Brooklyn organizer for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that promotes bicycle and pedestrian-friendly policies."
3081,"The “first human-powered two-wheeled machines,” debuted in New York in 1819, according to a news release from the Museum of the City of New York. Those machines did not have pedals, and riders mainly coasted. Those machines were called velocipedes."
3082,Bicycles have evolved a lot since then.
3083,"On Thursday, the museum will open the exhibit “Cycling in the City: A 200-Year History.” It will explore the history and cultures of cycling, as well as the machines themselves. The exhibit includes 150 objects, 14 bicycles and three stationary bicycles."
3084,The exhibit runs (or rides!) through Oct. 6.
3085,It’s Tuesday — make your own path.
3086,Dear Diary:
3087,I was stepping up to order at Planet Smoothie in Penn Station when a man who had just gotten a smoothie stomped back to the counter.
3088,“What’s in this?” he said.
3089,The cashier looked nonplused.
3090,"“Which one did you order, again?” he said."
3091,The man waved at the board on the wall. The cashier continued to have a nervous look on his face.
3092,"“It looks like strawberries, blueberries, nonfat yogurt,” he said."
3093,"“I can read,” the man said. “But it doesn’t taste like it.”"
3094,The people waiting behind me began to shuffle impatiently. The cashier shrugged and shifted his feet. Two other employees moved in closer. I started contemplating whether a smoothie was worth waiting out this scene for.
3095,“I can make you another one if you like?” the cashier said.
3096,There was a pause.
3097,"“Nope, that’s all right, it’s good, ” the man said. “I like it, and I was just hoping for the recipe to make it at home.”"

3102,It’s Tuesday. 
3103,Weather: Bundle up. Temperatures start in the low 20s and by the afternoon will warm all the way up to the low 30s.
3104,Alternate-side parking: Suspended through Ash Wednesday.
3105,"The outlook for New York City yesterday went from, in the words of Bob Dylan, “give me shelter from the storm” to “an uneventful morn.”"
3106,And yet the city’s public schools — the nation’s largest system — were closed for a snow day.
3107,How did that happen?
3108,Why did Mayor de Blasio call a snow day?
3109,"Timing. He had to make a decision Sunday evening, when the forecast looked ominous. The weather changed overnight, but by that point, it was too late to adjust the plan."
3110,"The call to close schools is made early, “with as much time as possible for parents to plan,” the mayor’s spokesman said. Then there are all the school buses to think about."
3111,"As my colleagues Eliza Shapiro and Michael Gold wrote, buses leave depots before dawn and could interfere with the nearly 1,600 snow plows combing the streets."
3112,How many snow days have there been in New York City?
3113,"Seven since 2014, compared with 11 from 1978 to 2013, according to The City’s Alyssa Katz."
3114,What happened with recent storms?
3115,"• On Nov. 16, a sudden rush-hour storm took local officials by surprise, and thousands of commuters were delayed and stranded. Some students were stuck on a bus for 10 hours."
3116,"• Then on Jan. 18, motorists were advised to stay off the road. It turned out to be not so bad."
3117,"Did everyone get the forecast wrong, or did the weather change?"
3118,"“Temperatures were just not as cold as predicted, so it didn’t allow for as much accumulation,” said John Murray, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “It was a challenging forecast, with uncertainty at play, and a few inches can make a dramatic difference.”"
3119,Who else can tell you about the weather?
3120,"Practically everyone gets their information from the National Weather Service. Its website is detailed and maybe not ideal for people who just want to know if they need an umbrella or scarf. For that, there are some very good newsletters (I can think of a few)."
3121,"If you want a little more information, there is an array of weather apps."
3122,"Liz Robbins, a former Times colleague and weather enthusiast, told me about some she uses: AccuWeather is easy to use; Dark Sky is precise and good for knowing when to grab an umbrella; and Weather Underground (clever name!) has helpful charts, graphs and radar maps."
3123,"The takeaway: By the time the brunt of a storm arrives, it’s too late to figure out how to respond. Mayors often need to make decisions hours earlier, when many of the factors may be, literally, up in the air."
3124,And now ... 
3125,"Over to you, Diane."
3126,"• Historic: Meet Lora Panepinto, one of the first girls in New York City to be officially welcomed into the club that for more than a century had been called the Boy Scouts."
3127,• Art: The Brooklyn-based playwright Jackie Sibblies Drury won the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize yesterday for her play “Fairview.”

3141,
3142,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
3143,The New York Times has rules about puns.
3144,"“The successful pun pivots on a word that fits effortlessly into two contexts,” it says in The Times’s Manual of Style and Usage, commonly called the stylebook. “A pun should be a surprise encounter, evoking a sly smile rather than a groan.”"
3145,"And, of course, use it sparingly, as “a trace element rather than a staple.”"
3146,"“That’s well said,” Fred Firestone told me."
3147,"Mr. Firestone is the host of Punderdome, a competitive pun-making contest."
3148,"How Punderdome works: Contestants have about a minute to come up with as many puns about a broad topic as possible. Then they read their puns to the audience, whose reaction is calculated by a very official “human clap-o-meter.”"
3149,Whoever emerges victorious squares off with a winner from a previous contest.
3150,"The main rules: no hate, no hurt feelings and encouragement for all."
3151,"So, what does Mr. Firestone think of the stylebook’s entry on puns?"
3152,"To my surprise, he not only liked it, but said that was what he was attempting to emulate."
3153,"“The conventional wisdom is ‘a pun is an eyeroll.’ What we try to do is set up a situation where it is really a side-split,” he said. “We don’t want people rolling their eyes, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ because I don’t think we’d get people coming back.”"
3154,"And come back they have. Tonight’s show, at 7 p.m., at Littlefield in Brooklyn, is the 95th Punderdome to take place in New York City, Mr. Firestone said."
3155,"Part of Punderdome’s success is its lax rules about what exactly a pun is. “We define it very broadly,” Mr. Firestone said."
3156,"Audience members, who applaud or groan at the wordplay, “may not have a particularly correct definition of puns.”"
3157,It’s Tuesday — have fun with words.
3158,Dear Diary:
3159,"I was coming out of the subway elevator with my son in his stroller, when I saw a rat on the platform barely two feet away."
3160,"A rat is one of the few things that can truly unnerve me. So there I stood, clinging to the stroller and weighing my options."
3161,"A man standing nearby was watching in amusement. He chuckled, smoothed his black mustache, approached the rat calmly and watched it for several seconds."
3162,"Then, with a small, graceful jeté of his left black boot, he sent the rat sailing off the platform, through the air and onto the tracks, where it landed safely."
3163,"The man looked down, smiled and shrugged. Then he turned toward me, took a small bow, turned again and walked away."
3164,I hurried to squeeze onto the uptown express.

3171,"This North Stamford house, four miles north of the Merritt Parkway and 35 minutes from Midtown Manhattan, was built as the summer home of Walter Phillips Terry, a journalist who died in 1917. All the chestnut logs used in its construction were cut at an 18th-century sawmill on the site, and the mill is believed to now be the property’s guest cottage. The house was eventually turned into a year-round residence, and in 2008 it was bought and revived by the current owner, William Bretschger, a construction manager specializing in historic restoration. It is on the National Register of Historic Places."

3174,"Indoors: Orient Lodge, as the three-story house is called, is a trove of period details, including etched-glass windows, chinoiserie wallpaper, vertically striped wainscoting, beamed and latticed ceilings, and monumental cobblestone fireplaces built with rocks from a stream on the property and ornamented with welcoming messages inscribed in gold leaf."
3175,"The four-foot-wide entry door with cherry-blossom etched-glass panels opens to a double-height vestibule. A window cut high in one wall, overlooking the adjacent great room, is filled with delicate fretwork, including a border made of fylfot, or ancient swastika, symbols. The great room has a 23-foot ceiling and timber walls. The legend in gold leaf on the fireplace mantel reads “Here ends the Road that leads to all Good Comfort.”"
3176,"In the dining room, the ceiling is lower and the fireplace slogan shorter: “The Honor of the House is Hospitality.” Originally the leaded-glass window with fylfots overlooked a porch between the main house and the servants’ quarters and kitchen. That area has since been enclosed and is now taken up by a cabinet-lined butler’s pantry. The kitchen beyond it dates to the 1970s, with a 2008 refresh bringing in new appliances and repainted pine cabinets (the colors inspired by a Depression-era measuring scoop). The countertops remained Formica at the urging of Mr. Bretschger’s daughter."
3177,"The master bedroom is on the ground floor, off the dining room, and has large windows looking down to a waterfall and an en suite bathroom with original Arts and Crafts tile in the shower. Next to it is a den with leaded windows."
3178,"Two guest bedrooms and a sitting room, all with angled ceilings, dormer windows and latticed, shingled or bead-board walls, are on the top floor, along with a bathroom with restored subway and hexagonal tile."

3180,"Outdoor space: The 2.26-acre property includes a 3,000-square-foot carriage house with the original stables below and a guest apartment above. There is also a detached two-car garage with a deck and patio. Two ponds border the property, as well as an 85-foot-long stone dam. A full patio overlooks the wetlands area, and there are two meadows, multiple gardens, greenhouses and a circa-1800 functioning artesian well."

The main floor includes, on one side, the 1,000-square-foot great room, with its 25-foot ceiling, and a pair of bedrooms sharing a Jack-and-Jill bathroom.

A curving stairway from the living room leads to a partial second floor with a 900-square-foot master suite opening to a private outdoor deck."
3187,"Designed for entertaining, the house comfortably holds 150 people. Tucked behind a curving wall in the great room is a wet bar with a wine refrigerator, sink and dishwasher. Both the great room and the 300-square-foot dining room have gas fireplaces. The kitchen has two ovens, two grills, a plate-warmer, a deep fryer, a walk-in pantry and a central granite-covered island that seats 10."
3188,"The master suite’s bedroom, bathroom and walk-in closet are all about equal size. The bedroom and bathroom share a double-faced fireplace. The bathroom also has a soaking tub set in a granite base and a large walk-in granite-and-glass shower with multiple jets."
3189,"Outdoor space: The terraced property in front of the house contains a 30-foot-long water feature that trickles down the slope and ends in the heated swimming pool area. (There is also a separate hot tub.) Overlooking the pool are sheltered and open patio areas, some covered in artificial turf. An attached garage holds three cars and includes three storage areas."

3202,ALBANY — [What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
3203,"With New York’s upstate casinos struggling, some state officials are considering the once unthinkable: putting casinos in New York City itself."
3204,"Representatives from major gaming companies have been meeting this week with lawmakers in Albany, including the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, to push a proposal to open as many as three full-fledged casinos in the New York City area."
3205,"They say that such a move could provide the state hundreds of millions of dollars each year in new revenue and create thousands of new jobs, an argument that has been given extra heft by the collapse of the Amazon deal in Queens, and the ongoing effort to find a financial cure for the city’s decrepit subways."
3206,"Under one proposal, Aqueduct Raceway on the Queens border with Long Island and Yonkers Raceway would be converted from so-called racinos into full gaming operations. In another, the state would open bidding for up to three casino licenses, clearing the way for a new gambling hub to be built elsewhere in New York City, likely outside of Manhattan."
3207,"The chairmen of the Assembly and Senate gaming committees have thrown their support behind the idea of bringing gaming to New York City. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has not closed the door altogether, but he has expressed deep skepticism about an accelerated plan to expand gambling in the state. The leader of the Senate Democrats, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, has not publicly stated a position about new casinos, but Mr. Heastie has been historically cool to the idea."
3208,The companies have proposed paying upstate casino operators about $100 million to counteract the loss of exclusivity — New York had agreed not to issue any more casino licenses until 2023. The three companies also have expressed a willingness to pay the state at least $500 million each to operate in the downstate market.
3209,"Assemblyman Gary Pretlow, a Democrat from Westchester County who leads the Racing and Wagering Committee, was impressed by the amount of money being floated — “They are offering $500 million each,” he said — adding that such a windfall could improve the state’s finances immediately. “It could go into this year’s budget,” he said."
3210,"The upstate casinos are seemingly on board with the expansion plan. But it still faces an uphill slope in Albany, particularly among liberal Democrats in the State Assembly who view gaming as a regressive tax."
3211,"Mr. Cuomo has said he remained “dubious” of any plan to open new casinos before 2023, but he did not outright reject the possibility of expanding casino gambling, giving hope to plans like those backed by Las Vegas Sands, owned by Sheldon Adelson, a prominent supporter of Republican politicians and President Trump. Sands is seeking to open a new luxury casino in New York City, and the company has enlisted the former governor, David Paterson, to advocate on its behalf."
3212,"“I think, in an iconic city like New York, to have an iconic structure, would be another, really beautiful, tourism destination,” Mr. Paterson said in an interview, adding that he wished someone had proposed it when he was in office and “we had a $21 billion deficit.”"
3213,"Mr. Paterson was referring to shortfalls in the state budget, which is due on April 1. Projected income tax revenue is lower, and agreements to create other revenue streams for the state, including legalized marijuana and congestion pricing, are facing opposition. The looming shortfalls led the governor and legislative leaders last week to signal an accord on a so-called pied-à-terre tax, which will target superluxury second homes in New York City."
3214,"There is also external pressure from neighboring states, as New Jersey continues to embrace and expand betting, and intrastate support: In Yonkers, Mayor Mike Spano signaled support for allowing live-dealer table games at the Empire City casino, which, like Aqueduct, currently only has video lottery terminals, which resemble slot machines. So did the Business Council of Westchester, which said the impact of Empire City “cannot be overstated.”"
3215,"MGM Resorts, which owns Yonkers Raceway, and the Genting Group, a Malaysian-based conglomerate that runs the Resorts World racino at Aqueduct, have stressed the speed with which they could transform their current operations in Yonkers and at Aqueduct Racetrack into full-fledged casinos, arguing they could be up and running within months, as opposed to the years it might take for an outside company to start from scratch."
3216,"“Resorts World is a proven operator ready to move immediately once given the authorization,” said Michael Levoff, a spokesman for the Genting Group, noting that the Aqueduct casino had been operating in Queens for seven years, and generated “over $2 billion in much-needed revenue.”"
3217,"Sands, meanwhile, seems to be banking on the appeal of construction and other union-friendly jobs. The company is already negotiating agreements with at least two major unions, including the Building Construction and Trades Council, whose president was one of the authors of an op-ed in early March that advocated for an expansion of casinos downstate as a way to provide “new revenue to improve public transit service, fund public education, and other New York priorities.”"
3218,"The argument in favor of expansion was echoed in a letter sent to Mr. Cuomo by the Business Council of New York, a frequent ally of his, arguing that it would add up to “$1.5 billion in much-needed immediate revenue,” though the Council said it was opposed to the idea of “any quick-fix approach to convert existing racinos.” The process, it said, should be opened to bidding."
3219,"The state has had a staggered and at times stalled approach to gaming. Its first casinos in the modern era came after Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s and 1990s affirmed the right of Native American tribes to run such franchises and a 1993 compact with Mario M. Cuomo, who was the governor at the time. The state’s racinos began to open in 2004 and have expanded to nine locations, including Aqueduct and Yonkers."
3220,"In 2013, Mr. Cuomo doubled down, signing legislation to allow seven full-fledged casinos, despite warnings about saturation in the gaming market. At the time, the governor promised such facilities were designed to benefit upstate before downstate, assuring no casino license would be granted anywhere near New York City until 2023."
3221,"But all four newly licensed casinos — Resorts World Catskills Casino in Monticello, N.Y.; Rivers Casino in Schenectady; the del Lago Resort and Casino, in Tyre, a small town southeast of Rochester; and Tioga Downs Casino Resort, west of Binghamton — have missed their own projections for earnings. Trouble signs are easy to find: Del Lago has been warned about its debt, while Empire Resorts, which owns the Catskills casino, also reported large losses last year."
3222,"Mr. Cuomo has already signed off on allowing the four upstate casinos to offer sports wagering inside the facilities, though he has balked at permitting mobile sports wagering, which New Jersey has embraced."
3223,"But the governor seemed to recognize the potential of a New York City casino, suggesting that such a facility, if opened to competitive bidding, could drive up the price far higher than the $500 million each currently being floated by MGM and Genting."
3224,"The appeal for the casino companies is clear: untold numbers of potential customers, including the 65 million tourists who come to New York City every year."
3225,"“You’ve got massive population, not only in New York but in surrounding states,” said Ron Reese, a spokesman for Sands. “And that’s really what drives the success of these multibillion dollar casino resort properties.”"
3226,"Indeed, Mr. Cuomo characterized a New York City casino as “the golden franchise” for gaming."
3227,"“If you were to go there, and I’m not even sure I would go there,” the governor said, about such a plan, “it would have to be through a competitive bidding process, so we made sure New Yorkers got the best price.”"

3229,Ask a New Yorker about their opinion regarding trains and you will likely get an earful about the sputtering subway system or the less-than-reliable commuter rail lines that stretch into the suburbs.
3230,"But few New Yorkers have ever glimpsed, or even heard of, the New York & Atlantic Railway, a freight train that would seem more familiar rumbling across the Great Plains, not chugging through crowded city neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, bearing cars loaded with food, scrap metal, construction materials and even beer."
3231,Now the little-known railroad’s profile is about to get much bigger.
3232,"City officials have been working to reduce the inundation of trucks on New York’s streets. The trucks carry about 90 percent of the city’s freight, more than most major American cities, contributing to the city’s worsening gridlock and pouring greenhouse gases into the air."
3233,"By contrast, the city’s rail lines transport just 2 percent of New York’s cargo."
3234,"To change that, city officials are investing tens of millions of dollars to upgrade the freight train’s corridors, including modernizing several rail depots."
3235,"The railway will also handle more freight because another little-known piece of the region’s transportation network will soon be expanded: a service that floats rail cars from New Jersey across New York Harbor by barge to Brooklyn, where they connect with New York and Atlantic’s line."
3236,"“That rail line has an important but unsung job of diverting truck traffic, and it is key to the future of freight transport for New York City,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who has long advocated rail freight, including supporting building a tunnel under New York Harbor connecting New Jersey to Brooklyn."
3237,"The New York & Atlantic line now is in the surprising position of having its big diesel locomotives — and the sooty, graffiti-strewn boxcars they haul — pegged as a progressive, environmental choice for New York."
3238,"“Anything with rail freight in New York City has to come through us,” said James Bonner, the railway’s president. “We’re the conduit to a lot of growth. It all kind of hinges here.”"
3239,"New York & Atlantic operates on a handful of freight-only lines in Queens, Brooklyn and eastern Long Island mostly by sharing commuter lines run by the Long Island Rail Road, per a 1997 agreement. "
3240,"The short-line railroad receives most of its loaded cars from trains operated by CSX Transportation, one of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, and other railroads from north of the city. They snake down through the Bronx and over the Hell Gate Bridge into Queens, to New York & Atlantic’s cramped rail yard in Glendale, which has the Manhattan skyline for a backdrop."
3241,"New York & Atlantic then takes the cars and distributes them to businesses along its lines where they are often taken onto tracks leading to a customer’s property. Some trains end up at rail-to-truck hubs, where goods are transferred to trucks for local deliveries."
3242,The hubs are vital to rail freight expansion since trains cannot reach all parts of the city. Several truck transfer points along the railway’s Brooklyn line will be improved under a $100 million plan by the city’s Economic Development Corporation to upgrade the city’s maritime and rail freight distribution system.
3243,"“New York City’s rail infrastructure provides significant untapped capacity, whereas our aging highways are at maximum capacity, which limits our ability to remain globally competitive,” said Ryan White, director of freight initiatives for the Economic Development Corporation."
3244,"New York & Atlantic’s volume has grown to 30,000 cars, from roughly 10,000 cars in 1997, Mr. Bonner said."
3245,"Since one rail car can haul as much as four tractor-trailer trucks, those 30,000 cars eliminate some 120,000 truck trips."
3246,"Trucks, and the traffic they cause, helped rally support for a recently approved plan to charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods. A congestion pricing panel formed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last year recommended imposing the highest fees on trucks."
3247,"New York & Atlantic, which serves about 80 customers in the city and in Long Island, has about 60 employees, including eight train crews that must obey strict traffic restrictions and follow a timetable scheduled around the Long Island Rail Road, the country’s busiest commuter rail. "
3248,"Most deliveries are done at night when there are fewer commuter trains. “We have to operate in a very tight window,” Mr. Bonner said."
3249,"In many ways, the train crews practice railroading as it was done a century ago, from assembling the train in the yard and coupling one car to another, to climbing down to the tracks to maneuver heavy hand switches."
3250,"As they lumber along through the dense urban landscape, passing highways, parks, cemeteries and shopping centers, the freight trains draw curious stares."
3251,"“The surprise on people’s faces when we go through their L.I.R.R. station — they’ve never seen anything like it,” said Alex Raia, a 50-year-old engineer, as he worked the throttle and brake on a 2,000-horsepower diesel locomotive to thread it between tight rows of sooty freight cars in the Glendale yard. He likened the task to “playing a game of chess every day.”"
3252,"The cars can carry scrap, recyclables and construction material, including nearly 1 million tons a year of gravel from quarries in Connecticut."
3253,"Walking the yard, Mr. Bonner pointed to a Providence and Worcester railway train that had just arrived. His crews would take over those cars and deliver them to a large yard in Maspeth, Queens."
3254,A rail car then passed by bearing concrete pieces for a new tunnel being built from Queens to Grand Central Terminal that would be used by the Long Island Rail Road.
3255,The railway also handles so many cars of flour and beer that Mr. Bonner has nicknamed it “the pizza-and-beer railroad.”
3256,"During peak beer drinking times — think St. Patrick’s Day and the Super Bowl — that can mean 30 rail cars of beer a week — each car can hold 3,500 cases — including Modelo Especial and Corona that has rumbled by train all the way from Mexico."
3257,"Several other ideas to increase rail freight have been discussed by transportation experts, but are far from becoming reality. They include expanding the use of commuter rail lines for freight and allowing freight trains on a new rail tunnel planned between New Jersey and Manhattan for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. The Regional Plan Association, an influential urban planning group, has proposed combined passenger and freight service on underused freight tracks stretching 24 miles from Co-op City in the Bronx to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn."
3258,"For now, about 15 percent of New York & Atlantic’s rail cars are floated over from New Jersey, but that percentage will increase because of an expansion of the Cross Harbor Rail Freight Program, one of the country’s few remaining floating systems for rail freight."
3259,"The barges provide a gateway into the city from the west and the south, since the Hudson River effectively cuts New York off from much of the nation’s rail freight network — the closest rail bridge is about 150 miles north of the city."
3260,Rail cars that arrive at a yard in Jersey City are taken across New York Harbor to a yard in Sunset Park on the Brooklyn waterfront. 
3261,"Since taking over the barge operation in 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has increased the cross-harbor volume from 1,000 rail cars per year to 5,000, but has been limited by having only one aging barge, which has a capacity of 14 rail cars."
3262,"The authority is set to add two new barges, each with an 18-car capacity, said Matt Masters, general manager of the authority’s port rail program. Within five years the cross-harbor system is expected to transport nearly 25,000 rail cars a year."
3263,"Mr. Bonner said that the increased focus on his railways would not only benefit his railroad’s bottom line, but also the public at large."
3264,"“Hopefully,” he said, “we can play a role in what New York City needs.”"
3265,"CHANGSHA, China — Inside a fishing gear store on a busy city street, the owner sits behind a counter, furiously tapping a smartphone to improve his score on an app that has nothing to do with rods, reels and bait."
3266,"The owner, Jiang Shuiqiu, a 35-year-old army veteran, has a different obsession: earning points on Study the Great Nation, a new app devoted to promoting President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party — a kind of high-tech equivalent of Mao’s Little Red Book. Mr. Jiang spends several hours daily on the app, checking news about Mr. Xi and brushing up on socialist theories."
3267,"Tens of millions of Chinese workers, students and civil servants are now using Study the Great Nation, often under pressure from the government. It is part of a sweeping effort by Mr. Xi to strengthen ideological control in the digital age and reassert the party’s primacy, as Mao once did, as the center of Chinese life."
3268,"“We must love our country,” said Mr. Jiang, one of the top scorers on the app in Changsha, the capital of the southern province of Hunan. “We are getting stronger and stronger.”"
3269,"While many people have embraced the app as a form of patriotism, others see it as a burden imposed by overzealous officials and another sign of a growing personality cult around Mr. Xi, perhaps China’s most powerful leader since Mao’s time."
3270,"“He is using new media to fortify loyalty toward him,” said Wu Qiang, a political analyst in Beijing. He likened Study the Great Nation to the little booklet of Mao quotations that was widely circulated during the chaotic and violent Cultural Revolution."
3271,"Since its debut this year, Study the Great Nation has become the most downloaded app on Apple’s digital storefront in China, with the state news media saying it has more than 100 million registered users — a reach that would be the envy of any new app’s creators."
3272,"But those numbers are driven largely by the party, which ordered thousands of officials across China to ensure that the app penetrates the daily routines of as many citizens as possible, whether they like it or not."
3273,"Schools are shaming students with low app scores. Government offices are holding study sessions and forcing workers who fall behind to write reports criticizing themselves. Private companies, hoping to curry favor with party officials, are ranking employees based on their use of the app and awarding top performers the title of “star learner.”"
3274,Many employers now require workers to submit daily screenshots documenting how many points they have earned.
3275,"Propaganda is ubiquitous in China, but experts say Study the Great Nation is different because the government is forcing people to use it and punishing those who cheat or fall behind."
3276,"The app allows users to earn points for staying on top of news about Mr. Xi. Watching a video about his recent visit to France, for example, earns one point. Getting a perfect score on a quiz about his economic policies earns 10."
3277,"The app comes as Mr. Xi, who rose to power in 2012, is leading a broader crackdown on free speech in China, imprisoning scores of activists, lawyers and intellectuals, and imposing new restrictions on the news media. Mr. Xi has spoken frequently about what he calls the need to guard against online threats. He has warned that the party could lose its grip on power if it does not master digital media."
3278,"“There is no national security without internet security,” Mr. Xi said in a speech this year. “If we cannot succeed on the internet, we will not be able to maintain power in the long run.”"
3279,"David Bandurski, co-director of the China Media Project, said the app was a way for Mr. Xi to ensure that Chinese families are invested in the life of the party at a time when many dismiss propaganda as stilted and irrelevant."
3280,"“Loyalty to the party,” Mr. Bandurski said, “means loyalty to Xi Jinping.”"
3281,"Study the Great Nation in some ways harkens back to the Mao era, when the chairman’s portrait hung in living rooms and families studied his words feverishly. While Mr. Xi cannot yet match Mao’s grandeur, he has borrowed from Mao’s playbook in his quest to be seen as a singular, transformative force."
3282,The app features a television series called “Xi Time” and Mr. Xi’s quotations on topics like building a strong military and achieving a “Chinese dream” of prosperity and strength. The app recommends stories about Mr. Xi on its home screen and sends push notifications highlighting “golden sentences” from his latest speeches. Even the Chinese name for the app is a play on Mr. Xi’s name.
3283,"The app, which also offers lighter fare about traditional Chinese culture, history and geography, presents a censored version of current events. Topics such as China’s mass detention of Muslims are not included."
3284,"At Hulunbuir University in northern China, school officials monitor the scores of more than 1,100 teachers and students who use the app as part of the school’s efforts to spread Mr. Xi’s ideas, known in China as Xi Jinping Thought."
3285,"“Everyone studies voluntarily and has very high scores,” said Bai Mei, an ideology instructor at the university."
3286,"Not everyone is as enthusiastic. In interviews, students and workers complained that superiors publicly chastised them for low scores. Others said bosses threatened to deduct pay or withhold bonuses if they did not use the app more frequently. They did not want to provide their names for fear of punishment, but some have complained online."
3287,"“What kind of phenomenon is this?” one user wrote on Weibo, a popular social media site, complaining of a salary deduction. “My God, what has happened to the party now?”"
3288,"Critics say Mr. Xi is intruding into the private lives of Chinese citizens in a way the party has typically avoided since the Mao era. The app makes the party’s messages difficult to ignore, awarding points only when an article has been read completely and a video has been watched for at least three minutes."
3289,"“You cannot divert attention away from it,” said Haiqing Yu, a professor who studies Chinese media at RMIT University in Australia. “It’s a kind of digital surveillance. It brings the digital dictatorship to a new level.”"
3290,"The app, which was developed by the party’s Propaganda Department and the technology giant Alibaba, is available on the Apple app store as well as Android app stores in China. The Propaganda Department keeps user data."
3291,"It is unclear how closely the government tracks users of Study the Great Nation, but the app requires people to provide a mobile number to register and a national identification number to access videoconference and chat features."
3292,"The Propaganda Department declined to comment, as did Alibaba, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange."
3293,"Given the pressures to use the app, a cheating industry involving at least a dozen products has flourished. A man who listed his contact information in an online advertisement for cheating software said in an interview that many of his more than 1,000 customers saw the app as a burden imposed by bosses. He declined to provide his name for fear of retribution."
3294,The government has moved swiftly to prosecute cheating and limit criticism of the app. The police in the southeastern province of Jiangxi last month detained a man who sold cheating software for about $13. The police said the man was running an illegal business.
3295,"The state-run news media teems with glowing reviews of the app, including stories about diligent hospital workers and kindergarten teachers who open Study the Great Nation as soon as they awaken, even before they drink water or go to the bathroom."
3296,"The app has inspired  videos by prison guards, raps by children and adulatory song-and-dance routines by power plant workers. Some party members have suggested the app can be used as a dating tool to screen potential mates (“If you see a guy on the subway using the app,” says one cartoon, “you should marry him”)."
3297,"In Changsha, which coincidentally is an hour’s drive from Mao’s childhood home, the local news media has lauded Mr. Jiang, the owner of the fishing gear store, for his high scores. He and his wife sometimes answer questions on the app together at dinner, alongside their 9-year-old son."
3298,"Mr. Jiang said his military training had inspired him to devote himself fully to Study the Great Nation. By using the app, he said, he has grown even more patriotic."
3299,"“President Xi has a dream of great renaissance,” he said. “When young people are strong, the nation is strong.”"

3305,"But today, we wanted to dig into the Los Angeles contemporary art scene. Jason Farago, a critic for The New York Times, recently made his way west for a piece exploring L.A.’s place in a global art ecosystem. He wrote about how he approached an expansive landscape: "
3306,"It’s almost a rite of passage for a New York Times art critic to be sent to Los Angeles to take the temperature of the city’s museums and galleries, and to pronounce whether the second-largest city in America has “caught up” to our hometown. As long ago as 1956, one of my predecessors wrote that “spectacular myths hover with the smog over Los Angeles obscuring the considerable progress this city has made in terms of the arts during the last few years.”"
3307,"So when my editor and I sat down to plan my recent story on contemporary art in Los Angeles, timed to the West Coast debut of London’s Frieze Art Fair, we set ourselves some ground rules. No clichés of L.A. as a dream factory of endless sunny days. No cooing over allegedly cheaper rent, which has become a myth of its own. Even the go-to jokes about traffic no longer made sense now that the New York subway has buckled into chronic dysfunction."
3308,"Over a week in Los Angeles — plus a few days in Palm Springs, scoping out the sculpture of the Desert X biennial — my priority was to assess the city on its own terms. I visited just about every museum and gallery from Brentwood to Boyle Heights."
3309,"I had coffees with museum directors and beers with recent M.F.A.s, whose local concerns dovetailed with global artistic ambitions. Plunked in the middle of it all were two new art fairs — Frieze, held on the Paramount backlot, and Felix, staged in the guest rooms and cabanas of a Hollywood hotel — that were the first to draw a global audience to Los Angeles after years of false starts. (My colleague Jori Finkel had a report from the fairs.)"
3310,"Surveying any city’s art scene, let alone one as diverse as L.A.’s, is a game of omissions. With more space I’d have covered stalwart galleries like Regen Projects, in Hollywood; newer ones like Château Shatto, downtown; and nonprofits like Art + Practice, Mark Bradford’s space in South L.A."
3311,"The collector base is growing, though it remains small relative to the city’s wealth. Alternative spaces like the Underground Museum, the Cabin, and Bel Ami are doing very good work."
3312,"The city’s boosters want critics to tell you that Los Angeles is now the center of the contemporary art scene. But the truth is that no single city can lead the way in producing the art of our time. Los Angeles, like every large city, is now a constituent of a global art system, where none of us is insulated from the flows of money and images. That may not be a satisfying conclusion, but at least it gives us the space to understand this wonderful city as it really is."

3335,Sarah Charlop-Powers is preparing to defend the Bronx against invaders.
3336,"Ms. Charlop-Powers, the executive director of a Manhattan-based nonprofit called the Natural Areas Conservancy, knows their names: Japanese knotweed and incised fumewort, among others."
3337,They are plants.
3338,"They are washing down the Bronx River “from people’s yards in Westchester or parkland in Westchester,” she said."
3339,"“The Bronx River only goes one way,” she added, “and it’s coming from them to us.”"
3340,"They are a threat because they crowd out plants native to the 2,041 acres of forests in the Bronx. Yes, the Bronx has that much wooded acreage."
3341,"Invasive trees can create a canopy of foliage, depriving other species of sunlight. On the ground, the knotweed and incised fumewort “are so prolific and can carpet an area,” Helen Forgione, the conservancy’s senior ecologist, said."
3342,"“That becomes a huge issue for the wildlife there, because of the loss of wildflowers.” she said. Bees especially wouldn’t thrive on the “worthless green matter.”"
3343,"The conservancy, working with several groups in the Bronx, plans to collect data on native plants and the soil, then coordinate with other groups to eliminate the invaders."
3344,"“It doesn’t make sense if the Botanical Garden is removing an invasive and just a few feet away in the Bronx Zoo, it’s not being addressed,” Ms. Charlop-Powers said. “We’re looking to make sure we’re all working effectively together.”"
3345,"The effort is the latest step in managing the city’s forests. In 2017, the Prospect Park Alliance sent goats to Prospect Park in Brooklyn to do some weeding, which involved eating invasive species."
3346,"Last year, the conservancy worked with the alliance to plant trees on Lookout Hill in the park."
3347,"The conservancy is beginning a separate partnership for Manhattan’s Riverside Park, where Daniel Garodnick, the former City Council member who became chief executive of the Riverside Park Conservancy last year, is also worried about invasive species."
3348,"The offenders there — Norway maples, white mulberries and porcelain berries — do not arrive on water. “A human brings seed from somewhere else into their own garden,” Mr. Garodnick said, “and then a bird or the wind will move it elsewhere.”"
3349,"That can happen a lot, because Riverside Park is a rest stop for migratory birds."

3380,"In the mid-1980s, those walls were covered in graffiti. Colorful, funny and sometimes newsy. (Hey, Duel is back in town!) After awhile, adults had the walls painted dull yellow. That invited more graffiti. (Hey, Duel is back again!)"

3387,Dear Diary:
3388,I was on the subway platform at Times Square at rush hour. I was trying to slip through a tight corridor between a staircase and the tracks when a man in front of me stopped and stooped over.
3389,"“What’s he doing?” I wondered, frustrated at having to pause."
3390,I saw that he was reaching for a glove that couldn’t have been his: It was on the ground in front of him as he bent over.
3391,"I looked around, trying to figure out whom the glove belonged to and what the man was going do with it. I was intrigued, but mostly out of self-interest. If he started asking around about whose glove it was, I wouldn’t get as far down the platform as I wanted before my train arrived."
3392,"A man who looked like a construction worker started walking our way. The first man tossed the glove in his direction, like you would with a pal. The construction worker caught it, smiled, winked, turned around and walked away."

3397,"Good morning,"
3398,"We’re covering Democrats’ new health care proposal, prosecutors’ decision to drop charges against Jussie Smollett and today’s hearings in Congress on aviation safety."
3399,"Democrats on Tuesday introduced a measure to lower health insurance premiums, strengthen protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and ban the sale of “junk insurance.”"
3400,"The legislation came a day after the Trump administration moved to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act. The Justice Department had initially said that only parts of the health care law, including its protections for pre-existing conditions, should be struck down."
3401,Why it matters: Some 21 million people could lose health insurance if the Affordable Care Act is ruled unconstitutional. Here are more potential consequences.
3402,"In a startling reversal in a case that drew national attention, prosecutors in Chicago dropped all charges against the “Empire” actor, who was accused of staging a hate crime attack in January."
3403,"It was unclear what led prosecutors to Tuesday’s decision, which was sharply criticized by city officials. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called it “a whitewash of justice” and cited Mr. Smollett’s celebrity as a factor in the decision."
3404,"Background: Mr. Smollett, who is black, gay and vocal on social issues, had told the police that two men had attacked him, taunting him with homophobic and racial slurs. The men later said they had been paid by Mr. Smollett to concoct the attack, according to the police."
3405,"The end of the inquiry by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, made clear at least one thing: President Trump has successfully thrown out unwritten rules that have been in place since President Richard Nixon resigned, our chief White House correspondent writes in a news analysis."
3406,"The special counsel’s decision not to take a position on whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice means that future occupants of the White House could feel entitled to take similar actions, and it may be the Mueller report’s most enduring legacy."
3407,The reaction: No collusion. Let’s party. Mr. Trump’s aides emerged from their emotional bunkers in celebration of what they said was total vindication.
3408,"Congressional committees are holding hearings today to examine federal oversight of the aviation industry, offering lawmakers an opportunity to question Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao about the Boeing 737 Max. We’ll have live coverage starting around 10 a.m. Eastern. "
3409,"The hearings are likely to be the most public reckoning for Boeing since the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet earlier this month. The accident came five months after the crash of another 737 Max jet, in Indonesia, prompting serious concerns about the model’s safety. "
3410,"With deep ties in Washington and a lavish lobbying budget, Boeing would appear to be well prepared to deal with a public-relations crisis. But the company’s public comments have been relatively sparse. "
3411,"Closer look: Long before the grounding of the 737 Max, the Federal Aviation Administration faced scrutiny over its longtime practice of giving manufacturers the authority to help certify their own planes."
3412,"Chris Riley, above, grew up in the mining town of Clawson, Utah. His great-grandfather, grandfather and father all worked in the coal mines, but Mr. Riley founded a company that could hasten the fossil fuel’s decline."
3413,"These are portraits of seven people who found a different path from their families, working in industries like wind and solar power that now provide more jobs than mining and burning coal do."
3414,"National emergency vote: The House failed to override President Trump’s first veto, shifting the fight over his declaration on the southwestern border to the courts."
3415,"Purdue Pharma settlement: The maker of OxyContin and its owners, the Sackler family, agreed to pay the state of Oklahoma $270 million to avoid going to trial over the company’s role in the opioid addiction epidemic."
3416,Next steps for Brexit: Parliament is set to vote today on alternatives to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union. 
3417,"Indian missile test: Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced today that his country had shot down a satellite. If the test is confirmed, India would join China, Russia and the U.S. in having the ability to destroy targets in space."
3418,A shift in the Middle East: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued that President Trump’s recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights allowed a country to keep territory seized in war. That argument could pave the way for annexation of at least part of the occupied West Bank.
3419,"Sexual assault inquiry: Conor McGregor, the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s biggest star and one of the world’s highest-paid athletes, is under investigation in Ireland."
3420,"Measles outbreak: Rockland County, a suburb of New York City, declared a state of emergency and barred unvaccinated children from public places. "
3421,
3422,"Snapshot: Above, aid being delivered to a village near Beira, Mozambique, one of the areas hit hardest by Cyclone Idai. The United Nations says the storm created devastation on the level of the crises in war-torn South Sudan, Syria and Yemen."
3423,"52 Places traveler: In his latest dispatch, our columnist visits Columbus, Ohio, a city obsessed with its future; and Williamsburg, Va., a place dedicated to its past."
3424,"Late-night comedy: Stephen Colbert reacted to Jussie Smollett’s case: “Isn’t it a hopeful sign for America that regardless of your race or sexual orientation, all rich famous people get off easily?” "
3425,"What we’re reading: This report from Inkstone, a daily digest of China-focused stories. It describes a propaganda subway train dedicated to the political doctrine of Xi Jinping that The Times’s Asia editor, Philip Pan, calls “beyond Orwell.”"
3426,Cook: Ricotta gnocchi are easier to make than the potato version. 
3427,"Watch: Every spring, the Museum of Modern Art and the Film Society of Lincoln Center present the cinematic miscellany known as New Directors/New Films. Our chief film critics point out the highlights."
3428,"Listen: The movie “Us” turned the weed anthem “I Got 5 on It” into a creepy horror theme, 24 years after its original release by Luniz."
3429,Advice: Should you confront a houseguest who seems to be stealing stuff? 
3430,"Smarter Living: Procrastination is not the result of laziness or time mismanagement, but of avoiding negative feelings associated with the delayed task. We feel better in the moment, but worse in the long run. Useful tools to help you act: Forgive yourself, and try to connect to some good feeling about the task."
3431,And we look at how gardening can help hospital patients recover.
3432,“Boeing” is synonymous with airplanes — though maybe it should be spelled Böing.
3433,"William Boeing, the company’s founder, was the son of a German immigrant-turned-lumber tycoon, and seems to have inherited his father’s business acumen in addition to the Americanized version of their family name."
3434,"According to Mr. Boeing’s biography on the company’s website, he started flying as a hobby around 1915 and quickly believed that airplanes could make a worthwhile business."
3435,"“Convinced that there was a definite future in aviation, I became interested in the construction as well as the flying of aircraft,” he once told an interviewer."
3436,"That interest eventually led to the Boeing Airplane Company, which initially focused on military planes but has long been known for its commercial aircraft."
3437,"Mr. Boeing left his namesake company in 1934 to pursue work in other industries, including lumber, real estate, horse breeding and livestock farming, though he continued consulting for Boeing for the rest of his life."
3438,That’s it for this briefing. See you next time.

3446,[The effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey collapsed on Monday. Read the latest updates here.] 
3447,This week the New Jersey Legislature could pass the most progressive recreational marijuana bill in the country. Lawmakers were poised to vote on the issue as early as today.
3448,New York may not legalize marijuana anytime soon.
3449,"My colleagues Nick Corasaniti, who covers New Jersey, and Vivian Wang, who covers the New York Legislature, explained."
3450,What makes New Jersey’s marijuana bill so progressive?
3451,"Mr. Corasaniti: Mainly, two things: criminal records and access to the market."
3452,"• First, the bill would make it possible to expunge nonviolent criminal records for marijuana-related offenses (up to five pounds, one of the highest thresholds in the country)."
3453,"People with past convictions, or who are incarcerated or on parole, would be eligible for a clean slate, and they could request expungement online."
3454,"• Second, the state would require that at least 10 percent of licenses for marijuana businesses go to small companies. Those licenses would be geared toward low-income or high-crime cities, or ones that have had a lot of marijuana arrests."
3455,"Basically, places that have been hit hard by marijuana criminalization would reap some benefits of cannabis legalization."
3456,"New Jersey would be the 11th state to legalize marijuana, along with Washington, D.C. Wealthy, white investors have traditionally reaped the profits of the emerging industry."
3457,Where would people be free to consume marijuana?
3458,New Jersey’s bill would allow for “public consumption areas.”
3459,"People wouldn’t be able to consume marijuana outdoors in public spaces. There would be designated areas for use, mainly at marijuana dispensaries: buy the drug in one room, and use it in another."
3460,The bill would also allow casinos and hotels to have consumption areas.
3461,"Also, the bill would allow marijuana delivery."
3462, Where does New York stand on all this?
3463,Ms. Wang: Legalization felt like an inevitability when Governor Cuomo announced his support for it in December. But that was just three months ago; that’s not a lot of time to figure all this out.
3464,"Some counties, like on Long Island, said that if the state legalizes marijuana, they may opt out. It’s politically tricky."
3465,Then there’s the lobbying. Social justice groups don’t want well-funded medical marijuana groups rewarded. Medical marijuana companies have been lobbying lawmakers to make sure they’re not frozen out of the New York market.
3466,"And after the collapse of the Amazon deal for a campus in Queens, the relationship between Mr. Cuomo and his fellow Democrats who control the Legislature has gotten complicated. That makes negotiating this deal harder."
3467,"Mr. Corasaniti: New Jersey’s governor, Philip Murphy, has been working on this for over a year. Before that, a Democratic state senator was pushing a bill in March 2017."
3468,Why did New York get a later start on this?
3469,"Ms. Wang: Mr. Cuomo called marijuana a “gateway drug” in February 2017. By the end of 2018, he said it should be legalized."
3470,"In between, he was running for re-election and facing a primary challenge from the actress Cynthia Nixon. She supported legalization (and auctioned off a bong as a fund-raiser)."
3471,"At Stuyvesant High School, there are few black and Hispanic students. “It’s just wrong,” one student said."
3472,"A conspiracy theorist, the mob and a mystery motive: Anthony Comello is accused of slaying a reputed Gambino boss."
3473,A video showed a man   repeatedly kicking a 78-year-old woman on the subway. A 36-year-old from Yonkers has been arrested in the incident.
3474,Officers shot a half-naked man who set his car on fire after crashing into a police vehicle.
3475,"A 374,000-pound steel beam will play a vital supporting role at ground zero."
3476,He confessed to beating a jogger who died. Questions about race and policing led to a retrial.

3517,"OAKLAND, Calif. — On a bone-chilling day here with the winter rains pelting down, the architects Ronald Rael and Virginia San Fratello retreated to their cozy 3-D printed cabin in the backyard."
3518,"A wall of moist succulents on the facade was springing to luxuriant life, embedded in rosette-patterned tiles 3-D printed from chardonnay grape skins, sawdust and cement. Raindrops pitter-pattered across 3-D-fabricated ceramic shingles."
3519,"Inside, a translucent bioplastic wall with cloudlike swirls — yes, also 3-D printed — changed colors on demand as Mr. Rael, with a clicker, shifted the hues from pink to green to purple, bathing the interior in otherworldly light."
3520,"It was just another weekend for the couple, 3-D printing pioneers who have developed novel techniques for sustainable building, often using low-cost waste materials like mud, dirt, nutshells, coffee grounds, and other discards that are “essentially free,” Ms. San Fratello said. "
3521,"Along the way, they have made 3-D printing cheaper and more accessible, often relying on lightweight printers to fabricate architectural components that can be assembled into large structures. These include the “Cabin of Curiosities” prototype in their backyard. "
3522," Ms. San Fratello and Mr. Rael “create complex and fantastic forms that couldn’t happen any other way,” said Ellen Lupton, senior curator of contemporary design at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, which included their work last year in its show, “The Senses: Design Beyond Vision,” and acquired a “Furry Curry Casserole” 3-D printed from curry powder. “They have the hybrid brain of an architect, an alchemist and a pastry chef,” Ms. Lupton added. "
3523,"Their work has been included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, as well as the Cooper Hewitt."
3524,"Mr. Rael and Ms. San Fratello, 47, are evangelists for the 3-D cause: He is a professor of architecture and art practice at the University of California, Berkeley; she is an associate professor of design at San Jose State. Their studio, Rael San Fratello, produces elegant and slightly oddball designs inspired by ancient craft traditions, like coiled pottery. "
3525,"Though the forms are drawn from indigenous sources, the production of 3-D printed tiles and other components is anything but. Mr. Rael and Ms. San Fratello deploy a variety of printing methods, often using a process invented at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called “binder jetting” that consists of a liquid material being sprayed onto a thin layer of powder hundreds or thousands of times until a hardened object emerges. The two also invented a software application for a 3-D printer that extrudes wet clay, pushing it through a nozzle like a gigantic toothpaste tube."
3526,"A series of clay vessels called “Bad Ombrés” was produced by this extrusion method: the name alludes both to President Trump’s comment about Mexicans and a term for the gradual blending of one color into another. Like much of the pair’s work, the vessels marry artisanship and geekiness. The clay is built up layer by layer, producing striated patterns and surfaces resembling knitting, complete with knots and loops. Occasionally, the code will tell the printer to drop a stitch, which creates visual drama."
3527,"As they document in “Printing Architecture: Innovative Recipes for 3D Printing,” published last year, mud is dear to their hearts. Mr. Rael grew up in an adobe house built by his great-grandfather in a small Hispanic village in the San Luis Valley of Colorado. His youthful playgrounds were adobe dwellings in varying states of decay. “I was fascinated with the cactuses growing on roofs, the rays of light and dust,” he said."
3528,"They met in 1995 on their first day of architecture school at Columbia University, and traveled to Yemen to explore the ancient walled city of Shibam, a dense cluster of ancient mud-brick buildings often called “the city of skyscrapers in the desert.” "
3529,"Their design for a 3-D printed free-standing adobe structure is currently on view in the exhibition “New Cities, Future Ruins at the Border” at the Rubin Center for the Visual Arts at the University of Texas at El Paso (through April 6)."
3530,"It is also the product of an unusual cross-border collaboration. Accompanied by their 9-year-old son, Mattias, as well as ceramics students, architects, professors and community members, they lead clay scouting expeditions, shovels and buckets at the ready, pinpointing, say, a patch behind a Subway shop in Texas or a Juarez brick factory. For the project “Zoquetes Fronterizos” (Mud Frontiers) the students learned to shovel mud into 3-D printers, building circular adobe structures on a mesa overlooking Juarez. "
3531,"The border has been a recurring theme in their work. Mr. Rael wrote “Borderwall as Architecture: A Manifesto for the U.S.-Mexico Boundary” (2017) on alternatives to President Trump’s wall, most serious but some fanciful. They have created a poster, called “Reunite,” about family separations at the border, that has been turned into a billboard at Amsterdam Avenue and 110th Street in Manhattan by For Freedoms, an arts nonprofit. "
3532,"But it is the pair’s status as the Lewis and Clark of the digital frontier that has impressed the techno cognoscenti. “Instead of paying $600 for 30 pounds of standard materials that come with printers, we said ‘Hey, let’s use salt!’” Ms. San Fratello explained. Their spinoff company, Emerging Objects, has recently worked with 3D Potter on a new type of printer to develop low-cost housing using adobe."
3533,"“They refused to accept the proprietary materials being sold by 3-D printer companies,” said Joshua G. Stein, a professor at Woodbury University in Burbank and co-director of Data Clay, an online database dedicated to ceramics and emerging technologies. “They said, let’s just hack the ingredients and see what we can do.” "
3534,"The international roster of designers engaged in the 3-D process, known as “additive manufacturing,” is expanding. Among the most high-profile is Joris Laarman of the Netherlands, who started his own robotics company and whose swooping, technically complex metal furniture has fetched hundreds of thousands of dollars at auction. The DFAB House in Zurich, a collaboration between the Swiss National Center of Competence in Research and university professors, also pushes the digital building frontier. The architecture was robotically assembled and features a free-form 3-D printed “smart slab” ceiling that is half the weight of concrete."
3535,"Mr. Rael and Ms. San Fratello are committed to democratizing the process for their young acolytes and others, making the point that 3-D printing from “upcycled” materials otherwise destined for the trash heap, and forgoing the purchase of drywall and other construction supplies, is a more sustainable design approach. Ingredients like curry and coffee grounds not only lower the cost, they add a dash of poetry, retaining their aroma long after being transformed."
3536,"To spend time at Mr. Rael’s graduate “print FARM” — the Facility for Architecture, Research and Materials at the U.C. Berkeley College of Environmental Design, is to feel a bit like Lewis Carroll’s Alice as she took her first nibble on the mushroom. It is to encounter a gray “Seat Slug” printed from cement. A light-as-a-feather, star-shaped “Poof” from tires that were pulverized and freeze-dried. It is to wonder about strange-looking squiggles resembling black licorice shoelaces."
3537,"“That’s a failure,” Mr. Rael said of the bioplastic building material meant to turn snow into patterns on buildings."
3538,"Some of the most mesmerizing projects are the couple’s collaborations with scientists. These include ceramic units for seeding coral larvae, spearheaded by Secore, a conservation organization that restores coral reefs. Scuba divers have already placed these microhabitats —- which have little legs and look as if they might skitter across the sea bottom — in endangered reefs. The 3-D printing allows quick replication. "
3539,"Ms. San Fratello and Mr. Rael have also worked with conservationists on ceramic nesting modules for the stocky seabirds known as Cassin’s auklets, off the California coast. (The nests have to accommodate the weight of lolling sea lions, and a private compartment for adults away from their boisterous chicks.)"
3540,"At home, Ms. San Fratello and Mr. Rael keep a 3-D printer on the dining room table and use it to produce the occasional Captain Underpants figurine for Mattias. Their devotion to the 3-D process, they say, is the connection it provides between the designer and the machine, a relationship lost with mass production. Their mission is to create objects and structures that are beautiful — and resolutely human."
3541,"“There is a culture embedded in the materials that surround us,” Mr. Rael observed. “We’ve lost the intimacy with materials, their tactility. How can you be intimate with foam?”"

3550,"Life for New Yorkers is likely to change in ways big and small thanks to the state’s $175 billion budget, which the Legislature and Governor Cuomo agreed to early Sunday."
3551,"In addition to fiscal policies, a raft of nonmonetary policies were inserted into the budget, usually as bargaining chips to win the support of reluctant lawmakers. Albany’s veterans refer to the hefty deal as “the big ugly.”"
3552,"[After weeks of intraparty bickering, lawmakers made a deal on the state budget.]"
3553,"One topic left out of the budget? Marijuana. Mr. Cuomo had vowed to legalize the drug, but stakeholders were unable to reach an agreement before today’s budget deadline. A similar deal collapsed in New Jersey."
3554,Here’s what else you need to know about New York’s budget:
3555,Plastic bags from stores will be banned.
3556,"Starting next March, the state will ban most stores from giving customers single-use plastic bags."
3557,Supporters say the law will help the environment. Counties can also add a 5-cent fee on paper bags to further encourage people to carry reusable bags.
3558,"Exemptions will exist for takeout food, deli meat and newspapers. Garment bags and trash bags sold in bulk will also be exempt."
3559,Congestion pricing will take effect below 60th Street in Manhattan.
3560,"New York is poised to be the first American city to charge this type of toll. The fee is likely to be more than $10 for cars and about $25 for trucks, starting in 2021. The tolls are expected to raise billions of dollars for the subways and other regional transportation needs."
3561,Cars with E-ZPass technology will be charged automatically for entering the zone. Drivers without E-ZPass will be sent a bill.
3562,Cash bail will be eliminated for most misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes.
3563,Critics have said that requiring people charged with crimes to pay cash to avoid incarceration while awaiting trial is tantamount to locking up innocent people because they are poor.
3564,The state also plans to give defendants speedier access to evidence that prosecutors may use against them in court.
3565,Buyers of some New York City homes will be hit with higher taxes.
3566,"Legislators initially wanted to tax owners of pieds-à-terre, luxury homes that are not primary residences. This fee would have been collected every year."
3567,"But after a push by the real estate industry, lawmakers replaced the idea with an increase to two one-time levies in New York City, the “mansion tax” for million-dollar homes and the transfer tax when it applies to multimillion-dollar homes."
3568,"The taxes would be charged when a home is sold. Combined, the tax rate would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of properties worth $25 million or more."
3569,"DNA from 360 black men was collected to solve the murder of a Queens jogger, defense lawyers said."
3570,Nurses strike in New York: The threat has increased over “safe staffing” levels.
3571," “Palestine does not exist,” a Jewish councilman said. Now he may be punished."
3572,Woodstock stage: This man says he has it.

3598,Dear Diary:
3599,"I lost my wallet in Midtown early one morning. At around 1 p.m. that day, I got a call from a man who said he had found it."
3600,"Although he didn’t speak English very well, he managed to tell me that he worked from 3 a.m. to noon delivering propane to coffee carts from Midtown to the financial district and that he hadn’t been able to call me until he got home to Queens. He apologized for opening my wallet to find my business card."
3601,"He told me he would leave the wallet at a coffee cart on 50th Street and Sixth Avenue, where I would be able to pick it up the next day any time after 3 a.m. I asked him to put it in a bag, so that it wasn’t obvious it was a wallet."
3602,"Despite everything I said, he wouldn’t let me send him anything to thank him. I asked his name several times, and he told me several times, but I couldn’t understand him. When I asked him to spell it, that didn’t work either. After we hung up, I received a simple text: just his first name."
3603,"At 5:45 a.m. the next day I got a text with a photo of the cart where he had left the wallet (there were two carts on the block, and he didn’t want me to be confused). When I got there, my wallet was in a plastic bag, and inside the bag was a silver gift bag and a card with my name and his."
3604,"Before I could call him, he called me to ask if I had picked up my wallet. Again, he refused to agree to let me do anything for him. He said he was happy I had gotten my wallet back. That was more than enough for him."

3608,"O.K., let me just get to it. I think I broke up with my last girlfriend because she’s white. Actually, no, I definitely broke up with her because she’s white."
3609,"First, some history: When I was a child, watching my pops get ready to go out was something to behold. He would spend hours preparing his mask every morning for whatever crowd, person or community he faced. A fresh shave followed by a ton of cologne (he’s Dominican, and it’s important to him that people know he’s coming, and know he’s there), and then blow-drying his hair to get that perfect coif."
3610,"Even years later, my pops still took longer to get ready than my mother and sister combined, delicately taking a black Sharpie to any stray grays that might pop up in his goatee."
3611,I’d ask him: Why? What’s it all for?
3612,"My pops would explain that as a young man in the Dominican Republic, you had to work so hard perfecting yourself, preparing your mask, so that when a young European or American woman came through, she might choose you, as he would put it, might take you home with her, like that was your only way out. "
3613,"Later he made his way to New York City, where he met my mother, who is Colombian. He was married now and no longer had to be “chosen.” But habits ingrained in adolescence can be hard to break."
3614,"So early on I learned how important it was to be “chosen,” selected. Selected by whom became and remains my dilemma."
3615,"It’s been a year since I broke up with my girlfriend, and I haven’t told her the real reason. I talked around it, mumbling about how I was trying to figure out who I was or whatever. She didn’t understand. I’m not sure I do either. There was nothing wrong with her at all."
3616,"I don’t really know what my tipping point was. It just kind of happened. At 30, I woke up one day, took a deep breath, looked at her and thought, “I don’t think I can date white women anymore.”"
3617,"Maybe I wouldn’t have broken up with her if it hadn’t been for all the judgment coming my way. Over the years I have dated brown women and black women, but mostly white women. I hadn’t thought about why that was, but when some brown and black people in my community started giving me a hard time about dating white women, I sensed they’d be happier if I stopped."
3618,"I also got weird vibes from some white people, namely the parents of the women I was dating. Like the ones who — even after I’d been dating their daughter for six months — kept thinking I was from Puerto Rico. I’ve never even been to Puerto Rico."
3619,"Or the ones who said upon meeting me, “Oh, I love ‘Buena Vista Social Club.’”"
3620,"Yeah, for sure, that’s a great movie, but so is “Gladiator.”"
3621,"And the ones who asked me if I speak Mexican. Yes, that is absolutely a thing. So is the father who opened the door and said, “Sorry, it’s not taco night,” and then closed it in my face, only to open it again because he was “just joking.”"
3622,"I’ve been with people in grocery stores who point to the dulce de leche and say, “Look, Chris, that’s you.” Actually, I’m lactose intolerant."
3623,"But the real reason I think I can no longer date white women isn’t any of that. It’s because in today’s hashtag-woke society, there is mad pressure to be hashtag-woke. To be aware of the implications of whom you’re attracted to and why. Which means that in the eyes of others, the color of the women I date is a big deal. Like I’m the problem. Like I’m betraying my people if I date white women."
3624,But I was taught that we were all one people!
3625,"I see people watching me with a stink eye, noses turned up, as if they think black and brown people would somehow be better off if I dumped my white girlfriend. It’s a lot of pressure. Along with each watchful eye, the whispers of, “Pick a side, Chris, pick a side,” fill my already noisy mind."
3626,"I started reading James Baldwin, Ta-Nehisi Coates and other black and brown authors looking for guidance, a road map, help on what it means to be a brown man in the world. Like: Yes, our bodies have been colonized. Yes, I am a child of blackness. Yes, the black body has done more for society than it has gotten in return. Yes, society seems to want to embrace a lot of things associated with blackness without actually being black."
3627,"How did we get here? If everyone is so woke, why are things so terrible? Maybe everyone isn’t so woke. Anyway, what am I supposed to do? How do I love as a brown body in the world in a way that makes everybody happy? I fell for a white woman and she fell for me — simple as that — yet I feel as if I’m doing the wrong thing by dating her."
3628,Am I the problem or is everyone else? Do white women find me attractive or do they see me as some exotic idea they should find attractive? Do I find white women attractive or do I see them as some exotic idea I should find attractive? Do I even know whom I’m attracted to or why?
3629,"I have to think my preferences were at least somewhat shaped by the ubiquitous image of Latin men as “The Lover,” an image that’s been shoved down my throat. Not because of what or whom we love, but as a way out, a way of being seen and of being saved. Like my pops said, “Maybe they’ll choose you.”"
3630,"It’s a message amplified by movies and TV, from “Save the Last Dance” to “Master of None” and dozens of other narratives that all feature, in one way or another, a black or brown man being made better from being with a white woman."
3631,"Since I was a child, I’ve internalized the idea that the hand I hold determines my worth more than my own hands. That my power is only as valuable as the person by my side. A whole system is coded within me. Why wasn’t self-worth coded within me?"
3632,"Before I was born, my mother told my father she was pregnant at 3 a.m. on a New York City subway platform. She and my pops made a commitment to give us children everything they never had, to strive and achieve and provide for us, and in response to their aspiration, some in their world thought they were leaving their roots behind and trying to become something else. Those folks said to them, “You trying to be white now?”"
3633,"What does that mean — trying to be white? We’ve all heard it (maybe not all of us). I’ve said it. If we think about it, it’s really just a comment on power: “Chico, you trying to have power now?”"
3634,"Yes, yes I am."
3635,"In truth, colorism has always been a thing. An aspiration to “better the race” has always been a thing. My grandmother and other grandmothers and mothers would warn us: “Don’t date someone darker than you. Don’t date coarse hair, big lips and big noses.”"
3636,"I brought home a black girl in high school and my aunt angrily mumbled, “Oh, do you see him and that Negrita?”"
3637,"I should have spoken up. “Ay, yo, stop! I don’t care about your damn opinions about how dark people are and how kinky their hair is. You ever look at old family albums? You ever look at me? You ever look at yourself? We ain’t white. Not even close.”"
3638,"But I didn’t say anything. (“Pick a side, Chris, pick a side.”)"
3639,"So here I stand, trying to be woke, and not dating white women, and feeling kind of bad about that. Because I’m definitely dating, and thinking that the decision to no longer date white women might not be my own, that any decision to choose a side doesn’t help the whole hashtag-woke thing because how do we solve anything if we just separate and isolate? And also, I mean, a lot of white women are really cool."
3640,"Obviously white women are cool. All women are cool. Cool is such a simple word, not the word I want to be using right now. I don’t just mean cool. (I probably shouldn’t even be talking about dating or not dating white women. Ah, man, this isn’t going where I wanted it to — )"
3641,"Anyway, this is me yearning, praying, journaling, writing, dialoguing, putting up a one-man show, wishing, trying to pick a side, wondering how to choose myself and trying to wrap my head around this, hoping that I’m doing woke right, because something just doesn’t feel right."

3649,The special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s investigation into President Trump is over.
3650,Now it’s New York’s turn.
3651,"Federal and state prosecutors in New York are at the forefront of about a dozen investigations connected to Mr. Trump, which largely grew out of Mr. Mueller’s effort."
3652,Here’s a guide to the inquiries.
3653,Didn’t the Mueller report settle everything?
3654,"Hardly. Mr. Mueller investigated two main issues: whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, and whether the president obstructed that investigation."
3655,[Read the key Mueller findings.]
3656,"During that inquiry, evidence of other possible crimes came to light, so Mr. Mueller’s team referred cases to other offices for further investigation."
3657,How many investigations are there?
3658,"About a dozen, according to sources and court documents. Typically, investigations are done in secret, so there is no official count."
3659,"More than half appear to be in New York. Others are in Washington, Virginia and Los Angeles."
3660,Why are so many investigations in New York?
3661,"Mr. Trump worked in New York for years and ran his campaign from here. That puts the president, his associates and his company, the Trump Organization, in the jurisdiction of New York investigators."
3662,Who is investigating in New York?
3663,• On the federal level: the Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of New York.
3664,"• On the state level: the attorney general, the Manhattan district attorney, the Department of Financial Services and the Department of Taxation and Finance."
3665,What are they investigating?
3666,"A lot. Mr. Trump’s business, his campaign, his inauguration and his presidency."
3667,They are mostly following his money: where it went and how it was accounted for.
3668,"One set of inquiries relates to Mr. Trump’s campaign and other activities. Did his business arrange payments to women who claimed they had affairs with Mr. Trump, which may violate campaign finance rules?"
3669,Did Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee make false filings with the Federal Election Commission? Did the committee receive illegal donations? Did a top campaign and inaugural committee fund-raiser use his connections to the president to bolster his own businesses?
3670,"People who worked for Mr. Trump are also under scrutiny. Did Mr. Trump’s lawyers plan to offer a presidential pardon to a witness in exchange for keeping quiet? Can three companies that worked with Paul Manafort, the former presidential campaign chairman, be charged under the Foreign Agents Registration Act?"
3671,Earlier activities are also under investigation.
3672,Has Mr. Trump’s family charitable foundation violated tax laws? Did the Trump Organization inflate insurance claims several years ago? Have Mr. Trump and his family underpaid taxes on his father’s real estate empire over several decades?
3673,How serious is all this?
3674,"It varies. Some investigations are civil inquiries, and liability could lead to fines. Federal penalties could include prison time."
3675,The prevailing view at the federal Justice Department is that a sitting president cannot be indicted. The prosecutors in Manhattan could consider charging Mr. Trump after he leaves office.
3676,What’s next?
3677,Expect a lot of silence. This work can take time and is usually not done in public.
3678,What’s the takeaway?
3679,"“By handing off so many cases to other offices, Mr. Mueller ensured that his investigation would live on for months, if not years, with prosecutors in New York,” according to my colleague Ben Protess, who has been reporting on these investigations."
3680,"New York is poised to become the first city in the United States to introduce congestion pricing, putting new electronic tolls in place for drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan, The Times’s Jesse McKinley and Winnie Hu reported."
3681,"Details were not ironed out, but state leaders reached consensus that the plan was needed to help pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s subway system."

3708,"There is a long record of adults looking at young people with trepidation, Ms. Antell said. Essentially, she said, teenagers gathered, and adults figured they were up to no good and called the groups “gangs.”"
3709,"“Youth themselves during this period didn’t call themselves gangs most of the time,” she added. “They called themselves street clubs or cliques. Adults perceived what they were doing as purely antisocial or purely criminal.”"
3710,"[In 1958, The Times explained teenage gang expressions, such as “cool it” and ”diddley bop.”]"
3711,"The people at the center of this conversation may be young, but the laws governing them are not."
3712,"In 1933, for example, New York had juvenile delinquency laws that banned “extreme obscenities,” “running away from home” and “endangering the public morals of yourself or others,” Ms. Antell said."

3731,"A severe measles outbreak has been plaguing New York since October, with hundreds of confirmed cases both in the city and suburban Rockland County, prompting officials to spring into action."
3732,"New York City issued an emergency order in December, demanding that some schools prohibit students who were not vaccinated against measles from attending classes."
3733,"And in an extraordinary step, Rockland County on Tuesday barred unvaccinated children from public places for 30 days."
3734,"In 2018, New York and New Jersey accounted for more than half of the measles cases in the country. Nearly two decades ago, the United States had gone more than a year without any “continuous disease transmission.”"
3735,Here’s what you need to know about measles in New York today.
3736,Measles in New York City
3737,"There have been 214 confirmed cases of measles in Brooklyn and Queens since October, according to the city’s health department."
3738,"In Williamsburg, 161 cases have been confirmed; in Borough Park, there have been 47. The remaining cases have been in the Brooklyn neighborhoods of Midwood, Marine Park, Bensonhurst and Brighton Beach, and in Flushing, Queens."
3739,Measles in Rockland County
3740,"The county, which is north of New York City and has a population of more than 300,000, has had 155 confirmed cases since October, according to its Health Department."
3741,Are these cases linked?
3742,"The outbreak in both places has mostly affected ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities and is associated with travelers who brought back measles from Israel, where the disease is spreading."
3743,"Lower vaccination rates and anti-vaccination information are also contributing to the wave of cases, public officials say."
3744,What exactly is measles?
3745,"Measles is among the most contagious of the infectious diseases. It killed 110,000 people globally in 2017, mostly children younger than 5."
3746,"In some cases, measles can lead to pneumonia, permanent deafness and brain damage."
3747,What are the symptoms?
3748,People may show no symptoms up to two weeks after being infected.
3749,"At first, the signs of measles can appear benign — a moderate fever, cough, sore throat or runny nose. Later, a fever may reach 104 or 105 degrees, and the telltale red dots can appear on the skin."
3750,How is measles spread?
3751,"Measles is transmitted by droplets from an infected person’s nose or mouth. The virus can live in the airspace where the person has breathed, coughed or sneezed."
3752,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, someone who is not vaccinated “can catch measles just by being in a room where a person with measles has been, up to two hours after that person is gone.”"
3753,How safe and effective is the measles vaccine?
3754,The measles-mumps-rubella vaccine is extremely safe and effective. The vast majority of people who contract measles have not been vaccinated.
3755,It does not cause autism.
3756,"If I choose not to vaccinate my child, why should anyone else care?"
3757,An unvaccinated child can get the virus and spread it to those who can’t protect themselves. Infants and people with compromised immune systems cannot get vaccines.
3758,Why is this a problem now?
3759,"Vaccination rates are down worldwide. Public health officials are fighting back, repeatedly pointing out that medical and scientific evidence confirms that vaccines are safe. Still, dangerous misinformation is proliferating."
3760,"“This feels like a very real-world manifestation of what can happen when you’re in an echo chamber,” said The Times’s Michael Gold, who has reported on the recent outbreak."

3781,March Madness brackets aren’t just for basketball. They’re for pizza slices. The name of the year. And one-liners.
3782,"Emily Winter, a writer and comedian from Brooklyn, founded One-Liner Madness, a bracket-style single-elimination joke contest, six years ago, and she is hosting a version tonight in the borough. (She’s hosted more than a dozen of these shows across the country.)"
3783,Here’s how it works:
3784,"• Sixty-four comedians compete. Two are onstage at a time, and each tells a one-line joke."
3785,"• The audience laughs (or boos — this is Brooklyn, after all), and judges decide who advances to the next round."
3786,"The contest lasts about 90 minutes, and there are lots of jokes flying around — from the competitors, Ms. Winter and even the musician who performs between rounds."
3787,The sets are short. No context is needed.
3788,"“I’ve never thrown a bad one,” Ms. Winter said about the show, adding that it’s usually a hit, even if the one-liners aren’t."
3789,"“The people that don’t have the jokes get eliminated right away, and if there’s somebody you don’t like, they won’t be onstage that long.”"
3790,The show starts at 8 p.m. at the Bell House in Brooklyn. Tickets are $15.

3805,"When Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez questioned President Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, on Mr. Trump’s finances last week, we told you that the answers “laid a bread crumb trail for future investigations.”"
3806,Now someone has started picking up those crumbs.
3807,New York State regulators yesterday issued a sweeping demand for information from the Trump Organization’s longtime insurance broker.
3808,Here are the latest developments.
3809,Who is asking questions?
3810,"The state Department of Financial Services, which is part of Governor Cuomo’s administration. It regulates the insurance industry, as well as banking and other financial institutions."
3811,Who is being looked at? 
3812,"The Trump Organization’s insurance broker, Aon. It’s one of the largest insurance brokerage firms in the world."
3813,What are regulators doing? 
3814,"The Department of Financial Services sent a subpoena to Aon, demanding a range of materials about Aon’s business with Mr. Trump and the Trump Organization dating to 2009."
3815,[The subpoena was the first step in an investigation of insurance policies and claims involving Mr. Trump’s family business.]
3816,"The regulators are also looking at compensation for the current and former Aon employees who handled the Trump Organization account, including their incentives, bonus payments or commissions."
3817,"The subpoena contains no indication that the company or its employees engaged in misconduct, according to a person briefed on the matter, nor does it specify any possible wrongdoing that is the focus of the inquiry."
3818,Why are regulators looking at the Trump Organization’s insurance broker?
3819,"At a hearing in front of the House Oversight Committee on Feb. 27, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez asked Mr. Cohen whether the president ever inflated his assets to an insurance company. Mr. Cohen simply replied, “Yes.”"
3820,"The Trump Organization falls outside the Department of Financial Service’s purview, but Aon does not."
3821,Have questions about Mr. Trump’s finances been raised before?
3822,Yes. My colleagues found evidence that he underreported the value of his New York assets to lower his tax liabilities.
3823,And Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan is seeking information about people and businesses connected to the president.
3824,What can regulators do if they find something improper?
3825,"The Department of Financial Services does not conduct criminal investigations, but it can refer any possible illegal activity to prosecutors. It can also issue fines against the companies and individuals it regulates."
3826,Has something like this happened before?
3827,"In 2017, the department scrutinized the Trump Organization’s relationship with Deutsche Bank. The examination concluded without the agency taking any action against the bank."

3853,"“Some of the wackiest behaviors I’ve seen have definitely come from New Yorkers,” Ms. Rothenberg said. “If you don’t like someone, there’s this thought in New York that you’re never going to see them again.”"
3854,"Ms. Rothenberg is making sure their bad behavior is seen again and again. She has more than 70,000 Instagram followers."
3855,"“Men might behave in a way that is truly horrible and say some horrible things via text without realizing this can be documented, and shared,” she said."
3856,And there is so much to discuss.
3857,Here’s how it works:
3858,"Women take screenshots of messages they have traded with men and send them to Ms. Rothenberg. She picks one each week to feature, and talks to the sender and gets the back story."
3859,Ms. Rothenberg then creates an episode via Instagram stories.
3860,"No real names are used: All the women are called Jane, and all the men are John. No identifying details are revealed. At the end of each episode, Ms. Rothenberg adds an illustration representing the most poignant or funniest part of the exchange."
3861,The result is a mix of inspiration and entertainment.
3862,"“By posting examples from strong women, other women feel empowered,” she said."
3863,"One piece of advice for daters in New York: “The way a person texts can tell you a lot about them,” Ms. Rothenberg said. “I think the way that you text is a huge extension of who you are.”"

3865,Dear Diary:
3866,"Most Tuesdays, I pull into a spot on Riverside Drive at the corner of 116th Street just before noon. I sit there for a half-hour reading until alternate-side is finished, securing a space that lets me see my car from the vestibule of my apartment when I get upstairs."
3867,"On a recent Tuesday, I wasn’t able to pull onto the block until 12:15. There were no empty spaces left when I got there. I drove laps around the neighborhood until I found a spot 10 blocks away."
3868,"Later in the day, I was looking out the window and I saw an empty spot. By the time I got my sneakers on, it was gone. Taking a chance, I walked the 10 blocks to my car anyway. After doing more laps, I eventually found a spot on Riverside two blocks from my window."
3869,"Crossing the street toward home, a spot ahead of me opened up. It was not only in view of my apartment but would also allow me not to move my car for an extra day."
3870,A couple in a car nearby saw me turn back. They rolled down their window.
3871,"“You want that spot?” they said, pointing toward the space I had my sights on."
3872,"“Yes,” I said. “Do you?”"
3873,They shook their heads.
3874,"“Hurry, hurry,” they said before driving away."
3875,"I pulled out quickly, but when I got to the space, another car had already pulled in. Despondent, I started to pull away."
3876,The driver of the car that had pulled into the spot rolled down the window and waved. It was the same couple.
3877,"“Hurry,” they said before driving away."

3885,"When Amazon announced last month that it was canceling plans to build a major campus in Queens, the company did not directly blame any one person or group."
3886,But others have.
3887,"Governor Cuomo, who with Mayor de Blasio helped negotiate the deal largely in private, blamed the State Senate, where crucial leaders opposed the plan."
3888,"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who opposed the campus, blamed Amazon for seeking $3 billion in tax breaks and incentives that she said should have been spent elsewhere."
3889,"Now a poll is offering insight into how the public feels about the deal’s collapse. Over a third of New Yorkers point the finger at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, according to a Siena College Research Institute survey of 700 voters."
3890,"Here’s what else you need to know about the poll, which was released yesterday:"
3891,The deal was popular across the state: Two-thirds of voters said Amazon’s withdrawal was bad for New York.
3892,Sixty-three percent of Democrats and 56 percent of self-identified liberals said the cancellation was bad for New York.
3893,Sixty-four percent of New York City voters agreed with them.
3894,"Blame fell on Ms. Ocasio-Cortez: Thirty-eight percent of voters faulted the congresswoman for the deal’s demise, identifying her as a “villain.” “Local activists in Queens” were labeled villains by 34 percent of voters."
3895,"In the New York City suburbs, 50 percent of voters blamed Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. Upstate, the number was 40 percent; in the five boroughs, it was 29 percent."
3896,A spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez declined to comment on the poll results.
3897,What about the governor and mayor? Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio were each seen as a villain by fewer than 30 percent of voters.
3898,What about Amazon? The company was blamed by 26 percent of voters.
3899,The takeaways:
3900,• The progressive base that cheered Ms. Ocasio-Cortez as she railed against the deal was not representative of most voters.
3901,"“Those closest to a project don’t necessarily reflect the views of a wider audience,” said Steven Greenberg, a pollster with Siena College. (I asked Mr. Greenberg if by “closest” he meant physical proximity, and he replied, “Yes.”)"
3902,"• “Local activists in Queens” were blamed more often for the plan’s demise than the State Senate was. In the suburbs, 39 percent of voters labeled the activists as villains, but only 23 percent labeled the Senate as such."
3903,This matters in part because Democrats need to retain suburban seats to hold on to their Senate majority.
3904,The poll   was conducted March 10-14 and has a margin of error of 4.2 percentage points.
3905,President Trump’s crackdown on undocumented workers has unnerved immigrants and the farmers who rely on them.
3906,"Only 7 black students got into the most selective public high school in New York City, out of 895 spots."
3907,He spent seven years in prison after being convicted of two cellphone robberies. Then a court changed the rules.

3923,Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed in 1953 for being Soviet spies. It’s a case that some people are still debating and that others have never heard of.
3924,"And it’s “a New York story,” Richard H. Weisberg, a professor at Cardozo School of Law, said."
3925,"The couple were tried in the Southern District of New York and buried on Long Island. New Yorkers “had connections to the case — parents, uncles, aunts, grandparents,” Professor Weisberg said."
3926,"“It’s a story of how a couple that owns a ma-and-pa electronic fix-it store becomes swept up in the web of an investigation,” Professor Weisberg said. “And there are so many unresolved issues, even the guilt and innocence of both Julius and Ethel — who should be seen separately, really in a way — is unclear at the moment.”"
3927,"The case is more than 60 years old, but some at Cardozo say it shouldn’t be forgotten. Today at 4 p.m., the law school will screen a movie about the Rosenbergs called “Daniel,” which the executive producers have described as “inspired” by the case."
3928,"At 6:30 p.m., an actress in the film, Lindsay Crouse, will participate in a discussion with one of the Rosenbergs’ sons, Robert Meeropol. The discussion will be moderated by Professor Weisberg."
3929,Ms. Crouse said the case was long overdue for a re-examination.
3930,"“One of the reasons I think it’s important for students to know what went on in the Rosenberg case is that this country has almost shunned the case,” she said in an interview. “It’s very upsetting on many levels, and we need to look at it square in the face to learn its lessons.”"
3931,"Barbara Kolson, the co-director of the Fashion, Arts, Media and Entertainment Center at Cardozo, who helped organize the event, said the school’s students “did not know who the Rosenbergs were.”"
3932,"“They also did not know who Roy Cohn was,” she said, referring to one of the prosecutors who was instrumental in the convictions."

3949,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

3953,"Like many famous and wealthy New Yorkers, the city’s most celebrated museums often have lesser-known, more approachable relatives. These kindred spirits do not reside on Fifth Avenue, but they will usually welcome you without delays or demands for exorbitant fees."
3954,"Out of the way, offbeat or small — and sometimes all three — these institutions may offer a more detailed or focused view of a period or an unusual collection. Here are six to explore."
3955,I never expected to be asked to donate objects to a museum — especially not two 1978 paper bus transfers that I mentioned finding in an old jacket.
3956,"Dave Herman, however, specializes in collecting what others throw away: subway tokens, signs, building bricks, seltzer bottles, door stops. He also has city “wildlife” — a rat skeleton and a taxidermied pigeon. Such bits of urban history make up City Reliquary, which Mr. Herman founded in 2002 in his apartment window and which now occupies a Williamsburg, Brooklyn, storefront. It is as quirky as the New York it celebrates."
3957,"“It was inspired by my appreciation of what I refer to as unsung landmarks,” Mr. Herman explained, “these places that have historic significance but are often overlooked.”"
3958,"The museum, for instance, has reconstructed Petrella’s Point, a Chinatown newsstand named after its owner, Adam Petrella, now deceased, who used to decorate it with his artwork. It has also recently acquired the lobby directory of the St. Denis, an 1853 hotel turned into an office building, which developers plan to replace."
3959,"Mr. Herman has devoted his back room to “Making a Museum,” an unfolding exhibition about his operation. Its most striking object, lent by the author Sarah Murray, is a coffin in the shape of the Empire State Building that she commissioned from the Ghanaian artist Eric Kpakpo Adotey."
3960,"This is not a collection you would find at the New-York Historical Society. But, Mr. Herman said, “we are able to connect with people on a much more relatable level.”"
3961,"American taverns offer food, drink and company. More than 200 years ago, however, some also helped cook up a revolution."
3962,"Fraunces Tavern was one of them. Now a museum devoted to Revolutionary America, this 1719 building still has a thriving restaurant."
3963,"“Samuel Fraunces pioneered some of the first takeout in New York,” said Jacqueline Masseo, the museum’s director, referring to the tavern’s colonial proprietor. “And he became George Washington’s steward.”"
3964,"Washington memorabilia is scattered throughout the Lower Manhattan museum, including a lock of his hair, a fragment of a tooth and a shoe worn by Martha Washington that she gave away as a gift. Ms. Masseo compared that gesture to a rock star’s throwing drumsticks into an enthusiastic crowd. In America, the couple “were the first celebrities,” she said."
3965,"But the space that most evokes Washington is the Long Room, where he bade a tearful farewell to his officers on Dec. 4, 1783. (The museum re-enacts the event annually.) A new railing has been installed there with a button visitors can press to hear his speech."
3966,"The museum also honors less famous patriots, including women. Two paintings illustrate the exploits of Mary Ludwig Hayes, a.k.a. Molly Pitcher, who carried water for the troops at the Battle of Monmouth in 1778 and took over firing a cannon after she saw its gunner — her husband — fall. And one current exhibition, “Confidential: The American Revolution’s Agents of Espionage,” celebrates many ordinary people who spied for the cause."
3967,Some of them undoubtedly drank here.
3968,This is another building that famously enticed George Washington. And it also lured Lin-Manuel Miranda.
3969,"The mansion, Manhattan’s oldest, was built in 1765 by Roger Morris, a Tory who fled after the Revolution started. Because the residence offered panoramic city views, Washington briefly commandeered it as his military headquarters in 1776. An informal parlor, labeled Washington’s War Room, is done in 18th-century style. Most of the furnishings, however, reflect the French Empire tastes of a wealthy later occupant, the imperious Eliza Jumel (1775-1865), who married Aaron Burr in 1833."
3970,"“She was a force to be reckoned with,” said James W. Tottis, a consultant to the museum. But though she filed for divorce in less than a year, Morris-Jumel still has a room with a desk and other pieces of Burr’s. And that’s how Mr. Miranda, creator of “Hamilton,” enters the story."
3971,"“He sat in that chair and wrote at least two of the songs,” said Mr. Tottis, pointing to an unassuming reproduction piece with a striped slipcover. Mr. Miranda even tweeted a photo of himself sitting in the chair."
3972,"Famous associations, though, are not the only way the Morris-Jumel draws visitors. It offers tours, family days, plays and art shows and, at least once a month, paranormal investigations."
3973,"“There is some thought that Eliza is here,” Mr. Tottis said. And Burr? He laughed. “We don’t think that Eliza would let him come back.”"
3974,It even has a raven.
3975,"Unfortunately, the bird is not alive — stuffed, it occupies a glass cabinet — but it does add atmosphere to this tiny early 19th-century dwelling, which Poe rented during his final years. Perched on a small swath of greenery (Poe Park) in the Bronx, it looks as if it had dropped from the sky like Dorothy’s Kansas farmhouse."
3976,"“It gives us a glimpse of where the common person lived,” said Vivian E. Davis, the museum’s education coordinator. Not that Poe was common, but he was poor. “It’s good for people to see the human side of him,” she added. “He was trying to make a living like everyone else.”"
3977,"Poe moved to this formerly rural spot in 1846 with his young wife, Virginia; his mother-in-law, Maria Clemm; and their cat, Catterina. Poe hoped the country air would cure his wife’s tuberculosis, but she survived only six more months. A small first-floor chamber has the bed where she died. That macabre furnishing, a framed mirror and a rocking chair are the museum’s only pieces that actually belonged to Poe, Ms. Davis said, but memorabilia on the walls reveals his life, as do an audio tour and a video. The works he wrote here include “Annabel Lee” and “The Bells” (but not “The Raven”)."
3978,"The place is eerie but “not haunted,” Ms. Davis said. Still, while upstairs, I felt the presence of someone behind me. It was Poe, all right — in the form of a life-size cutout."
3979,I recently got acquainted with several friendly city residents I wouldn’t have anticipated encountering off a Queens parkway: eight goats and two alpacas.
3980,"Along with six sheep, two steers, 150 hens and 14 hives’ worth of honeybees (two visiting pigs are soon to arrive), they live at the Queens County Farm Museum, which, though far from small — 47 acres — is certainly extraordinary."
3981,"It is “the longest continually farmed site in New York State,” said Jennifer Walden Weprin, the museum’s executive director. “Your assumption would be that it’s somewhere else, not in New York City.”"
3982,"The property, which dates to 1697, has a historic 1772 farmhouse and a detached 1797 summer kitchen. (Other buildings are from later years.) A sustainable working farm, the site sells its eggs, produce, honey and wool on the premises while also serving as an educational campus. Young visitors can feed animals, harvest in a children’s garden, learn about composting and practice science and math skills. And gain a little insight: “Peas are awful good when they’re freshly picked,” Ms. Walden Weprin said."
3983,"She plans to expand that teaching mission by turning the Summer Kitchen into a reading room — a cozy refuge in winter — and is raising funds for a $25 million education center. In the meantime, the museum offers spring hayrides and festivals, an Earth Day program and a chance to really lose yourself here in the fall: It builds a very popular corn maze."
3984,"The most resonant and wrenching object here is a bill of sale. Yellowed with age, it is no ordinary retail receipt."
3985,"“This is for a 13-year-old girl named Nan who was sold right here on Staten Island,” said Sylvia Moody D’Alessandro, executive director of the Sandy Ground Historical Society."
3986,"On the island’s southwest tip, Sandy Ground earned its name from its gritty, infertile soil. But the site is rich in African-American history. Some of the museum’s pieces, like that 1812 bill of sale, document slavery. But most commemorate the area’s triumphant past as one of the oldest continuously inhabited free black communities in the country, settled not long after New York State abolished slavery in 1827."
3987,"“We didn’t want this history, like so much of African-American history, to get lost,” said Mrs. D’Alessandro, herself a Sandy Ground descendant."
3988,"The society, established in 1979, maintains its museum in an unassuming house filled with African masks, exhibits on past community residents and “Binding Ancestry: The Heritage & Artistry of Handmade Quilts,” an exhibition to which Mrs. D’Alessandro and other local artists have contributed. The quilts’ motifs include the oyster industry (it drew many free black workers), family trees and the historic local 1850 Rossville A.M.E. Zion Church."
3989,"The other current show, “Faces of the Underground Railroad,” displays contemporary quilt squares portraying figures like Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman. Mrs. D’Alessandro encourages visiting schoolchildren to draw a historic face on a doorknob hanger to take home."
3990,"She said she tells them, “The person on your doorknob helped open the door for somebody else to get freedom.”"

3992,"Black lawmakers are blocking a push to legalize recreational marijuana in New York, warning that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s proposal could perpetuate the racial inequality fostered under current drug laws."
3993,"The lawmakers say that unless people of color are guaranteed a share of the potentially $3 billion industry, there may be no legalization this year. They want to be assured that some of that money will go toward job training programs, and that minority entrepreneurs will receive licenses to cultivate or sell the marijuana."
3994,"Ten states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana, and as lawmakers elsewhere consider their own laws, they seem intent on not repeating what they see as other states’ mistakes."
3995,"They say one misstep, in particular, stands out: None of the 10 states or Washington ensured that minority communities would share in any economic windfall of legalization — missing out on an opportunity to redress years of having a disproportionate number of African-Americans arrested on marijuana charges."
3996,"In New York, the question of economic return for those communities has emerged as a defining issue."
3997,"“I haven’t seen anyone do it correctly,” Assemblywoman Crystal Peoples-Stokes, the first black woman to serve as Assembly majority leader, said of legalization."
3998,"“They thought we were going to trust that at the end of the day, these communities would be invested in. But that’s not something I want to trust,” she continued. “If it’s not required in the statute, then it won’t happen.”"
3999,"Critics say marijuana legalization has fostered an inequitable system in which wealthy, white investors often reap the profits of the fledgling industry."
4000,"In Colorado, black entrepreneurs said they were banned from winning licenses because of marijuana-related convictions. Black people make up just a handful of the thousands of cultivation or dispensary license holders there, and continue to be arrested on marijuana-related charges at almost three times the rate of white people."
4001,"In California, several cities introduced equity programs retroactively. Oakland now requires at least half of licenses to go to people with a cannabis-related conviction and who fell below an income threshold."
4002,"The black New York lawmakers include some of marijuana legalization’s most vocal supporters, but they want to make their state the first to tie legalization directly to an economic equity program. And that has meant seeking changes to Mr. Cuomo’s proposal, which though it provides for a “social and economic equity plan,” does not specify how much weight would be given to minority license applicants, or how much money would be invested in communities ravaged by the war on drugs."
4003,"Alphonso David, the governor’s counsel, said that those provisions would be written in regulation after legalization was passed. “Some people are looking for a level of detail that may not be appropriate for legislation, and we have to be careful how we implement the legislation so we don’t have to change it every few years,” he said."
4004,But opponents say those omissions undercut Mr. Cuomo’s efforts to frame legalization as a way to right the wrongs that decades of criminalization had wrought on communities. He called for sealing some drug-related records and funding substance abuse treatment.
4005,"Even as Mr. Cuomo has pressed for speed, urging the Legislature to include legalization in the state budget in April, crucial lawmakers have shown little interest in rushing his proposal through."
4006,"“It’s not going to go the way it looks now,” said Ms. Peoples-Stokes, a Democrat who represents a district that includes Buffalo. She has introduced her own bill, which directs half of all marijuana revenue to a community fund supporting job training, and prioritizes licenses for people from communities most affected by criminalization."
4007,"Mr. Cuomo seemed to acknowledge as much on Monday, telling reporters that he was “no longer confident” that marijuana would be in the budget."
4008,"The debate in New York is unfurling as at least three Democratic presidential candidates — Senators Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and Julian Castro — have said they support reparations for African-Americans. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez recently called for “affirmative action” licensing for entrepreneurs of color in the marijuana industry."
4009,"Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, another presidential candidate, has introduced a bill to legalize marijuana nationwide. Co-sponsored by four other Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, it includes provisions for job investment in minority communities."
4010,"In New Jersey, where the Legislature is also weighing legalization, a coalition of black pastors, the N.A.A.C.P. and advocates is also pushing for legalization only if tied to community reinvestment. After lawmakers in November moved the bill through a committee, the state’s chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union called adding language about education and job training a top priority."
4011,"Of particular concern in New York has been the influence of wealthy medical marijuana corporations, which are overwhelmingly led by white people and may be well positioned to capitalize on the recreational industry."
4012,"That concern has made itself so clear that the New York Medical Cannabis Industry Association, worried that legislators might seek to shut them out of the new industry, sent a letter to Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders on Monday promising to set up a $25 million “Cannabis Economic Opportunity Fund” to provide zero-interest loans to companies led by women and people of color. (The association recently asked the company MedMen to resign from the group amid allegations of racism among top executives.)"
4013,"The medical companies have sought to shape the bill in other ways, too: Their executives and people tied to them have donated more than $600,000 to Mr. Cuomo’s campaign account."
4014,"The governor’s bill also would require applicants to already have the land, buildings and equipment needed for their businesses, which would effectively exclude many black people because of historical disparities in capital, said Kassandra Frederique, New York State director at the Drug Policy Alliance, a nonprofit group. Ms. Frederique’s group is pushing for the bill to include zero-interest loans and provisional licenses."
4015,"Mr. David said the state’s regulations after legalization could include zero-interest loans for minority entrepreneurs, funded by payments from companies seeking licenses."
4016,"Other interests are already clamoring for a share of the hypothetical tax revenue as well, which has been projected to reach as much as $677 million a year. Last month, Mr. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan to divert at least some of the money to New York City’s subway system."
4017,But legislative leaders suggested that revenue might not materialize without a robust economic equity plan.
4018,"“I was very clear with the governor and the mayor that the marijuana revenue, if we get there,” should go first to “community investment,” the Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, said."
4019,"A bill that includes only criminal justice changes, at the expense of economic ones, would not meet that standard, advocates said."
4020,"“Some people exploit the social justice piece of legalization,” said Bertha Lewis, president of the Black Institute and a chief strategist for We Rise to Legalize, a coalition of advocacy groups."
4021,“You can’t talk to me about justice and not talk to me about economics. They are inextricably joined.”
4022,"Throughout New York City, communities are trying to ensure that they see some benefit from legalization, regardless of what happens in Albany."
4023,"The City Council’s Progressive Caucus and the Black Latino and Asian Caucus recently introduced laws and resolutions calling for the city to have local control over home delivery and cultivation of marijuana, potentially allowing smaller businesses to share in the sales."
4024,"“Not arresting people is not good enough,” Donovan Richards, a city councilman from Queens, said. “Economic justice must be served.”"
4025,"For some marijuana skeptics, “economic justice” has become the selling point, and also the sticking point. The Rev. Anthony Trufant, pastor of the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Brooklyn, held a conference with the group Women Grow at his church last month that was aimed at improving diversity in the cannabis industry."
4026,"Among its speakers was Representative Hakeem Jeffries, who said in an interview that a “growing emphasis on the economic aspect of marijuana legalization” had replaced an “overemphasis on social justice.”"
4027,Mr. Trufant said the economic argument had helped ease his initial hesitation about legalization.
4028,"“There are opportunities for investment,” he said. “There are opportunities for employment.”"
4029,"If reinvestment initiatives are not put in place alongside legalization, the underground market is likely to remain, said Dasheeda Dawson, the chief executive of MJM Strategy, a cannabis consulting and marketing firm."
4030,"“The industry right now reads as very white,” Ms. Dawson said. “If I’m in the hood and I’m hooking up my man with revenue by purchasing from him, I’m going to continue to buy black.”"
4031,"Still, the economic argument has not won over all the skeptics."
4032,The Rev. Johnnie Green Jr. of Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem said black politicians and activists were “fooling themselves” if they thought licenses to sell marijuana would go to the black community.
4033,"“The licenses will go disproportionately to Caucasians. It’s already been proven in every city where there’s legalization of pot,” he said. “I just wish they would stop acting like this is a win-win for the black community.”"
4034,"The Rev. Reginald Lee Bachus of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem said he would push to ensure that legalization, if successful, would create funding for black communities, but would not push for legalization itself because the issue had divided his congregation."
4035,"“I lose a segment of my support if I come down on one side or the other,” Mr. Bachus said, “but I have 100 percent support if I talk about the tax revenue.”"

4037,"Good morning,"
4038,"We start today with a new report about Jared Kushner’s security clearance, the aftermath of the failed U.S.-North Korea talks, and details of a peace plan in Afghanistan."
4039,"Mr. Trump overruled concerns from intelligence officials last year and ordered his chief of staff to give top-secret security clearance to Mr. Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, according to four people briefed on the matter."
4040,"John Kelly, then the White House chief of staff, wrote an internal memo saying he had been “ordered” to grant the clearance. The top White House lawyer at the time, Donald McGahn, also wrote a memo outlining his reservations. "
4041,The president told The Times in January that he had taken no role in Mr. Kushner’s receiving his clearance. 
4042,"Background: Mr. Kushner’s initial background check took more than a year. Officials had raised questions about his ties to overseas governments and investors, and about his initially unreported contacts with foreigners."
4043,"Response: A spokesman for Mr. Kushner’s lawyer said on Thursday: “In 2018, White House and security clearance officials affirmed that Mr. Kushner’s security clearance was handled in the regular process with no pressure from anyone. That was conveyed to the media at the time, and new stories, if accurate, do not change what was affirmed at the time.”"
4044,"The two sides traded blame on Thursday after the second summit meeting between President Trump and North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, collapsed with no deal."
4045,"Mr. Trump said Mr. Kim was unwilling to dismantle enough of his nuclear weapons program to warrant lifting sanctions, an assertion the North later disputed."
4046,"News analysis: Mr. Trump negotiated directly with North Korea, an approach his predecessors avoided. The risk of doing so is that if you fail, there are few places to go, our national security correspondent writes."
4047,What’s next? History suggests that the North Koreans may try to pressure Mr. Trump by escalating. The North has the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal.
4048,The Daily: Today’s episode investigates why the meeting fell apart.
4049,All American troops would withdraw from the country within the next five years under a new Pentagon proposal being discussed in peace talks with the Taliban.
4050,"The plan would transfer responsibility for training the Afghan military to international troops, and largely shift American operations to counterterrorism strikes. It has been met with broad acceptance in Washington and among NATO officials."
4051,"Negotiations with the Taliban to end the war, now in its 18th year, resume on Saturday."
4052,How we know: Parts of the plan were shared with The Times by more than a half-dozen current and former American and European officials. 
4053,"The party’s leaders emphasized on Thursday that they intend to pursue multiple investigations of President Trump’s actions rather than an effort to impeach him, after this week’s testimony by Michael Cohen. That position puts the leadership at odds with some rank-and-file Democrats and liberal activists."
4054,"Another angle: It’s unclear whether Mr. Cohen’s testimony about Mr. Trump’s potentially criminal conduct will shift opinion on either the left or the right. But he did implicate Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s longtime chief financial officer, who may now face further scrutiny. "
4055,"“Leaving Neverland,” which appears on HBO starting Sunday, is a four-hour movie about the musician’s alleged pedophilia, focused on the stories of two men who say they were his victims as children."
4056,"Our critic at large, Wesley Morris, writes about wrestling with his fandom as the agonizing stories unfold. "
4057,India-Pakistan tensions: Pakistan released an Indian pilot today who was shot down during this week’s escalating tensions between the two countries.
4058,"The 2020 election: Jay Inslee, the governor of Washington who has made climate change and the environment his signature issues, joined the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates today."
4059,"Indictment near for Netanyahu: Israel’s attorney general has announced a plan to indict Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust."
4060,"An appeal to Amazon: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been working behind the scenes to persuade the company to resurrect its plans to open a campus in New York City, including a personal pitch to Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder."
4061,"Departure at HBO: The cable network’s chief executive, Richard Plepler, is leaving after 27 years there. He is said to have felt that he had less autonomy since AT&T acquired HBO’s owner, Time Warner, last year."
4062,"Snapshot: Above, Edda, a pug that officials seized from a family in Germany and then sold on eBay for 750 euros, roughly $850, to cover an unpaid tax bill. On Thursday, a spokesman for the city of Ahlen called it “a pragmatic solution” to an outstanding debt, but the case has prompted outrage from animal rights activists and others."
4063,"In memoriam: André Previn, an Oscar- and Grammy-winning composer, conductor and pianist, blurred the boundaries between jazz, pop and classical music. He died on Thursday at 89."
4064,"Phone review: Samsung’s new Galaxy S10 Plus is an excellent (albeit $1,000) device with an innovative wide-angle camera. But it lags Apple in biometrics, our technology columnist writes."
4065,"Record baseball contract: Bryce Harper has reached a free-agent deal with the Philadelphia Phillies for 13 years and $330 million, the most ever guaranteed to a baseball player."
4066,News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.
4067,Late-night comedy: Jimmy Kimmel assessed President Trump’s summit meeting in Vietnam: “He flew over there and got nothing — like the Fyre Festival.” 
4068,"What we’re reading: Chris, your Morning Briefing writer, recommends this Pulitzer Prize-winning piece from 2007 in The Washington Post. “The violinist Joshua Bell performed a recital in London this week that I was lucky enough to attend. Twelve years ago, The Post (my employer at the time) conducted an experiment in which he played in a Washington subway station during the morning rush hour. Virtually no one stopped to listen.”"
4069,Cook: Cauliflower gets the Philippine adobo treatment in this vegetarian dish.
4070,"Watch: “Free Solo,” the Oscar-winning documentary about the rock climber Alex Honnold, is among our small-screen recommendations for the weekend."
4071,"Go: When in Venice, join the locals for cicchetti, the Italian version of tapas."
4072,"Read: Clive Thompson, a longtime tech writer, brings an anthropologist’s eye to the world of programming in “Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World.” It’s one of 12 books to watch for in March."
4073,"Smarter Living: When you’re cleaning out your closet, try finding a new life for your unwanted clothes, whether by selling, donating or recycling them. In 2015 Americans sent 10.5 million tons of textiles to the dump and just 2.5 million tons to be recycled."
4074,We also have ideas on how to keep fresh on long days of travel.
4075,"Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss, was born 115 years ago on Saturday."
4076,He had a unique take on the English language. His inventive use of rhythm and rhyme is at once ridiculous and intoxicating to children and parents alike.
4077,"His titles have sold a staggering 650 million copies in more than 45 languages — including Latin, Hebrew and Catalan — and are available in 110 countries."
4078,This global expansion came with a tricky obstacle: how to translate him.
4079,"“The challenge is staying true to the original books while being sensitive to the local market,” says Susan Brandt, the president of Dr. Seuss Enterprises. “And not lose the magic.”"
4080,"The solution? Hire local poets to work with translators. That’s how “Snuvs” from “Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!” became “Lhufas” in Portuguese, and “Hakken-Kraks’” from “Oh, the Places You’ll Go!” became “Scracchi Stridenti” in Italian."
4081,"And as for Sam I Am? In Spanish, he’s Juan Ramón, and he’s obsessed with huevos verdes con jamón."
4082,"The last time an American spacecraft carried astronauts into orbit was in 2011. On Saturday, SpaceX and NASA will test a replacement for the space shuttle."
4083,That’s it for this briefing. See you next time.

4085,"Thank youTo Mark Josephson, Eleanor Stanford, John Dorman and James K. Williamson for the break from the news. Karen Thorne, a content strategist, wrote today’s Back Story. You can reach the team at briefing@nytimes.com."

4087,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
4088,"Los Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than 12 miles an hour. In San Francisco, car speeds have fallen to 10 miles per hour. And Seattle’s streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogether."
4089,"Major cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them. But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan, the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy — even though it was once considered politically toxic, according to municipal officials and transportation analysts."
4090,"“New York’s use of congestion pricing could be a game-changer,” said Travis Brouwer, an assistant transportation director in Oregon, which has considered congestion pricing for traffic-jammed Portland."
4091,"“If New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance, it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricing.”"
4092,"New York, the country’s largest city, will charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars. The tolls are expected to start in 2021."
4093,"Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time, closely watching New York’s move, “to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability and mobility,” said Kelly Cofrancisco, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney."
4094,"Los Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing, and Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in 2021."
4095,"“It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say ‘They’re doing this and it’s working,’” said Michael Manville, an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California, Los Angeles, who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing. “At the very least, it changes the conversation in other cities.”"
4096,"Not everyone is ready to sign up. Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit, where “driving isn’t a choice, it’s a necessity.”"
4097,"A handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place; it has helped clear roads in London, Stockholm and Singapore. But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poor."
4098,"Fueled by an economic boom, a revival of urban areas, a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon, the average speed in urban downtowns fell to 15 miles per hour last year, down from 18 miles per hour in 2015, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics company."
4099,"“I believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities,” said Phil Washington, the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “Here in Los Angeles, our congestion challenges are just as bad, if not worse, than Manhattan’s.”"
4100,"He added, “We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worse.”"
4101,"In New York, many details of a congestion pricing plan — including how much drivers will be charged — are still being worked out. The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started 18 months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business, civic and labor leaders, who saw no other way to tackle gridlock."
4102,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward, making it a centerpiece of the $175 billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled. Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor, threw his support behind it. They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the city’s crumbling subway system."
4103,"And city transit officials, facing a growing financial crisis, warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increases."
4104,"Congestion pricing’s moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country. Historically, cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones — only to find that those, too, became jammed, said Matthew Turner, an economics professor at Brown University."
4105,"As a result, America’s roads are carrying more traffic than ever. The number of people driving to work climbed to about 130 million in 2017, up from 121 million in 2012, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Of those, more than 116 million drove alone, and only 14 million car-pooled. Just 8 million workers took public transportation."
4106,"The increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health, safety and environmental implications. The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high."
4107,"Traffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities: The boom leads to an influx of new residents, businesses and construction. More than two dozen major American cities, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, have more congestion now than a decade ago, according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIX."
4108,"The most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of 97 hours last year, up from 82 hours in 2015. That, in turn, cost the economy roughly $87 billion in lost productivity last year, up from $74 billion in 2015, according to INRIX."
4109,"“It only takes one car that doesn’t get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic,” said Trevor Reed, an INRIX transportation analyst."
4110,"In Seattle, Amazon’s relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub. Now, major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlock."
4111,"“As we build a city of the future, we must reduce our reliance on cars,” Ms. Durkan said. “My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars, a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollution.”"
4112,"Road pricing has been used on some American highways since the 1990s, with tolled express lanes — or so-called Lexus lanes — built alongside regular lanes, offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for it."
4113,"Cities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets. “There’s a critical mass forming where people are saying, ‘enough is enough,’” said Stuart Cohen, the founding director of TransForm, a California-based group that released a recent report on congestion pricing. “They’ve tried everything else and nothing’s working.”"
4114,"Still, Charles Komanoff, a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan, said the idea of “putting a price on driving” clashes with America’s car-loving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom. He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to “shooting a rocket to the moon.” “There’s so much gravity — the forces opposing this are so powerful — it almost seems like defying nature,” he said."
4115,"Oregon looked at congestion pricing in 2005, but “our traffic wasn’t that bad, so people weren’t willing to pay a toll to escape it,” Mr. Brouwer said. But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices. State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the state’s first highway tolls on a seven-mile stretch through Portland."
4116,"Congestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs, and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transit."
4117,"“Social equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing,” Mr. Cohen said. “In West Coast cities, equity is very high on the political agenda.”"
4118,"But Mr. Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on. Congestion fees, he added, can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished drivers."
4119,"In Los Angeles, public buses traveled at an average of 11.8 miles per hour last year, down from 12.2 miles per hour in 2013, according to transit data. Mr. Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride free."
4120,A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing “because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of life.”
4121,"Still, congestion pricing remains a tough sell. After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging $5 to drive in some neighborhoods, Boston’s mayor’s office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricing."
4122,"In New York, drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below 60th Street, where the average speed for vehicles is down to 4.7 miles per hour, from 6.9 miles per hour in 1994."
4123,"John Corlett, a lobbyist for AAA in New York, said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls. “To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope,” he said."
4124,"But Sam Schwartz, an architect of the city’s congestion pricing plan, said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New York’s progress. “If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere,” he said."
4125,"San Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown, including expanded bus and rail service, installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes, said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which is leading the city’s congestion pricing effort."
4126,"“Everyone agrees there’s a problem,” Ms. Chang said. “There are multiple views of the solution. But frankly, we’ve tried a lot of them and they’re not enough.”"
4127,The plan was simple: Take the train to the ski slopes. 
4128,"Why? Trains are romantic. Trains are relatively climate-friendly. And I had recently spent an hour and a half on a perfect powder day sitting in traffic, trying to drive up Little Cottonwood Canyon to Snowbird, near Salt Lake City."
4129,So I decided to swear off car travel for a weekend of skiing and snowboarding via the rails. 
4130,"Two developments in Denver made the scheme possible: In 2016 the city opened the A line train, which runs from Denver International Airport to Union Station, an exquisitely restored Beaux-Arts terminal and the city’s main transit hub, in 37 minutes. "
4131,"The following year, Amtrak launched its service on the Winter Park Express, a snow-season train that leaves Union Station each weekend and delivers passengers to the base of the Winter Park Resort, a burly, 3,000-acre ski mountain about 70 miles outside Denver. "
4132,"Getting to the mountain, and the other resorts west of Denver by car is increasingly an issue. On a snowy weekend, traffic on I-70, the main route to the mountains, can turn an hour-and-a-half drive to Winter Park into a four-hour ordeal. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of the Winter Park Express’s trips sell out, with 400 passengers choosing to ride the rails each trip. "
4133,"Or, as 8-year-old Sophia Sprinkle, who rode the train on a recent weekend with her mother and her mother’s boyfriend, said, “I like it a lot because it goes really fast.” "
4134,"It was admittedly a harebrained exercise. I had to fly to Denver and back, and spend a night in a hotel there at either end of the ski weekend, making for an expensive two days on the slopes. But I decided to consider it as research for a possible longer trip. "
4135,"The journey began on a Friday afternoon in New York City, which lacks what travel planners call a “one-seat ride” to the airport. I slalomed down the subways stairs with my skis and gear as commuters streamed up, then rode a urine-perfumed elevator to the platform to meet my friend Julie at Penn Station. A standing-room-only Long Island Rail Road train took us to Jamaica station, the terminus of the AirTrain, where we once again had to schlep our gear to a new platform to get to the terminal for our four-hour-and-47-minute flight (which sat on the tarmac for an hour and a half after our scheduled departure). "
4136,"In Denver, things looked up: As we walked out of the airport with our gear, the train to Union Station was on the tracks, its countdown clock showing 0.0 minutes to departure. I broke into a run, but the helpful conductor held the door and we slipped on with no seconds to spare. "
4137,"After a too-short night in the Hotel Indigo Denver Downtown, across the street from Union Station, we boarded the ski train a little before 7 a.m. It was already filling up with ski-pants-clad passengers, most of them headed to the mountain for the day. Skis and bags went into a luggage area, and a friendly volunteer from Colorail, the Colorado Rail Passenger Association, helped us find seats. "
4138,"The original Colorado ski train was created by the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad in 1940 to carry members of the Eskimo Ski Club to the mountain. The tradition continued until 2009, when the DRGW, which had changed hands several times by then, was sold again, and the new owners shut it down, selling off the cars to a Canadian outfit, as if to put a spike in the idea that it might return. "
4139,"But train enthusiasts do not give up easily. In the fall of 2014, a member of Colorail called for the ski train’s revival in the group’s newsletter. Brad Swartzwelter, an Amtrak conductor who, as a boy, had gone fishing and hiking in the woods not far from the train tracks in Granby, Colo., put together a business plan, which Colorail pitched to Amtrak. "
4140,"Test runs began in March 2015 and by January 2017, after some improvements to the platform at the ski resort, the Winter Park Express was in business. "
4141,"Its eight cars — double-decker Superliners — are usually used on overnight trains in the West, like the California Zephyr or the Southwest Chief, but in the winter, when rider numbers on the big trains decline, the cars can be lent to the ski train. Mr. Swartzwelter is the conductor, checking tickets and offering a running commentary over the train’s public address system. "
4142,"After leaving Denver at 7 a.m. sharp, the Express rolled through the suburb of Arvada and across a wide grassland plain, where it climbed a series of 10 curves toward the mountains of the Front Range. As the terrain got steeper, the train wound through massive slabs of rock that seemed almost close enough to touch. In the lounge car, the bartender, Darrell Bennett, was playing Tracy Chapman and doing a brisk business in Bloody Marys. After a section along South Boulder Creek, the train reached the 6.2-mile Moffat Tunnel. For the day-trippers, that was the signal to put their ski boots on; in 10 minutes we were at the base of the mountain. Nine a.m., right on time. "
4143,"We cheated on our anti-car resolve and rode a hotel shuttle bus to the front desk of the Zephyr Mountain Lodge, where we stowed our bags, since our room in a nearby condominium wouldn’t open up until the afternoon. Within half an hour we were in line for the gondola. The mountain seemed to fit into the theme of the trip, with runs named Trestle (an Expert bump run with one seriously steep section), Brakeman and Derailer. Winter Park has never had the cachet of mountains like Vail and Aspen, and its devotees seemed to have a bit of a chip on their shoulders: “Vail Sucks” stickers were plastered on many available surfaces in the lift lines. "
4144,"Julie and I split up for a while. Did I notice, she asked when we got back together, that everyone here seemed to be talking about smoking weed? "
4145,"That night we cheated again and took a shuttle bus into the nearby town of Winter Park for fish tacos at a bustling joint called Pepe Osaka’s, where we sat at the bar and watched motor sports on TV. As we waited in the falling snow for a shuttle home, the people next to us casually lit up a joint. "
4146,The next day was a skier’s dream. It had snowed all night and just kept going. My skis floated through inches of powder as we danced down the bowls and tree-lined slopes off the Panoramic Express lift. The day was punctuated by cries of “yee-hah” from our fellow skiers — and maybe from me as well. 
4147,"Around 3:30 p.m., I called it a day and went back to the condo to pick up our gear. Another quick shuttle ride took us back to the platform and the waiting train. Every seat was taken. There were numerous family groups — Emily Rice and her husband, from Chesapeake, Va., were visiting her parents, and her father, who had never been to Winter Park, had arranged the outing for them all. They hadn’t even skied. “I love taking the train,” she said. "
4148,Another group was celebrating a birthday — they had a cooler of beer for the ride back. 
4149,"John Blood was on the train with his family, including his two young children, and another couple and their children. Why had they taken the train? “I-70,” he said. Well, part of the appeal was “little kids who like trains,” he added, though at $200 for a family, the ride was not a viable alternative to the highway, he said. "
4150,"As we rode out of the mountains, Mr. Swartzwelter talked about the train — how it got 400 passenger-miles per gallon of diesel fuel, what he does while the train is at Winter Park — “fix things” and rest, since he gets up at 4 a.m. to get the train rolling in the morning. "
4151,"Then he pulled out his smartphone, tapped on Google Maps and traced his finger along the path of I-70 where traffic was backed up for miles. “See all the red?” he asked. I did. And I was happy to be on the train. "
4152,"This ski season, the Winter Park Express ran every Saturday and Sunday, leaving Union Station at 7 a.m. on the way out, and returning from Winter Park at 4:30 p.m. The train also ran on the first two Fridays of each month, letting skiers spend a long weekend on the mountain. Tickets range from $29 to $59 per person each way, depending on how far in advance they are purchased. Children 2 through 12 are half-fare with an adult. The Winter Park Express runs this year through March 31. "
4153,"The A Line from the airport to Union Station, Denver, takes 37 minutes and costs $10.50 per ride. Tickets can be purchased using the RTD app on your phone. "
4154,"The Hotel Indigo Denver Downtown is just across the street from Union Station at 1801 Wewatta Street. A room with two queen beds was $153.95, including taxes, using the Booking.com app. "
4155,"At Winter Park, a studio in the Founders Pointe condominium at the base area with one queen bed and a pull out couch was $280.12, including taxes. "
4156,"The Crawford Hotel occupies what used to be office space within Union Station itself. You check in at a nook off the main waiting room. A double queen room recently cost about $278 a night booked through the hotel, $351.95 with taxes and fees. The hotel does not have its own bar or restaurants, but has access to those in the station, including the Cooper Lounge on the mezzanine, which offers a view over the waiting room along with craft cocktails.

4159,"CHICAGO — In a startling about-face on Tuesday that drove a rift between Mayor Rahm Emanuel and local prosecutors, the Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office dropped all charges against the “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett, who had been accused of staging a hate crime attack in the city’s downtown in January."
4160,"The decision, announced in court in a hastily convened hearing, slammed the door on a case that became a national fascination and flashpoint, with its overtones of racial and political discord in a city with a history of tension over law enforcement."
4161,"It drew waves of celebrity commiseration and torrents of finger-shaking tweets as the victim turned into a suspect and then a defendant. And by Tuesday night, many questions remained unanswered, including why prosecutors had suddenly decided to let Mr. Smollett off only a month after his arrest, and what actually happened at 2 a.m. on Jan. 29 as he was walking back from a late sandwich at a Subway."
4162,"Mr. Smollett, who is black, gay and outspoken on social issues, had told the police that two men jumped him, while taunting him with homophobic and racial slurs and yelling “This is MAGA country,” a reference to President Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. The assailants, according to Mr. Smollett, tied a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him. He was briefly treated at a hospital."
4163,"The police spent days poring over surveillance camera footage to locate the two men, and eventually homed in a pair of brothers who knew Mr. Smollett. But after hours of questioning, the police said, the men said they had been paid by the actor to concoct the attack as a way to gain publicity because he was unhappy with his “Empire” salary."
4164,"The resulting charges embarrassed Mr. Smollett, 36, imperiled his career and raised the possibility of jail time. As of Tuesday, his record, for official purposes at least, had been wiped clean."
4165,"The state’s attorney’s office said in a statement, “After reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case,” including Mr. Smollett’s performance of community service and an agreement to forfeit his $10,000 bond payment, “we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution.”"
4166,"In an interview later, Joe Magats, the prosecutor who made the decision, said there had been no problems with the evidence or the police investigation into Mr. Smollett. He also noted that Mr. Smollett had no previous record of violence or felonies, and said that dropping the charges “didn’t exonerate him.”"
4167,[A timeline of events of the Smollett case.]
4168,"“We work to prioritize violent crime and the drivers of violent crime,” Mr. Magats said. “I don’t see Jussie Smollett as a threat to public safety.”"
4169,"But soon afterward, in a striking news conference, the mayor and the police superintendent, Eddie Johnson, sharply criticized the State’s Attorney’s Office and the actor himself."
4170,"Mr. Emanuel said that Mr. Smollett’s celebrity had played a role in the decision, calling it “a whitewash of justice.”"
4171,[More about the war of words in Chicago on Tuesday.]
4172,"“You cannot have, because of a person’s position, one set of rules apply to them and one set of rules apply to everybody else,” Mr. Emanuel said."
4173,"“Our officers did hard work, day in and day out, countless hours, working to unwind what actually happened that night,” he added. “The city saw its reputation dragged through the mud.”"
4174,"Mr. Johnson said, “I think this city is still owed an apology.”"
4175,"“At the end of the day,” he added, “it’s Mr. Smollett who committed this hoax.”"
4176,[Read more about Jussie Smollett here.]
4177,The state’s attorney’s office did not respond to the remarks.
4178,"Exoneration or no, for Mr. Smollett, who maintained his innocence, the outcome could hardly have been better. After the hearing, he read a statement outside the courthouse without taking questions. He thanked his family, friends and “the incredible people of Chicago and all over the country and the world who have prayed for me, who have supported me.”"
4179,"“I’ve been truthful and consistent on every single level since Day One,” he said somberly. “This has been an incredibly difficult time, honestly one of the worst of my entire life, but I am a man of faith and I’m a man that has knowledge of my history, and I would not bring my family, our lives or the movement through a fire like this.”"
4180,"Investigators initially treated the case as a possible hate crime, especially because a week before, a threatening letter was sent to Fox production offices in Chicago directed at the actor. Mr. Smollett, who also maintains a singing career, plays the gay musician son of the head of Empire Entertainment on the Fox television show."
4181,"Many celebrities and advocacy groups expressed their support for Mr. Smollett, painting the attack as another example of the increasing number of hate crimes in the era of Mr. Trump’s presidency. But soon, doubts about Mr. Smollett’s account played into a different narrative: that it was a real-life “false flag” concocted to shame the president and his supporters."
4182,"Before Mr. Smollett’s arrest, the president described the attack as “horrible.” After the arrest, Mr. Trump asked on Twitter, “what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!?”"
4183,"After Mr. Smollett’s initial report, detectives had trouble finding surveillance video of the attack, or witnesses, in an area that they said was well covered with cameras."
4184,"On Jan. 30, the police released images of two men seen on a surveillance camera and eventually identified them as two brothers, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo. After initially denying involvement, they said that Mr. Smollett had enlisted them for $3,500."
4185,"According to the police, phone records showed that Mr. Smollett spoke to the brothers an hour before he said the attack took place, and then an hour afterward."
4186,"Police also said Mr. Smollett sent himself the threatening letter, an aspect of the investigation the F.B.I. had taken over. The F.B.I. declined to comment."
4187,"Mr. Smollett denied having planned the attack, and his lawyers described the $3,500 as payment for a physical training program to get him in shape for a music video."
4188,"“It was for nutrition and training,” Patricia Brown Holmes, one of his lawyers, said on Tuesday. “They were his trainers.”"
4189,"Until Tuesday, the prosecutor’s office had appeared to be taking a hard line with Mr. Smollett. A couple of weeks after his arrest, the office announced that a grand jury had indicted him on 16 separate counts of disorderly conduct related to the filing of a false police report. The move appeared to increase the pressure on Mr. Smollett, whose lawyers described it as “prosecutorial overkill.”"
4190,"But the state’s attorney’s office had already drawn scrutiny for its handling of the case. The Chicago Tribune reported that after police department sources began leaking their doubts about Mr. Smollett to local reporters, Tina Tchen, a former chief of staff to Michelle Obama, had emailed Kimberly Foxx, the top prosecutor, saying the actor’s family had “concerns about the investigation.”"
4191,"Ms. Foxx told Ms. Tchen, and separately a member of Mr. Smollett’s family, that she had asked the police superintendent to request that the F.B.I. take over the investigation."
4192,"“Omg this would be a huge victory,” the relative replied in a text message, according to The Tribune."
4193,"Once it became clear that Mr. Smollett was himself a suspect, Ms. Foxx recused herself from the case, but her actions had already embittered the police department, and the head of the police union accused her of interference."
4194,"The resolution of the case struck some legal experts as atypical, and the two sides could not even agree on what to call it. Prosecutors characterized it as an agreement, but Mr. Smollett’s legal team denied that any deal had taken place; in any event, Mr. Smollett was required to forfeit the $10,000, which would have been returned to him had he shown up for all his court dates. (Had he been convicted, he could have been required to pay far more than that to reimburse the police for their time spent on the case.)"
4195,"The police department’s main spokesman highlighted the unusual nature of the resolution, saying, “In our experience, innocent individuals don’t forget bond & perform community service in exchange for dropped charges,” he wrote on Twitter, apparently mistyping “forfeit.”"
4196,"In an interview following his news conference, Mr. Emanuel took issue with Mr. Smollett’s continued professing of his innocence. “He is walking around like he is the victim here of an unjust act,” the mayor said, adding that he had been given no explanation from the prosecutor’s office about what led them to drop the case."
4197,"Had the case gone to trial, defense lawyers almost certainly would have tried to make the most of the brothers’ shifting accounts. And some tweets and accounts surfaced later suggesting that one of them had made homophobic remarks in the past. The brothers, who have not been charged, did not respond to emailed questions on Tuesday and their lawyer declined to comment."
4198,"Darryl A. Goldberg, a Chicago defense lawyer not involved in the case, said, “Frankly, despite the news conferences by law enforcement laying out what they believed was overwhelming evidence of guilt, as a defense lawyer I have always thought the prosecution would have a difficult time meeting its burden of proof.”"
4199,"Even with the case behind him, Mr. Smollett’s future prospects are uncertain. His character was removed from the final two episodes of the current, fifth season of “Empire,” and Fox Television has not said whether it would pick up the series for another season."
4200,"In a statement, Fox said, “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified on his behalf that all charges against him have been dismissed.”"
4201,"After delivering his remarks on Tuesday, Mr. Smollett was immediately surrounded by fans — one shouting “Free Jussie!” — and posed for selfies before being ushered into a black SUV."
4202,"Asked if he believed he should be back on “Empire,” Mr. Smollett did not respond. One bystander who said she loved the show answered for him: “Yes, he should.”"
4203,"The rooftop fund-raiser was meant to be a secretive affair, but word spread quickly among those with pending issues before the state. Lobbyists told their clients that the event would be a good thing to go to. "
4204,"After all, the dinner was being held a little more than two weeks before the New York State budget was due, and what better way to make valuable connections than to pay tribute to the guest of honor, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo."
4205,Among those present were the vice president of a school bus company seeking tax breaks for the purchase of buses; a recycling company founder looking for a broadening of the 5-cent deposit law; and an affordable housing developer lobbying for real estate tax credits. 
4206,"The fund-raiser was held on March 14 on the 20th floor of the St. Regis Hotel, just off Fifth Avenue and a block from Trump Tower. The minimum donation per couple was $25,000. "
4207,"The event, which was billed as a spring dinner with the governor, was strictly under the radar: It was not listed on Mr. Cuomo’s calendar, and even the invitation was vaguely worded, with the locale only provided in the R.S.V.P."
4208,"And although a reporter who showed up at the fund-raiser was barred entry, The New York Times was able to piece together an account of the event through interviews with six attendees and a partial guest list of 35 invitees. The guests included senior Cuomo administration officials, including the state budget director."
4209,"The fund-raiser provided a vivid example of how things work in Albany’s pay-to-play culture, where political contributions are often viewed by business leaders as a prerequisite for getting their perspective heard in the capital. It also offered a glimpse into the nexus of money and politics that is commonplace across the ideological spectrum and around the United States, and something that Mr. Cuomo has excelled in. "
4210,"The governor is considered one of the Democratic Party’s most prolific fund-raisers, accumulating more than $30 million in his campaign war chest until last year’s costly re-election effort, when he spent dearly to fend off a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon. "
4211,"The high-priced event seemed in stark contrast to Mr. Cuomo’s promise of “real campaign finance reform” made two months earlier, as he announced his support for a public financing system. In January, the governor signed new limitations on corporate donations and, in his State of the State speech, vowed to “combat big money in politics” and empower small donors."
4212,"But the vast majority of Mr. Cuomo’s political fund-raising has come from big checks, and the event at the St. Regis, held in a room with a trompe l’oeil of the sky on a partly cloudy day, continued that trend."
4213,"Corey Muirhead is a vice president at Logan Bus Company and interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association. School bus contractors are lobbying the state on several issues of interest to their members, including tax exemptions for the purchase of new school buses. "
4214,"“I coordinate with my lobbyist and I go to events that they feel are important,” said Corey Muirhead of Logan Bus Company, who attended the dinner. “We have stuff that we want to see done up in Albany.”"
4215,"Robert Mujica is the state budget director. He had been working out of Mr. Cuomo’s Manhattan office on the day of the fund-raiser, the governor’s staff said, and received an invitation as a matter of courtesy. "
4216,"About 100 people mingled in a crowd that included the state budget director, Robert Mujica, and the governor’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, before sitting down at more than a dozen tables for two slices of filet mignon, vegetables and what one attendee described as a “little peaked salad.” "
4217,"According to the invitation, a limited number of tickets were available for $5,000; most single tickets were $15,000."
4218,"The governor delivered a speech that touched on Amazon, the tumult in Washington, and the transition from campaigning to governing that he said some new Albany legislators had to learn."
4219,"“I thought he gave a great speech. He really knew how to relate to the crowd,” said Conrad Cutler, whose company, Galvanize Group, gathers bottles and cans and returns them to the distributors, collecting the deposit and a 3.5-cent handling fee. “He addressed a lot of pressing issues involving health care and the M.T.A. He underscored his commitment to New Yorkers who have issues.”"
4220,"Conrad Cutler is the chief executive of Galvanize Group, a company that collects cans and bottles to return them to distributors. Galvanize Group wants the state to approve an expansion of the bottle bill, which is backed by Mr. Cuomo and would make more bottles eligible for deposit. "
4221,"Thirteen minutes before the fund-raiser officially began, Mr. Mujica emailed a statement to reporters, lashing out at the Democratic-led State Senate and accusing it of creating “false political expectations” with its budget proposals. "
4222,"Then the dinner started, with attendees sporting badges with two names: theirs and Mr. Cuomo’s, the latter done up in his campaign logo."
4223,"“As the governor said since Day 1, anyone who can get swayed by a single dollar has no place in government,” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said. He added that people who said their lobbyist told them to attend the fund-raiser should “fire their lobbyist and get their head examined.”"
4224,"Mr. Azzopardi defended the presence of senior aides — including Mr. Mujica, who is in charge of the state budget being negotiated in Albany — at the fund-raiser, saying Mr. Mujica had “worked out of his New York City office that day and this event was after hours.” Staff members are routinely invited to events as guests, he added."
4225,"Mr. Cuomo, for his part, came from Albany for the event and was in the capital the next day, according to his public schedule."
4226,"One oddity at the fund-raiser? Neither attendees nor staff members from the Cuomo campaign could describe what office, if any, Mr. Cuomo, who was recently re-elected to a third term, was raising money for."
4227,Nor could those contributing to him.
4228,"“I didn’t ask. It’s obvious what it is. It’s the continual cycle of fund-raising,” said John Samuelsen, the president of the Transport Workers Union International and an ally of the governor. “That’s what he does. That’s what everybody seems to do.”"
4229,"John Samuelsen, whose name is misspelled on his badge, is the president of the Transport Workers Union International. The union, especially its Local 100, represents tens of thousands of public transit workers in the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "
4230,"Mr. Samuelsen said he arrived just after the governor had finished his formal address. He said he spoke to the governor for a couple of minutes about the subway. Mr. Samuelsen, who recalled wearing a Woolrich shirt to the event, said he could not recall how much he had donated to attend. "
4231,"“Honestly, I’m not even in the weeds on that level,” he said, adding that his union has happily long spent money to support Mr. Cuomo. “The governor has been the best governor for the trade union movement ever.”"
4232,"The roster of invitees included some well-known figures in New York real estate such as Douglas Durst; prominent political donors like the Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis; and past contributors to Mr. Cuomo like Elliot Gibber, who owns an egg products company and donated $73,000 to the governor’s 2018 re-election campaign. "
4233,"“I walked in and walked out,” Mr. Gibber said. “I have huge facilities in New York State. I believe in the governor. He’s done a lot of work for education and private education.”"
4234,"Mr. Durst gave but did not attend; Mr. Catsimatidis said he did not contribute or go to the event, explaining the governor’s invitation as a matter of their longstanding friendship."
4235,"“I go back with the governor 20 years,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. “In 50 years in business, I have never gotten anything from the city or the state.” "
4236,"“You know what I’ve gotten? Ungatz,” he said, of a slang term for nada, zip, zero. “That’s Italian, I think.”"
4237,"Charlie Bachtell is the founder and chief executive of Cresco Labs, a cannabis company based in Chicago. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach a deal on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on the idea."
4238,"Others who bought tickets did so while they had an issue of importance to them being decided in Albany, like Larry Regan, a housing developer seeking real estate tax credits who did not go to the dinner, and Charlie Bachtell, the chief executive of Cresco Labs, a Chicago-based cannabis company."
4239,"Cresco Labs hired a lobbyist in New York for the first time this year, state records showed. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach an agreement on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on that notion. "
4240,A spokesman for the company declined to say why Mr. Bachtell had attended the fund-raiser. 
4241,"Larry Regan is the president of Regan Development, which develops market-rate and affordable housing. Mr. Regan has been lobbying the state on real estate tax credits. He paid for a ticket, but did not attend the event, a spokeswoman said. "
4242,"Others with an immediate interest in state matters included Maury Litwack of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas that would like an increase in the reimbursement for science and math education at nonpublic schools. The week before the budget is passed could decide the size of that program."
4243,"“The governor has been a champion of the STEM program and Jewish causes,” Menashe Shapiro, a spokesman for Mr. Litwack, said. He said that while Mr. Litwack had briefly attended the end of the fund-raiser, “he did not write a check.” "
4244,"Maury Litwack is the executive director of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas. The group wants the state to expand its STEM reimbursement program for nonpublic schools. "
4245,"Mr. Muirhead, the bus company executive, said he attended in his role as interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association, which was lobbying the state government. He said a big issue for the group was a possible tax exemption on the purchase of new buses. "
4246,"Mr. Cutler, the recycling executive, was also clear about his interest in the fund-raiser."
4247,"“Governor Cuomo proposed to expand the bottle bill to all beverages except wine and liquor,” he said, noting that the bill does not cover a few select categories, like milk. “I agree with that because I make money on every bottle that’s redeemed, and for environmental reasons.” "
4248,"JACKSON, Miss. — “I come from the smallest town in Mississippi, in the buckle of the Bible Belt,” said Gerald Gibson, outreach manager at Open Arms Healthcare Center, the only clinic created to serve gay black men in this state."
4249,"“Growing up, I didn’t know anybody like me,” he added. “I come from a culture that says you’re going to hell for being homosexual and AIDS is God’s wrath.”"
4250,"President Trump’s plan to end America’s epidemic of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, within 10 years is not going to succeed easily in places like this."
4251,"Medically, AIDS experts agree, the plan he announced in his State of the Union address in February is sound. It has twin goals: First, to get every American who is infected with the virus — an estimated 1.1 million people — onto three-drug cocktails that, if taken every day, suppress the virus, keeping patients healthy and reducing almost to zero the odds that they will infect anyone else."
4252,"The second goal is to get every American who is at risk — an estimated one million people — onto pre-exposure prophylaxis (called PrEP), a pill that, if taken daily, protects almost completely against infection."
4253,"But reaching those goals will take a huge amount of money — far more than the $291 million Mr. Trump requested in his 2020 budget proposal. Moreover, it will require courageous political leadership, not just from the White House, but from every statehouse and city hall in the nation."
4254,"In the last 15 years, the epidemic has shifted into groups that are hard to test and even harder to keep on daily medication: men who are closeted, drug injectors, the homeless, the rural poor, the mentally ill and those with little income and no health insurance. "
4255,"But the group most at risk comprises gay and bisexual black men and transgender women in the Deep South — Mr. Gibson’s peers and his clientele. More than half of new H.I.V. infections in the country each year now occur in the South, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and often in rural areas. "
4256,"Many of the newly infected are young black men. Nationally, gay and bisexual black men face a 50 percent lifetime risk of H.I.V. infection. The epidemic cannot be halted, experts say, unless those men can be found, educated about the disease, convinced to protect themselves and their sexual partners, and helped to do so."
4257,That often is not easy.
4258,"“I had an individual hit me up on Instagram for help — he’s positive,” said Mr. Gibson, 42, referring to a man infected with H.I.V. "
4259,"“I said, ‘Come to the clinic. If you don’t have transportation, I’ll send a car.’ He said, ‘It’s not that simple. My family thinks I can be healed religiously.’”"
4260,Mr. Gibson paused: “He’s not on medication because they think they can pray the H.I.V. away.”
4261,"More than 80 percent of all new infections are transmitted by people who don’t know they are infected or who are not on medication, according to the C.D.C."
4262,"San Francisco, America’s model H.I.V.-fighting city, has worked hard to extinguish the last embers of its epidemic. It may not be enough. "
4263,"In the 1990s, the city had over 2,000 new infections a year; it has driven that figure down to about 200. “But we’re plateauing,” said Jeff Sheehy, a former city supervisor and longtime AIDS activist who is H.I.V.-positive. "
4264,"“We’ve hit a wall. All the gay white boys in the Castro are on PrEP or linked to care, and now we have to reach the hard-to-reach.”"
4265,"Twelve percent of young gay men in the city’s ubiquitous homeless population are infected. Some undocumented immigrants fear deportation and avoid city clinics. Many H.I.V.-infected women in the city have histories of drug use, beatings and rape; they are too traumatized to organize their lives around pill-taking."
4266,"“H.I.V. is now a disease of poverty, and you can’t separate it from people’s other issues,” Mr. Sheehy said. “When you have schizophrenia and are homeless and use heroin to get to sleep and speed to wake up, H.I.V. is just one of your problems.”"
4267,"In response, San Francisco has a corps of “navigators” who visit homeless encampments and bang on doors in downtown residential hotels to find and physically escort elusive clients to doctors’ offices and pharmacies."
4268,The city employs case managers who fill out complex insurance and Medicaid paperwork to pay for drugs and lab tests. It has opened a “trauma-informed” clinic exclusively for H.I.V.-positive women who have suffered abuse.
4269,"For the uninsured, the city has its own taxpayer-supported health insurance plan. In November, the city passed a new tax on major businesses to raise $300 million to house the homeless."
4270,"So what of the rest of the country, where most municipalities have only a fraction of San Francisco’s resources?"
4271,"Both financially and culturally, Jackson is at the opposite end of the H.I.V. care spectrum. And Mississippi officials know it. "
4272,"“People want us to jump to being San Francisco right away, and we’re just not there,” said Dr. Thomas Dobbs, chief of the Mississippi state health department."
4273,"About a third of gay black men in Jackson are infected, he said. (Although its population is only 170,000, Jackson is the state capital, and the state’s biggest city; it has some gay bars and three H.I.V. clinics.)"
4274,"Outside Jackson, doctors trained to treat H.I.V. patients are rare. When Dr. Dobbs practiced in Hattiesburg, in the southeastern part of the state, he said, some patients drove almost four hours to see him."
4275,"Wages in Mississippi are so low that many full-time workers could be on Medicaid. (Even health department receptionists earn just $17,000 a year, Dr. Dobbs said.) But the state legislature rejected Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act."
4276,"In 2016, the health department’s budget was cut by 35 percent; it has a third fewer employees than it once did."
4277,"The state receives some federal aid for H.I.V. treatment under the Ryan White Act, but almost all of it must be spent on medicine. Little is left for the services Dr. Dobbs said he would offer if he had more money: new clinics, PrEP for all takers, and hiring doctors, outbreak-tracking epidemiologists, case managers and counselors. "
4278,But financial barriers are just one obstacle. The legal and cultural obstacles are bigger.
4279,"Basic sexual knowledge is limited. By state law, sex education is abstinence-focused; condoms may be mentioned, but not distributed."
4280,"Mr. Gibson was escorted off a junior college campus when he tried to hand out condoms and demonstrate putting them on a plastic model. “And that was to adults!” he said, shaking his head."
4281,"For a study, Dr. Leandro A. Mena, Open Arms’s medical director, asked dozens of gay Jackson men to put condoms on a plastic penis; 90 percent did it wrong, he said."
4282,"“They opened it with their teeth, or they didn’t check the expiration date, or they used a lube that deteriorates latex,” he said. “Many had never used one.”"
4283,"In New York, residents routinely see subway ads for PrEP, some of which show black men with their arms wrapped lovingly around each other."
4284,"“That would definitely not be possible here,” said Dr. Sandra Melvin, Open Arms’s chief operating officer."
4285,"Dr. Dobbs agreed, reluctantly admitting that his department puts coasters endorsing PrEP in gay bars and public service ads on gay dating sites like Grindr. “But we don’t put our state brand on it,” he quickly added, fearing a backlash from the legislature."
4286,There are also psychological barriers.
4287,"An H.I.V. diagnosis — like a cancer diagnosis — is inevitably a shock, and many men disappear after a positive test, too shaken to start treatment. Without navigators, finding them again is hard."
4288,"Also, in Mississippi, knowingly infecting someone with H.I.V. can mean 10 years in prison. “People don’t even want to get tested because if they know their status, they’re responsible,” Mr. Gibson said."
4289,"Moreover, some people do not want to be seen with H.I.V. drugs."
4290,"“In Jackson, a lot of down-low guys have girlfriends,” said Aaron Jones, an Open Arms phlebotomist. Those men avoid the clinic: “They say, ‘Is my business going to be spread to the world?’”"
4291,"Jacqueline Wilson, a clinic receptionist, discovered she was infected after catching her ex-husband in bed with a man. “A lot of women are afraid to be on the meds,” she said. “Afraid of what people will think, afraid of what the doctor will say.” "
4292,And distrust of the public health system is intense.
4293,"“People have heard of the Tuskegee experiment,” said Regi Stevenson, another receptionist, citing an infamous scandal in which federal health officials let black men stay infected with syphilis for decades. “My grandfather won’t go to a doctor until he’s almost dead.”"
4294,"Despite the obstacles, 85 percent of Open Arms patients achieve viral suppression, Dr. Mena said, meaning they take their pills so faithfully that the virus cannot be found in their blood. "
4295,"To reach that goal, the clinic has to offer many extra services: counselors to remind clients to take their pills, transportation for those who don't own cars, and even a food bank offering weekly food packages, since many patients are so poor they skip meals and then will not take pills that may trigger heartburn."
4296,"Open Arms would like to have an on-site pharmacy too, Dr. Mena said, but has not received a license yet. Mostly, he said, a clinic must offer the right attitude."
4297,"“People don’t come back to clinics where the nurse makes you feel guilty for sleeping with men, or keeps saying ‘he’ when it’s ‘she,’ or threatens to stop your meds if you don’t take them all,” he said. “People with H.I.V. are still people.”"
4298,"Louisiana, next door to this state, goes further: Patients whose blood tests prove they are taking their pills daily get paid."
4299,"“For some folks, that’s controversial, but it works,” said Dr. Alexander Billioux, a Louisiana assistant health secretary. “And we’re not sending anyone on luxury vacations. It’s about $25 a month.”"
4300,"No matter what tactics a state employs, “medication has become the simple part of H.I.V.,” Dr. Mena said. “What’s been missing is the political will.”"
4301,This is the sixth installment in an eight-part philosophical tour of the ancient city by the author. The entire series can be found here. 
4302,"ATHENS — Since we began our little tour I have tried to take you to some of the less obvious sites around the ancient city, often at the periphery. But now I want to head right to the center of it: the Agora. This was a large public square, humming with human activity — shopping, gossip, dramatic performances, military and religious processions — and surrounded on all sides by buildings, including many of the key institutions of Athenian democracy. "
4303,"Excavations since the 1930s have uncovered the Agora, an open green area, about 30 acres sloping down northwest from the rock of the Acropolis. What I most like about it is its feeling of space, the sense of absence that triggers the imagination and allows one to conjure the ruined city in the mind’s eye."
4304,The reason for coming here on this particular day was entirely selfish: It was my birthday and I wanted to return to my favorite site in Athens and visit the ruins of the house of the source of my name: Simon the Cobbler. He also pretended to be a philosopher of sorts.
4305,"We arrived close to the entrance to the Agora as it opened. A railway line, built in 1891, bisects the northern edge of the site, emitting a low, pleasant rumble (not the anxiety-inducing squeal of the New York subway). The train line covers the remains of the Altar of the Twelve Gods and runs right alongside the Stoa of Attalos, rebuilt in the 1950s, which houses the small and rather lovely Agora Museum. With standard Athenian counterpoint, colonnades of bright white columns abut garish trackside graffiti. The contradictions reach further back: King Attalos of Pergamon was a student of the philosopher Carneades in the second century B.C. and the presumably grateful alumnus gave his university town the gift of a shopping mall, with 42 shops in the stoa rented out by the city. Everything was for sale in the Agora."
4306,"It was time for a birthday breakfast: Greek yogurt and a big stack of American-style pancakes soaked with honey. A very drunken Englishman (this was about 9 a.m.) sat just ahead of us, smoking a cigarette, and holding onto it with some difficulty. He turned around to look at us for a good long while and said to me, “You’re serious, aren’t you?” Hardly, I thought. He then started into a series of incoherent anti-German, pro-Brexit rants to no one in particular. The waiters seemed puzzled, but tolerated him nonetheless. Sometimes, I do miss England."
4307,"A group of about 100 schoolchildren were talking wildly over one another and waiting at the entrance for their bewildered teachers to buy them tickets. We slipped by them and into the site. We were standing on the Panathenaic way, the ancient processional path that led through the Agora and up to the Acropolis."
4308,"Early morning rain had given way to cool sunshine. Some trees were just beginning to blossom, and I buried my nose into flowers that seemed to have the scent of honey, though it could have been the remains of breakfast. But Persephone is definitely on her way back from Hades."
4309,"In a row running along the west side of the Agora are the footprints of the key institutions of Athenian democracy: the Metroon, the sanctuary for the mother of the gods and the city archive and records office; the Bouleuterion, where the 500 citizens chosen by lot each year to serve on the council, or boule, met every day; and the Tholos, the modest, round headquarters of the 50-strong executive committee of the council with space for at least some members to stay overnight to deal with any emergencies. Just up from these buildings was the open area of the Pnyx where the General Assembly, or ekklesia, of citizens met every 10 days to speak and to decide the law collectively."
4310,"Just above, on a small hill, stands the Hephaisteion, the best-preserved Doric temple in Greece and, for me, the most beautiful building in Athens. Though similar to the Parthenon, it is smaller, more complete and all the more enjoyable for being slightly ignored. On a visit here last summer, we watched a tortoise slowly lumber from view into the darkness of the surrounding bushes at the back of the temple."
4311,"The boundaries of the Agora were marked with marble stones about three feet high called horoi. These defined the horizon between public and private space, preventing the encroachment of the latter into the former. Two have been recovered, and each is inscribed with the simple phrase, “Horos eimi tes agoras,” “I am the boundary of the Agora.” I find the pronoun very interesting. It is not the impersonal address of a piece of legislation: This is the boundary, trespassers keep out. Rather, the stone itself speaks."
4312,"On the south edge of the site, right next to a boundary stone, and therefore just outside the Agora, are the excavated ruins of a small building with a plaque that says “Oikia Simonos,” “the house of Simon’.” Legend has it that this was the home and workshop of Simon the Cobbler, a good friend of Socrates. It is said that Socrates liked to hang out in Simon’s workshop and engage in discussions, free from the public glare."
4313,"It is ironic that Socrates might have liked to spend time with a cobbler. Socrates was famously shoeless, a habit widely imitated by some of his followers. So, whatever took place in Simon’s house, it wasn’t selling shoes. Also, as is clear from many of the Platonic dialogues, Socrates genuinely admired people with practical skills. Sadly, he had none himself. "
4314,"There is some archaeological support for this legend. A number of hobnails were found during excavations, along with bone eyelets used for tying laces or straps. These are on view in the museum, along with the base of a black-glazed cup, or kylix, with the name Simonos scratched on to it. So, maybe the story has some truth."
4315,So who was Simon?
4316,"The splendidly unreliable Diogenes Laertius gave Simon his own entry in his “Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers” and added that Phaedo of Elis was the author of a “genuine” dialogue called “Simon.” When Socrates came into his workshop and began to talk, Simon reportedly made notes of all that he could remember. And Laertius claimed that Simon was the first — before Plato — to introduce Socratic dialogues as a form of written conversation. There were 33 of them, described as “leathern,” doubtless because of Simon’s occupation. Titles include “On Good Eating,” “On Greed"" and “On Pretentiousness.” Apparently, they were unpretentiously short."
4317,"There is another story connected with Simon that assumed significance for a more anarchic school of street philosophers who followed Socrates: the Cynics, or dog philosophers, so called because they were abusively called dogs and then took on the moniker as a badge of honor. It is said that Simon attracted the attention of Pericles, the most powerful leader of Athenian democracy in the classical period. Pericles promised to protect and support Simon if he came to work for him. But Simon refused because he preferred his parrhesia, his freedom of speech."
4318,"For the Cynics, only those people who achieved self-sufficiency (autarkeia) or independence of mind could truly exercise their freedom of speech. For a cobbler-philosopher like Simon to work for a powerful political figure like Pericles would have undermined that independence and completely compromised his freedom. Simon thus exemplifies the freedom of the Cynic, namely those who chose a life as free as possible from politics and power, who were cosmopolites, citizens of the world and not subjects to any particular city or state. And by tracing their ancestry through Simon, the Cynics could see themselves as having a direct lineage to Socrates."
4319,"Plato famously described Diogenes the Cynic as a “Socrates gone mad.” But this madness is testament to a libertarianism that refused the authoritarian picture of society described in Plato’s “Republic” and the “Laws.” Unlike Plato and Aristotle, Diogenes did not work for tyrants. Perhaps this is why tyrants loved him. Legend has it that Diogenes was the philosopher most admired by Alexander the Great. When Alexander met Diogenes, he asked him what he wanted. Diogenes famously replied, “I want you to get out of my light.”"
4320,"I have been reading an interesting book recently called “The Tyrant’s Writ"" by Deborah Tarn Steiner. It is a study on the relation of writing and tyranny in antiquity. We possess the understandable prejudice that literacy and democracy somehow go together, that a literate society is best able to resist oppression. That might be so, but it overlooks the way in which tyranny and writing are often conjoined — through the writing of laws and decrees, but also the stamping of coins, huge inscriptions on columns, the elaborate architectural construction of triumphal arches, not to mention the branding of slaves — that dictatorial regimes assert and exert control. "
4321,"Ancient historians like Herodotus often associate writing with the behavior of “barbarian tyrants from the East,” notably the Persians, as opposed to democracy, which is much more concerned with speech."
4322,"The historians and dramatists of the classical period repeatedly stated that a democracy depends on the ability of citizens to speak freely and declare their will out loud. As Steiner wrote, “It is logos and not writing that exists at the heart of democratic Athens’s self-definition and the good speaker — not the writer — who keeps popular government on course.” Speech is the hallmark of the democrat, and written communication and legislation repeatedly appear in the depiction of the oligarch. Contemporary political parallels are too numerous and obvious to draw, but it might be noted that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is very fond of citing law."
4323,"The association between written law and democracy is much more problematic than one might at first imagine. Think here of the debate about the merits and demerits of a written versus an unwritten constitution, the United States versus Britain, for instance. Writing can thus be seen as opposed to liberty, as the very mechanism of enslavement. Real democracy perhaps requires no written constitution. What it needs are hard-won habits of freedom of speech, persuasion, collective decision-making and candor."
4324,"Of course, the freedom of speech by which Athens defined itself was famously betrayed by Athens itself. Socrates was charged with impiety toward the gods and corruption of the youth and summoned to face those charges in the Royal Stoa, here in the northwest corner of Agora very close to where I am standing."
4325,We know Socrates’ fate. What — we might wonder — is ours?
4326,"In our virtual Agora, where the boundary stones separating the private from the public have all been removed, and where we live in a new and unprecedented tyranny of writing, of text and texting, and where cynicism has taken on a whole new troubling set of meanings, how is that fragile parrhesia of the ancients that defines democracy to be cultivated? And how might it be sustained?"
4327,"Simon Critchley is a professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research and the author of “What We Think About When We Think About Soccer” and the forthcoming “Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us.” He is the moderator of The Stone."

4332,"Saudi Aramco began a road show to pitch prospective investors on a $10 billion bond offering, providing a peek into the state-owned oil company’s books — and showing how incredibly profitable it is."
4333,"Aramco made $111.1 billion in profit last year, according to data provided to credit ratings agencies. That means it was the world’s most profitable company in 2018, Bloomberg notes, making more than Apple and Alphabet combined."
4334,"The company produced 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year, which far surpasses any other producer, such as Royal Dutch Shell or BP."
4335,"The disclosures finally shed light on the oil company’s finances and operations. (They were necessary as part of the bond offering that will support Aramco’s $69 billion deal to buy control of a Saudi chemical company, Sabic.)"
4336,Credit ratings agencies were impressed. Moody’s assigned Aramco’s bonds an A1 rating (though still below the Aaa that it gave to Exxon Mobil). The agency said the biggest risk to the rating was any downgrade to Saudi Arabia’s own financial picture.
4337,"Facebook’s C.E.O. wrote an opinion piece for the WaPo on Saturday laying out how he believes his company should be treated. His top policy executive, Nick Clegg, echoed its points in an interview with Politico. Here’s how Mike Isaac of the NYT reads between the lines:"
4338,"• Harmful content. Mr. Zuckerberg called for lawmakers to decide “what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more.” By adhering to the letter of the law, Facebook can effectively shield itself from blame if something goes awry."
4339,"• Election protection. “Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. That would serve Facebook well, Mr. Isaac writes: “When the next erroneous outburst inevitably occurs, Facebook could point toward the law it was forced to follow.”"
4340,"• Privacy and data protection issues. “I believe it would be good for the internet if more countries adopted regulation such as G.D.P.R. as a common framework,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, referring to Europe’s data protection rule. If laws are enacted to limit data collection in the future, Mr. Isaac notes, Facebook might be able to squash smaller competitors."
4341,"• Data portability. “Regulation should guarantee the principle of data portability,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Facebook claims its users would be able to freely take their information from one network to the next, Mr. Isaac says. But in reality, data portability could help the company combine its platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp."
4342,More: Facebook will start explaining why people are being shown content in their news feed. The company “mistakenly deleted” many of Mr. Zuckerberg’s old posts. And lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand want to ban “weaponized” social media.
4343,"As the two countries nudge ever closer to striking an agreement, Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT explain how one of its key tenets could undercut Washington’s vision:"
4344,"• “Any agreement seems certain to involve China’s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods. For Mr. Trump, this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States’ record trade deficit with China.”"
4345,"• “But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state, and most will be carried out by state-controlled Chinese businesses, further cementing Beijing’s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese.”"
4346,"“Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by next week, to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He, the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal,” Ms. Swanson and Mr. Bradsher write. The goal is reportedly “to have an agreement by the end of that meeting, with a signing ceremony between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month.”"
4347,"But there are still sticking points. “Those include how an agreement will be monitored and enforced, and how many of Mr. Trump’s tariffs come off and when,” according to Ms. Swanson and Mr. Bradsher."
4348,"The ride-hailing company began trading on the public markets on Friday, with its stock closing up about 9 percent. But the file of winners is bigger than just those who bought into the stock before it listed:"
4349,• Gig economy start-ups. Lyft showed that there’s interest in the public markets for companies that rely on part-time employees. (But the big question is still whether they can ever make money.)
4350,"• The Golden State, truly. Lyft’s success bodes well for its home state, California, which is set to collect a capital-gains tax bonanza from the tech companies planning to go public this year. Alejandro Lazo of the WSJ reports that the state is already expected to draw nearly 10 percent of its revenue for the next fiscal year from tech I.P.O.s — a figure that could grow if the offerings perform better than expected."
4351,• Uber. The world’s largest ride-hailing company will probably be heartened by Lyft’s success. One unnamed investor told the FT that a $120 billion valuation for Uber now “doesn’t look too unreasonable.”
4352,Who didn’t win: Anyone who bought shares in Lyft after it listed on the Nasdaq.
4353,More: Meet the V.C.s who are expected to be big winners from the coming wave of tech I.P.O.s.
4354,"After rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal deal for a third time on Friday, British lawmakers will attempt again to come up with an alternative."
4355,"Parliament will vote on options later today. There are eight proposals, none of which won a majority when they were voted on last week. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, may trim down the options, which could force cohesion around a plan."
4356," Mrs. May continues to scramble. The FT reports that she is considering a fourth vote on her deal, while she grapples with a breakdown of trust inside her Conservative Party."
4357,"If Parliament remains deadlocked, Britain faces a choice: Leave the European Union without a deal on April 12, or ask Brussels for another extension."
4358,"There is a feeling of anger and embarrassment. “In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise,” Ellen Barry and Benjamin Mueller of the NYT write. “No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful. It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.”"
4359,"More:  There is at least one Brexit winner in Britain: the corporate law industry, which is profiting from companies trying to prepare."
4360,"The Amazon chief’s security consultant accused the Saudi government of gaining unauthorized access to Mr. Bezos’ phone, Karen Weise of the NYT reports:"
4361,"• “In an opinion article in The Daily Beast on Saturday, Gavin de Becker, Mr. Bezos’ security chief, alleged the Saudis wanted to hurt Mr. Bezos because he owns The Washington Post. The Post has aggressively reported on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of its columnists, who was killed last year in Turkey.”"
4362,"• “Mr. de Becker’s claims about the Saudis are difficult to verify and raise many questions. Throughout his article, the security consultant was vague on details.”"
4363,"• “On Sunday, American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, which first reported earlier this year that Mr. Bezos was having an extramarital affair, issued a statement denying ‘the false and unsubstantiated claims of Mr. de Becker.’ ”"
4364,"State lawmakers reached a $175 billion budget deal over the weekend. It promises sweeping changes to the way New Yorkers commute, shop and live, the NYT reports."
4365,"Congestion pricing — a first in the U.S. — will subject vehicles traveling below 60th Street in Manhattan to a toll. The revenue will go toward the subway and other transportation projects. Specifics, like what the charge will be, have been deferred to other authorities."

4399,"Consider the newspaper, the physical object, printed on processed wood pulp, shot upward on rollers at high speed as ink is applied, gathered and folded and bundled, dropped off at newsstands and bodegas or delivered to doorsteps. Nowadays it is a minority choice, as a majority of consumers around the globe opt to get the latest word from their screens as they zoom from one place to the next. But that minority of readers is substantial, and fierce. They savor the thrill of the first hit of newsprint in the morning, with its slightly acrid odor and its ironclad association with the first cup of coffee. They have mastered the origami skills required to read the paper on the subway. They appreciate the staggered hierarchy of the front page — the significance of the top left corner, the relative point sizes of major and minor headlines, the weight of an obituary (say) that lies above the fold, the nuance of features heralded in the bottom third — not because they are lesser but because their front-page appearance is merely the tip of a much larger body within. And they can foretell how their copy will end up: folded to the crossword puzzle, decorated with various stains, missing a recipe or a travel tip, ready to return unto pulp."
4400,"Unlike its digital counterpart, the physical newspaper is not just a transient occurrence along an ongoing stream; it is a singular phenomenon, which happens every day. The city may no longer feature vendors shouting the main headline at passing commuters, but that headline still carries a sense of urgency, can still thrill or appall when caught unexpectedly in a sidelong glance. A newspaper is a measure of days, an index of passing time. Its front page compresses the significance of a unique date into a rectangular field of words and images, its jarring list of specifics unforeseeable until press time. Why else would Picasso and Braque have chosen the newspaper as both their model and their source when they began making collages in 1912? How else could filmmakers convey the galloping speed of history but with a process-shot montage of spinning newspaper front pages? How else would kidnappers prove that their victims were still alive on a given day other than by photographing them holding that day’s Late Final?"
4401,"Online you are encouraged to compose your own newspaper, according to your personal algorithmic specifications. The paper model ensures that although you can ignore entire sections (at your peril), you will at least skim the principal news part from stem to stern, reading the headlines. Along the way you will become absorbed in stories no mathematical formula would have selected for you. And if your flight is grounded, you will end up reading the entire paper, down to the small ads, and possibly come away with several new interests as a consequence."
4402,"The newspaper in its 19th-century flowering was not just a novel and practical way of transmitting current political and military doings; it was also a great herald and artifact of modernism. It exuded the teeming, democratic randomness of the city — see the immense broadsheets of the time, with their acres of close-set columns, each one crammed with stories, each one clamoring for attention like orphans at a train window. Eventually, editors and compositors learned how to marshal their contents, to deploy them strategically around the page, to let the reader’s eye cascade from upper left to lower right and then circle around again. Most of the leading newspapers devised their own design languages, promoting a look that, although it might be austere, was very particular. A glance at a torn fragment, maybe less than an inch long, maybe affixed to the sole of a boot, would tell the observer just which paper it came from."
4403,"The newspaper is a veritable helper, with many functions in the course of the day. It wakes you in the morning, tells you things on the way to work, comes to hand when you have 10 minutes to spare or need to clear your head, sits with you during your solo lunch, ladles out the soothing stuff you’ve kept for the ride home. It can serve as a veil when you’re at a cafe terrace and wish to avoid attention, as a fan when you’re relaxing in the park on a hot day, as a pillow when you consequently cop a snooze, as a cushion for transporting pottery or glassware, as a fire starter for the hearth, as a floor covering when painting or sanding, as a liner for your cockatoo’s cage."
4404,"Oddly enough, newspapers also come in handy when you are being stalked by paparazzi. Stars, crooks and indicted officials seem to have lately overlooked this handy source of portable foliage. But fame is ever fleeting in the world of news. In the 1937 comedy “Nothing Sacred,” Carole Lombard plays a young woman apparently dying of a rare disease. Just before we find out she really isn’t, the camera lingers for a moment on the front page of some gazette, on which appears an overripe ode to her courage — and then a fish lands on top and hands wrap it up."
4405,"These are perilous times for newspapers, which all across the nation are being bought up by speculators and stripped for parts, from major papers in secondary markets to small-town bugles that sometimes have survived for a century or more. Their reportorial and editorial staffs are drastically cut, their page counts decreased, the local interest and focus that once lay at their hearts yanked in favor of wire-service summaries of national news already being covered much better everywhere else. Sometimes these papers are taken online altogether, where with their minimized resources they can be mistaken for URL place holders or the output of Romanian troll farms. For a paper to lose its print edition is to become ghostlike, immaterial."
4406,"There are plenty of fine online periodicals, of course, but those were designed with the logic of the internet in mind. The local paper, on the other hand, was meant to draw a picture of a physical community, with its customs, rituals, manners, lingo and collective memory inscribed in a thousand minute ways. Even if you get it only for the yard-sale ads or to hate-read the letters column, its presence itself is reassuring, part of the sometimes thin fabric that holds you and your neighbors together. But if you can’t buy it at the gas station along with your six pack and your night crawlers, it might as well not exist."
4407,"Nevertheless, even as the physical newspaper is diminished in numbers, it bows to no product in the modernity and total awesomeness of its production. As these spectacular photos by Christopher Payne show, this paper is produced in College Point, Queens, on machines the size of large houses, which do everything from the unwinding of the paper rolls to the folding of the complete sections. Each tower prints 28 spreads at once, front and back, in cyan, magenta, yellow and black, at ridiculous speed — 80,000 copies an hour can be produced this way. And then you can hold it in your hand, fold it, tear it, use it as a rain hat — a voluminous paper object with visual dazzle and hundreds of thousands of words, representing the collected information of that moment: news, opinion, analysis, testimony, critique, charts, graphs, photos, displays. And it happens every day, over and over again. Small wonder they call it The Daily Miracle. — Luc Sante"
4408,"Luc Sante is a writer and critic. His books include “Low Life,” “Kill All Your Darlings” and “The Other Paris.”"
4409,"Mike Connors, who manages The Times’s printing plant in College Point, Queens, started working for the Times in 1976, long before this plant was built in 1997. Connors is Fourth-generation with the Times; his family has been working for the organization for 126 years. He often works the night shift. “Urgency is second nature. You’ve got one chance at night, one inning.”"
4410,"The paper rolls are moved from storage to the presses with the help of three robotic cranes. Each roll of paper weighs 2,000 pounds and unspools 10 miles."
4411,"Finished newspaper pages are sent digitally from the newsroom to the plant and burned with lasers onto thin aluminum sheets called plates. A pressman like William Toohey, pictured below, bends each plate around a press cylinder. “Putting the plates in place requires a little bit of a knack,” he says. “There are a lot of musicians in my family. You need some dexterity in your fingers to get the plates all lined up. And fast.”"
4412,"The facility has 8,000-gallon vats of black, oil-based ink and 2,500-gallon vats of synthetic cyan, magenta and yellow ink. Tanker trucks deliver ink every week."
4413,"Pressmen calibrate each press carefully before a print run. Electricians and machinists are also on hand during this setup, to address any problems before the run begins. That includes calibrating the folder and slitter and trimmer that will process the pages once ink is applied. "
4414,"Each of the seven printing presses at the plant is several stories tall. They can print as many as 80,000 newspapers each hour of a run. College Point prints 1.7 million copies of The Times each week. There are 25 other Times print sites in the U.S., but College Point is the biggest."
4415,"Inevitably, news breaks during a press run. If it’s significant enough, the newsroom calls to “Stop the presses!” This happened after the recent tornadoes in Alabama, when Osama bin Laden was killed and during the 2016 election. Often the issues already printed aren’t scrapped, but the rest of the night’s run is dedicated to the updated version. "
4416,"Each press is shut down for one eight-hour shift each week, when press staff climb inside to remove ink buildup and wipe down crucial parts."
4417,"The Times isn’t the only newspaper the staff encounter most nights. College Point prints USA Today, Newsday and AM New York too."
4418,"Sections of the Sunday Times, like Arts & Leisure, printed earlier in the week are kept on giant rolls (with the Muller Martini storage system), then inserted in the weekend paper after it has been printed. "
4419,"The sound of the running presses and working plant is overwhelming. There are 14 miles of gripper conveyor belts overhead. Machines insert copies of the magazines and preprinted sections, and then finished papers move via conveyor to bundling machines. The bundles are stacked on pallets and fork-lifted into waiting delivery trucks."
4420,"By 3 a.m. on a typical night, all print runs are complete, and maintenance and electrical teams are moving around the plant to prepare for the next morning. College Point has a fleet of two dozen bicycles that workers use to get around the cavernous building, which feels even larger when the presses are quiet. — Caitlin Roper"
4421,"Christopher Payne’s first job, at 13, was selling newspapers on a street corner in downtown Boston. He would weave between cars stopped at a light, hawking The Boston Globe. (The paper cost 25 cents then, and he made a nickel on each copy he sold.) Growing up near The Globe’s printing plant, he could see the pressroom lit up at night while the rest of the city slept."
4422,"In 2017, Payne started photographing The Times’s College Point plant. He has gone 40 times, often losing track of time and staying late into the night as he watched the pressmen to understand their work and to anticipate where to set his camera. It’s the most challenging place he has ever photographed, he says: ‘‘It is vast, chaotic and visually overwhelming. Every press run was unique, so I never knew what to expect. Sometimes I would walk around for hours, only to leave empty-handed.’’ Shooting the presses in motion was especially tricky because of the intense vibration, but he found the deafening noise exhilarating. ‘‘When I’m climbing around the presses, I feel like I’m inside a giant engine,’’ he says."
4423,"Trained as an architect, Payne has published books of photographs on the Steinway & Sons piano factory, New York City’s power substations, state mental hospitals and an uninhabited island of ruins in the East River. For The Times Magazine, he has documented a Colombian candy factory, the American textile industry and a 130-year-old pencil factory in Jersey City, N.J. He lives in New York with his wife and daughter. "

4426,"The actor Santino Fontana had his legs waxed for the first time last year. His chest, too. He mastered, mostly, how to walk in heels and riddled out which lipsticks flatter him. (He’s an autumn. Clearly.) Last spring, during a turn in “Hello, Dolly!” he brought Bernadette Peters pictures of himself in a variety of women’s wigs. “Pretty girl” she scrawled next to some of them. Beside others: “Not so pretty girl.”"
4427,"“Like what even is a feminine side?” Mr. Fontana said recently, at a theater district bistro, as he pushed a pile of pear salad around his plate."
4428,"A Broadway veteran, Mr. Fontana, who turns 37 on March 21, is originating his first true male musical lead in “Tootsie,” which starts previews at the Marquis Theater on March 29. If you squint, it’s his first female lead, too. “He has created two very different characters who live in the same body,” Robert Horn, the show’s book writer said."
4429,"“Tootsie,” based on the 1982 Dustin Hoffman film, with music and lyrics by David Yazbek, tells the story of Michael Dorsey (Mr. Fontana), an underemployed actor and top-notch narcissist. Desperate for work, he grabs a wig and a dress, crashing a friend’s audition in female drag. (In the movie, it’s for a soap opera, here a misbegotten Broadway musical: “Juliet’s Curse.”) He lands the part. Michael Dorsey becomes Dorothy Michaels. Dorothy Michaels becomes a star. Mr. Fontana’s feminine side sings a lot of the Act One numbers."
4430,"Broadway loves men who dress, and occasionally sing, as women. Take, say, “La Cage Aux Folles” and “Kinky Boots,” as well as the developing productions of “Mrs. Doubtfire” and “To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar,” which cast Mr. Fontana in an early reading."
4431,"But Mr. Fontana typically presents as a lyric tenor, not a contralto, and he has never worn women’s clothes before, except once, in the 8th grade, when he skirted up as a cheerleader for a school skit. “It killed,” he said."
4432,"The two times I met him, once in Chicago last fall and once in New York in late winter, he was dressed low-key bro-ishly in jeans and baseball caps. One cap was red, the other one, classier, a houndstooth tweed. Dorothy is a departure."
4433,"Has his wife, the actress Jessica Fontana, endorsed all this waxing? Mostly. Ms. Fontana was, she admitted, briefly jealous of his legs. These days she’s more supportive. “Now I’m just really happy for him and how good he looks,” she said."
4434,"And speaking of support, how strange does it feel to spend eight shows a week in pantyhose?"
4435,"“It’s not any weirder than anything else,” Mr. Fontana had told me when we met for an iced coffee just before his final performance in Chicago. “It’s all weird. If you’re really doing your job, you’re never being yourself.” Still, he was looking forward to that last show. “Oh my God, I’m just so happy I don’t have to shave tomorrow,” he’d said. “And I don’t have to wear that corset.”"
4436,"But what makes “Tootsie” weirder, aside from the corset, aside from the twinned roles, aside from barn-raising a multimillion-dollar show that lives or dies on laughter, is the moment in which it arrives. Broadway has been reckoning, slowly, imperfectly, with the idea that musical comedies need to offer female characters full interiority and that maybe abuse — physical, psychological, verbal — isn’t so forgivable or funny."
4437,"That “Tootsie” is another musical with an all-male creative team makes it essential that it does right by women, even women played by men. But doing right can’t in any way stifle its reckless, headstrong comedy. Which is all to say that Mr. Fontana has some big kitten heels to fill."
4438,"Mr. Fontana was born in Stockton, Calif., the younger child of a teacher and an agronomist. He grew up in a small town in Washington state, playing baseball and acting in school plays: Wilbur in “Charlotte’s Web,” Jesus in “Godspell.” At the University of Minnesota, he completed a classical training program and at 24 he returned to Minnesota, playing Hamlet at the Guthrie. The Star Tribune compared him to the “whiny ‘Friends’ star David Schwimmer,” then fell for his antic style."
4439,"He broke into Broadway quickly, playing mostly secondary roles, like the brother in “Billy Elliot,” like the brother in “Brighton Beach Memoirs.” He did play the prince in “Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella,” opposite Laura Osnes, but he wouldn’t really count that as a lead. “I would say, like, ‘I love how much Laura has to do,’” he said. His voice work in “Frozen”? Another prince, another second man."
4440,"His characters are often cocky and almost always agonizingly vulnerable. His face — 3/4 heartthrob, 1/4 muppet — has a trampoline’s elasticity and he usually looks like he has just thought of a joke he might or he might not tell you."
4441,"At a morning rehearsal, just a few days before we had dinner in New York, he and the company were working a scene late in the second act when Michael finally removes his disguise, a gender reveal party that tanks. The scene begins in Michael’s dressing room — a chair, a table, a sofa, a prop wig lolling like a dozing red panda. The show’s director, Scott Ellis, asked Mr. Fontana to try some slightly different blocking for a song. Mr. Fontana obliged."
4442,"But as his friend, the playwright Stephen Karam had told me, Mr. Fontana “is meticulous in understanding every inch of a role.” So before he sat, before he stood, before he mimed putting on earrings, he took a few breaths to decide how and why Michael might move just then. Each gesture had to be made precise, intentional, cogent."
4443,"“He’s intense in the best way,” said Mr. Ellis who had told the show’s producers he would only direct if Mr. Fontana could star."
4444,"The word “intense” came up a lot when colleagues discussed Mr. Fontana. Also: “Smart” and “passionate” and “focused.” Is someone so “focused” tough to work with? A lot of people will recognize Mr. Fontana from “Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,” a popular television comedy that he insisted on exiting, a possible red flag. (For the record: He says he left because he’d never intended to do an hourlong series, because his wife’s career is in New York, because he missed theater. TV can wait until he’s “tapped out,” he said. Skylar Astin now plays the role.)"
4445,"But every colleague I spoke to described his playfulness, his generosity. “He’s never throwing you under the bus to get a laugh,” said Joanna Gleason, who starred opposite him in Mr. Karam’s “Sons of the Prophet.”"
4446,"Still, the character of Michael, a perfectionist and a straight shooter, pursuing his art like some creepy stalker, came easily. (Is Michael Mr. Fontana minus any emotional intelligence? Basically.) Dorothy was a tougher nut. She couldn’t be a joke, she couldn’t be a caricature. Michael invents her on the fly, yes, but the audience should still feel a waft of estrogen whenever she walks on."
4447,"To make Dorothy so persuasive that his wife has asked to hang out with her at home (“I was like, ‘You’re nuts,’” Mr. Fontana said), he began with hair and makeup — looks matter! Months before rehearsals for the Chicago tryout began, he sent some early makeup tests to Mr. Ellis, who emailed back asking, “What sick world are you in?”"
4448,"He interviewed a bunch of women, his wife, his family, his friends, studying physical vocabulary. He borrowed especially from his mother. She doesn’t see the resemblance. He worked with Joan Lader, his longtime voice teacher, to find the right timbre for Dorothy."
4449,"“It’s not a cartoon voice,” Ms. Lader said, speaking by telephone. “It’s not like Mickey Mouse, it’s not really falsetto.” The notes, she said, “sound quite female.”"
4450,"In Dorothy, Mr. Fontana found a character who has to walk the tightrope (yes, in heels) that many professional women will recognize. “She has to be,” he said, “assertive, but not bitchy, compassionate, but not emotional.” And unlike Michael, she still finds the energy to take care of everyone else in the room."
4451,"Mr. Fontana had more to do. He wanted a show that would be worthy of Dorothy, of the women who inspired her. He advocated for an ending in which Michael owns up to the women he’d defrauded, something the movie doesn’t include, “which is shocking,” he said. And he arranged a meeting with the writer Rebecca Traister, who happens to be a staunch “Tootsie” fan, to discuss the show’s gender dynamics. They had several conversations that Ms. Traister, speaking by telephone, described as complicated and nuanced."
4452,"The first talk was on the day of Mr. Fontana’s first chest-waxing. “I felt he was extremely attuned to experiences he might not have been attuned to before,” she said. “He was deeply committed to this being a feminist show and that he wanted to do everything in his power to make it one,” she said."
4453,"Mr. Fontana wasn’t quite so forthright with me. Maybe he didn’t want to mansplain. The only time he used the word feminist was in praise of Ms. Traister. Maybe he didn’t want to take up more space than an actor should. But he did say, more generally, that while it’s up to men to listen to women it’s also up to them to become part of the conversation. “I want to help,” he said."
4454,"Standing up for his character has made him more aware of how men treat men, how men treat women, how people compliment his wife’s looks before they mention her talent, how his co-stars might sometimes need an escort to the subway, “because it’s dangerous to walk! Down the street!” He added a few expletives."
4455,"As Ms. Fontana told me, “This experience has given him true empathy.” He has had to listen to people obsessing over his hair and clothes and figure — “Pretty girl,” “Not so pretty girl” — and he has had to obsess over them, too, while also arguing about what a woman can do and say and be."
4456,"After the Chicago run, Ms. Fontana overheard her husband speaking to the costume designer, William Ivey Long, about that awful corset. As an actress who has sometimes had to sacrifice comfort for aesthetics, she listened in. She heard him ask if they could lose the corset, if they could find something less snug. And then she heard him say, “But I don’t want to sacrifice the waistline in that red dress.”"
4457,Just what a woman — or a man passionately committed to playing one — would say.
4458,"AUSTIN, Tex. — When she was around 11, Lupita Nyong’o’s parents brought home a cassette tape that changed her life. It was of the song “Regulate” by the West Coast hip-hop dynasts Warren G and Nate Dogg. Nyong’o and her five siblings, then living in a suburb of Nairobi, could only partially savor the lyrics of the song — a hearty, slang-ridden narrative of a thwarted mugging, topped with a soupçon of ceremonial group sex. But the music was hypnotic and evocative, suggesting an absorbing pocket universe. Nyong’o remembers wearing the tape out, rewinding it over and over until she knew all of the words by heart."
4459,"Of the many apparently effortless but difficult-to-emulate things the 36-year-old star of “Us,” the new psychological horror film from Jordan Peele, has done in front of a camera, it’s worth taking a moment to consider the rapping. She’s done it twice, both times in videos filmed in the back seat of a car and posted on Instagram: the first to celebrate her three millionth follower and the second with her “Black Panther” co-star Letitia Wright, on the week of the film’s premiere."
4460,"No one would call Nyong’o the next Warren G, but something about watching her rap disturbs an inner accountant. Here is a person whose very first appearance in a feature film, as the unforgettable Patsey in “12 Years a Slave” (2013), made her the seventh black woman and first black African to win an Academy Award for acting; a person whose doll-like facial symmetry and frictionless skin has landed her four solo appearances on the cover of Vogue; a person who speaks four languages and holds a graduate degree from Yale."
4461,"And this same person, wearing dark sunglasses and facetiously calling herself Troublemaker, reveals that she also can rap, with appropriate levels of insouciance and conviction, and while remaining on beat. One suspects the divine dealer of dereliction of duty."
4462,"Nyong’o discussed her hip-hop hobby on an afternoon earlier this month in Austin, where she had come to the South by Southwest film festival to unveil “Us,” due March 22. Like the rap videos, her foray into horror represents both an abstention from, and an implicit critique of, the Hollywood playbook for stars of her pedigree. Though she has been deliberate about creating a space for herself in an industry that wasn’t built for her, inhabiting and defending that space is another matter. Nyong’o’s performance in “Us,” already earning ecstatic reviews, is a shot across the bow to anyone who would deny her her due."
4463,"It was overcast and humid. But we caught a breeze on a digressive walk around Lady Bird Lake on the edge of downtown. Nyong’o, who was dressed for an earlier panel discussion in a gray and black gingham pantsuit, black heels and matching round sunglasses, was trailed by two barrel-chested bodyguards, who kept a wide berth at their client’s polite but firm insistence. As we wound between naked trees down a semi-paved path, more than a few rubberneckers shot her adoring grins and sheepish waves."
4464,"Her normal life is much lower maintenance. She’s lived in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn for several years, having opted to stay on the East Coast after school, and spends quiet weekends going to the farmer’s market, or to local restaurants, where, she said with relief, “New Yorkers are too busy to recognize people.”"
4465,"But such normalcy grows scarcer by the day. Nyong’o spent much of the last two years preparing for, shooting and promoting Marvel’s “Black Panther,” in which she played Nakia, an idealistic Wakandan spy and the hero’s love interest. The film’s worldwide success may turn the Oscar-winning actress into a blockbuster heroine, a rarefied combination that “Us” is positioned to affirm."
4466,"In it, she plays both Adelaide, the matriarch of the charming Wilson family, and Red, her bloodthirsty doppelgänger. Peele wrote the characters with Nyong’o in mind, and the two were close collaborators on interpreting the script. They met for the first time shortly after Nyong’o wrapped “Panther” (during production of that film, the actress and lifelong horror fan organized a cast field trip to see Peele’s surprise 2017 smash, “Get Out”) and quickly hit it off."
4467,"“He was really inviting of my thoughts and ideas,” she said. “He’ll have this kernel of an idea that is so strong, and then he’ll keep adding to it and clarifying his intentions as he goes along. When he cast me in the movie, I joined him in that process.”"
4468,"In an interview, Peele said he was grateful for the second pair of eyes. “Right out of the gate she was asking questions about the characters that I didn’t know the answer to — and I knew everything about them,” he said."
4469,"In the film’s story, as carefully as it can be described without spoilers, Adelaide embarks on a beachside vacation with her husband (fellow “Black Panther” alumnus Winston Duke) and their two children. It turns cataclysmic when another family of mysterious origin — their mirror images, but as filtered through a particularly ghastly nightmare — shows up on their doorstep."
4470,"Peele seeded his script with cryptic prompts for the look and feel of Adelaide’s evil double. One concerned Red’s movement, which Peele conveyed with just two exceptionally creepy words: Queen cockroach."
4471,"Another prompt indicated that Red had a scratchy voice, as if withered from lack of use. That seed — contained in a single sentence on the page — was fertilized when Nyong’o attended a fashion event where, to her surprise, she heard a speaker whose voice she thought sounded close to what Peele was describing. The speaker was Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has spasmodic dysphonia, a neurological disorder that causes involuntary spasms of the larynx. In the film, Nyong’o’s hair-raising performance is defined by a haunting amplification of the disorder, which sounds like what might happen if you swallowed a cheese grater."
4472,"Nyong’o’s set debut in costume as Red, for a long, unbroken monologue that fills in the character’s life story, was one of the most dramatic moments of the shoot."
4473,"“She walked into the room and you just felt the air suck out of it,” Peele said. “The first time she did that scene was magic. I think we shot it like 10 times — just because we could — and it was always gold.”"
4474,"On the trail in Austin, Nyong’o was recalling how she fell in love with acting when something — someone — broke her focus. It was a large man in a faded T-shirt and white earbuds walking behind us, talking so loudly that we were struggling to hear one another. Nyong’o stopped and turned around. As the man passed by, she gave him a look of such elegant and devastating ferocity that I thought he might evaporate mid-stride, leaving only the earbuds behind. The bodyguards may not have been necessary after all."
4475,"Her aunt had been a theater actress in Nairobi, and Nyong’o’s siblings and cousins would perform short skits at family gatherings. Acting was a way to win attention from (and manipulate the emotions of) her mother and father, who defied the stereotype of African parents by encouraging their children to pursue their passions."
4476,"Both accompanied their daughter to the “Us” premiere. Nyong’o’s father, Peter, is a politician and the governor of Kisumu County in Kenya. As a young college professor and critic of former President Daniel arap Moi, he temporarily exiled himself and his family to Mexico City, where Nyong’o was born and given a Spanish name inspired by their adopted home. Her mother, Dorothy, is a public relations consultant and the managing trustee of the Africa Cancer Foundation, founded by her husband."
4477,Nyong’o credited her mother in particular for her self-confidence.
4478,"“She’s dignified in the things she knows, and she’s dignified in the things she doesn’t,” she said. “She’s not afraid to admit that she has something to learn. And that quality is something that I seek to emulate — to be able to be comfortable in the discomfort of not knowing, or the feeling that you’re unprepared.”"
4479,"“Us” is only Nyong’o’s fourth live-action appearance in a film since her debut, and as a lead actress, she is still learning how and where she wants to apply herself. Many in her position would accept as much work as their schedules would bear, fearing the laws of gravity that can bring Hollywood prodigies abruptly back to earth. But here, too, Nyong’o has defied expectations. She believes her creativity is a finite resource and doesn’t offer it easily."
4480,"“I’m not creative all the time, I’m just not,” she said. “Each role depletes me in some way, and I know that I do my best work when I’ve had time to remain fallow.”"
4481,"Being selective has meant saying no to star vehicles that other actresses would relish. After she won her Oscar, Nyong’o was approached to headline the American remake of the Mexican action thriller “Miss Bala,” but ultimately decided not to move forward with the project. (The film was released last month starring Gina Rodriguez.)"
4482,"“I just realized that whatever I’m interested in didn’t fit into the story, so I chose to bow out,” Nyong’o said. “I didn’t feel like I had the right perspective for it.”"
4483,"Her awareness that few historical models exist for female movie stars of color, particularly those with dark skin, has made her especially mindful of the example she is setting."
4484,"With “Black Panther,” Nyong’o was part of a seismic shift away from whiteness as the unquestioned default in American popular cinema. “Us,” in which the race of the central characters — though affirmatively black — is never depicted as remarkable, gave her a chance to take that shift a step further."
4485,"“It’s really not exceptional to be black, or to be African, and I think that’s a powerful statement in and of itself,” she said. “We can be seen and perceived as part and parcel of the global experience, because that is the truth.”"
4486,"In Austin, where the sun had finally emerged, we left the lake behind and turned toward downtown, where Nyong’o was due at her hotel to get dressed for the “Us” premiere later that night."
4487,"Before we arrived, she told me a story about a time when she still felt beholden to the expectations of others. It was by way of explaining her excitement over another creative coup, as both producer and star of a coming mini-series adaptation of the novel “Americanah,” by the Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie."
4488,"As a young, Kenyan-Mexican actress living and working in America, Nyong’o said she had made a habit of suppressing her accent, a natural composite of the places she’s lived."
4489,"“I was only speaking in the American accent, because my feeling, and the feeling that was communicated to me in school, was that having an African accent would limit your possibilities,” she said."
4490,"After she wrapped “12 Years a Slave,” newly facing the prospect of a public life, the inauthenticity of her voice became a source of anxiety. Encouragement came from a novel Nyong’o was reading at the time, “Americanah,” in which the main character, Ifemelu, is a Nigerian immigrant who also attends an Ivy League school and also has given up her natural tongue."
4491,"Burdened eventually with shame and regret, longing to be seen — and heard — as her ordinarily extraordinary self, Ifemelu giddily repents."
4492,"“I remember I was on the subway when I was reading that,” Nyong’o said. “I just wept.”"

4494,The Tesla C.E.O. responded to the accusation that he violated a fraud settlement with the S.E.C. by declaring that the regulator was trying to muzzle him.
4495,"The S.E.C. asked for Mr. Musk to be held in contempt of court over a tweet about Tesla production volumes, which it says infringed a settlement that put limitations on his social-media use. Tesla conceded that lawyers didn’t review the tweet before it was sent."
4496,"That response “smacks of retaliation and censorship,” Tesla’s lawyers argue. They say the regulator is asking a court “to trample on” Mr. Musk’s First Amendment rights, perhaps because it’s embarrassed by criticism. And they contend that Mr. Musk has cut his Tesla-related tweeting by nearly half."
4497,"They also say the tweet was innocuous, “simply Musk’s shorthand gloss on and entirely consistent with prior public disclosures detailing Tesla’s anticipated production volume.”"

4500,"Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London."
4501,____________________________
4502,"The White House sent its budget proposal for the 2020 fiscal year to Congress yesterday, requesting $4.75 trillion. Here’s a look at President Trump’s priorities:"
4503,"No deficit reduction — for a long time. Mr. Trump’s budget projects trillion-dollar deficits for the next four years, and no balanced budget for 15. And that’s on an expectation of consistently strong economic growth, with no recession in the next decade. (Independent economists think that’s unlikely.)"
4504,"Steep cuts to environmental projects. The White House proposed cutting the E.P.A.’s budget by 31 percent and the Interior Department’s by 14 percent, as well as reducing funding for renewable energy research by 70 percent."
4505,"And similar treatment for Medicare. There, Mr. Trump’s proposal envisions up to $845 billion in cuts, to a service he promised not to touch during the 2016 campaign. It comes as many Democratic presidential contenders are pushing Medicare for all."
4506,"But big boosts to the military and infrastructure. The Pentagon would receive a 5 percent increase in funds — more than it had requested. The White House wants $200 billion for infrastructure spending, too."
4507,"Democrats immediately dismissed the proposal. “This is a budget that we will not take seriously,” Representative Jim Yarmuth, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said. But Democrats will now be forced to reveal their own budget priorities."
4508,Shares in the company fell 5 percent yesterday as governments pressed it for answers over the fatal Ethiopian Airlines crash — the second time a new 737 Max 8 jet has crashed within five months.
4509,"Governments and airlines are grounding jets. Australia, China and Indonesia stopped use of the Max 8; Singapore banned all flights involving the broader family of Max jets. In total, at least 20 airlines have grounded their Max 8s — but not Southwest Airlines or American Airlines. About 40 percent of the world’s 737 Max fleet is grounded, the WSJ estimates."
4510,Airline workers are worried too. The Association of Flight Attendants called on the F.A.A. to review the 737 Max. And a former safety official for America’s biggest pilots’ union told the NYT that his colleagues in the industry were “very concerned.”
4511,"The F.A.A. hasn’t yet grounded the 737 Max, despite calls from two U.S. senators to do so. But the agency did demand that Boeing  update flight control software by April, along with manuals and pilot training requirements."
4512,"The damage to Boeing may be huge. Analysts estimate that the 737 Max lineup represents about two-thirds of its future deliveries and 40 percent of its profits, according to the WSJ. “Boeing has lost control of the timetable to provide the safe, reliable solution,” Neil Hansford of the consulting firm Strategic Aviation Solutions told Bloomberg. “The longer it goes, the more chance Boeing has of losing orders.”"
4513,"A lawsuit accusing Alphabet’s board of responding to misconduct cases by paying off executives, rather than firing them, has confirmed the size of those payouts, Daisuke Wakabayashi of the NYT writes."
4514,"• Alphabet’s board agreed to pay Amit Singhal, who ran Google’s search operations, as much as $45 million when he resigned from the company in 2016 after being accused of groping a subordinate, according to board discussions that form part of the lawsuit."
4515,"• Board meeting minutes cited in the lawsuit also confirm the NYT’s previous reporting of a $90 million exit package for Andy Rubin, who once led its Android division, after he was accused of sexual misconduct."
4516,"The case also shows the power exerted by Larry Page, the Google co-founder who is now Alphabet’s C.E.O., Mr. Wakabayashi writes, describing it as “a window into the workings of Alphabet’s board”:"
4517,"• Mr. Rubin was offered a pay package of $650,000 (and a potential bonus of more than double that) in April 2014 while he was an adviser to Google and no longer running the Android business."
4518,"• He declined the offer until he had spoken to Mr. Page. In August 2014, Mr. Page awarded a $150 million stock grant to Mr. Rubin."
4519,"• After the $150 million grant was awarded, a Google official emailed the board committee asking for approval of Mr. Rubin’s $90 million compensation. It was approved."
4520,"Less than 24 hours before a potentially decisive vote by lawmakers, Prime Minister Theresa May secured legal assurances from the E.U. in a bid to save her unpopular Brexit deal, Stephen Castle of the NYT writes."
4521,"“After a telephone call with Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, Mrs. May flew to meet him in Strasbourg, where the European Parliament is holding a plenary session,” Mr. Castle writes."
4522,"The new provisions clarify the temporary nature of terms relating to the Irish border. “This provision is designed to prevent a hard border being created between Ireland, which will remain in the E.U., and Northern Ireland, which is part of the U.K.,” Mr. Castle writes."
4523,"Now comes the hard part. Parliament will vote on Mrs. May’s updated deal later today, but Mr. Castle said it remained “unclear that the concessions agreed by the E.U. negotiators would be enough to prevent another defeat.” (She lost the last one by 230 votes in a 650-seat Parliament.) Critics say that the E.U. hasn’t conceded much — and her own attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, appears to agree."
4524,"If no agreement is reached by March 29, Britain will leave the E.U. without a deal. Mrs. May has promised British lawmakers that, should she lose today, they could vote on whether to leave without an agreement. If they decide against that, next would be a vote on whether to request an extension of negotiations."
4525,"But Mr. Juncker warned, “It is this deal, or Brexit may not happen at all.”"
4526,"For decades, the business center of New York City has been in Midtown Manhattan. That could change, Joshua Chaffin of the FT reports, as the new Hudson Yards development opens on the Far West Side."
4527,"• A key selling point of Hudson Yards: office buildings that include “floor-to-ceiling windows, whizzing elevators and towers without interior columns, which allows for uninterrupted floor plans.”"
4528,"• Jeff Blau, the C.E.O. of Related Companies, which developed the area, said that the real estate was meant to be attractive to millennials — and companies that want to hire them."
4529,"• Among those moving in is the investment giant KKR, whose co-founder, Henry Kravis, described the buildings as having “what younger people want today.”"
4530,• Others relocating to Hudson Yards — which has as much office real estate as central Pittsburgh — include BlackRock and the hedge fund Third Point.
4531,• But the FT notes that the tech companies who inspired Hudson Yards are largely absent.
4532,"Yesterday, the world wide web entered its fourth decade. Its inventor, Tim Berners-Lee, has reflected on the criticism that now dogs the products and platforms using his creation. And he has some plans for how to clean up the network:"
4533,"• “Given how much the web has changed in the past 30 years, it would be defeatist and unimaginative to assume that the web as we know it can’t be changed for the better in the next 30.”"
4534,"• “Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative, and open.”"
4535,"• “Companies must do more to ensure that their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact, or public safety. Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity, and security in mind.”"
4536,"• “And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable for the commitments they make, and demand that both respect the web as a global community with citizens at its heart.”"
4537,"• “The web is for everyone, and collectively we hold the power to change it.”"

4567,"My admittance to Stanford was my golden ticket to a college nicknamed “Paradise,” where learning from Pulitzer Prize-winning authors and being mentored by paradigm-changing scientists were normal. Stanford opened doors I never even knew existed, having grown up in a small, agricultural town in Northern California. A little thing called an “endowment” changed my life. "
4568,"When I graduated in 2018, I was no longer a small-town girl, but rather a young adult, itching to contribute something meaningful. Stanford transformed my flimsy desire to become a doctor into a fiery passion to become a leader in health care — all because I had witnessed this leadership in my mentors and friends."
4569,"Today, I still question what it means to attend an “elite” college, especially as admissions scandals unfold. But what I do know is that these colleges can open doors for those who want to rectify flawed systems and are hungry to elevate others. Small-town girls like me just need the exposure. To those on admissions committees: Admit more of us. Doing so can improve communities and generations to come."

4571,To the Editor:
4572,"I have a vivid recollection of the conversation that occurred in the parking lot of an independent prep school where I taught years ago. A colleague asked me, somewhat incredulously, “Wait a minute — you went to a state college?” There was a pause as I nodded in the affirmative, then came the kicker: “Oh, but I thought you were brilliant.”"
4573,"In places such as these, and too often in the job market, attending an “elite” college matters very much. The fact is, it shouldn’t matter at all. My dad was retired; we could not afford an expensive college. I earned a full-tuition scholarship and paid my own way. I pursued graduate work at an “elite” engineering school and earned an advanced degree from a large university. Neither was inherently superior in terms of the education it delivered."
4574,The college experiences that shaped my life the most centered around getting to know people from diverse backgrounds and learning to solve problems independently. Where or if a person went to college should matter far less than what a person has learned and become along the way in life.

4577,"My community college experience saved my life. After graduating from high school, moving around and floundering in minimum-wage jobs, I returned to my hometown to live with my parents. I was depressed and attempted suicide. During my recovery, I started attending the community college in my hometown. At first, I resisted enrolling in our local community college because I felt there was a stigma. But when I did, I found a menagerie of students from all walks of life and professors who were deeply passionate about their students."
4578,"Class by class, the depression that had held me down for so long began to lift. I joined the honors program and then helped mentor other students. I presented at an undergraduate research conference. Along the way, I met my fiancé and built a network of peers and mentors who helped me get where I am today."
4579,"I cannot emphasize enough the importance of community colleges. Their support systems, small and tight-knit communities, and affordability are truly unrivaled. Today, I am working to destigmatize the college experience I owe everything to."

4582,"I arrived for my freshman year at Yale still wondering why I had been admitted. I was delighted and humbled by my access to all the resources, human and physical, that a great and prestigious university has to offer. I wish I could do it again, but as an adult. Yale was an amazing treat, like being taken on an exotic vacation."
4583,"My diploma must have conferred a little prestige when I went looking for a job, but that’s all. In my 45 years in the working world, I always saw employees judged on cooperation and performance, not pedigree. In fact, being thought of as an intellectual fancy pants became an obstacle once in a while."
4584,"A degree from a fancy school is like having a fancy suit. Delightful if you care about such things, but overpriced, overhyped and meaningless in our universal quest toward living a life we love."

4588,"Duke. That single word changed my life in 1966. It’s right there on my license plate. DUKEMD. I had never been south of Washington, D.C. I had not even visited the campus of my “safety” school in North Carolina. I was going to Yale. Except I didn’t get in."
4589,"I found myself in a foreign land of segregated restaurants, hushpuppies that you ate, not wore, alpaca sweaters, tassel loafers, ties at football games and something called Brunswick stew. I also discovered that people with thick Southern accents could run rings around me in chemistry class. And I thought I was smart!"
4590,"I was pre-med, but I took many mandatory liberal arts courses. Thank goodness I did. It was in Religion 2 that I first read the New Testament and in psychology that I read Freud. Those classes left the biggest impressions on me as they opened my horizons to novel (for me) ways of thinking."
4591,"I owe the rest of my 50 years, including meeting my wife in Duke Medical School, to that very foreign land in Durham, N.C. Did it matter that I went to Duke? I bet my life it did."

4594,"I graduated in 1957 from a competitive public high school in Brooklyn. After my brother entered Swarthmore in 1951 when I was 11, my mother began grooming me and pressuring me to get admitted there, too. I worked hard academically, became an editor of a school publication, and took tutoring lessons all to prevent the catastrophe of being rejected."
4595,"I did get into Swarthmore, and during my first semester began to experience the incapacitating depressions that would haunt me for the rest of my life. I still remember clearly my first visit home at Thanksgiving. I was riding the IRT subway to Brooklyn and looking at the other riders and thinking, “I wonder if any of these people are smart enough to go to Swarthmore, but I’m sure they are all happier than I am.”"

4598,"Can four years change your life? I arrived on the Brandeis campus in the late summer of 1982, a fresh-faced kid from a small town in upstate New York. During my time at school I met the woman who would become my wife. Made friends who are still my closest. Became a Deadhead. Partied a lot (sorry, Mom and Dad!). Studied a bit. Began playing guitar."
4599,"I learned how big the world actually is, and realized for the first time how much a part of that world I was. My mind grew, opened up. My heart changed. I became, essentially and fundamentally, who I am today."
4600,"One conversation with a professor sticks with me. I was a middling student. He grabbed me after class and we talked for maybe five minutes. I don’t remember exactly what he said. It had something to do with my potential, with something he saw in me that I didn’t see. I walked out of his office and thought of myself in a different way. Suddenly there was an intellectual curiosity, almost a kind of muse, that I am still following. I wonder if he ever knew?"

4606,"I earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees from South Dakota State University in the 1990s. Immediately after graduating I moved to the East Coast, where many people I met couldn’t find South Dakota on a map and had certainly never heard of the university. I was able to find jobs with good companies in various large cities and to build a decent career. After a few years in the work force, it seemed to matter more where I had worked than where I went to college. "
4607,"I was probably not called in to interview by some companies because I hadn’t attended a prestigious university, but there are plenty of great employers who look at more than alma mater. All that said, I’ve seen how attending certain schools opens many doors. It’s not a guarantee of success, but there’s no denying that graduates of top schools have a leg up."
4608,"I have a 2-year-old and I already think about where she’ll go to college. It will ultimately be her choice, but I will strongly suggest elite institutions. Despite my own positive experience and my desire for it to not matter, it absolutely does."

Sister Colman cast me in Shaw’s “Arms and the Man” and I fell in love with the theater."

A student of Auden and Roethke at Bennington College, she taught us how to write and be passionate about poetry. Her office was in the basement next to the janitor’s closet. She smoked cigars, ashing them into a cracked teacup she kept on her desk. I still read and write poetry today, and it’s because of her."

I confess to have attended only to prove to my parents, my friends and myself that I could “get in.” Although I made several lifelong friendships and, because of a captivating professor in the music department, developed a love for music that sustains me to this day, I was far too immature to benefit from the potentially excellent education that I neglected to take advantage of."
4622,"Although I confess to having enjoyed the cachet evoked by my school’s name, I’ve often regretted that I didn’t attend a large coed school with football and basketball games (and parties) to attend — or wished that a “gap year” had been available so that I could have had a year to experience the real world before being immersed in an ivory tower that, perhaps at one year older, I would have appreciated more."

4632,"Analia Acevedo, a 22 year-old who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, joined the app during her final year at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale. There, she said, “most of the students would use it.”"
4633,"“Sometimes it makes me feel paranoid, and afraid knowing that there is a lot that goes on,” she said. “It does give me some comfort knowing my surroundings, but I’m always torn between wanting to know and see everything, or to have that blind eye toward everything.” "
4634,"Conflicted enthusiasm is a common sentiment among Citizen users: I don’t know if I want to know, but I can’t not know. In any case, it’s free, it’s right there, and it’s always refreshed. It’s a new feed. And as with our other feeds, it can be hard to look away."
4635,"Other feeds are full of friends and photos, made for you to see. This one is full of information that feels faintly illicit. To new users, the app itself can feel like a bit of a mystery, too. Where does it come from? How does it work? What … does it want? Here’s what we know."
4636,"Before there was Citizen, there was Vigilante, founded by Andrew Frame, formerly of the internet-based phone company Ooma. “Vigilante is a new technology that opens up the 911 system,” said a launch announcement for the app in 2016. “With Vigilante,” it continued, “vital information is unlocked and everyone can do their part.” This sounded an awful lot like, well, a prompt for vigilantism. At the time, the New York Police Department issued a critical statement: “Crimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cellphone.” Soon thereafter the app was removed from Apple’s App Store for violating the company’s policies. "
4637,"But Citizen is Vigilante, redesigned and relaunched, with a less of an emphasis on what it might get you into, and a bit more on what it might let you avoid. The NYPD spokesman at the time the department was disavowing Vigilante, Peter Donald, now works for the company, and was the employee who responded to questions about the app."
4638,"Vigilante’s #CrimeNoMore hashtag has been replaced with Citizen’s #ProtectTheWorld. Citizen’s parent company, Sp0n, has raised 13 million dollars from Silicon Valley investors, according to Crunchbase, with seed money coming from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund."
4639,"Citizen debuted in New York City in 2017, then opened in the San Francisco Bay Area. It launched in Baltimore in February, and Los Angeles last week. The company says it has plans to expand to more cities soon. Citizen has not shared user numbers, but it’s been rated over 19 thousand times in Apple’s App Store, and it displays a tally of notifications it sends: More than 31 thousand phones near Times Square buzzed about the flaming cab, according to the app."
4640,"It is not clear, at first, where Citizen’s reports come from or how they’re selected. But they arrive constantly, in an authoritative voice, providing the app’s signature ambient sense of alarm and disorder. "
4641,"Under the hood, Citizen is essentially a transcription service for emergency radio. The company employs teams of people to listen to police, fire and emergency radio transmissions and to submit certain categories of incident for including in the app. (“Citizen has a detailed editorial guide about what goes into the app and why,” Mr. Donald said. “Citizen does not include, for example, suicides inside a private residence, suspicious people, or vague suspect descriptions.”) "
4642,"For decades, it’s been possible to listen to emergency broadcasts with hardware police scanners, used by hobbyists, reporters, off-duty law enforcement and neighborhood busybodies. (And, occasionally, ambulance-chasing lawyers. Or criminals.) "
4643,"Citizen, however, is devoting resources to converting raw scanner traffic — which is by nature unvetted and mostly operational — into filtered curated digital content, legible to regular people, rendered on a map in a far more digestible form. Rich Carlson, a retired Chicago-area police officer, a longtime scanner enthusiast and salesperson for a company that sells scanner devices, compared Citizen to long-gone “notification networks” of three decades ago, in which “operators” would listen to scanners and send out alerts to members’ pagers. "
4644,"But Citizen isn’t just for listening and watching. The app suggests, in some cases, that users go out to stream and document incidents that are unfolding around them. This is unusual. “Our mantra in the scanner business, and with the clubs, is: listen to it at home, and stay home,” Mr. Carlson said. “We never recommend people go to an incident.” "
4645,"If you install Citizen, and check it enough, chances are the app will ask you if you’re able to safely stream from a nearby scene. This results in a lot of footage of smoke, and of police cars parked outside of buildings. Occasionally there’s something more gripping or morbid: someone trapped on the other side of an elevator door, waiting to be freed; a raccoon running around a store; a mangled car; a sheet over a body. "
4646,"Mike Pecchillo, 32, lives in Ozone Park, Queens, and has broadcast on Citizen a handful of times. “I’m kind of like the nosy neighbor,” he said. He checks the app regularly, and subscribes to other scanner feeds on social media. (He’s thinking about buying a real radio, soon.) When he hears about something nearby, he’ll go to the scene. Maybe there he’ll stream to Citizen, where he said he once had over three thousand viewers. “The chats can get wild,” he said. "
4647,"But he’ll also check Stringr, an app that pays users to record footage to be sold to news organizations, to see if they want a recording. “It really depends on what it is,” he said. “There was a shooting nearby, and I was there in two seconds. Stringr was paying like 60 bucks for that footage.” (Citizen footage, with a logo watermark, is provided to television stations free of charge.)"
4648,"Mr. Pecchillo’s hobby puts him in the occasional company of other Citizen users, some of whom take the task quite seriously. One user, who works under the name BoyWonder, has broadcast on the app more than 675 times. He can be spotted all around Brooklyn, ending his broadcasts with “catch you on my next scene.” Another popular user has streamed over 200 times under the username “CityStreets.” "
4649,"“More than 100,000 live videos have been recorded on Citizen,” Mr. Donald said. “The overwhelming majority of these videos have been streamed by organic users on our safety network.”"
4650,"The company has experimented with modes of production. A former contractor with the company said that, for a time in 2017, he was paid to create video for the app. (He signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company; The Times has agreed not to share his name). "
4651,"“We had a small crew,” he said. “We met at the office a few times.” The company instructed him how to produce the footage they wanted: to narrate; to record stable footage; to interview people. He was told not to claim he was working for Citizen. He worked in “sort-of shifts,” he said, and compared the job to previous work he had done for Postmates, the delivery app. “There would be all kinds of ways they would pay,” he said. “The number of views when you went live, how long you went live, whether it became a ‘story,’” he said. (“When new markets are opened, Citizen works with a team of ambassadors to meet with key community groups and introduce our technology,” Mr. Donald said.)The contractor said he made about $250 a week on average. A 2017 job listing posted by the company sought a “Freelance Smartphone Reporter” to join “a new kind of street team.”"
4652,"“Your primary task will be to witness and live stream incidents such as crimes, fires, and other emergency events going on in the city,” the listing said, “all from your mobile phone.”"
4653,"The company is also quietly testing a new tool called GuardianNet, which makes available a version of Citizen’s internal scanner-listening software to regular users. After agreeing to a set of rules and guidelines for which types of incidents to report — volunteer-produced reports are still vetted by employees before they appear in the app — I was able to log into the app and watch other “Dispatchers” work in a control-center-like interface. In the application’s chat room, a volunteer chatted with Citizen employees about a “code three” nearby — lights and sirens — before telling them that he had to go, because he was running late for class. "
4654,"“We have been exploring ways to get the community more involved in helping bring awareness to different neighborhoods and help others stay safe,” Mr. Donald said. “We are moving slowly and thoughtfully to ensure we get it right.”"
4655,"Citizen is just one of a growing number of app-based options for making yourself either more aware of your surroundings or just extremely paranoid. (Or both.) Nextdoor, the neighborhood-based social media app, has long seen its communities become obsessed with crime and the real and imagined threat thereof. It has struggled for years with racial profiling by its users. Ring, the controversial Amazon-owned internet-connected doorbell company, lets users upload videos recorded by their devices to a neighborhood feed, which is supplemented by Citizen-style crime reports. "
4656,"Nextdoor is a wide-ranging social network, and Ring sells hardware that put a camera on your house. What Citizen says it offers to users is awareness and safety: “Citizen is empowering everyday people to participate in their own safety,” said a spokesman for the company in a statement. The company shared recent stories that emphasized how information in the app could be actionable for users. A Citizen user helped find an abducted boy in Manhattan after the app sent out an alert. Last year, Dan Humphry, a law student at Fordham, was notified by the app of a fire in his own apartment building. “It was about 3 or 4 in the morning, and I wake up, smelling smoke,” he said. “I look at my phone and there’s an alert.”"
4657,"“Users write to us every day telling us how Citizen is changing how they engage with their neighborhoods,” the company says in its publicity materials. But this is believable in multiple potentially conflicting ways. Apps with maps are among the most powerful on our phones. They show us our world from space and offer at least an illusion of control and omniscience. Filling one with reports of possible crimes and danger, instead of restaurants or friends, is potent. In Citizen chats, some users earnestly wonder what’s happening, and if everyone at a scene is ok. Others simply gawk, demanding a better angle from a streamer, or making guesses at what happened. There’s a lot about decline, and about “bad neighborhoods.” This specific type of awareness can inform. It can also be alienating. Most commenters ignore the open bigots and trolls. But they show up where and when you might expect them, to offer their take on the crime unfolding down the street."
4658,"What Citizen wants from its users is less clear. There are no ads, and there is no way to pay for the app. “The company is exclusively focused on growing the safety networking over the next significant period of time,” the company says. Citizen asks its users for full access to their phones’ location data, which is a potentially lucrative resource on its own.  It also asks users for access to contacts. But, the company says, “Citizen does not advertise or sell user data.”"
4659,"There are, however, hints that the company may see a role for itself on the inside of the emergency response infrastructure. "
4660,"When the app launched in Los Angeles, the company published a conventional announcement: “Citizen Comes to Protect the City of Angels.” It also published a call for users around Greater Los Angeles to contact their police chiefs, fire chiefs and mayors, asking them to grant Citizen access to their radios, which, as is increasingly popular across the country, encrypt communications. That means that in pockets around Los Angeles, Citizen’s operators can’t listen in, and semiprivate, functional emergency communication remains just that, away from the gaze of the anxious public. “Citizen has no formal relationships with any municipalities,” Mr. Donald said. He did say that the company would “welcome that conversation.”"
4661,"Every great partnership has to begin somewhere. For Karen O and Danger Mouse, it was a drunk dial in 2008."
4662,"At least, that’s how half of this duo featuring the queen of the aughts rock revival and the versatile Grammy-winning producer remembers it. Karen O drew a blank when Danger Mouse (born Brian Burton) brought it up late last month at Electric Lady Studios in Greenwich Village, where they worked on their new album, “Lux Prima.”"
4663,"“I got this phone call, and you were like, it’s Karen O. I was like, what?” Burton said. His flummoxed collaborator at the other end of the couch slowly recalled what had happened: After years of saying they wanted to work together but only meeting briefly, Karen O had seized the moment."
4664,"“I get excited about things after a couple of drinks — then I’m like, yeah, I’m going to call him now!” she said. “That’s so me, too,” she added and let out the Karen O cackle, a high, sharp peal of laughter."
4665,"Sipping tea in an upstairs studio at the storied recording complex, both musicians were in Clark Kent mode, Zen and studious. (To be fair, this is Burton’s forever mode.) Since 2001, Karen O — short for her last name, Orzolek — has been best known as the frontwoman for the trio Yeah Yeah Yeahs, a stage-devouring, beer-spraying punk who can swing a microphone around her head while nailing every note with an ecstatic grin on her face. Burton was a cross-genre producer searching for his niche when “The Grey Album” — his unauthorized mash-up of Jay-Z’s “The Black Album” and the Beatles record known as the White Album — became a cause célèbre (and almost ended his career before it started) in 2004. He went on to form Gnarls Barkley with CeeLo Green; work with Gorillaz, Beck, the Black Keys and U2; and collaborate with James Mercer of the Shins in a group called Broken Bells."
4666,"[Never miss a pop music story: Get our weekly newsletter, Louder.]"
4667,"They’ve both recently entered their 40s: not old enough to be old, but old enough to question what’s coming next. It’s something that was on their minds as they began their journey into “Lux Prima,” an album of sprawling, soulful, cinematic psych rock filled with astral bass lines, gauzy strings and Karen O-isms like “You’re not coming for me/I’m coming for you.”"
4668,"“I’m on a vision quest of sorts: What does it mean to be a woman artist in her 40s? And how can I lay it down so that’s like, something [expletive] awesome,” Karen O said a few days later at a tony Lower East Side hotel that sprouted up two blocks from the tiny Mercury Lounge, where Yeah Yeah Yeahs played their first show, opening for the White Stripes. “It’s not a paved road, it’s not a well-beaten path,” she added. It’s “find your way through that wilderness and write us a postcard.”"
4669,
4670,"THOUGH THEY MET AROUND 2005, had that fateful phone call in 2008 and ran into each other again in 2012, the Karen O and Danger Mouse project didn’t get moving until 2016, a year after Karen O gave birth to her son, Django. Yeah Yeah Yeahs had last put out an album in 2013 — “Mosquito,” which concluded their contract with Interscope — and the singer followed up with an indie release called “Crush Songs,” a quiet series of meditations on romance she’d written alone in her New York apartment around 2007."
4671,"She was relishing her newfound freedom. “On the one hand,” she said, “Yeah Yeah Yeahs have had the great fortune of the label not meddling in our process. But there’s expectations for singles and the trajectory that you have to hit.” She added, “Until I was out of that deal, I didn’t realize the subtle psychic weight that I’d been carrying for like a decade.”"
4672,"Nick Zinner, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist who did a little playing on “Lux Prima,” said the pressures of the band were “something that you can spend a lot of energy trying to not think about,” and he knew this kind of independence was something Karen O “was yearning for.”"
4673,"Karen O compared working with Burton to when she wrote her “psycho opera,” a decidedly noncommercial art project called “Stop the Virgens,” in 2005 (it was staged in Brooklyn and Sydney, Australia, in 2011 and 2012): There were no expectations from the outside and no limits. Before they got started, Burton played her Michael Kiwanuka’s “Cold Little Heart,” the beautiful, shape-shifting 10-minute song that kicks off the London artist’s 2016 album, “Love & Hate,” which he produced, and it struck a nerve."
4674,"“That’s what made me want to make music when I first heard Pink Floyd in college,” said Burton, who easily switches between his roles as a producer and a musician. “I had always thought music was entertainment, and I didn’t want to be an entertainer, I wanted to be an artist.” He referenced his days in Athens, Ga., when he became immersed in the ’90s psych-rock scene anchored by the Elephant 6 Recording Company. “I was like, people make 15-minute songs? You’re taking yourself out of competition or pop or any of that stuff, you’re just making something. That’s what I want to do.”"
4675,Karen O chimed in: “That’s what I want to do. After all these years.”
4676,"So the first thing they did was make a 12-minute song, the lush, groovy “Lux Prima” (it later got a haircut to nine minutes), following Burton’s process: Come in with nothing and make something. They worked five-hour, two-week shifts in Burton’s Los Angeles studio so Karen O could stick to Django’s schedule. (While she defines downtown cool for a generation of New Yorkers, Karen O now lives in L.A., where she doesn’t have to schlep a stroller up subway steps. And Burton, a longtime L.A. resident, has relocated to New York.)"
4677,"Because the “Lux Prima” material was the first original music Karen O had written since giving birth, “I was really wondering what would be streaming out of me after that experience,” she said. “I felt more deeply connected to the cycles of life and like, consciousness. And I had a deep sense of love that was different.”"
4678,"Zinner said he saw his longtime collaborator wrestling with a new set of concerns. “Whatever Karen does, she’s working through something that’s happening with her,” he said, adding there was a “different element” in the mix this time. “Definitely being a mom. And being a woman in the age of Trump.”"
4679,"Burton was struck by Karen O’s process — she writes lyrics in the studio, which they both called torturous. But Karen O likes it because it helps her find an arc for the full album. And the primacy of the album was critical."
4680,"“There were only a couple of times we were like, ‘Should there be a single in this?’” Karen O said. “There’s plenty of hooks and melodies in the record, but as far as like a single in 2019, what does that sound like, especially in alternative music?”"
4681,"Burton quickly added, “Don’t even try.”"
4682,"The nine tracks on “Lux Prima” unspool grandly, from the ominous lullaby “Ministry” to the stomping girl-group squall of “Woman” to the compact psych-funk groove of “Leopard’s Tongue.” The duo will present the album as a “multisensory art installation” in April at the Marciano Art Foundation in Los Angeles. The event, overseen by the creative director Barnaby Clay (Karen O’s husband), will use lighting, projections and other stimuli to creative an immersive experience — the antidote to the kind of glance-listening that dominates pop’s current era of distraction."
4683,"Holding people’s attention isn’t easy in 2019. Danger Mouse later shared the advice he gives the young artists on his label, 30th Century Records: “Just have faith that if you’re doing the stuff you want to do, it will be heard at some point.”"
4684,"Dan Auerbach, the Black Keys singer and guitarist, admires Burton’s ability to pull the best from his collaborators. Burton, who has worked on four albums with the band, was the first outside producer the duo let into their world. “I think we just liked how drum-heavy his stuff was, kind of dusty and funky and always so rhythmic,” Auerbach added. “He just has a sixth sense with melody.”"
4685,"Despite having worked with some of the most successful artists in music, including Adele and Red Hot Chili Peppers, Burton’s guiding ethos remains heart over trends. “Usually when I work with somebody I tell them, ‘This is probably going to be your least-selling record, and if we make a couple of accidents that work out, it could be your best-selling record,’” he said. “‘But it’s probably not going to be anywhere in between.’”"
4686,"James Mercer, the Shins leader who teamed with Burton in Broken Bells, said his band was listening to “The Grey Album” backstage in Copenhagen the night Burton showed up unannounced to meet them. “That’s the type of person he is, he’s that brave and gregarious,” Mercer said. “He’s very good at being open to new ideas, so he definitely has stuff he learned from working with U2 and the Chili Peppers.” Mercer wasn’t surprised when Burton joined forces with Karen O, saying they’d listened to Yeah Yeah Yeahs together in the past: “He’s a fan of female singers, and she’s kind of the best.”"
4687,"Burton’s admiration for Karen O is obvious. “She has a voice I believe,” he said. “My whole thing was making sure that one of the coolest chicks in the world likes what we’re doing.”"
4688,
4689,KAREN O HAS BEEN KNOWN as a rock ’n’ roll badass for so many years that many of the nuances of her personality and art have been blasted away.
4690,"For starters, she has a deep appreciation for soul music, particularly from the 1960s. As a kid, she would listen to her father’s collection of anthologies on repeat, “And I think they really imprinted songwriting into my brain,” she said."
4691,"In early August, Karen O randomly pulled out a compilation featuring Aretha Franklin that she’d leaned on during her 20s, and wrote on Instagram that the Queen of Soul “broke the mold.” Ten days later, Franklin was dead."
4692,"“That was a bit weird,” Karen O said at the hotel, her tight bob of hair hugging her face. Thoughts about the irreplaceable artists of her youth and the idea of legacy started to gnaw at her as she approached 40 last year. What happens when “even the biggest people in the arts just eventually fade away?” she wondered, and what would she herself leave behind?"
4693,"“She is a rock musician who’s idling in a genre that is currently completely undervalued,” the singer Shirley Manson of Garbage, a friend of Karen O’s, said in a phone interview. “People laugh at us, the rockers. Karen and I have spoken about this. We’re like, ‘We’re the [expletive] rockers, and we love it, because there’s no one else in our pool. We’re still swimming around like sharks.’”"
4694,"Manson turned her attention to the music industry, which she called “a really staunch patriarchal system” that devalues women as they get older. “You have to walk through the valley of death yourself and figure out who you will be. Karen’s going to have to find out for herself what Karen O will be, and she’ll figure it out fine.”"
4695,"Karen O tends to look to the left when she’s talking, and her gaze remained fixed as she described that midlife crisis. “I felt those cliché things,” she said. “Like, wow, maybe I’m not going to get around to doing all those things I wanted to do. I’ve just been wildly ambitious and idealistic and actually quite optimistic about making stuff.” Suddenly she was struck by how hard it felt to create, and how fleeting and impermanent everything can seem."
4696,"She said she turned to a friend who was a punk rocker in the late ’70s and early ’80s for advice, “And she said to me: ‘Yeah, ashes to ashes, man, isn’t it great? Once you realize that, you’re free.’ And I was like, wow. I can’t process that quite yet, but once I do, that’s going to be [expletive] good times.”"
4697,"HERAT, Afghanistan — A 2017 wall calendar dangled from a nail over Kawsar Roshan’s bed on the otherwise blank wall of her room. “Best year for me” she had written, in curly script, above aerial photos of lakes and waterfalls. She drew a smiley-face next to her wobbly English letters."
4698,"The out-of-date calendar was “nothing too special,” said Kawsar, though she does love waterfalls, especially Niagara Falls — which she saw with her own eyes during that best year. "
4699,"Kawsar, then 16, saw a lot of places as a member of Afghanistan’s first-ever girls’ robotics team. More than any other Afghan girl she knows. Or boy. Or even grown-up, for that matter."
4700,"You may remember hearing about that team. In the summer of 2017, Kawsar and five teammates, along with their coach, were denied visas into the United States for a robotics competition in Washington, prompting an international outcry. "
4701,"Eventually, 53 members of Congress signed a petition and President Trump intervened to get the girls travel documents on special humanitarian grounds. They received a silver medal in “courageous achievement” and Congressional certificates of merit. Back in Afghanistan, they were received as icons of progress, though some sniped that they had dressed immodestly while abroad and compromised their marriageability. "
4702,"In the time since, the photogenic troupe of teenage girls in head scarves and protective goggles has shuttled between their homes in Herat and competitions in North America, suitcases bulging with robotics contraptions, trophies and rice cookers. "
4703,"They met Ivanka Trump three times. Justin Trudeau offered to be their backup robot driver. The rapper Will.i.am, one of their sponsors, took so many selfies with the girls that Lida Azizi, the team’s robot driver, called him, “a true friend.”"
4704,"Over and over again, they were showered with a compliment to which they never quite knew how to respond: “It’s so inspiring to see an all-Muslim team.” "
4705,"They amassed tens of thousands of Facebook followers and, as their English improved, learned the art of the sound bite, delivering messages about “resilience” and “self-confidence.” "
4706,"It was an unimaginable odyssey between two worlds, as their friends and families faced continued violence in Afghanistan. While at a major competition in Mexico City last summer, the girls awoke to news that a suicide bomber in Kabul had killed 47 boys about their age in a college-exam prep class. They traded pajamas for black head scarves and posted a selfie on Facebook with a sign that read, “We continue for you.”"
4707,"Now, with peace negotiations underway involving the Taliban, many inside and around Afghanistan are fearful that recent gains in women’s rights and girls’ education could be washed away. Earlier this month, Roya Mahboob, an Afghan expat tech entrepreneur and the team’s founder, sent a letter to Ms. Trump, who had been so enthusiastic about the team, pleading that the youth of Afghanistan not be forgotten in the talks; last week, Ms. Mahboob met with the United States’ special envoy for Afghan reconciliation. "
4708,"The girls’ one-year visas expired in the fall, so they are focused now mostly on school: Kawsar and Fatemah Qaderyan, the team’s pint-size captain and a “Harry Potter” fan, study English in an after school program, and Lida, dreaming of college in Canada, where the team trained last winter, is being tutored by an uncle."
4709,"They are eager for peace, of course, though concerned that a newly empowered Taliban could further stifle girls’ ambitions. Such a future, Kawsar said recently via What’sApp, “would be unbelievable for me.” She added a sad-face emoji."
4710,"It is not often that teenagers get to travel the world. It was unheard-of for 16-year-old girls from Afghanistan — girls not used to leaving the house without a male chaperone, girls whose peers were getting married — to travel the world competing in robotics. "
4711,"Before it all started, the only robots they had known were the drones used by the American military. And the only Americans they had seen outside of television were soldiers in armored cars."
4712,We followed Kawsar and her teammates through much of that “best year.” These are snapshots from their journey.
4713,"[For more on women and girls, sign up for In Her Words, a weekly newsletter.]"
4714,"Their odyssey started with an invitation from an American inventor named Dean Kamen, who had founded a robotics league in the United States decades before and in 2017 planned an Olympics-style competition. He enlisted Ms. Mahboob to put together an Afghan team."
4715,More than 150 girls turned up to try out. A dozen made the first cut. 
4716,"As they awaited the robot parts sent by Mr. Kamen, they set up a workshop in the basement of Ms. Mahboob’s parents’ home in Herat, watching YouTube how-to videos and tinkering with scrap metal that their coach, Ms. Mahboob’s brother, Alireza Mehraban, picked up in the market. "
4717,"They hammered nails with rocks, twisted chains by slamming doors on them, and searched for kitchen knives sharp enough to make slits in aluminum. They worked barefoot, as is customary inside Afghan homes, and without any safety equipment. "
4718,"“When you have Taliban outside, goggles aren’t your biggest security problem,” one of the girls joked."
4719,"They came from different schools, neighborhoods and ethnic groups, but most were born in 2001, the year United States troops began what the military called “Operation Enduring Freedom.”"
4720,"When the team returned to Herat after that first competition, Fatemah’s father, Mohammad Asif Qaderyan, planted a congratulatory kiss on her cheek in front of the TV cameras at the airport — a public display of affection not looked kindly upon by all. "
4721,"He had been the team’s biggest booster, helping persuade other fathers to let their daughters travel. A building contractor with a ninth-grade education, Mr. Qaderyan was an avid supporter of girls’ schools, of robotics and, above all, of Fatemah."
4722,"They had a special closeness, staying up late to watch science documentaries on DVDs. “We would talk about complicated stuff, and I could ask him any question,” she said. “Sometimes he would be surprised by my questions, but he always tried to answer.”"
4723,"Exactly one week after the team came home from Washington, Fatemah waved to her father as he shut the gate of their home and headed to the mosque. When the blast hit a bit later, her mother ran into the street, panicked. Fatemah kept dialing his cellphone. "
4724,"The Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, whose official death toll was 36, though neighbors counted more."
4725,"“All our neighbors thought I was the cause of his death,” she said. “They said if I had not been on the robotics team, it would not have happened.”"
4726,"In early 2018, the girls were invited to train with a robotics team in Canada, and ended up qualifying for a 700-team competition in Detroit. They arrived late one evening at a suburban hotel, where the bar was filled with men and women drinking, laughing and eating chicken wings."
4727,"Somaya Faruqi, the team’s mechanical whiz, cocked her head toward the bar, her eyes widening."
4728,"“In Afghanistan we laugh differently,” she said."
4729,"Yes, like, not loudly, the others explained. And no teeth showing."
4730,"“At home,” Kawsar said, “they stone women to death for adultery — or even if they just suspect it.” Then she added: “But the truth is, I like to smile.”"
4731,"Sometimes, when no one was around, the girls would crack each other up with a routine."
4732,"“You are so awesome,” one teammate, Sahar Barak, would say in her best American accent, mimicking the people who kept telling them as much."
4733,"Kawsar, batting long dark lashes, would join in: “You guys are really inspiring!”"
4734,"Lida might make a little heart shape with her fingers: “Yes, yes, you have touched our hearts!”"
4735,"Without fail, this would reduce the girls to a heap of giggles, hands flying to cover mouths and hold onto slipping head scarves, eyes darting to make sure Coach Ali wasn’t watching."
4736,"“When we go home, we will change our behavior,” Fatemah said. “We will know how to hide our smiles when we need to.”"
4737,"A trip to Canada that was supposed to last a few weeks turned into months on the road, and the girls began to worry about missing too much school. They liked the freedom to ride bikes in New York — “At home, if you are a boy you can go bike riding, but not us,” Kawsar said —  and loved using the swings in Central Park. They also appreciated the flip-flop selection at Kmart. But their suitcases were getting heavy and they missed their mothers. "
4738,"They slept on beanbags at Ms. Mahboob’s apartment in Queens, N.Y., for a few weeks between competitions, taking turns cleaning, cooking, and painting each others’ nails with glitter polish."
4739,"“I’m so happy for Ed Sheeran that he is getting married,” Lida said one day. She was a big fan of Ed Sheeran, as well as of Lionel Messi. And she loved everything having to do with World Wrestling Entertainment, including Mr. Trump."
4740,"“He might be a W.W.E. fan, but he doesn’t like Muslims like you,” Sahar told Lida."
4741,“Is it true Trump supports ISIS?” Kawsar asked.
4742,"They discussed their collective crush on Prime Minister Trudeau, whom they called “Justin.” They wondered who — “besides us” — might be the most famous Afghans outside of Afghanistan, and dissected another famous young Muslim woman who promoted girls’ education: Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who is Pakistani."
4743, “She repeats the same lines to everyone!” Fatemah argued.
4744, Then they wondered aloud: “Do we do that?”
4745,"They had recently learned the word “weird,” and were pleased with its ability to encompass feelings about the unfamiliar. "
4746,"People kissing in the streets in America, for example, was weird. Billboards with women half-undressed? Weird. Or strangers talking to you in the street: “You don’t know them, and suddenly they are saying something,” Fatemah said. "
4747,"Once, riding the subway from Queens to Manhattan, a stranger called Lida a “cookie” and asked to touch her head scarf. Another time, somebody leaned over and said: “People get blown up right on the street in your country. What do you think about that?”"
4748,"But the worst was on an overnight Greyhound bus from Detroit to New York. They had showed up in high spirits, with matching blue eye shadow and mascara they had been trying on in a Sephora that afternoon."
4749,"Then, on the bus, one man was watching porn on his phone. When they asked another to change seats, he cursed and pushed them. “You are rude!” Sahar retorted in her best English before bursting into tears."
4750,"They missed the way time moved slowly in Herat, where aunts and uncles were constantly visiting, and dinners were long, and always homemade."
4751,"“There is no greater pleasure in life,” Somaya said, “than a family picnic at the park, at home.”"
4752,"“No one would ever push you there,” Kawsar added."
4753,"After one competition in Albuquerque, N.M., the girls stopped for ice cream at an outdoor mall, where, after long discussions on the merits of each flavor, they all ordered pistachio."
4754,"They discussed the robotics team from Burundi, whose members had disappeared after the competition in Washington and then resurfaced a few weeks later, requesting asylum."
4755,"“It’s annoying that Americans think everyone wants to sneak into their country,” said Fatemah. “I don’t.”"
4756,"“When I grow up, I’m going to start a robotics company with Somaya,” she said. It would be a fleet of robots to monitor security issues. Or maybe agricultural robots to help farmers collect saffron."
4757,"That is, if she doesn’t become president of Afghanistan, which is her real dream. Somaya could be her chief of staff, Fatemah said. The others could help with her campaign."
4758,Sahar rolled her eyes.
4759,"“Yes, it would be nice to live, for a while, in a country where girls are allowed to ride bikes and swim and where there are Baskin-Robbins everywhere,” said Kawsar."
4760,"And it would be “awesome” to study overseas, they agreed."
4761,But stay?
4762,"“Not us,” they said."
4763,"The girls had been traveling for 30 hours, changed planes five times and gone through 13-and-a-half time zones. It was the first day of Ramadan when they touched down in Herat last May, and they would soon be fasting. As they prepared to exit the plane, they put on their medals and dialed down their smiles."
4764,"Awaiting them on the tarmac were TV cameras, a government minister with bouquets of plastic roses, and families relieved to have their daughters safely home."
4765,"The only mother missing was Fatemah’s. Someone made an excuse, saying she was sick. “Not exactly sick,” she said later. “I am sick in my heart.” It had been less than 10 months since the mosque attack that killed her husband."
4766,"With their U.S. visas having run out, the team’s activities have quieted. Fatemah, Somaya and Lida went to a robotics competition in Estonia in November and, with three new girls, to one in Istanbul in February."
4767,"Fatemah and Ms. Mahboob met with Afghanistan’s president, Ashraf Ghani, about a plan to start a robotics club in Kabul, as well as a technology-focused school, which the Yale Engineering Department has offered to design. He offered support, but there is as yet no budget."
4768,"At a school assembly, Lida and Kawsar spoke to hundreds of girls in matching black tunics and white head scarves about how the team had won the all-rookie award at a championship in Canada and how they each came home with six medals and how, above all, they were proud to serve their country."
4769,"One girl asked if they had seen the Statue of Liberty. Yes, they had. And they had met Justin Trudeau! It was unclear how many in the audience knew who that was. "
4770,"Afterward, one girl said: “I could do robotics, too.”"
4771,"“If I just knew what it was,” she added. “And if my dad allowed.”"
4772,"Danna Harman is a London-based journalist who has reported from across Africa, the Middle East and Latin America."
4773,"On Friday, the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards will open, the culmination of more than a decade of planning, strategizing and developing, and New York City will have the newest, shiniest, largest expression of what we used to call a “mall.”"
4774,"Glide, if you will, up its escalators and you can get a manicure-mid-meditation at Sundays or an $800 haircut at Sally Hershberger, dip into a new-concept Zara or the first “offline” store from the e-tailer Mack Weldon or Rolex or Cartier. Spin through the first New York City Neiman Marcus or its kookier neighbor, Forty Five Ten, a fellow Dallas retailer with outposts in Miami; Aspen, Colo.; and the Napa Valley of California. "
4775,"Stay for lunch — chicken fingers (at Momofuku’s Fuku) or high-end Korean-inflected cuisine (at Momofuku’s Kawi), Shake Shack or the newest Thomas Keller restaurant — and a restorative 10-minute siesta in a Provençale-scented aromatherapy room at the Conservatory, a new store offering a little bit of everything (including Provençale-scented siestas). Hit Lululemon, Tory Burch and, what the hell, Sephora, and now it’s time for dinner. Won’t you stay?"
4776,"Hudson Yards hopes you will. If you need, the first Equinox Hotel awaits just outside. Rooms start at $700 a night."
4777,"The retail center, all one million square feet of it, is the shopping, dining, pampering hub of Hudson Yards, the largest wholesale innovation to the New York landscape in years. It is nothing less than a full neighborhood developed by Related Companies, the mega-developers run by the billionaire Stephen M. Ross, in a joint venture with Oxford Properties Group. (Related also owns Equinox.) "
4778,"Built over 28 acres and atop still-active train yards, Hudson Yards runs from 10th Avenue to 12th Avenue, and 30th Street to 34th Street. (The Hudson Yards district is zoned as far east as Eighth Avenue and as far north at 42nd Street, so it will grow.) It includes office towers and residential towers, a new performance space (the Shed), a giant new piece of public art (the Vessel), a public square and garden, and this retail center."
4779,[The Times’s architecture critic asks: Is this the neighborhood New York deserves?]
4780,"Kenneth A. Himmel, the president and chief executive of Related Urban, who oversaw the project, is a veteran developer of mixed-use developments, including Water Tower Place in Chicago, Copley Place in Boston and the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. They all pale before the scope and ambition of Hudson Yards. "
4781,"“This one,” Mr. Himmel said, “we knew was the mother of all mothers.”"
4782,"When all is said and done, Hudson Yards will be home to L’Oréal and Warner Media and the Tapestry brands (Coach, Kate Spade and more); to Boston Consulting Group and the global investment firm KKR and Point72 Asset Management (Steven A. Cohen’s investment firm). Current listings for available residences at 15 Hudson Yards include a $4.315 million two-bedroom apartment and a $32 million penthouse. The Shed will have diverse programming, including Björk and Boots Riley. New York Fashion Week is in discussions to move there as well, as soon as September."
4783,"If the new neighborhood, as Related is marketing the development, were a country, a tour guide chirped a few months back in the company’s 360-degree multimedia presentation center, it would have a gross domestic product comparable to Iceland’s."
4784,"At opening, the retail center will be 90 percent leased, with 100 stores and 25 restaurants, from fast-casual to fine dining, hoping to draw customers not only in but up to scale its gleaming heights. (A 35,000-square-foot “Spanish food experience” by the chef José Andrés is just outside.) "
4785,"When the retail complex is fully open, Related projects that it will see 60,000 visitors per day. It has designed the center for frictionless ease, to float between floors with minimal effort, and slide from well-known brands to first-time bricks-and-mortar retailers plucked from the direct-to-consumer e-tail boom on its Floor of Discovery. "
4786,"Still, Mr. Himmel acknowledged, there is always the question: Will it work?"
4787,"“When you throw a big party, you send out 200 invitations and hope that 150 people come,” he said. “We think we’ve cast the net out to thousands and thousands of people who are going to enjoy the project. But you always hold your breath.”"
4788,"One reason for that is that malls — “vertical retail,” in industry parlance — are a tricky and often unsuccessful proposition in New York City, where shopping is typically integrated into the cityscape, on sidewalk thoroughfares like Fifth and Madison Avenues, or shopping districts like SoHo or NoLIta."
4789,"Recent years have seen an influx of vertical developments, including Brookfield Place and the Oculus downtown, both of which have struggled. In January, Saks Fifth Avenue, one of Brookfield’s anchor tenants, closed its 86,000-square-foot women’s store after a mere two years."
4790,"Vertical retail and indoor malls are “two things New York City has never embraced,” said Arthur Maglio, the leader of the Faith Hope Consolo team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who had a few clients interested in Hudson Yards spaces. He cautioned, though, that Hudson Yards didn’t have a direct parallel to earlier attempts. "
4791,"“It’s really at the forefront of where malls are heading,” he said. “On a macro level, the mall at Hudson Yards is pivotal for retail.”"
4792,"One of the few successful malls in Manhattan is a Related property, the Shops at Columbus Circle at the Time Warner Center, anchored by a Whole Foods and an Equinox gym below street level and tethered to high-end condos above."
4793,"“People said vertical retail wouldn’t work in New York,” said Webber Hudson, an executive vice president at Related Urban. “We were able to prove them wrong.”"
4794,"But Related has had to contend with the lingering sense that New York is not a mall town and that Hudson Yards, the fantasy of one developer more or less magicked out of nothingness, is somehow “not New York.” "
4795,"“I used to go to Dubai a lot,” said Sally Hershberger, whose salon is on the ground floor of the complex. “This is really Dubai for me, but better, because I can walk there. I don’t have to schlep all the way to Dubai to get that kind of energy.”"
4796,"That energy is not necessarily a point of pride in a pedestrian’s paradise like New York, which has a certain satisfaction in its cheek-by-jowl mix of glamour and grit. Architectural innovations at Hudson Yards, like the setting back of certain floors, serve specifically to give a sense of streethood. All it takes, Mr. Hudson suggested, is a slight renovation of expectations."
4797,"“It’s just like any street,” he said. “It’s just that our sidewalk runs vertically through the project.”"
4798,"Related hopes Hudson Yards draws huge crowds of visitors, locals and tourists alike. The developer is keen to point out that it has two major streams of easy access: the 7 subway line, which the city extended in 2015 to the development’s doorstep, and the High Line, a tourist magnet that sees some seven million visitors per year and likewise spits out its strollers at Hudson Yards’ feet."
4799,"But the complex’s greatest advantage may be the tens of thousands of people who will live and work on-site. When the development is complete, it will comprise more than 18 million square feet, with 4,000 residential units and businesses expected to bring 55,000 workers to the area, providing a captive audience: Some of the buildings will open directly onto the mall’s key floors. "
4800,"Brian Bolke, the founder of the Conservatory, a new store attempting a showroom-style, inventory-less model, said he was initially uninterested in pursuing a lease at Hudson Yards. "
4801,"But one of the key draws, he decided, was what he called “the extraordinary relocation of the corporations that moved down there.” Many of the new tenants, including Neiman Marcus and the Equinox Hotel, described robust plans already in the works to market to those living and working in Hudson Yards."
4802,"It’s a symbiotic relationship. The new employees and residents patronize the stores, and the stores serve the new employees and residents, who are relocating to an area of Manhattan as yet underserved, even largely unknown."
4803,"“It’s literally a neighborhood that nobody’s ever been in,” said Daniel Arsham, one of the principals of Snarkitecture, the architecture and design practice that is opening Snark Park, a ticketed, immersive and Instagram-friendly art installation. “I was in Detroit last week and trying to explain to people where this physically sits and nobody has any reference for the area.”"
4804,"The main profit driver of large, mixed-use developments like Hudson Yards are condo sales, which are a harder multimillion-dollar sell in an area without conveniences, as Hudson Yards pre-Hudson Yards mostly was. "
4805,"Retail “almost becomes an amenity,” Mr. Maglio said, though he cautioned that the retail isn’t forgotten. But because Related needs these merchants as much as it needs their rents, it incentivized their deals, as is standard practice, and in some cases invested in their businesses. "
4806,"“Innovation requires investment,” Mr. Hudson said when asked. Ms. Hershberger confirmed that the company had invested in her salon. “They made it nice for me, put it that way,” she said."
4807,"Related may have made Hudson Yards nice for some of its tenants, but the early reaction to the project has much to do with how nice New York City made with Hudson Yards. Related won development rights for $1 billion in 2008 after the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority solicited bids. It has since received tax breaks and incentives, which, when coupled with the city’s extension of the 7 train, add up to nearly $6 billion in government assistance, according to research out of the New School."
4808,"Critics complain that these tax breaks favor billionaire developers, corporations and luxury buyers, not everyday New Yorkers. New York magazine recently illustrated a diamond-encrusted Hudson Yards on its cover, calling it “a billionaire’s fantasy city.”"
4809,"Lynne Sagalyn, an emeritus professor at Columbia Business School who has written on redevelopment, dismissed questions of seemliness. "
4810,"It is clear that given the city’s budget and constraints, development of the site, including the building of the platform over the train yards, would require private-sector investment, Dr. Sagalyn said, for which it would have to give incentives. (Dr. Sagalyn is a board member of Blackstone Mortgage Trust, which provided a loan for the construction of the Spiral, a new office tower in the Hudson Yards district.) “Gauging the magnitude of the subsidies is the right question,” she said. “Did they give away the store?”"
4811,"Proponents of the development say that the area will generate jobs and property taxes that will benefit the city for years to come, and that New York needs to change with the changing times."
4812,"“I worked in New York in the early ’80s,” said Chris Norton, the chief executive of Equinox Hotels. “You wouldn’t go down to that part of town. It was nothing.” What makes New York great, he said, is its continual reinvention."
4813,"“If you’re looking to continue to see New York develop and see new things happen, I don’t know if there’s many ways to do it besides vertically,” said Joe Cole of Forty Five Ten, who designed the space with his wife, Kristen Cole, its president and chief creative officer. “It feels like the future.”"
4814,"Geoffroy van Raemdonck, the chief executive of Neiman Marcus, echoed the sentiment. “We look at this neighborhood as being the next generation,” he said."
4815,"Neiman Marcus already does significant business in New York: $100 million in online sales in the New York area in the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. van Raemdonck said. But the Neiman Marcus at Hudson Yards will be the first in New York City, and Hudson Yards’ largest store, encompassing three floors and including two restaurants, a bar and an education and event space. "
4816,"“There were many opportunities that passed and were not chosen,” he said. “This felt like something we couldn’t miss.” Related and its new tenants are hoping that shoppers won’t be able to miss it, either."
4817,"“I would be very hesitant to project how it’s going to do,” Ms. Sagalyn said. “I think people will go over there just to see it — it’s a new part of the city. But how many people return and return there to shop? We’ll see.”"
4818,"The condos at 15 Hudson Yards are already 60 percent sold, and Related will begin selling 35 Hudson Yards, with 143 residences and prices beginning at $5 million. More office towers will begin construction soon. According to recent transplants, the neighborhood is coming to life. Nick Wooster, a veteran retail executive and longtime resident of the West Village, moved in three years ago."
4819,"“I do understand that what makes New York New York is not necessarily this,” he said, but New York’s days of wearing its grit and discomforts as a badge of honor may be behind it. And in any case, far from living at the ends of the earth, Mr. Wooster is on 10th Avenue. "
4820,"“I do not delude myself into thinking that I live in the Village,” he said, “but it doesn’t feel as disconnected.”"
4821,"About the retail center’s prospects, he was sanguine. “This is what I believe about today: All bets are off. The rules that we knew 30 years ago don’t necessarily apply.”"
4822,"Asked about how to keep Hudson Yards humming well into the future, Mr. Himmel said it would now be up to his tenants to draw their customers."
4823,"“We’ve done everything we possibly can to set the stage for this,” he said. "
4824,"In any case, the architect of the mother of all projects is ready to begin work on Related’s next project, in Silicon Valley."
4825,"“We have full approvals, 100 percent green light, to build over 12 million square feet of mixed-use,” Mr. Himmel said. “We don’t have to go up. We don’t have to combine all these uses in the same building. We’re going to do a street scene.”"
4826,"Two weeks before the opening of the Shed, the ambitious $475 million arts center opening where the High Line meets the luxe Hudson Yards development, workers in hard hats were busily turning its biggest theater into a standing-room-only dance floor for the celebration of African-American music that will inaugurate it April 5."
4827,"When that ends, they will install 1,200 seats for a run of staged Bjork concerts. Then the seating will be reconfigured for it next show, a kung fu musical featuring aerialists and Sia songs. And, by the middle of the summer, the theater’s walls and ceilings will disappear, as its airy, silvery puffer jacket of a shell rolls back on rails to expose an outdoor plaza for free open-air performances."
4828,New York has never seen a new cultural entity quite like the Shed — and not just because of its unusual building. 
4829,[See how the Shed’s nesting shell moves on rails to create indoor or outdoor space.]
4830,"It was born, improbably enough, of the failed attempt to bring the Olympics — and a football stadium — to Manhattan. It began with an idea for a new kind of arts building, before it was entirely clear what would go inside. It was nurtured by the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire who gambled an eye-popping $75 million in public money on it before it was fully defined — and later matched the amount with a $75 million gift of his own money. And, in an astonishing feat, it raised nearly half a billion dollars before opening."
4831,"Now it is opening in the Hudson Yards, the new development that both critics and admirers have likened to Dubai, and which Michael Kimmelman, the architecture critic of The New York Times, lamented was a “supersized suburban-style office park, with a shopping mall and a quasi-gated condo community targeted at the 0.1 percent.”"
4832,The Shed could become its antidote — if it succeeds in its goal of welcoming the other 99.9 percent. 
4833,"Some of its backers are calling it the city’s biggest new cultural entity since Lincoln Center opened in the 1960s; others see it more like the emergence of the Park Avenue Armory as a multidisciplinary arts space in 2007. Either way, it is rare for a new institution to attract the kind of lavish support the Shed has, and to open on such a grand scale. "
4834,"The Shed was more than a decade in the making, and its birth was not always smooth. “This is a project that had more than nine lives,” said Kate D. Levin, who helped develop the project as Mr. Bloomberg’s cultural affairs commissioner and now serves on the Shed’s board."
4835,"It all began more than two decades ago, with the dream of an investor named Daniel L. Doctoroff, who wanted to bring the Olympics to New York. When he became a deputy mayor in the Bloomberg administration, he continued the push, calling for the construction of a new football stadium for the Jets on the West Side of Manhattan to boost the city’s Olympics bid. (At one point, he tried to drum up support by lugeing down the steps of City Hall. “I almost killed myself,” he recently recalled. )"
4836,"The plan to build the stadium was killed by state officials after it ran into significant community and political opposition, derailing the city’s Olympics bid. But, as part of its effort, the city had already rezoned a broad swath of the West Side — paving the way for what would ultimately become Hudson Yards. One element of the plan, from the beginning, called for building a “to be determined” cultural institution on a small parcel of city-owned land."
4837,"It was the kind of amenity — like the promise of new schools and open space — that is often added to proposed real estate projects to help them win approval. But it also reflected the Bloomberg administration’s broader support for the arts and was a product of its time: As New York worked to recover from the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the administration was anxious to reaffirm the city’s position on the world stage."
4838,"“In the Bloomberg administration we always saw New York on some level as a competitive entity,” Mr. Doctoroff said, “and thought that New York competes extraordinarily effectively through our cultural institutions.” "
4839,Their plans were nebulous at first.
4840,"The city started out by holding brainstorming sessions with arts leaders and artists, and decided early on that the new space should be a highly flexible one that could cater to the growing desire of many artists to break out of their silos and blend disciplines. “Dancers were even more interested in collaborating with visual artists,’’ Ms. Levin said. “Musicians really wanted to work with theatrical kinds of expressions of their work.’’"
4841,"The architecture firms hired to design it — Diller Scofidio + Renfro, in collaboration with Rockwell Group — were given the task of imagining not only a new structure, but also a new institution. "
4842,"“It was some kind of cultural entity, it was undefined, and it was to be flexible,” the lead architect, Elizabeth Diller, said."
4843,"“FLEXIBLE was in capital letters,” David Rockwell recalled. “We sort of liked that.”"
4844,"They quickly came up with the building’s salient feature: its sliding shell. It was a physical embodiment of that flexibility, but just as crucially it proved a nifty, eye-catching design that became a major selling point for a project still struggling to define itself. And it doubled its footprint."
4845,"Mr. Doctoroff — who went on to run Mr. Bloomberg’s business, Bloomberg L.P., before running Sidewalk Labs, a sister company to Google, and becoming the chairman of the Shed’s board — tends to speak of the project in business terms. “It’s one of the largest cultural start-ups ever,” he said."
4846,"At one point, he said, its founders market-tested the idea of making it a “cultural time share,” to see if it could be rented to visiting institutions that wanted a New York presence. They initially christened it Culture Shed. “One of the definitions of shed is ‘an open-ended structure with tools,’” Mr. Doctoroff said, “and that’s how we saw this, as a platform for artists.”"
4847,"There was still no artistic director in place in 2013 when Mr. Bloomberg arranged the $75 million city grant — jump-starting its creation at a moment when other arts projects, including the plan to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site, had seemed to stall. (Mr. Bloomberg declined to be interviewed about the Shed.) "
4848,Such lavish support for an untested concept was initially greeted with skepticism — and more than a little jealousy — from other city arts leaders as they struggled to keep their own institutions afloat in trying times. 
4849,"But early fears that the city might be creating a cultural white elephant were largely allayed in 2014, when the Shed named its first artistic director and chief executive: Alex Poots, who had founded the Manchester International Festival and, as the artistic director of the Park Avenue Armory, had unexpectedly made the Upper East Side a destination for must-see, cutting-edge art."
4850,When Mr. Poots was first approached by the search firm looking for someone to lead the Shed — they had spoken earlier to figures from the visual arts world — he was not interested. 
4851,"“When they came knocking, I remember thinking, well, what’s the mission?” he said."
4852,"But he agreed to meet with Mr. Doctoroff — if Mr. Doctoroff would come see one of his shows, Kenneth Branagh’s muddy, bloody “Macbeth,” which was playing at the Park Avenue Armory after a run in Manchester."
4853,"“This was not just a touring show; we made it,” he recalled telling Mr. Doctoroff. “And I have one question for you right at the start of this meeting: This show cost $4 million to make, O.K.? If we sell out the run, every single ticket, we would make $3.1 million in box office. So my big question to you is: Is $900,000 an investment in culture and society, or is it a loss?”"
4854,"Mr. Doctoroff’s reply, he said, was: “I’d been warned about you.”"
4855,"Before Mr. Poots agreed to take the job, he reshaped the whole idea of the Shed. "
4856,"He insisted that the Shed commission all new work, sometimes with partners elsewhere. It was a radical departure for an entity that had weighed the cultural time share idea, and a departure for a city whose presenters often import visiting companies who perform works created by theaters and festivals elsewhere. "
4857,"“That was a whole different organization that I was describing,” Mr. Poots said, “with twice as many staff and a whole commissioning pot of money that would need to be found.”"
4858,The board signed off.
4859,"Presenting all new work can be exciting. But it’s also risky. Karen Brooks Hopkins, the former president of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, put it this way: “Doing a few commissions is complicated — doing all is a little scary.”"
4860,"There was another thing, Mr. Poots said: its original name, Culture Shed, rubbed him the wrong way."
4861,"He asked several artists he trusted for advice. Many said they found the word culture redundant, if not off-putting. Marina Abramovic, the performance artist, offered a branding analogy. “She said: ‘When they named Apple, they didn’t call it Apple Computer,’” Mr. Poots recalled. “Actually, I found out, they did. But they got rid of it — making her point.”"
4862,He asked the artists to put their thoughts in writing so he could send them to the board — which agreed to rename the institution the Shed.
4863,"Mr. Poots also made changes to the building. He wanted to add seating capacity to its theaters and, perhaps most crucially, better soundproofing. “That meant we could present Kendrick Lamar at 108 decibels without it affecting the galleries and critically, the theater,” he said. Those changes added $26 million to the building’s price tag."
4864,"There were construction difficulties to surmount. The architects had to reorient the building so that it faced east instead of north. The Vessel, a shiny, copper-colored stairway to nowhere by Thomas Heatherwick that has proved more popular with selfie-takers than architecture critics, was added along the Shed’s north side. Asked what she made of the Shed’s shiny next-door neighbor, Ms. Diller simply raised her eyebrows."
4865,"Then a new plan called for joining the Shed, which had been envisioned as a stand-alone building, to a tower. Ms. Diller and Mr. Rockwell ended up signing on to design the tower, too, to protect their design for the Shed, they said — a move that allowed them to claim the use of the tower’s first 10 floors as back offices and storage spaces for the Shed."
4866,"The Shed has raised a total of $529 million, when a $45 million interest-free loan from Stephen M. Ross, the developer of Hudson Yards and a member of its board, is factored in. But for all its resources, it still faces challenges. "
4867,"Raising money for annual operating expenses is much harder than raising money for capital projects, which generate excitement and naming opportunities. The Shed will soon find itself competing not only with existing cultural institutions for philanthropic support, but also new ones, including the multidisciplinary, flexible theater (sound familiar?) being built at the World Trade Center site, the Ronald O. Perelman Center for the Performing Arts. "
4868,"Shed officials were reluctant to discuss their operating budget or business plan, but said they expect to spend around $50 million in the first year. They hope to generate rental income; the Shed has an event space on its top floor, and there has been talk of luring Fashion Week."
4869,"Now the Shed will have to define itself, and where it fits into the city. Is it the northernmost part of the High Line, the popular elevated park Ms. Diller helped create on a set of abandoned rail tracks? Or is it a Hudson Yards amenity — another bit of bragging rights in a glossy new amalgam of office towers, condos and a luxury mall where $800 haircuts are on offer?"
4870,"The tensions are clear. The Shed is now envisioned as a place for artists to create new work — Ms. Diller recalled how when she was starting out New York was still “a place of production,” and lamented that it had become “a place for consumption” — but it sits in an area that, as much as any, has come to symbolize the soaring rents that have priced artists out of the city."
4871,"Several arts leaders questioned whether the Shed’s permanent-festival approach to programming, with all new commissions, would produce enduring works — and if it would be able to compete with the tried-and-tested offerings of other presenters."
4872,"But Mr. Poots, who has succeeded in the past at drawing audiences to even seemingly esoteric fare, said art needed new work, and new ideas. "
4873,"“Let artists explore — let them fail!” he said. “We don’t want them to fail, but it’s not that they’ve messed up if they fail. In every show we do there’s things that don’t always work, but there has to be a place to experiment and invent.”"
4874,"He said that his artistic vision for the Shed — as the kind of place that welcomes the avant-garde and pop, as well as music, theater and dance, sometimes all within the same work — was all about forging a connection to the city and its diverse audiences. "
4875,"“This idea that we’re making new work, commissioning across all art forms, allows for parity,” he said. “Across art forms, but also across society.”"
4876,"Ms. Hopkins, the former Brooklyn Academy of Music president, noted that challenge of making that kind of connection in a development critics have likened to a gated community. “The challenge for the Shed is that even with this constant flow of money, great cultural institutions thrive best without gates — wide open to great ideas, diversity, energy and curiosity,” she said. “We have seen Lincoln Center and others spend millions to open their campuses and space for this kind of real connection between visitor and artist. Can this happen at Hudson Yards?”"
4877,"The Shed is trying. It is working to reach out to the city beyond its glass-tower neighbors: offering $10 tickets to people in low-income neighborhoods, starting a program teaching flex, the Brooklyn-born, bone-bending dance, at schools and public housing community centers, and presenting works by 52 emerging artists from around the city — including It’s Showtime NYC!, the dance collective born of outlawed subway performers."
4878,"And its flexible design holds out the possibility of presenting a wide variety of work, without being too hemmed in by the contours of its building. Which was the point from the beginning."
4879,"“It started with a kind of response to how to make a structure that would be responsive into the future,” Ms. Diller said. “The future is unknowable: That’s the one thing that we do know. So what would artists be thinking about and doing in 20 years, 40 years? We have absolutely no clue.”"
4880,"The Mets were back in the Polo Grounds in 1963 and so were their many fans. Who knows why everyone showed up, or why so many of them brought banners, but some of the fervor was just sheer irreverence, the antiestablishment joy of rooting for a team that was so awful."
4881,"And for sure, the Mets were terrible again, although this time they managed to win 51 games instead of 40. The nuttiest moment came when Jimmy Piersall ran around the bases backward after hitting the 100th home run of his career. The most exhilarating occurred when tens of thousands of Mets fans invaded Yankee Stadium for a charity exhibition game against baseball’s defending champions, had their banners confiscated and then went berserk anyway when the Mets actually won."
4882,"A year later, the Mets moved to Shea Stadium, their new home in Queens, and took their ineptitude with them. They went 59-103. They lost their home opener while creating a massive traffic jam. At the end of May, they lost a doubleheader at Shea that went on forever because of a 23-inning second game that lasted 7 hours 23 minutes, a record at the time. Three weeks later at Shea, the Mets were the victims of a perfect game thrown by Philadelphia’s Jim Bunning."
4883,"In 1965, the Mets were even worse, winning just 50 games while also losing Casey Stengel, who retired after breaking his hip. Without Stengel, the Mets were less entertaining and still stunk. They did move up from last place to ninth in 1966 but then fell right back into 10th a year later."
4884,"Still, that season the Mets had the rookie of the year in pitcher Tom Seaver. In 1968, the left-hander Jerry Koosman was just as impressive in his first season. The teammates of Seaver and Koosman now included other emerging players, like Jerry Grote and Bud Harrelson and Cleon Jones. And it showed in the Mets’ 1968 record — a 73-89 mark that still wasn’t very good but suggested that maybe something was changing. And something was."
4885,"The journey from hopelessness to champions of the world without having to pass through mediocrity might have been the miracle, and the devil’s bargain."
4886,By Robert Lipsyte
4887,"Mocking the Mets was considered cool in the early days of that ragtag expansion franchise because it concealed our painfully conflicted true feelings. At the same time that we were deeply ashamed at having been stuck with such a lousy team — how could baseball have scammed us like this? — we also embraced a lunatic joy at once more feeling major league. After all those years being the only three-team city in the show, we hadn’t found the Yankees enough for us."
4888,"So we celebrated the Mets in an appropriately early-1960s way — ironic, self-aware, rambunctious. Rock-ish. The crowds with their made-for-TV bedsheet banners seemed charmingly self-deprecating (“We don’t want to set the world on fire, we just want to finish ninth”) but they also foreshadowed darker times to come (“Pray”). The price of allowing, then encouraging, grandstand populism would eventually be their strident demands."
4889,"But those two Polo Grounds years were fun. Energized media members were thrilled with their new job and the West Coast trips to visit the Dodgers and Giants that came with them. Writers replated the former Yankee manager Casey Stengel as a madcap guru even as he spoke the truth after yet another loss (“The attendance was robbed, we’re still a fraud”), often with sarcasm (“Come out and see my amazin’ Mets”). A teenager who would never fulfill his hype, Ed Kranepool, was held up as the face of the future."
4890,"Most notorious of all, an inept first baseman, Marv Throneberry, was extolled as the symbol of the bumbling present. Years later, he told me how miserable he had been as a Met. He had entered the big leagues as a Yankee, Mickey Mantle’s heir, no less, after a sensational minor league career. Being celebrated as Marvelous Marv, the Mets’ fool, broke his spirit."
4891,"Perhaps the most telling signal that celebrating the “lovable losers” as comforting symbols of “everyman” — just like us! — would be short-lived was the creation of “neggies,” precursors of the Moneyball analytics of today. We needed those negative statistics to prove that the Mets were not merely profoundly second-rate but actually the worst of all time, so gloriously bad that we could claim them as champions, inverted champions to be sure, of games lost, chances bobbled, bases missed, hopes dashed. For the Mets, even mediocrity was a dream deferred."
4892,"But the founding Mets writers and fans couldn’t paint over the mid-’60s slump in real American life. The glow of post-World War II triumphalism had given way to the Bay of Pigs, the murderous resistance to civil rights activism, mounting Cold War anxiety, the assassination of J.F.K. There was too much dread. Mets fans began to clamor for some wins on their scoreboard."
4893,"There was a jolt of hope in 1964 when the Mets moved into their home for the next 44 years, Shea Stadium, paid for by the taxpaying fans, named for a wheeler-dealer lawyer. The ballpark was riddled with imperfections. The team was even worse, lurching through five more losing seasons. The Mets couldn’t even claw their way up to mediocrity."
4894,"The so-called New Breed fans (named and championed by the swaggering, righteous Daily News columnist Dick Young) grew restive. Beyond the ballpark, the riots and assassinations were taking their toll on the public psyche, and the Mets, our safety valve, our comic relief, were becoming just another black hole of despair."
4895,"And then came Tom Seaver — fresh, ebullient, hard-working, immensely talented. Nothing mediocre here. He was the Mets’ first homegrown superstar and many of us still think the only one. In 1967, he was National League rookie of the year, an All-Star, and a 16-game winner for a last-place club. The next year he again won 16 games, this time for a ninth-place club."
4896,"But Tom Terrific set the world on fire, not only the top gun of a strong young pitching staff — Jerry Koosman, Nolan Ryan, Gary Gentry, Tug McGraw — but the anti-Marv. He was the New Breed’s dream of the New Met, a California college boy with a playful cackle who would lead us to the promised pennant in 1969."
4897,"Was it a miracle? Don’t sports miracles happen suddenly, one hockey game, a shot heard ’round the world, a perfect punch? This miracle unspooled through seven years of suffering as preparation for 100 victories punctuated by Seaver’s 25. Beating the highly favored Orioles was almost anticlimactic: It was truly about the journey from hopelessness to champions of the world without having to pass through mediocrity. Maybe that was the miracle … and the devil’s bargain."
4898,"In fact, a case could be made — here it comes — that the 1969 World Series is still the high point of Mets history, that nothing in the next 50 years came close. The Mets lost the 1973 Series to Oakland and won in 1986 under morally nullifying circumstances; not only did they win because of a Red Sox error, but a member of that team in his final major league season, at a still serviceable 41, was Seaver."
4899,He should have still been a Met.
4900,"In 1977, a contract dispute with the cartoonishly imperious Mets chairman, M. Donald Grant, was viciously spun by Dick Young into a Desperate Players Wives plot; Nancy Seaver, he claimed, wanted Tom to make more than Nolan Ryan. A man of dignity, Seaver opted out and began an exile’s journey to the Reds, the White Sox, briefly back to the Mets, then the Red Sox and finally to his California winery."
4901,"The Mets went on to lose the World Series in 2000 and 2015, each by four games to one. Failing against the Yankees in 2000 doomed the Mets to their current fate. Only winning the Subway Series would redeem a history of steady disappointment. Their owners have been lackluster; they have managed a record of 4,362 victories against 4,732 defeats, a .480 average, not to mention involvement with the Ponzi schemer Bernie Madoff. The closest the Mets ever came to a Seaverish star was the talented, handsome, good-hearted David Wright, unfortunately bedeviled by injuries."
4902,"Even now, 50 years after what, yes, must have been a miracle, that glory is tinged with sadness. Seaver, a longtime victim of Lyme disease, recently announced his withdrawal from public life because of encroaching dementia. The creator of so many of our most amazin’ memories, is losing his."

4906,"Shea Stadium, the newest major league baseball park, opened for business yesterday with appropriate festivities and colossal traffic jams. A crowd of 50,312, including 48,736 who paid, radiated enthusiasm under sunny skies as the New York Mets fought their way to a typical 4-3 defeat at the hands of the Pittsburgh Pirates."
4907,The lack of parking space at the stadium caused massive traffic snarls that started an hour and a half before game time. The congestion was not nearly so bad after the game despite the addition of normally heavy commuter traffic. Traffic Commissioner Henry A. Barnes was in a helicopter over the area trying to unscramble postgame jams.
4908,"In every respect but traffic control and the outcome of the game, the occasion was declared a rousing success by most of those involved."

4911,Baseball’s transcontinental archrivals — the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants — battled through 10 hours and 23 minutes of a titanic doubleheader at Shea Stadium yesterday that included the longest game on a time basis ever played in the major leagues.
4912,"Endurance records, attendance records and performance records fell through nine innings of the first game and 23 innings of the second before the largest crowd of the baseball season anywhere — 57,037."
4913,"The huge throng saw the Giants win, 5-3 and 8-6. And the 8,000 to 10,000 still on hand when the action ended at 11:25 p.m. saw 41 players struggle for 7 hours and 23 minutes, a record, in the second game."
4914,The two teams also played the longest doubleheader in history: 9 hours 52 minutes on the field. They also played the most innings ever played by big-league teams in one day: 32.
4915,"During and after the games, people lined up outside the stadium to use a telephone alongside the right-field stands."
4916,"Because of a union jurisdictional dispute, there are no telephones at the stadium."
4917,"Some potential callers who saw the one phone booth tied up rushed hundreds of yards to the elevated train station. After paying a token, they raced to the phone booths there."

4936,"But in most ways, Seaver’s first major league victory turned into a triumph for the Mets’ Class of ’67 — especially since another rookie, Don Shaw, went to the rescue in the eighth inning and retired the last five Chicago batters."

4944,Leonard Koppett covered the World Series for The New York Times. Following are excerpts from his articles about the first four games.
4945,"BALTIMORE, Oct. 11 — The euphoric suspicion that the New York Mets might never lose another game was dispelled conclusively today as the Baltimore Orioles defeated them, 4-1, in the opening game of the World Series."
4946,"Mike Cuellar, the 32-year-old left-handed Cuban, pitched a strong six-hitter, striking out eight men. Tom Seaver, the most glamorous Met, also gave up six hits, but one was a leadoff home run by Don Buford in the first inning and four more hits came with two out in the fourth, when the Orioles scored their three other runs."
4947,"So Seaver, who left after five innings, suffered his first defeat since early August after 11 consecutive victories. And the Mets, for the first time in three weeks, lost a game that counted."
4948,"The Orioles, however, were not concerned with Met statistics. Having run away with the American League’s Eastern Division title (by 19 games) and polished off Minnesota in three straight in the championship series, they extended some streaks of their own by taking a 1-0 lead in the four-of-seven Series."
4949,"The only other time a Baltimore team had played in the Series was in 1966, when the Orioles swept the Los Angeles Dodgers, winning the last two games by 1-0 scores here in Memorial Stadium."
4950,"Thus, when the Mets finally scored on a sacrifice fly by Al Weis in the seventh inning, the run ended a string of 39 consecutive scoreless innings posted by Baltimore pitchers in Series competition. The Orioles also stand at this moment as the only team that has won every Series game it has played."
4951,"The Mets could have had that distinction had they won today, but the only real threat they mounted against Cuellar came too late because Seaver did not approach the form that had brought him 25 victories during the regular National League season."
4952,"In his last start, against Atlanta in the opening game of the pennant playoff there, he was also hit hard, but he emerged as the winning pitcher. This time, he didn’t get away with it."

4956,"Three straight singles with two out, by Ed Charles, Jerry Grote and Al Weis, gave the Mets the go-ahead run in the top half of the ninth inning. Then Jerry Koosman, who had held Baltimore hitless for six innings before yielding the tying run in the seventh, needed Ron Taylor’s help to nail down the final out with the potential tying and winning runs on base."
4957,"For the Mets and their followers, the entire final inning was a moment of truth."
4958,"If they lost this game, especially after Koosman’s fine two-hit effort, their position would approach hopelessness."
4959,Dave McNally had been tagged for a home run by Donn Clendenon in the fourth. The Orioles then made it 1-1.
4960,"Now, with two outs in the top of the ninth, Charles, the 36-year-old third baseman to whom this World Series is an unexpected and immeasurable experience, bounced a single through the left side, his second hit in a row."
4961,"Grote also singled on a hit-and-run play and Charles reached third. Then Weis, the unappreciated infielder, lined McNally’s first pitch to left for a single, scoring Charles."
4962,"Now it was up to Koosman, who needed three more outs. He retired Don Buford and Paul Blair but that brought up Frank Robinson, as feared a batter as baseball can provide."
4963,"Robinson walked. So did huge Boog Powell. Out of the dugout came Manager Gil Hodges, out of the game came Koosman, and out of the bullpen came Taylor to face Brooks Robinson."
4964,"On a full count, Robinson then swung and hit a sharp grounder to Charles, wide of third. Charles started to run the few steps to third base for a forceout, saw he didn’t have a play, and threw to first. Clendenon dug up the low throw and Robinson was out."

He was off in a special conference room, where superheroes are subjected to mass questioning, and later was on television.

4971,"“I was shading him a little bit toward right field,” said Agee of Hendricks, who bats left-handed. Hendricks hit a high drive toward the left-center-field fence, and Agee and Cleon Jones convened on it. “I saw the ball well because the sky was cloudy, not bright, but I wasn’t sure I could reach it.

4982,Neither the umpires nor the Baltimore Orioles noted that the New York Mets scored the winning run in Game 4 of the World Series on an illegal play.
4983,"The run scored because the throw by Orioles pitcher Pete Richert to first, on J. C. Martin’s bunt in the bottom of the 10th, was deflected by Martin’s left wrist a few strides before he reached the base. The ball bounced away from second baseman Dave Johnson, who was waiting for the throw, and only after that did pinch-runner Rod Gaspar, who had gone from second to third, continue home with the run that ended the game."
4984,"But Martin, running to first base, was not in the lane that exists specifically to prevent this sort of interference with a throw. Pictures show that he ran on the left side of the foul line instead of the right side, where he is supposed to run when there is a possibility of a throw being made to first base from behind him."
4985,"There is a special marking for this lane: a white line, three feet to the foul side and parallel to the foul line, extending the last 45 feet of the distance between home plate and first base."
4986,"No umpire called this infraction, for which Martin should have been declared out — and no Baltimore player or coach protested the oversight."
4987,"If Martin had been called out, the game would have continued with one out, Gaspar on third, Al Weis on second and Tommie Agee coming to bat, with Bud Harrelson due to bat."
4988,"The 3-foot lane has been the source of controversy in several American League games during the last two years. On 99 plays out of a hundred, the lane doesn’t matter, since it takes effect only if there is a throw from behind the runner. Which is what happened in Game 4."
4989,"Unlike photographs of some controversial plays, pictures of this play leave no room for ambiguity. Martin had both feet on the wrong side of the foul line. The throw hit his left wrist. It could not have done that if he had been in the proper lane."

No one could move a full step in any direction without pushing someone else aside."
5005,"That was the main dressing room. But the office of the manager, which is to the left of the entrance door (while the corridor leading into the rest of the clubhouse leads off to the right) was an oasis of order."
5006,"Manager Gil Hodges at first was in the mob outside. The first one into the empty office was Gil Jr., the C.W. Post College student, who hastily climbed out of his civilian clothes and into his Met uniform for the sweaty hour to follow."
5007,"Then came his mother, and the older two of his three sisters."
5008,"“We’re champions,” cried out Joan Hodges, who has lived through her husband’s baseball triumphs and setbacks with such fervor all these years. “Imagine, we did it!”"
5009,"A moment later, the head of the family entered, and Joan hugged him and squealed:"
5010,“You know what we are? You know? Champions. We’re champions of the world.”
5011,"Hodges hugged her back, and his daughters. And they kissed him, and he grinned, and Gil Jr. put his arms around them from behind while the Mets photographer snapped a family portrait."
5012,"And then the stream of interviewers began to trickle in, filling the office with bodies but not with any of the hysteria outside. Hodges, as he has always been, was calm, speaking softly but distinctly, mopping his face, listening attentively, answering carefully, smiling quickly — working, in a way, harder than during the game."
5013,"Mrs. Joan Payson, the team’s owner, arrived, too."
5014,"“Oh my, oh my,” she kept repeating. “Oh my.” Donald Grant, the chairman of the board, was there, and then Johnny Murphy, who actually ran the club as general manager, and Georgie Weiss who had started it, and other members of the Mets family."
5015,"“Yes, it’s the same and it’s different,” said Hodges, trying to answer questions about how this victory felt alongside other World Series triumphs he experienced with the Dodgers, in 1955 and 1959. “As a player, and as a manager, it’s different — it’s hard to explain. In a way this means more. I’m so proud of them all.”"
5016,"Did he think Donn Clendenon was the most valuable player, worthy of the car given for that distinction?"
5017,"“That’s not my job,” said Gil. “I think of all 25 of them — and four coaches. Let’s see, that’s 29.”"
5018,"“And the manager,” someone suggested."
5019,"“No, no, not the manager,” demurred Hodges."
5020,"“The manager already has a car,” a voice interrupted, and everyone laughed, including Hodges."
5021,"Later it became celebrity time — Pearl Bailey, who kissed Hodges, called him a “cool cat,” and wound up dancing in the main room with Charles while a record player blared the singalong record the Met squad had made two weeks ago; Robert Merrill, the opera star, who sat with the Met party all three days at Shea and was still shaking. Bill Shea, who set the whole thing in motion and for whom the stadium is named, saying “in my lifetime — they did it in my lifetime!”"
5022,"After an hour or more, Joan Hodges was casting anxious glances at her husband — who, after all, had suffered a heart attack only 13 months before and whose marvelous discipline and recovery can’t eliminate worry. Only two days ago, however, a doctor’s examination had shown Gil in fine shape."
5023,"But sporadic yelling and singing were still going on in the clubhouse, the floor slippery, the room less crowded, but few players dressed. In another hour or two, they would go upstairs to the Diamond Club for a real party, with their wives and the whole Met official family."
5024,"“It’s the first one,” Swoboda had shouted at the beginning, “and the sweetest, and because it’s the first, nothing can ever be that sweet again.”"
5025,"In other words, all they have to look forward to is repetition."
5026,The Final Out: The announcer Curt Gowdy on NBC: “There’s a fly ball out to left. Waiting is Jones … the Mets are the world champions! Jerry Koosman is being mobbed! Look at this scene!”
5027,"In both years, the World Series lasted five games, but the similarities pretty much ended there. Daytime games then, nighttime now. Complete games then, an army of relievers now. And so on. However, each Series did have a first baseman who excelled and did so with virtually the same statistics. What was very different was the vehicle they drove away with as the Series M.V.P."

5306,"On cold mornings, Les Goodson shows up early outside the University Club, on a wealthy stretch of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, and races two panhandlers he has nicknamed Catman and Pimp-the-Baby for a warm spot in front of a steam vent. He launches into “Take Five” on his saxophone, leaving his case open for bills and coins."
5307,"In a good week, it’s a living — enough to pay the rent on his railroad flat in Harlem and put food on the table. A few times, he has seen a former classmate, Gregory Peterson, bound into the social club without so much as a nod."
5308,"Mr. Goodson, 67, and his classmate were among a record number of black students admitted to Columbia University in 1969. Columbia and other competitive colleges had already begun changing the racial makeup of their campuses as the civil rights movement gained ground, but the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, and the resulting student strikes and urban uprisings, prompted them to redouble their efforts."
5309,"They acted partly out of a moral imperative, but also out of fear that the fabric of society was being torn apart by racial conflict. They took chances on promising black students from poor neighborhoods they had long ignored, in addition to black students groomed by boarding schools."
5310,"A look back through the decades shows what went right in the early years of affirmative action in college admissions, but also what can go wrong even with the best of intentions."
5311,"Those who were able, through luck or experience or hard work, to adapt to the culture of institutions that had long been pillars of the white establishment succeeded by most conventional measures. Others could not break through because of personal trauma, family troubles, financial issues, culture shock — the kind of problems felt by many white students as well, but compounded by being in such a tiny minority. And universities at the time, they said, did not have the will or the knowledge to help."
5312,"“I think it’s a fair question to ask: Did we really understand or know what we were doing, or could we have predicted what the issues would be?” said Robert L. Kirkpatrick Jr., who at the time was dean of admissions at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., which was part of these early efforts. “The answer is no. I think we were instinctively trying to do the right thing.”"
5313,Columbia — an Ivy League campus right next to Harlem — was a particularly revelatory setting. Perhaps nowhere else were the divisions more striking between the privilege inside university gates and the troubles and demands of black people outside them.
5314,"The New York Times tracked down many of the nearly 50 black students in Columbia’s Class of 1973, who arrived on campus as freshmen in 1969. Some of them have remained close friends and helped locate others from directories and photographs."
5315,The number of black students admitted to Columbia more than doubled in 1969 from the year before. About half of those who enrolled received their degrees four years later. 
5316,"Many, like Mr. Peterson, went on to comfortable lives and professional success. His classmate, Eric H. Holder Jr., rose from a strivers’ neighborhood in Queens to become the first black attorney general of the United States. There were future doctors in the class, future executives and lawyers. Others, like Mr. Goodson, strayed from prescribed paths."
5317,"The debate over race in college admissions only intensified. By the late 1970s, colleges began emphasizing the value of diversity on campus over the case for racial reparations. "
5318,"Today, Harvard and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill are facing legal challenges to race-conscious admissions that could reach the Supreme Court. The Trump administration is investigating allegations of discrimination against Asian-American applicants at Harvard and Yale. University officials who lived through the history fear that the gains of the last 50 years could be rolled back."
5319,"One of them is Lee Bollinger, the current president of Columbia, who first arrived on campus as a law student in 1968."
5320,"“In that time, there was a sense, pure and simple, that universities had to do their part to help integrate higher education,” Mr. Bollinger said. “We are still on that mission, but the sense of purpose and urgency and connection to the past have dissipated.”"
5321,"Mr. Goodson sits on a plastic milk crate covered by a clean, brightly colored cushion. He is wrapped in layers of flannel shirts, sweatshirts, a canvas jacket, and wears stylish suede shoes. A watch cap and a graying goatee hide his face."
5322,"He resents it when people assume he is homeless and plop down bags of food next to him without even asking. He is more forgiving of the police officers who routinely ask him if he would like to go to a shelter. He jokes: No thanks, he has a place at Trump Tower, across the street. (His apartment is a short subway ride away, not far from the jazz club where he plays a weekly gig.)"
5323,"Mr. Goodson grew up in a housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, and in those days he was known as Ervin. His mother was a housekeeper for a wealthy family on Park Avenue; his father was a tailor and owned a dry-cleaning shop for a time. He took an early liking to music, learning to play the viola from Cora Roth, his fifth-grade teacher at Public School 46 in Brooklyn, now a painter in Los Angeles who still remembers him as “a pure soul.” "
5324,"A number of programs sprang up at the time to find talented students from tough neighborhoods. In junior high school, Mr. Goodson was chosen to spend three summers in enrichment classes at Hotchkiss, a Connecticut boarding school, where he read incessantly. He was accepted to New York’s Stuyvesant High School, which at the time was mostly white. Now Stuyvesant is mostly Asian-American, and under attack for its test-based admissions. This year, seven black students were offered admission out of 895 slots."
5325,"When a racially fueled teachers’ strike broke out during Mr. Goodson’s senior year, his parents managed to transfer him to the Wooster School, another boarding school in Connecticut. He had been a middling student at Stuyvesant, but vaulted to the top of his class in private school."
5326,"An English teacher drove him to Columbia for the admission interview, and he remembers feeling “a little bit phony” as he answered questions. He was also accepted at Dartmouth, but chose Columbia because it was closer to home."
5327,"In college, Mr. Goodson realized that he could reinvent himself, and began going by Les, his middle name, instead of Ervin. He wanted to be a photographer, and took pictures of B.B. King, Amiri Baraka and the band Sha Na Na with his Miranda camera. He made some rash decisions, once spending $600 of a $1,500 student loan on a Karmann Ghia sports car."
5328,Not much in the course catalog spoke to him.
5329,"“If you go back and look at that blue book, all the courses — I would say 95 percent — were Eurocentric,” he said. “I remember they had a few black courses, and all the black students would take them because they were known as cushy courses, because they were easy to pass.”"
5330,"The only black professor he can remember was Charles Hamilton, a political scientist who collaborated with Stokely Carmichael, the civil rights leader, to write about the Black Power movement, which Mr. Goodson said influenced him. Columbia’s first black department chair, Elliott Skinner, in anthropology, would not be named until 1972 — the year Mr. Goodson dropped out."
5331,"After his freshman year, Mr. Goodson was asked to take a leave for bad grades. He lived surreptitiously on campus, crashing in friends’ dorm rooms. He got a student at Barnard, Columbia’s sister college, pregnant, and his daughter was born in August 1971. After three years, he left Columbia for good."
5332,"“Nothing stopped me from finishing,” Mr. Goodson said. “I just did something else.”"
5333,"While civil rights leaders pressed colleges to admit more black students, the big push came after the assassination of Dr. King on April 4, 1968, followed by uprisings in more than 100 cities and student strikes."
5334,"“I don’t see how you can understand it apart from the upheavals on campus, racial upheavals in the larger society, the general upheavals around the world,” said Jerome Karabel, a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a historian of college admissions."
5335,"Later that month, students occupied several buildings in protest of what they saw as Columbia’s complicity in the Vietnam War and a plan to build a gym in a Harlem park. The standoff ended with a violent clash with the police."
5336,"The radical politics of 1968 came too late to affect the admissions decisions that fall, as acceptance notices had already gone out. But in 1969, the number of black students recruited and admitted to Ivy League universities and their sister schools rose sharply from the year before, in many cases by more than 100 percent, according to statistics published in The Times in April 1969."
5337,"From 1968 to 1969, according to archival data provided by Columbia this year, the number of students recorded as black who applied rose to 220 from 121, the number who were admitted rose to 130 from 58, and the number who registered rose to 48 from 31 out of a total class of about 700. (All of them were men; Columbia College did not begin admitting women until the 1980s.)"
5338,Some black students in that class resisted being cast as emissaries of racial understanding.
5339,"Gregory Peterson, the classmate Mr. Goodson has seen going into the University Club, did not see himself in any racial framework. “I shied away from anything that was like a ‘black’ group,” he said, “because I didn’t grow up that way.”"
5340,"He and his twin brother, Maurice, were in advanced classes in predominantly white schools, although they were part of the black middle class in East Elmhurst, Queens. Their father owned a barbershop; their mother was a teacher."
5341,"When Mr. Peterson was in high school, the mother of a white friend took him to a cocktail party where he met a white intellectual who had gone to Exeter and Harvard. He became a mentor, encouraging Mr. Peterson’s ambitions to apply to Ivy League universities."
5342,"At Columbia, Mr. Peterson was an English major, and mixed with white students. He discovered his gay identity, though he remained closeted."
5343,He did experience racial discrimination in college. A Southern white Barnard student apologized to him for not being able to invite him to a party back home. An older man at a reception once assumed he was on the basketball team.
5344,"But race took a back seat to his sexuality. “I was so busy having problems being gay that I didn’t notice being black,” he said."
5345,"After graduating in 1973, Mr. Peterson spent a few years in the arts before “the rational side took over,” and he went to Columbia Law School. He went on to become a corporate lawyer. His brother, who also graduated from Columbia, owns a spa."
5346,"Mr. Peterson and his husband now live on a high floor of a prewar building at 72nd Street and Riverside Drive, a prime Manhattan location. The light-filled apartment is crammed with his art collection. A portrait by Paul Hodgson of Mr. Peterson in a formal suit, looking cerebral and commanding, hangs on one wall."
5347,"A while back, as Mr. Peterson got out of a cab on his way to the University Club, he was greeted by a street musician."
5348,"“Hey, Gregory, it’s Lester — from Columbia,” the musician said."
5349,"The sounds of a saxophone had often filtered into the club gymnasium through the steam vents, but Mr. Peterson had never known who was playing it. He had not stopped before because he had not recognized his classmate."
5350,"“I tell you, I just totally flipped out,” Mr. Peterson said."
5351,"He did not know enough about Mr. Goodson’s life to judge him, he said. But the encounter made him conscious of his own good fortune."
5352,"In July 1972, Eldridge McKinney, a black sophomore at Columbia, shot the dean of students several times with a .38-caliber handgun. Mr. McKinney had been suspended for bad grades, and was angry that he was not reinstated, the police said. By one news account, he shouted “racist bastard” at the dean, who was white, before opening fire."
5353,"The dean, Henry S. Coleman, was badly wounded but returned to work. (Mr. Coleman had been caught up in campus turmoil before, when students occupied Hamilton Hall and took him hostage in 1968.)"
5354,"Mr. McKinney’s fall from grace was steep. He arrived at Columbia in the fall of 1970, a year behind Mr. Goodson and Mr. Peterson, as an overachiever: a Boy Scout leader; the valedictorian of his high school on the South Side of Chicago; a member of the band, school newspaper, yearbook, and the math, chess and Spanish clubs, according to The Chicago Tribune at the time. But at Columbia, something changed."
5355,"After the shooting, Mr. McKinney’s mother and Roy Innis, the civil rights leader, publicly pleaded with him to turn himself in. Charged with attempted murder, he disappeared. Classmates remember the jarring sight of his face on wanted posters at the post office. His friends believe that he has been living under an assumed name and identity for nearly 47 years."
5356,"Mr. McKinney, nicknamed E, became something of a legend. Some black students quietly cheered him on, understanding his rage. “E was sort of like a semi-hero at the time, because apparently he got away with it,” Mr. Goodson said. “And every once in a while, I’ll ask somebody, ‘Yo man, you ever hear from E?’”"
5357,"Darryl T. Downing, a black classmate of Mr. McKinney’s, stepped forward to defend him in 1972. He told The Times back then that Mr. McKinney wanted to be a lawyer, but found Columbia to be a hard adjustment."
5358,"“Columbia is not the situation we’re used to,” Mr. Downing, who went to a neighborhood public school in New York City, said then. “But we felt we were lucky to be here, so we got together to adjust.”"
5359,"Mr. Downing now lives in a high-rise project in Harlem, where he answers the door warily; for many years, he said, the police or the F.B.I. would knock on his door asking if he had heard anything from Mr. McKinney."
5360,"Mr. Downing said he had been constantly looked on with suspicion at Columbia, as if he did not belong. Security guards would demand to see his identification every time he walked in, even though they knew who he was and did not demand the same of white students."
5361,"Soon after the dean was shot, when the campus was “on high alert,” Mr. Downing said he was brought up on disciplinary charges for fighting with a white student who barged into his dorm room uninvited. He said that Dr. Skinner, the black anthropology professor, interceded on his behalf."
5362,"“Instead of just going to school and just having an experience, the experience was survival,” said Mr. Downing, who is now an events promoter. In his last semester, he “just walked away.”"
5363,"Black and Hispanic alumni from those days recall forming tight bonds because they were so few. They studied together. They went to their own parties and listened to different music. Mr. Downing recalled that his black friends preferred rhythm and blues, while his white classmates listened to Jimi Hendrix."
5364,"“We had massive — massive — study groups, where everybody would pile into a black lounge,” Mr. Downing said. Many black students felt pulled in two directions — assimilation or resistance."
5365,"“I think that’s still an open question in some people’s minds: Are you expected to stay with your ghetto identity and the world has to adapt to you?” said Julius Gonzalez, the son of Cuban factory workers in West Harlem, and a member of the Class of 1973. “Or do you make a few adjustments and adapt more to the outside world?”"
5366,"Despite how hard it could be to adapt, there were many success stories among the black students in the Class of 1973."
5367,"Mr. Gonzalez, whose factory-worker parents had grade-school educations, got an M.B.A. from Harvard and became a financial officer in energy ventures abroad. He is now retired and living in Florida."
5368,"Gary Friday, son of a beer distributor in Philadelphia, became a neurologist. Eric Coleman, whose widowed mother straightened and curled hair in her kitchen and took in laundry, is a state judge in Connecticut."
5369,"But many names disappeared from the class directory between freshman and senior years. “Sometimes I look through a list of people who actually graduated,” Dr. Friday said. “A lot of people are missing.”"
5370,"About half the students recorded as black in the class — 25 of the 48 — received diplomas in 1973, according to the data provided by Columbia. Seven more got their degrees later, and one, a student from Tanzania, graduated early."
5371,"The common perception that professors made allowances for minority students was false, Mr. Gonzalez said. If anything, being black invited tougher scrutiny. “Some of these guys smirked and looked at you and said, ‘What are you doing here? You misspelled a term,’” he said. “You had to prove them wrong.”"
5372,"Within a few years, universities stopped taking as many gambles. The early press coverage was celebratory: “Colleges That Recruit in Ghetto Find Effort Benefits All Concerned” read a headline in The Wall Street Journal in 1968. But it soon became more skeptical."
5373,"Thomas Sowell, a black professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles, wrote in The Times in 1970 that white college administrators, out of misguided “romanticism,” were admitting unqualified “‘authentic’ ghetto types” and setting them up to fail, while overlooking “intellectually oriented black students.”"
5374,"A 1973 New York Times Magazine article by Martin Kilson, a black Harvard professor of government, caused a furor by arguing that students had imported a culture of black separatism that was dysfunctional in academia."
5375,"It was the dawn of a series of bitter battles in the Supreme Court over allegations of “reverse racism” against white students, beginning with Marco DeFunis, a white student rejected by the University of Washington Law School in 1971. The high court found the DeFunis case moot in 1974 because the plaintiff was graduating."
5376,"David L. Evans, associate dean of admissions at Harvard, acidly complained that because of the DeFunis case, alumni believed that “semiliterate blacks are being accepted at the expense of white geniuses,” according to The Harvard Crimson in 1975."
5377,"Since then, the Supreme Court has consistently upheld the right of colleges to use race as one factor in admissions. Now Harvard is fighting a claim that it is manipulating the admissions process to exclude Asian-Americans."
5378,"But what happened 50 years ago changed admissions forever. In some ways, affirmative action has become more sophisticated over time, as diversity has become an established principle, and schools — barred by law from using racial quotas — have sought an ideal mix of students that is more reflective of society."
5379,"Colleges often turn to private schools to find even poor black and Hispanic students, because “they have the cultural and social capital to succeed on campus,” said Anthony Abraham Jack, a professor of education at Harvard and author of “The Privileged Poor.”"
5380,"Mr. Gonzalez said he saw the difference among the younger generation of black and Hispanic students at reunions: “They act like, ‘Yeah, I belong here.’”"
5381,"After dropping out, Mr. Goodson worked a variety of jobs, from junk hauler to taxi driver to furniture refinisher."
5382,"In a late-life bid for middle-class stability, he returned to college with renewed zeal for learning, and received a bachelor’s degree in history from Lehman College in 2003, then completed most of a master’s degree. He lasted only briefly as a high school social studies teacher, unable to abide students who addressed him as “Dawg” and freely used racial slurs among themselves."
5383,"His daughter, Dara, graduated from Morgan State University, a historically black college in Baltimore. She and her husband, both teachers, have three children."
5384,"A few years ago, Mr. Goodson was rejected from a Columbia Ph.D. program. The blow was softened by the interest that one professor, Eric Foner, an expert in the Reconstruction era, took in his proposal to study the 13th Amendment’s exception clause and its connection to black incarceration. (“When he proposed to study this subject, it was a very original project,” Professor Foner wrote in an email.)"
5385,"Mr. Goodson has not strayed far from the Columbia orbit. Every Wednesday night, his four-piece band, the Les Goodson Intergalactic Soul Jazz Band, performs at Paris Blues, an old-fashioned dive bar just a 15-minute walk from campus."
5386,"What he whimsically calls his “penthouse,” a fifth-floor walk-up in central Harlem, is a few blocks farther."
5387,"The apartment is a revelation. It is narrow, stylishly appointed. He has decorated the walls with art and photographs that he made himself. One painting is splattered like a Jackson Pollock. A homage to Miró features a big blue flying saucer; floating window bars were inspired by Chagall."
5388,"He has stacked sheet music on the floor under a well-buffed antique wooden table that is a testament to his refinishing skills. A violin hangs on the wall. Scattered about are dismembered bits of saxophone, an instrument he first picked up some 50 years ago, in a classmate’s dorm room."
5389,"“Columbia,” he said, “it changed my whole life.”"
5390,Doris Burke and Alain Delaquérière contributed research.
5391,"When you find yourself at 77 a billionaire six times over and an N.F.L. team owner practically running out of fingers for Super Bowl rings, there aren’t a ton of opportunities you haven’t already enjoyed. Private jets are your subways. Weekends with pals at $2,000-a-night island resorts are your backyard barbecues. The question “what to do for kicks?” becomes harder to answer."
5392,"That may be why Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, ended up on stage with Cardi B before Super Bowl LIII last month."
5393,"Mr. Kraft was at the pregame party hosted by Michael G. Rubin, the 46-year-old owner of Fanatics, the online sports merchandise company, and an owner of the Philadelphia 76ers."
5394,"Cardi B was performing “Money.” (It goes: “I like boardin’ jets, I like mornin’ sex, but nothing in this world that I like more than checks.”) “Get out there and dance,” said Meek Mill, just off the stage, to Mr. Rubin and Mr. Kraft."
5395,"Mr. Rubin backed away. But Mr. Kraft, dressed in black and his signature Nike Air Force One sneakers, began to bust out some steps."
5396,"“He was moving more than I thought he could move,” Meek Mill said later. The video spread around the web."
5397,"It was about three weeks later, though, that news about Mr. Kraft really went viral. "
5398,"On Feb. 22, Mr. Kraft was charged with two misdemeanor counts of soliciting sex at a massage parlor in Jupiter, Fla. He pleaded not guilty."
5399,"[Read more: Despite charges, Trump wants Robert Kraft at Super Bowl celebration.]"
5400,"On Tuesday, prosecutors made an offer to Mr. Kraft and 24 other men facing charges: a fine and community service in return for admitting that if their cases were to go to trial, the prosecutors would win."
5401,"And on Wednesday, lawyers for Mr. Kraft and 14 other men filed a motion to prevent evidence in the case from being made public, including hidden camera video of the men at the massage parlor. "
5402,"As of Friday, Mr. Kraft, who declined to comment for this article, refused to sign the proposed deal."
5403,"And on Saturday, he released a statement. “I am truly sorry. I know I have hurt and disappointed my family, my close friends, my co-workers, our fans and many others who rightfully hold me to a higher standard,” it said, in part. “Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women; my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years.”"
5404,"The Kraft camp is very sensitive to the inferences that Mr. Kraft’s solicitation charges have anything to do with what prosecutors say is a larger investigation into sex trafficking. All told, dozens of men have been charged with soliciting prostitution."
5405,"“We have looked into it, we’ve looked at the charges brought, looked at the evidence, and there is zero evidence of human trafficking,” said William Burck, one of his attorneys."
5406,The operators of the Jupiter spa have not been charged with sex trafficking; the women Mr. Kraft is accused of soliciting are 45 and 58 years old and are licensed massage therapists.
5407,"Another woman, who ran a spa in Vero Beach, has been charged with trafficking, and the investigation continues, as does a conversation about the role of men seeking sex for money in the trafficking economy."
5408,"And Mr. Kraft’s name continues to propel the conversation about that investigation. “It makes my skin crawl to see him being smeared this way,” said Drew Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback."
5409,"While Mr. Bledsoe and others who are sympathetic to Mr. Kraft say prosecutors are using the solicitation charges against him largely to publicize their broader investigation, it remains true that the sex trade often exploits women who have few or no means to escape it."
5410,"As his lawyers fight the case, Mr. Kraft has been described by friends as conflicted. He is angry about what he did and ashamed of the embarrassment he has caused, yet insistent that he did nothing illegal and is defiant enough to hire a very expensive legal team to battle charges that most people settle quickly. "
5411,"Several people interviewed for this article say he continues, a month after the case became public, to break down in tears when discussing the situation."
5412,"Casual friends of Mr. Kraft think the public reaction is overblown. “I can understand someone being 77 and going to a massage parlor,” said Larry King, 85. “He’s an older man who finds himself with a need and he gets that need satisfied. Why do we care?”"
5413,Much of the fascination with this case stems from an as-yet unanswered question: Why was a gazillionaire going to a random strip mall massage parlor anyway?
5414,And the attendant tabloid headlines are a consequence of Mr. Kraft’s fame and wealth. Here is one of the richest men in the country — a pal of President Trump and the owner of a dominant football team — charged with a seedy offense.
5415,"Now he must face the group he may care about as much as his family: his fellow N.F.L. team owners, who will gather starting Sunday at the Biltmore hotel in Phoenix for their annual meeting. "
5416,"Last year the talk there surrounded Colin Kaepernick and players kneeling during the national anthem. This year, the chatter will be about what penalty the league may impose upon Mr. Kraft for “conduct detrimental to the league” — code for making the owners look bad."
5417,"Friends and colleagues in Mr. Kraft’s inner circle say that his current legal problems reveal his continuing struggle to recalibrate in the aftermath of the 2011 death of that “love of my life” — his wife, Myra. "
5418,"They married in 1963, when he was 22 and about to enroll in Harvard Business School and she was 21, going into her senior year at Brandeis University. They were married for 48 years when Mrs. Kraft died of ovarian cancer."
5419,"“Bobby was so devastated when Myra died,” said Steven J. Comen, who has known Mr. Kraft since they were in kindergarten. “It took him a long time to get his bearings. If you can imagine becoming married when they were kids, and having kids when they essentially were still kids, and having the partnership to build something that was so spectacular — and her going through such a long period of suffering and then dying — well, it would have been devastating to anyone.”"
5420,"This wasn’t a situation where Mr. Kraft took care of the business and Mrs. Kraft saw to the home life, said Tom Brady, the Patriots’ quarterback for 19 years, who called from a family vacation to talk about his closeness with “RKK” and the Kraft family."
5421,"“I remember bringing my oldest son, Jack, in to her office and her playing with him on the floor, with blocks and Legos,” Mr. Brady said. “She was very influential in my life and in many players’ lives. She was the mother of four sons, so she knew what it was like being around boys.”"
5422,"Mr. Kraft has had one serious girlfriend in the intervening years. He met Ricki Noel Lander, now 39, in 2012 at a party hosted by Steve Tisch, an owner of the New York Giants. They have gone through very public phases, like attending a New York City Ballet gala for which Ms. Lander served as a chair, along with Sarah Jessica Parker, in 2016, and she appeared on the field with him after Super Bowl wins, including after the most recent one. "
5423,"They also have maintained separate lives. In 2017, Ms. Lander became a mother to a baby girl. The Patriots released a statement that said, “While Robert Kraft is not the biological father, he is thrilled with Ricki’s blessing of having a healthy child.” (Attempts to reach Ms. Lander were unsuccessful.)"
5424,Public and private reaction to Mr. Kraft’s most recent newsworthiness is complicated. Most of his fellow N.F.L. owners are reluctant to speak publicly about his crisis.
5425,"But his fight against a relatively minor charge, using high-priced lawyers, is evidence of his sense of self-importance, possibly prolonging the media attention, according to at least one person familiar with that world. "
5426,"“The problem with Kraft is the problem with famous people, which is you bring famous attorneys and think they will do a better job,” said Hugh Culverhouse Jr., a former prosecutor and lawyer in Florida and son of the former owner of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. “It’s like going to a knife fight with the entire Seventh Army.”"
5427,"Some politicians, including Senator Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said they intend to give the campaign donations they received from Mr. Kraft to groups focused on ending human trafficking, according to The Boston Globe. A group of survivors of sexual exploitation are planning to send a letter to the N.F.L. to ask that Mr. Kraft be barred from owning a team."
5428,"These days, Mr. Kraft is leaning heavily on one of his closest friends, Mr. Rubin, 30 years his junior. Like Mr. Kraft, Mr. Rubin is a billionaire who is branching into professional sports ownership."
5429,"“We talk on the phone five times a day,” said Mr. Rubin in an interview at the Fanatics office in New York. (Actually, he and Mr. Kraft like to FaceTime each other.)"
5430,"They were set up on a friend date in 2012 by Mr. Kraft’s oldest son, Jonathan Kraft, the president of the Kraft Group and the New England Patriots. Mr. Rubin was divorced, and so they were two single men with 10-digit bank accounts. "
5431,"“I’ll go as his date to events, he’ll come as my date,” Mr. Rubin said. “My girlfriend is jealous. She’ll say, ‘I wish you talked to me the way you talk to Robert.’”"
5432,"In Charlotte, N.C., during last month’s N.B.A. All-Star weekend, Mr. Rubin chatted with an N.B.A. employee who revealed that he was a die-hard Patriots fan. “So I FaceTime Robert,” Mr. Rubin said, “he’s got his shirt off, he’s in bed. I say to the kid, ‘Say hi to Robert,’ and then I leave the phone.”"
5433,"Mr. Rubin is trying to keep Mr. Kraft hip to pop culture, but some references get lost. In February, Mr. Rubin was at a 76ers game with the actress Emily Ratajkowski and her husband, Sebastian Bear-McClard, a producer, and Josh Ostrovsky, the Instagram personality known as the Fat Jew. "
5434,Mr. Rubin FaceTimed Mr. Kraft and introduced him to Mr. Ostrovsky. Mr. Kraft was perplexed. “What do you mean he’s a fat Jew?” he said. 
5435,Mr. Kraft and Meek Mill first bonded through Mr. Rubin during a guys’ weekend in Miami to attend the 2017 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.
5436,"“I am from the ghettos of America, and he is one of the most powerful billionaires,” said Meek Mill of Mr. Kraft. “He is more down-to-earth and relatable than I expected him to be.” "
5437,"After the Patriots won their sixth Super Bowl, in February, Meek Mill gave Mr. Kraft his $200,000 diamond-encrusted necklace that spells out “Championships,” the title of his recent album. Mr. Kraft wore it during the victory parade. "
5438,"“My chain is like my Super Bowl trophy for rising above poverty and overcoming the system,” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘I wear this chain every day. It’s my gift to you.’”"
5439,Meek Mill said he had spoken to Mr. Kraft probably 30 times since the massage parlor scandal broke. 
5440,"In 2017, Meek Mill, now 31, was sentenced to two to four years in prison for violating his parole. (Meek Mill pleaded not guilty to the initial incident, when he was 19, and said if he had done what he was accused of, he would be dead. “Everyone knows what happens to a black kid that points a gun at police officers,” he said.)"
5441,"Meek Mill’s friends, including Mr. Kraft, talked to him frequently while he was in prison and were outraged by his situation. Mr. Kraft visited him in prison a year ago and spoke to the press about injustice afterward."
5442,"The N.F.L.’s inner circle is dominated by billionaires who lean to the right. Despite his friendship with Mr. Trump, Mr. Kraft is considered one of the more liberal owners, backing an array of progressive causes and voting Democratic more often than not."
5443,"“He is one of the biggest faces in America, and this is a smart guy saying to the world, ‘This is a good kid.’” Meek Mill said. “It was a big deal for me.”"
5444,"After Meek Mill was released, Mr. Rubin asked Mr. Kraft to join his efforts to create an organization called Reform Alliance, to fight for changes to criminal justice practices. The eight founders, including Jay-Z and Daniel Loeb, a billionaire investor, pledged a combined $50 million."
5445,"Meek Mill sees echoes of his experiences in Mr. Kraft’s current predicament. “They aligned his name with a different set of charges that weren’t tied to him at all,” he said."
5446,"There are big differences, and Meek Mill has made sure Mr. Kraft appreciates them too. “I said it to Robert the other day, ‘Someone as powerful as you, you have done so much good in the world and brung so much to America, you see what they did to you,’” Meek Mill said. “I said to him, ‘Imagine someone that comes from poverty in the ghetto who doesn’t have people to speak up for them on their behalf. It happens in my community every day.’”"
5447,"Mr. Kraft grew up in Brookline, Mass., loving sports, though joining teams was difficult because he couldn’t play on the Sabbath. He liked the Boston Braves baseball team."
5448,"He went to college at Columbia, on scholarship. As a senior, he went back to Boston for a football game and spotted Myra Hiatt in a delicatessen. He waited until her date went to the restroom and then introduced himself. He went to the library on the Brandeis campus the next day to look her up, and they married the following year."
5449,"Myra finished college, and they had four sons; three work for the family business. "
5450,"After attending Harvard Business School, Mr. Kraft went to work for his father-in-law. Mr. Kraft had his own vision for the company, and left but eventually purchased the business and began to build a fortune in paper and packaging. As he did, he and Mrs. Kraft established themselves as a power couple in Boston’s charity scene. The family has given away “hundreds of millions of dollars,” a Patriots spokesman said."
5451,"Foundations backed by Mr. Kraft are known to make unexpected calls to small organizations in which Mr. Kraft pledges a gift ranging from $100,000 to a few million dollars, urging the nonprofit group to create donor-match campaigns."
5452,"A few years ago, Lisa Goldblatt Grace, a founder of My Life My Choice, received such a call, from an executive at the Patriots Foundation. The mission of My Life My Choice is to support young survivors of sexual exploitation and the commercial sex industry. The foundation gave the group $100,000, with a matching incentive. The money allowed the group to hire another mentor, Ms. Grace said."
5453,"“We were heartbroken when we heard the news that Robert Kraft had been charged,” Ms. Grace said. “The most important thing we can do is focus on the victims and shine a light that helps people to understand that this is a multi-billion-dollar industry that preys on the most vulnerable.”"
5454,"In 1994, Mr. Kraft paid $172 million for the Patriots, at the time the largest sum paid for a professional sports franchise. "
5455,Mr. Kraft and his son Jonathan flew back from the meeting to Boston (middle seats in coach on T.W.A.) to tell Mrs. Kraft the deal was done. She was worried that the high price tag would make it difficult for the family to continue its philanthropy. Mr. Kraft promised her that owning an N.F.L. team would give them an even larger platform to support their causes.
5456,"The next night, Mrs. Kraft overheard her husband on the phone with the head coach, Bill Parcells. Mr. Parcells said he needed $10 million for a contract to sign a player."
5457,"She was not happy. “The summer house better be in my name,” she told him."
5458,"The investment turned out to be beyond sound. In 2000 Mr. Kraft lured Bill Belichick away from the Patriots’ division rival New York Jets. The next year, Mr. Brady became the team’s starting quarterback, and the Patriots raced all the way to their first Super Bowl win."
5459,"The Belichick-Brady tandem has shattered records ever since. Forbes estimates that the Patriots are the second-most-valuable N.F.L. franchise, worth an estimated $3.8 billion."
5460,"The team’s success has also burnished Mr. Kraft’s status inside the N.F.L., where owners can be hypercompetitive and jealous. By most accounts, Mr. Kraft has become the league’s most influential owner, with seats on the powerful broadcasting, labor and finance committees. "
5461,"His contacts in media circles make him indispensable during negotiations with the television networks that provide the bulk of the league’s income. One owner said that these multi-billion-dollar deals are typically negotiated by three people: the N.F.L. commissioner, Roger Goodell; Brian Rolapp, the league’s media chief; and Mr. Kraft."
5462,"Now, amid what friends describe as Mr. Kraft’s unyielding anguish over his travails and the uncertainties he is confronting in the legal system, the N.F.L. and the court of public opinion, Mr. Kraft’s BFFs are rallying around him, and are eager to discuss the depth of their respect."
5463,"Despite the solicitation charges, Mr. Trump has said he wants Mr. Kraft to attend a White House reception celebrating the Patriots’ recent Super Bowl victory."
5464,"Mr. Brady is also standing by his longtime friend. “I’ve been with the organization 19 years and I’ve been through a lot,” Mr. Brady said. “He has been by me and supported me. That’s hard to do these days — to have longtime relationships like we do is a challenge.” "
5465,"Mr. Bledsoe, the former Patriots quarterback, said that even in the 18 years since he left the team, he still answers his mobile phone when the caller ID says “BLOCKED,” in case it’s Mr. Kraft, whom he calls “RKK.” "
5466,"“RKK has achieved success on a scale that few people ever achieved and kept his soul intact all the way through,” said Mr. Bledsoe, now a winemaker in Walla Walla, Wash. "
5467,"On a golf outing a few years ago, Mr. Bledsoe asked Mr. Kraft to tell him the one thing that matters most in building a successful organization. “‘There is no one thing,’” Mr. Bledsoe said he said. “‘There are no small details.’”"
5468,"Kenny Chesney, the country music star, said: “Robert has become in many ways a very strong mentor in my life. He believes that music and sports bring people together like nothing else.”"
5469,"Fifteen years ago, Mr. Chesney was dreaming of performing concerts in N.F.L. stadiums, which hold three to four times more fans than other large arenas. “Robert was the first N.F.L. owner to take a chance on a guy from East Tennessee,” Mr. Chesney said. "
5470,"He has played Gillette Stadium, home of the Patriots, in Foxborough, Mass., 19 times, more than any other musical artist. He has lunch with Mr. Kraft in his office each time he plays there."
5471,"“He set me on a path and helped me see a blueprint for how to change the scale of my business and the scope of my touring life,” Mr. Chesney said."
5472,"Mr. Kraft has made only a few public appearances since he was charged, including at parties hosted by fellow billionaires Ron Perelman and Barry Diller on Oscar weekend in Los Angeles."
5473,Mr. Rubin called Mr. Kraft and urged him to come to Philadelphia for Meek Mill’s first hometown solo concert since being released from prison last year. 
5474,"On March 15, Mr. Kraft hung out backstage while Meek Mill performed at the Met Philadelphia, a recently refurbished opera house. Mr. Kraft spent much of his time palling around with Meek Mill’s son and his son’s half brother."
5475,"Inevitably, the chatter between Mr. Kraft and the kids turned to football. So Mr. Kraft pulled out his phone and performed his favorite party trick: He FaceTimed Tom Brady and handed the phone to the boys. "
