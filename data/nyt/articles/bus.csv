0,"This summer, 100 city bus shelters will be transformed into platforms for an exhibition of work by a New York-based photographer, Elle Pérez."
1,"Pérez’s “from sun to sun,” which opens on Aug. 13, is the first exhibition in a collaboration between the nonprofit Public Art Fund and the advertising firm JCDecaux, which controls the ad space for about 3,400 bus shelters in New York City. The Public Art Fund will use this unconventional canvas to present two solo photography exhibitions annually; each exhibition will run for 14 weeks on 100 bus shelters."
2,"Mx. Pérez, 29, has been photographing New York, and especially the Bronx, for years. Past work by Mx. Pérez, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns “they” and “them,” has explored the punk community in the Bronx, underground night life culture, gender identity and Latinx communities. (Latinx is a gender neutral alternative to Latino or Latina.) For “from sun to sun,” Mx. Pérez will shoot new work all over the city — mostly focused on portraiture, but also on revisiting locations that have personal significance."
3,"“I grew up all over the city,” Mx. Pérez said, recalling long rides on the No. 6 train from Lower Manhattan to the Bronx, “certain spots in Harlem” and the Puerto Rican neighborhood in Bushwick where they now live. “I’ve been hanging out in bus stops for research,” they said."
4,"Katerina Stathopoulou, assistant curator at the Public Art Fund, said the broad reach of the exhibition was part of the goal. “We really want to reach all five boroughs,” she said."
5,"Ms. Stathopoulou said there are visual advantages to bus shelters-as-exhibition-spaces. “The work will be at street level, and at eye level,” she said. “When you look at something in a bus shelter, it’s often at life scale. Especially because in the first iterations of the series we’re primarily focusing on portraiture, to be able to look at a full-sized portrait eye-to-eye will be a really powerful experience.”"
6,"Mx. Pérez is also excited about the bus stop as a platform. “What’s really exciting to me about this project is the potential for having something on the street available and accessible to the people I grew up with and grew up around,” they said, noting that people might have extra time at bus stops. “When someone is sitting on a bench on the way to work, knowing the bus is coming, they may have to wait a long time,” Mx. Pérez said. “That may be time that they don’t actually spend with one image in museums and galleries, but while they’re waiting for the bus, they can.”"
7,STOCKHOLM — A bus exploded on Sunday morning in the heart of Stockholm after ramming into a barrier near the entrance of a tunnel in the Swedish capital.
8,"No passengers were on the bus, the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported, but the driver was taken to a hospital."
9,Emergency services received calls about the crash at Klara Tunnel in central Stockholm about 11:25 a.m. local time.
10,"A witness, Björn Wallentin, told Aftonbladet: “I heard a big explosion and then several smaller ones. It sounded like the scaffolding of a building falling down. I thought it was a terror attack.”"
11,"The cause of the accident was not immediately clear, but there were no indications of any link to terrorism. The Stockholm police told the newspaper that the bus ran on natural gas."
12,"After the crash, a plume of black smoke could be seen rising from the wreckage of the bus, which was consumed in flames that stretched above nearby buildings."
13,Another witness told Aftonbladet that a notice on the bus indicated that it had not been in service at the time.
14,"A third witness, Linus Axelsson, told Aftonbladet: “I had just parked my car and then heard this enormous explosion and the bus was in flames. It was scary.”"
15,"The driver was headed toward the northern part of the city, where his bus route was to start, Patrik Aberg, a spokesman for Keolis, the driver’s employer, told Aftonbladet."
16,The bus plowed into a barrier indicating the maximum height for vehicles traveling into the tunnel.
17,"“The bus drove into a beam hanging down from the tunnel entrance, and then the gas tank on the roof exploded,” Asa Skold, an operator with the emergency services, told the newspaper."
18,"Mr. Aberg said the bus had taken the wrong road. “You can’t drive that way because the buses are too tall,” he said."
19,"The fire had been extinguished by 12:04 p.m., according to a reporter for Aftonbladet, who was at the site of the crash."
20,"BEIJING — A long-distance coach bus taking tourists to Mao Zedong’s hometown in southern China erupted in flames, killing more than two dozen people onboard, according to official statements and news reports on Saturday."
21,"The diesel-powered bus was going from Henan Province in central China to Hunan Province in the south, and the fire broke out near Changde, a city in Hunan, on Friday night, officials said in an account released through state-run news media. The flames swiftly consumed the bus, and at least 26 of the 56 people aboard died, apparently trapped by the flames."
22,"Twenty-eight other people were injured and treated at three hospitals, including five who were said to be in serious condition."
23,"Other details of the accident were unclear, and investigators were trying to determine the fire’s cause. One Chinese news website, Shangyou News, cited a survivor who said that the bus had been taking tourists to Shaoshan, the small city where Mao Zedong was born, and that the fire broke out at the back of the bus, quickly overcoming passengers who did not have time to jump out."
24,"Two drivers survived and were detained while the police and safety officials investigated, the Changde government said."
25,"The accident was another jarring reminder of China’s shaky safety record, coming soon after a blast at a chemical plant in eastern China on Thursday that killed at least 64 people."
26,"Deaths on Chinese roads have risen with the rapid expansion of expressways and car ownership. The government has responded with tighter enforcement of speed limits, bans on drunken driving and stricter vehicle inspections."
27,"Even so, nearly 64,000 people died in transportation accidents in China in 2017, mostly on roads, according to government statistics. The real toll could be much higher: Past studies by safety experts have found that Chinese police statistics seriously underestimated road deaths, and the World Health Organization said in 2016 that about 260,000 people died on Chinese roads every year."
28,"Last year, there were five road accidents in China in which 10 or more people died, a decline from 2017, the Ministry of Public Security said in January."
29,"ROME — An Italian school bus driver took 51 seventh-graders hostage in northern Italy on Wednesday, pouring gasoline on the bus floor and later setting it afire."
30,"After someone on the bus made an emergency call, Italian carabinieri, or military police, reached the bus and safely rescued all the children, as well as two teachers and a janitor aboard, as it burst into flames."
31,"The driver, Osseynou Sy, an Italian of Senegalese origin, said that “he wanted to vindicate the dead of the Mediterranean,” according to Warrant Officer Marco Palmieri, a spokesman for Milan’s provincial branch of the carabinieri, Italy’s military police."
32,"Mr. Sy, he said, was referring to the large number of migrants who lose their lives each year during the perilous crossing of the Mediterranean from North Africa to Europe. The International Organization for Migration estimates that 282 people have drowned that way this year."
33,"A promise to curb migration from North Africa was a key factor in the election of Italy’s populist national government a year ago. Since then, the country — once a principal hub for migrants crossing the Mediterranean — has closed its ports to nongovernmental rescue vessels, to force other European countries to bear the burden of migrant landings."
34,"The Italian interior ministry announced on Sunday that migrant arrivals were down 94 percent this year, compared to 2018."
35,"Mr. Sy was arrested and treated at a Milanese hospital for burns on his hand. He was expected to be charged with kidnapping; arson; resisting arrest; intention to commit mass murder, because some students were still on the bus when it burst into flames; and terrorism as an aggravating factor, because he “created panic and threatened Italian institutions,” said Alberto Nobili, one of the Milanese prosecutors assigned to the case."
36,"Mr. Sy told prosecutors that he had acted alone and that he intended to send a message to African immigrants “not to come to Europe, but at the same time to punish Europe for what he saw as its unacceptable migration policies,” Mr. Nobili said at a news conference in Milan on Wednesday night."
37,"The students, who attend a middle school in Crema, a city some 50 kilometers, or almost 32 miles, east of Milan, were returning from gym class when Mr. Sy, a regular driver on the route, poured gasoline down the bus’s center aisle and announced that he was hijacking it and taking them to Linate Airport in Milan, investigators said."
38,"He then gave zip ties to the three adults, ordering them to tie each child’s wrists together as he drove. As they went back the rows of seats, the adults left the zip ties progressively looser, another prosecutor, Francesco Greco, said."
39,"Police in two carabinieri cars, tipped off by the phone call, forced the bus to stop on the Paullese provincial highway, but Mr. Sy rammed the cars again and again. While some officers tried to speak to him, others from a third military police car forced the bus’s side door open and broke the windows at the back to allow the passengers to flee."
40,"At that point, Mr. Sy apparently ignited a lighter he was holding, officers said, and the bus caught fire as the hostages were escaping."
41,"Italian television stations showed images of the charred skeleton of the bus, completely destroyed."
42,"Asked why the adults did not try to overpower the driver, Warrant Officer Palmieri said that he could not speak for them, but that “the threat was very real.”"
43,"Mr. Sy was born in Senegal in 1972, investigators said, and became an Italian citizen in 2004. His wife, from whom he is separated, is Italian, and the couple have two children."
44,"Mr. Sy had been working for the Autoguidovie bus company for 15 years, a company official, Corrado Bianchessi, said. He “never gave any particular signal” to indicate what he had planned, Mr. Bianchessi told the Italian channel of Sky News. “We are amazed,” he said."
45,"Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who is also Italy’s interior minister and a major opponent of illegal immigration, posted a tweet in which he said that Mr. Sy had a police record for driving under the influence and sexual assault."
46,“Why was someone with such record driving a bus for school children?” he asked. But prosecutors said the offenses were relatively minor.
47,"Mr. Nobili said Mr. Sy had made a video explaining his actions on Tuesday. “He wanted the world to speak of this event,” he said, adding that prosecutors had no sense the episode was tied to “radicalized terrorism.”"
48,"He said Mr. Sy told investigators he wanted to board a plane to Senegal from Linate Airport, but it was unclear how he could do that or what he intended to do with the students, who were around 12 years old."
49,"Mr. Sy told prosecutors he never wanted to hurt anyone, but Mr. Greco wasn’t buying it. “If we’re not crying over the death” of dozens of schoolchildren, he said, “it is thanks to the courage and rapid response of the carabinieri.”"
50,"“It could have been a massacre,” he told the Ansa news agency."
51,"Serious train and bus accidents are rare. But when they happen, passengers and their bags have almost none of the protections considered standard on planes and cars."
52,"The National Transportation Safety Board has long recommended a variety of measures to improve passenger safety, including installing lap-shoulder seatbelts, requiring riders to buckle up and improving window safety and overhead baggage restraints."
53,"“Current safety standards for locomotive cabs and rail passenger cars are inadequate,” the N.T.S.B. said in February when it unveiled its “most wanted” list of safety improvements for trains. “Protecting passengers and crews from injury requires keeping rail car windows intact and maintaining their structural integrity during an accident, and includes occupant restraint systems, such as seatbelts, to mitigate the severity of passenger injuries.”"
54,"But regulators of Amtrak, Greyhound and a host of national and regional transportation carriers have generally not adopted the recommendations."
55,"In 2017, 44 people died in bus crashes, according to the safety board. The Federal Railroad Administration’s office of safety analysis said 21 passengers and employees were killed in Amtrak and commuter train accidents in 2017 and 2018. While the number of bus and rail fatalities is relatively small, thousands of people were injured in accidents in recent years on Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and other commuter trains, as well as on Greyhound and other interstate bus companies, according to federal regulators."
56,"“Those 44 people could have been saved,” said T. Bella Dinh-Zarr, a recently retired member of the safety board who helped lead major bus and train crash investigations. “In some cases, just simply wearing their seatbelt would have saved them from being severely injured and then dying from those injuries, or being ejected and killed, or suffering traumatic brain injury.“"
57,"The safety board’s call for regulators to evaluate installing seatbelts in rail cars and “securing potential projectiles” resonates in the case of Rudolf Wetzel. He dozed off in his seat on an Amtrak train just outside Tacoma, Wash., as the train made its first run on a new service route south on Dec. 18, 2017."
58,"“I woke up when all hell broke loose,” he said. The train had derailed on an overpass, sending the locomotive, the power car and two rail cars tumbling onto Interstate 5. “I didn’t know what was going on.” Thrown from his seat and seriously injured, he lay underneath the train, where he could see wheels turning and hear the engine roaring."
59,"The N.T.S.B.’s preliminary investigation determined that excessive speed caused the train to derail as it rounded a curve at 78 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone. Three passengers were killed, and 62 passengers, crew members and motorists were injured. Mr. Wetzel, 82, was hospitalized for three days with a broken back as well as internal and cognitive injuries."
60,"On its most wanted list, the N.T.S.B. said “compartmentalization” — a design in which closely spaced, well-padded and high-backed train seats absorb energy during accidents — remains a problem because it “may not protect passengers during derailments and overturns.”"
61,"In a derailment, passengers often collide with one another. In these instances, Ms. Dinh-Zarr said, Amtrak’s seats don’t offer much protection from other passengers or from flying luggage. The overhead baggage racks on most Amtrak trains have only a shallow edge and railing. There are no other restraints or compartments that close with a door and a latch akin to the overhead storage in commercial airplanes, except on Acela Express, according to Amtrak."
62,"James Vucinovich, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Wetzel and others in lawsuits against Amtrak, said the interior of Amtrak train cabins leaves people vulnerable when accidents occur. “You’re going to be like a Ping-Pong ball inside of a can.”"
63,"In January last year, Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee was among the dozens of Republican lawmakers traveling to a retreat in Virginia on a chartered Amtrak train when it struck a garbage truck. Mr. Roe, a physician, assessed injuries inside and outside the train with a group of other doctors."
64,"Does he support putting seatbelts on Amtrak? “If you wanted to move safety to another level, the answer would be yes,” Mr. Roe said."
65,"He added that he is a mountaineer and not risk averse. “But I always harness up, and I’m always on the rope,” he said. “So if I’m sitting on an Amtrak and there’s a safety belt there, I’m going to put it on.”"
66,"If trains have an Achilles’ heel, it is their windows. The safety board issued a recommendation 47 years ago about “the problem of ejection of passengers through large side windows.” Ms. Dinh-Zarr said Amtrak’s windows, which are secured by rubber grommets, remain a problem because they can pop out in a crash or derailment. She was on the scene in Philadelphia in May 2015, she said, when eight passengers were killed and 185 were taken to hospitals after a locomotive and seven passenger cars derailed."
67,"“The N.T.S.B. found that if the passenger car windows had remained intact and secured in the cars, some passengers would not have been ejected and would likely have survived the accident,” the board’s report on the accident said. “Further, the passengers were not protected from serious injuries resulting from being thrown from their seats when the cars overturned.”"
68,"Kimberly Woods, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said in an email: “Amtrak will continue to work with industry experts to explore the enhancement of occupant protection systems on our trains.” Amtrak’s windows, she said, “comply with federal requirements for impact resistance and emergency release.”"
69,"When asked why Amtrak had not installed seatbelts, she said international research on the matter has shown “inconclusive results regarding any improvements to safety.”"
70,"In a 2017 letter, the Federal Railroad Administration responded to the safety board’s seatbelt recommendation: “Current research indicates that unlike in the automobile and air transportation modes, adding seatbelts in passenger rail cars is not the most effective way to increase safety.”"
71,"Warren Flatau, a spokesman for the agency, added that the railroad administration’s own “extensive research” on the subject “has revealed that the use of seatbelts could actually increase the risk and severity of injuries.” He said the agency’s focus on “occupant protection and accident survivability” has led to “redesigned tables and seats that contain and cushion passengers,” as well as “enhanced emergency egress features” including windows, lighting and “structural crashworthiness.”"
72,"Commercial buses manufactured after 2016 are required to have seatbelts. But after a Greyhound accident in San Jose, Calif., in 2016 in which two passengers were thrown from the bus and killed, State Senator Jerry Hill looked into why everyone on board wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He found that travelers did not have to wear the belts."
73,"“What’s the point of a seatbelt if passengers and drivers aren’t required to wear them?” he asked. So Mr. Hill introduced legislation, which took effect last summer, making California the first state with a law requiring bus passengers to wear seatbelts in any bus that has them and requiring operators to inform passengers before departure that they must buckle up or face a fine."
74,"The N.T.S.B. supported California’s law. And on its most-wanted list, it recommends that every state enact a law that requires all vehicle occupants to use seatbelts and allow law enforcement officers to give tickets to anyone who has not buckled up. The agency said it was concerned about “the limited availability and use of seatbelts in commercial vehicles” including motor coaches, school buses and medium-size buses."
75,"In August, a truck driver on Interstate 40 near Thoreau, N.M., lost control of the vehicle and jackknifed into oncoming traffic, striking a Greyhound bus. Seven passengers died and 39 were injured in the crash."
76,"Reid Valentine, a passenger on the bus, said he was not wearing his seatbelt. He said he was thrown into the seat in front of him so hard that it broke. “Glass shattered, and I watched the front of the bus just basically crumple all the way up to the front axle.”"
77,"Mr. Valentine said passengers did not receive a safety briefing, so opening emergency windows proved difficult. “We were fighting to keep them open so that we could get out of the bus and start getting people out,” he recalled. The heavy bus windows don’t just pop off, he said. “You have to hold them up like on camper awnings.”"
78,"Crystal Booker, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said in an email: “We are constantly reviewing safety features on our buses to look for ways to improve passengers’ safety.” She added that all buses “undergo thorough inspections” and that “all Greyhound drivers nationwide are trained on safety announcements,” including evacuation procedures."
79,"She said the back of Greyhound’s seats help to “cushion passengers and mitigate injury,” even for passengers who don’t wear a seatbelt."
80,"When asked why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not issued federal regulations to improve bus emergency exit windows, Kathryn Henry, a spokeswoman, said the agency was still analyzing emergency evacuation research it completed in 2011 “to inform possible means of improving the emergency exits.”"
81,"She added, “The agency believes that bus window exits must not only enable adequate evacuation in emergencies, but also should not pop out too readily in a crash.”"
82,"Crash survivors, meanwhile, often have to contend with a range of lingering physical and psychological effects. After physical therapy, Mr. Wetzel — who survived being thrown from an Amtrak train — said he was functioning at just 60 percent of his abilities."
83,And Mr. Valentine said he avoided all bus travel.
84,"“I’m still at the point where I barely sleep at night,” he said. “It’s something I’ve constantly got to think of and it’s always on my mind.”"

86,"One day in seventh grade, Rasheda Herndon walked up to Clyde Edwards, a tall, skinny, supernice guy in her class, and told him, “You’re going to be my boyfriend.”"
87,"Mr. Edwards was down with that. But Ms. Herndon wasn’t sure she was allowed to date, so she told him that there would be no “funny business” and he was relegated to holding her hand on or around school property."
88,They lost contact after junior high.
89,"Decades later, Ms. Herndon and Mr. Edwards reconnected on Facebook. They exchanged messages about running — Ms. Herndon is an avid marathoner — and then they met for dinner when Ms. Herndon was in Washington, D.C."
90,"“Bing, that was it,” Ms. Herndon said. “It just took off from there — game on.”"
91,"But Ms. Herndon was living and working in New York City, and Mr. Edwards had roots in the capital. They knew it would take more than texting each other kissy-face and heart-eye emojis to bring them together."
92,"Then a white-and-green, 56-seat Cupid rolled into their lives: A charter bus that Ms. Herndon found both aesthetically pleasing and affordable. Now she can visit her “little honey bunny” — her words — nearly every weekend for rarely more than $25 each way (prices can start at $5) — without having to endure what she has experienced, she said, on other bus lines: Overcrowding, crumpled fast-food wrappers on seats, or neglected, smelly bathrooms."
93,"Ms. Herndon and Mr. Edwards, who are both 43, aren’t alone. Many long-distance couples are relying on affordable, tech-oriented bus services to see each other regularly, turning the Jersey Turnpike into a freeway of love."
94,"“We noticed via our internal technology that a lot of riders take the first bus after work on Friday, and then take the last bus home Sunday evening,” said Axel Hellman, a co-founder of OurBus, the company favored by Ms. Herndon (and others in this article) for its cleanliness, perks and unique routes. “And then we noticed that they do this every single weekend.”"
95,"When Grace Gardner met Autumn Trowbridge on a Tinder date in Washington, she was immediately smitten with the brunette she describes as “the most special person I’ve ever met.” But when it came time for college, Ms. Gardner, 22, enrolled at Baruch, in New York City. Ms. Trowbridge, meanwhile, remained in Washington, at George Washington University. They are a four-hour bus ride apart."
96,"Ms. Gardner uses her dog-walking money to buy tickets. In order to maximize her time with Ms. Trowbridge, she often takes a Thursday night bus. The couple might spend the weekend doing homework side by side, or visiting museums like the National Portrait Gallery."
97,"“Because we’re both in college, we’re trying to meet different people — this arrangement gives us independence,” Ms. Gardner said. “If we were in the same city, it might be more difficult — when you’re really, really in love with someone, you want to spend all of your time with them, and that prevents you from developing your own identity.”"
98,"If Ms. Gardner were instead to take Amtrak, she might pay anywhere from $49 to $96 for a one-way ticket, depending how far in advance she booked."
99,"OurBus is popular with undergrads and graduate students. When Mr. Hellman founded the company with Narinder Singh in 2016, they crowd-sourced routes in suburban areas that had been previously underserved by bus travel, like Columbia, Md. They also began regular service to academic hubs like Ithaca, N.Y., and State College, Pa., knowing that their fare structure, modern technology and perks like free bottled water would give their product an edge in student-heavy communities."
100,"If it weren’t for a New York City-Syracuse route, Vinayak Prabhu, a 26-year-old quantitative finance major at Rutgers, might not see his girlfriend, the “really pretty” graduate student who first caught his attention at a Walmart checkout line in New Jersey."
101,"“I believe in face-to-face interactions,” said Mr. Prabhu, who lives in Newark. “While we do live in the age of FaceTime, there’s nothing better than being in close personal touch.”"
102,"Emily Shea also found love in a big-box store when Peter Hayes, 25, one of her roommate’s friends, who was visiting from West Chester, Pa., joined them on a shopping spree in Red Hook, Brooklyn, then gamely helped lug their purchases up to their new fourth-floor walk-up apartment in SoHo."
103,"“I knew he was cool because he could deal with Ikea,” said Ms. Shea, 24, who works at an ad agency in New York. Now Ms. Shea and Mr. Hayes use the bus three weekends a month to see each other."
104,"When OurBus introduced its West Chester-New York route in December 2017, it was as if Eros himself had heard Elizabeth Stackowitz’s pleas."
105,"The 23-year-old Long Islander was sick of being “disgusted and dirty and cranky and hangry” on another bus line. She cited one incident where a man seated directly in front of her clipped his fingernails during the trip. To make matters worse, getting from New York City to Philadelphia was only half the battle. Her boyfriend, Thomas Griffin, 23, still had to pick her up and drive her and her belongings to his home in West Chester, an additional hour of traveling. This turned what should have been a joyous Friday-night reunion into an arduous journey."
106,"Without a direct bus route, Ms. Stackowitz said, “I don’t know if we would have lasted, actually. If you can’t see each other, it’s hard to have a relationship over the phone. And with the train, I don’t know if I could have afforded that twice a month.”"
107,"Similarly, a nonstop route from Lancaster, Pa., to New York made it possible for Jelena Lojpur, 23, to simultaneously interview for jobs and visit her boyfriend, Christopher Harmantzis, 26, after he moved to Brooklyn to teach eighth-grade history at a Crown Heights charter school. She took an OurBus a few times a week for six weeks — a frequency that would have made train tickets and highway tolls financially prohibitive — until she landed a job here as a paralegal."
108,The couple now lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant and regularly takes the bus — together — to visit family.
109,"RIO DE JANEIRO — A powerful summer storm swept through Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday night, leaving at least six people dead, as streets turned into rivers and mudslides destroyed homes and buried a bus, where two of the dead were found."
110,"Residents woke up to a city in disarray, with cars and motorcycles destroyed after floating down flooded roads and trees and light poles down everywhere, knocked over by winds that hit 70 miles per hour."
111,"Hotels and restaurants were inundated with water, and whole neighborhoods were left without electricity or working phone lines."
112,"“This surprised even meteorologists,” Mayor Marcelo Crivella told TV Globo in the early morning, near the area where a bus had been buried. “In two hours it rained what was expected for the whole month.”"
113,"While this was an unusually powerful storm, with windss almost as strong as a hurricane, the damage and death that followed were not rare for Rio de Janeiro and the surrounding state with the same name."
114,"In November, mudslides in the neighboring city of Niterói killed 14 people. In 2010, heavy rains left over 50 people dead in the beach town of Angra dos Reis."
115,"And in 2011, in what became one of Brazil’s most gruesome recent disasters, a powerful storm caused floods and landslides in cities in the hilly areas across the state of Rio, killing over 900 people."
116,"With precariously built homes and makeshift infrastructure, the city of Rio de Janeiro’s hillside poor neighborhoods, or favelas, are commonly the hardest hit during the summer’s heavy rain season. Residents say the government can do more to both flood-proof buildings here and warn people ahead of time."
117,"Statistics collected by the Rio de Janeiro Budget People’s Forum, which monitors the local budget, showed that the city cut almost 80 percent of its spending on flood control in the last four years."
118,"“This reduction shows authorities don’t prepare for these heavy rains,” said Luiz Mario Behnken, an economist with the forum. “Every year they are surprised by these rains.”"
119,"Rita de Cássia Smith, a community leader in Rocinha, one of the city’s largest favelas, pointed to faulty sewage and drainage systems, and the lack of trash collection, as some of the causes of the destruction."
120,"“In Rio de Janeiro, we have tragedies and deaths every year,” Ms. Smith said. “This happens because all the building work is poorly done, so when the rain comes it knocks it all down.”"
121,"As she watched her street become a river rapid, Ms. Smith said she spent the night scared to death. Just down the road, dozens of residents spent the day trying to use ropes to lift more than 10 motorcycles that had fallen down a hillside."
122,"Mauricio Ehrlich, an engineer and geotechnician at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, said there had been investments in the city’s drainage system in recent decades, but not enough."
123,"“The ideal thing would be to have urban planning,” Professor Ehrlich said. “The government fails when it lets the city grow in inadequate areas.”"
124,"Nearby, Maria Leni Martins tried to recover whatever was left of her home, after it had flooded the night before. As the water hit her waist, she had to scream for neighbors to save her 74-year-old mother, who has difficulty walking."
125,She thought they were going to drown.
126,"“The government needs to do something,” she said, as she tried to clean off the mud from her floors. “This isn’t the first time my house floods.”"
127,"OTTAWA — An afternoon commute in Canada’s capital turned to horror after a double-decker city bus became impaled on a passenger shelter, leaving three people dead and 25 injured, officials said."
128,"Jim Watson, the mayor of Ottawa, said that one victim was standing on the platform at the time of the collision, and the other two were aboard the bus."
129,"“Our hearts and condolences go out to all those who were injured,” Mr. Watson said at a news conference. “Our focus now must be to provide care and sympathy for those affected by the accident.”"
130,"Of the injured, 14 arrived at hospitals in critical condition."
131,It was the second deadly accident involving a double-decker bus in the city in less than six years.
132,"The bus, operated by the city’s transit system, OC Transpo, was traveling along a below-grade road reserved for buses when it lost control entering a station west of the city’s downtown at about 3:50 p.m., said Chief Charles Bordeleau of the Ottawa Police Service."
133,"It then mounted a passenger platform and crashed into a shelter. The steel and glass of the shelter’s overhang tore off the front of the bus, and sliced through a large section of its upper deck."
134,"Chief Bordeleau said that most of the injured people were in that part of the bus, and that several people on the platform also required treatment."
135,Why the bus lost control was not clear. It was a bitterly cold afternoon: Officials had delivered a frostbite warning and black ice had developed on several roads throughout the city.
136,"“There’s no question that the weather adds to the complexity of the scene,” Chief Bordeleau said, although he declined to answer questions about the possible causes or the condition of the transit road’s service."
137,"He said that “something led us to having arrested” the bus driver, but he declined to offer any details. She was being questioned on Friday night."
138,"The bus, whose route was to take it from downtown to the suburbs, was not scheduled to stop at the station where the collision occurred, and merely meant to pass through it."
139,"Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario, wrote on Twitter that he was “devastated to hear about those who lost their lives and were injured following the horrific bus collision.”"
140,"In 2013, another OC Transpo double-decker bus collided with an intercity passenger train, leaving six dead and 35 people injured."
141,"An investigation by federal authorities found that the driver may have been distracted by a video screen that allowed him to monitor passengers on the upper level of the bus. It also called for the addition of bumpers to the buses, which are made in Britain."
142,"John Manconi, the general manager of OC Transpo, said buses built since that report have included bumpers, but he did know whether the bus in Friday’s collision was among them."
143,"Iran said Tuesday that at least three Pakistani citizens were among the assailants responsible for killing 27 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps on a bus last week, including the driver of the explosives-laden car that rammed the vehicle."
144,"The Feb. 13 bombing in a restive southeast region along the Pakistan border was one of the deadliest attacks in years to strike Iran. At least 13 people were wounded and the bus was destroyed, according to Iranian news websites."
145,"Iran, which is predominantly Shiite Muslim, has often criticized Pakistan for harboring Sunni Muslim militants from the province, Sistan and Baluchistan, a haven for separatist groups and drug traffickers that have orchestrated attacks in recent years against Iranian security forces. But it is unusual for Iran to accuse Pakistani citizens."
146,"The accusation, reported by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, was made by a commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Brig. Gen. Mohammad Pakpur, at a ceremony held Tuesday to honor victims of the attack."
147,"Tasnim quoted General Pakpur as saying that two members of the terrorist team and the suicide bomber were from Pakistan, and that three others were from Sistan and Baluchistan."
148,"On Monday, the Revolutionary Guards announced three arrests in the attack, but did not specify the identities of the suspects."
149,"Within hours of the attack, a militant Sunni extremist group, Jaish al-Adl, which has operated in southeast Iran for years and has links to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility."
150,"Iranian officials immediately accused the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia of complicity in the attack. They suggested it was more than coincidental that it had been carried out as representatives of all three nations were meeting in Warsaw at a conference aimed in part at isolating Iran."
151,But the Iranians also made clear after the attack that they suspected militants from the Sistan and Baluchistan region.
152,"Tasnim said Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, spoke by telephone on Sunday with his Pakistani counterpart, Shah Mahmood Qureshi. Mr. Qureshi said Pakistan was “ready for any kind of cooperation with Iran to probe into the terrorist attack,” the news agency reported."
153,"A suspect in the deadly shooting of an off-duty police officer in Chicago over the weekend was targeting the “first Hispanic man he saw” after a dispute with a group of Latino men, the city’s police superintendent said."
154,"The officer, John Rivera, 23, was shot in a parked car early Saturday along with a friend, who was hospitalized and is now in stable condition, according to Melissa Staples, the Chicago Police Department’s chief of detectives."
155,"Surveillance camera video showed that one of the two men who have been charged in the attack, Menelik Jackson, 24, encountered the Latino men on a party bus in front of a McDonald’s in the River North neighborhood, Chief Staples said at a news conference on Monday. Mr. Jackson, who is black, was punched in the face by one of the men and ran away, the chief said."
156,"Shortly after, Mr. Jackson returned but the party bus had left the area, Chief Staples said. Mr. Jackson then got in his white Ford pickup truck and searched the area for the bus but did not find it, she said."
157,"Chief Staples said that an hour after the confrontation in front of the McDonald’s, Mr. Jackson approached a car with two friends, Jovan Battle, 32, and another man the police are still searching for. She said Mr. Jackson then shot at the car with a .40-caliber handgun, killing Officer Rivera and wounding his friend."
158,"“It appears that he was just looking for a Hispanic person,” Eddie Johnson, the Chicago police superintendent, said at the news conference. “He was searching around for the party bus, the party bus had left the area, so I guess he settled for the first Hispanic he saw,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that Mr. Jackson had confessed."
159,Mr. Jackson and Mr. Battle have each been charged with one count of first-degree murder and three counts of attempted murder. They are being held without bail.
160,Mr. Johnson also said that the authorities “have been pursuing possible hate crime charges since the beginning.”
161,"Chris Anderson, a public defender who is representing Mr. Battle, said that his client did not “share the intent of the shooter based on what the state proffered.” He added that Mr. Battle “suffers from bipolar disorder and depression, receives S.S.I. and disability, was denied phone calls, and has a severe, untreated, old and deep cut to his finger that needs medical attention.”"
162,"Mr. Battle has been ordered to the jail hospital for treatment, Mr. Anderson said."
163,A lawyer for Mr. Jackson did not immediately respond to calls and emails.
164,"Officer Rivera’s second anniversary with the Chicago police had been approaching in May, the department said."
165,"“He was the kind of officer that we want in Chicago,” Mr. Johnson said, adding that Officer Rivera was a “hard worker, he loved going out on patrol and solving problems.”"
166,"As they begin their search for a nominee, most Democrats — more than half, according to a February poll from Monmouth University — prize electability above all else. They want a sure thing, someone who will beat President Trump."
167,But beating Trump isn’t the same as beating Trumpism. Unseating the president won’t automatically undermine the white resentment and racial chauvinism that drive his movement. That will depend on the nature of the campaign against him and whether it challenges the assumptions of his ideology or affirms them in the name of electoral pragmatism.
168,"The possibility of defeating Trump without defeating Trumpism looms over Joe Biden’s possible run for the 2020 Democratic nomination. The former vice president’s not-yet-candidacy centers on his appeal to the white, blue-collar workers who rejected Hillary Clinton in favor of Donald Trump. He believes he could have won them in 2016, and he thinks he can win them now. This isn’t just about Biden’s working-class affect. As a senator from Delaware, Biden understood himself as a staunch defender of Middle American interests."
169,"But those interests were racialized, which is how a younger Biden could at once be a committed liberal and an ardent opponent of busing to desegregate his state’s public schools. As an article in The Washington Post last week demonstrated, Biden was at the forefront of opposition to busing in Delaware. The rhetoric he deployed in defense of his position channeled the visceral hostility of suburban (and urban) whites whose children were bused or whose schools took in bused children."
170,"“I do not buy the concept, popular in the ’60s, which said, ‘We have suppressed the black man for 300 years and the white man is now far ahead in the race for everything our society offers. In order to even the score, we must now give the black man a head start, or even hold the white man back, to even the race,’” Biden told a Delaware-based weekly newspaper in 1975. “I don’t buy that.”"
171,"Biden made his argument using language that is still common to opponents of efforts to rectify racial inequality: “I don’t feel responsible for the sins of my father and grandfather. I feel responsible for what the situation is today, for the sins of my own generation. And I’ll be damned if I feel responsible to pay for what happened 300 years ago.”"
172,"Busing did its job — integrating schools and improving outcomes for black students — but many whites viewed it as an encroachment on the privileges afforded them in a racially stratified society, what W.E.B. Du Bois called a “psychological wage” given as compensation for racial solidarity. These Americans thought they could keep black children out of their schools and neighborhoods. Busing meant they couldn’t, and they were angry."
173,"That’s the reason a segregationist like the former North Carolina senator Jesse Helms had kind words for Biden’s position, welcoming him “to the ranks of the enlightened.” Biden made a straightforward defense of white racial advantage aimed at those communities that viewed integration with suspicion and hostility. He articulated their anger. And while Biden tried to distance himself from outright demagogues like George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama and presidential candidate, his rhetoric was on the same wavelength."
174,"“The real problem with busing,” he said, was that “you take people who aren’t racist, people who are good citizens, who believe in equal education and opportunity, and you stunt their children’s intellectual growth by busing them to an inferior school … and you’re going to fill them with hatred.”"
175,"Politically, Biden’s position made sense. Most white voters in Delaware opposed busing. And just three years earlier, in 1972, the Democratic presidential nominee, George McGovern, had prompted a revolt among working- and middle-class whites with his defense of the policy. McGovern tried to reframe the issue, asking white voters if “stopping the buses is really going to give them all the other things they want: jobs, homes, healthy families, better schools, safe communities — futures to look forward to with pride.” It didn’t work."
176,"“Support for it was a difficult case to make to white working people who felt that integration was taking place on their backs,” the historian Jefferson Cowie explains in “Stayin’ Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class.” “Immediate defense of white identity, home, and school readily trumped the abstract hope of a better world someday.”"
177,"Biden’s sensitivity to the fears and anxieties of his white constituents helps explain his positions on drugs and crime in the 1980s and 1990s. He was an ardent drug warrior and “tough on crime” Democrat who hoped to outflank the Republican Party on those issues, winning ground from worried white voters. “One of my objectives, quite frankly, is to lock Willie Horton up in jail,” he said in 1990 when he was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee."
178,"That line, which refers to a notorious political ad from the 1988 presidential election, gets to the heart of Biden’s appeal in that era. He was working for voters who viewed cities and their denizens as carriers of crime and disorder who should be controlled if they couldn’t be isolated. His central work on the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, like President Bill Clinton’s later support for welfare reform, was part of a larger effort to position the Democratic Party as both a defender of white middle-class interests and as a disciplinarian — in clamping down on assumed black pathologies of criminality, promiscuity and dependency. Biden himself was trying to take this path in the 1988 election, before he derailed his campaign by plagiarizing a British Labor Party leader."
179,"No one is their past, however, and it’s possible Biden has morally and politically redeemed himself through his association with Barack Obama’s historic presidency. And Biden has been supportive of civil rights laws as well as a strong ally to groups like the N.A.A.C.P. At the same time, however, the former vice president has only tentatively addressed his intimate role in building the modern incarceration state, and he still defends his position on busing."
180,"The questions, then, are simple: Are Biden’s politics still racialized? Is his blue-collar and Middle American appeal still an implicit affirmation of white racial privilege?"
181,"If it is, then a Biden candidacy may be one where he tries to capture the supposed center of American politics by presenting himself as the real embodiment of working-class white identity against Trump’s inauthentic embrace of the blue-collar worldview."
182,"Consider the message this would send. For decades Biden gave liberal cover to white backlash. He wasn’t an incidental opponent of busing; he was a leader who helped derail integration. He didn’t just vote for punitive legislation on crime and drugs; he wrote it. His political persona is still informed by that past, even if he were to repudiate those positions now. Biden could lead Democrats to victory over Trump, but his political style might affirm the assumptions behind Trumpism. The outward signs of our political dysfunction would be gone, but the disease would still remain."

185,"OTTAWA — A truck driver whose inattention led to the deaths of 16 people aboard a youth hockey team bus in Saskatchewan last year, a collision that shook Canada, was sentenced to eight years in prison on Friday."
186,"The defendant, Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, had driven a tractor-trailer laden with peat moss at about 60 miles an hour past five signs warning him to stop before the truck collided with a bus carrying the team, the Humboldt Broncos. Thirteen other people were injured last April in the crash, which occurred with such force that the bus flipped on its side and the two vehicles slid well off the highway before coming to a stop in a pile of rubble."
187,"Many of the victims were young players who had come from across Western Canada to live with families in Humboldt, a farm town of about 6,000. They had joined the Broncos with hopes of either advancing to professional careers or getting college scholarships."
188,"Canadians mourned the loss of so many young lives, which prompted an outpouring of donations from across the country for the survivors and families of the dead. Informal memorials, like symbolic hockey sticks left in front of homes, quickly appeared."
189,Mr. Sidhu had earlier pleaded guilty to 29 counts of dangerous driving.
190,"“Families have been torn apart because of the loss,” Judge Inez Cardinal said at the hearing in Melfort, Saskatchewan, after reviewing more than 100 statements from victims. “Somehow we must stop this carnage on our highways.”"
191,"Mr. Sidhu, who worked for a tiny trucking company in Alberta, was on his first solo trip about two weeks after qualifying as a truck driver."
192,"There was no sign that he was impaired by drugs or alcohol on the night of crash, nor was he using his phone as he sped past the corner’s oversize stop sign and its flashing warning light. Nothing on the corner obstructed his view of the approaching bus, nor did he notice that an oncoming car had stopped for it."
193,The judge said that Mr. Sidhu appeared to have been distracted by a flapping tarp on one of the trailers.
194,"“This was not a momentary loss of attention,” Judge Cardinal said. “He had ample time to stop his unit.”"
195,"She added, “Seconds matter, attention to the road matters.”"
196,"At an earlier hearing, prosecutors said that investigators had concluded that it was impossible for the driver of the team bus, who was among the victims, to have avoided slamming into Mr. Sidhu’s truck."
197,"The sentence was less than the 10 years that prosecutors had sought, but longer than most dangerous-driving sentences in Canada. Mr. Sidhu, who is 30 and lives in Calgary, Alberta, will probably be deported to India after his release from prison."
198,"“The sentence is subject to varying opinions, but what is important is that Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty, has shown remorse and has remained accountable for his careless actions,” Jamie Brockman, the president of the Broncos, said in a statement."
199,"Since the collision, Saskatchewan and Alberta have introduced mandatory and more rigorous classroom and on-road training for heavy-truck drivers. They have also beefed up licensing tests."
200,"For a seasoned executive like Maximilian Büsser, you would not expect that he would be fazed by the development of a new watch. After all, he is a former managing director of Harry Winston Rare Timepieces and for the past 14 years he has been shaping his company, MB&F, into a leading light of the independent watchmaking world."
201,So how hard could it be to create the house’s first watch for women?
202,"“It was horrendously difficult,” Mr. Büsser said in an interview during a visit to London last month. “First of all, I have no idea what a woman wants.”"
203,"The timepiece was also a very personal project, being a homage to his mother, Dinoo, who died last year; his wife, Tiffany; and two daughters, now 6 and 2. He said he wanted the watch to reflect what he loved most about his mother and his wife: “Full of crazy energy but at the same time super elegant.”"
204,"The result, after more than three years’ work, was the Legacy Machine FlyingT, which embodies the avant-garde, mechanical sculpture look for which MB&F is known. It was introduced online earlier this month and is being presented at the Baselworld fair this week."
205,"The automatic watch features an unusually high sapphire dome that houses a vertically stacked movement topped with a flying tourbillon. Resting at the 7 o’clock position is a small dial displaying the hour and minutes, and which is inclined at 50 degrees, so it can be read only by the wearer (“The time is a gift, only for her,” Mr. Büsser said). It has a 100-hour power reserve, and the underside features an 18-karat gold rotor in a sculpted sun motif."
206,"As usual, the watch is a limited edition: MB&F will make only 35 pieces a year."
207,"Mr. Büsser said his aim was to remove all the bridges and keep only the “elegant, mobile parts” — the wheels and escapement — to create a movement that was vertical, like a tower. Or a pillar, he said, like the women in his life. “I like that allegory,” he added. “Now, is it feminine? I have no idea.”"
208,"What is arguably feminine, however, is the use of diamonds. There are three models, all of which have a diamond-encrusted case and a small diamond topping the flying tourbillon. The original version comes with a stark black lacquer dial plate ($115,000), while a pavé version features 485 stones totaling 2.8 carats on the dial plate ($145,000). And a baguette-cut diamond design ($315,000) has a dial plate with 294 stones totaling 11 carats."
209,"The diamonds were intended to make the FlyingT a timepiece dedicated to women. But, Mr. Büsser said, there was what he called an “enormous debate” within the company about using stones — partly because his wife does not wear diamonds."
210,And her reaction? “She hasn’t seen it yet!” he said.
211,"“Maybe my wife will go, ‘That’s naff,’” he added, deadpan. “It’s been very complicated emotionally to come out with this piece.”"
212,"DIAVATA, Greece — Greek police fired teargas on Saturday as angry migrants hoping to travel to northern Europe hurled stones and bottles after being barred from reaching a nearby border crossing, witnesses said."
213,"Spurred by a false rumor about border openings that spread on social media, hundreds of migrants and refugees arrived and pitched tents on Thursday in a field next to the Diavata migrant camp near Greece's border with North Macedonia."
214,"There were dozens of tents in the field on Saturday and riot police formed a cordon to block an access route, parking 20 buses to stop the migrants from leaving the field. Authorities also sent buses to take people back to housing settlements."
215,"At about midday, riot police fired teargas at dozens of people -- some carrying children -- who hurled stones and bottles as they tried to break through the police cordon and reach the main road leading to the border. "
216,"""We don't want to fight with the Greek police,"" said 36-year old Yaser, a Syrian refugee, sitting on a blanket with his baby son in his arms. ""We want to go to Europe, we don't want to stay in Greece,"" he told Reuters through an interpreter."
217,"His 26-year old wife Fatemeh, who was carrying their six-month old baby, said the family was determined to stay at the makeshift camp."
218,"""We will stay here until the borders open, we don't have any other choice,"" she said, standing close to where the clashes took place."
219,'FEEDING THEM LIES'
220,The scuffles lasted for several hours and thick plumes of smoke rose over the fields as police fired flares to disperse the crowds and angry migrants started small fires.
221,Most people refused to leave the site despite calls by ministers to return to accommodation centres and warnings that onward travel would be impossible. A few were persuaded to board the buses and officials said they hoped everyone would leave voluntarily by Sunday. 
222,Migration Ministry coordinator for northern Greece Nikos Ragkos said two buses for migrants had already left Diavata.
223,They had traveled to the area due to false reports of plans for an organized movement to cross Greece's border with Albania in early April. The rumors quickly went viral on social media. 
224,"In neighboring Turkey, nearly 1,200 migrants heading toward the border with Greece following false rumors that Ankara had opened its frontier were detained on Friday, Turkish media said. "
225,"Jana Frey, country director for the International Rescue Committee Greece, said the unrest highlighted ""the amount of false information being presented to asylum seekers and refugees."""
226,"""IRC staff have received reports of refugees who are being lured to the border by smugglers, who are feeding them lies about the border to Europe opening up,"" she said."
227,"Tens of thousands of refugees and migrants, mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, are stuck in Greece from when Balkan countries shut their borders in 2016, closing the main passage towards northern Europe."
228,"In 2016, thousands of people had camped for months in another field in Idomeni, on the border with Macedonia. Greek authorities eventually cleared that makeshift camp out."

230,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
231,"When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly called off the L train shutdown, he upended years of careful planning to ensure that 275,000 displaced riders were not left stranded in an L-pocalypse."
232,"Now, even as officials forge ahead with a widely debated alternate plan, many transit advocates are calling for those contingency measures — more bus and ferry service, new bike lanes, traffic restrictions — to be put in place even with no shutdown. The planned changes, they say, are still needed in a growing city facing critical transportation challenges from congestion to a broken subway system."
233,"Why turn back, they say, when so much of the groundwork is done. Bike routes have been expanded. Bus lanes have been painted, and the skeletons of bus fare machines have been installed on sidewalks. New bus and ferry services have been announced."
234,"“What we have in front of us is a city that has to expand our transportation system,” said Ydanis Rodriguez, the chairman of the City Council’s transportation committee. “We have an opportunity to become the most pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly city in the whole nation.”"
235,"But critics counter that some of the changes would turn their neighborhoods into testing grounds for transit experiments that focus largely on moving commuters, and that the plans should be re-evaluated and weighed against the safety, health and quality of life of residents."
236,"Across the country, cities are grappling with similar issues as they try to reimagine their aging and increasingly inefficient transportation networks for modern needs. Many cities have overhauled subways and buses to attract more riders, and redesigned streets to make more room for cyclists, pedestrians and green spaces. They have embraced a host of initiatives to raise money for public transportation and reduce congestion and pollution."
237,"San Francisco has transit-only lanes on 30 miles of streets and plans to add 20 more miles in the next decade. It has even highlighted some busy lanes with red paint to make them more visible to drivers, resulting in fewer cars blocking the lanes, transit officials said."
238,"Portland, Ore., is spending millions to promote walking and cycling in its downtown area, and working to make bus service faster and more reliable. It has also offered incentives to commuters to take alternative transportation, including a program that gives free transit passes to those who turn in their city-issued parking permits."
239,"“Major cities across the country face the same challenges, and they are likely to only get worse unless we take action now,” Chloe Eudaly, Portland’s transportation commissioner, said. “Investment in our active transportation infrastructure and increasing ridership on public transit is critical to preserving and maintaining the livability of our city and our planet.”"
240,"In New York, there are more alternatives than ever for subway riders who tire of delays and overcrowding. Ferry routes will serve all five boroughs next year. New bus lanes are being installed at an average of seven miles a year, for a total of 111 miles so far, with city officials planning to pick up the pace. The city’s network of bike lanes has grown to 1,240 miles, including 300 miles of bike lanes added to streets since 2014 alone."
241,"But the 15-month shutdown of the L train had been the catalyst for faster and more sweeping changes. It spurred the installation of more Manhattan crosstown bike lanes — cyclists complain that there are not enough — on 12th and 13th Streets, and a bike lane on Delancey Street to keep cyclists moving on and off the Williamsburg Bridge, the city’s busiest bicycle bridge crossing with 7,300 trips per day."
242,"The city’s first “busway,” or bus-only corridor, was designed to restrict car and truck traffic on 14th Street. Officials also planned to impose high-occupancy-vehicle requirements on the Williamsburg Bridge: Private vehicles with fewer than three passengers — including taxis and ride-hailing cars — would be barred from using the bridge between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. to make room for a fleet of new temporary buses carrying displaced L riders."
243,"Under the alternate plan backed by Mr. Cuomo, weekday L train service — including during morning and evening rush hours — will remain unchanged, and repairs will be carried out at night and on weekends, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
244,"The agency plans to increase bus and subway service — including on the G, M and 7 lines — to accommodate L riders affected by the construction, but has not yet released specific details. Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman, said no final decisions had been made on other specific plans or services in the previous shutdown plan."
245,An M.T.A. draft memo obtained recently by Streetsblog NYC suggested that there would no longer be a need for the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge and the new ferry service. Mr. Tarek said the memo was outdated and that options were still being studied.
246,"Veronique Hakim, the M.T.A.’s managing director, said the agency was seeking public input and working with city officials to come up with a new plan “serving the needs of our customers while being sensitive to local communities.” The plan would be constantly monitored and adjusted as needed, she added."
247,"“New Yorkers can be certain that the alternate service plan for the new and improved L project will include additional transportation options designed to accommodate every affected L customer,” she said."
248,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
249,"Still, Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University, said that without the pressure of a looming shutdown, “there is now a risk that momentum will be lost,” adding that “planning for bus lanes, better ferries and more bike options is hard enough without sudden shifts in policy.”"
250,City officials would not answer questions about whether specific contingency measures would go forward or the costs incurred in planning for the shutdown.
251,"Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a recent news conference that the city was evaluating the new L train plan to decide “if there’s anything that we were planning that is no longer needed because of the L train, but that we might want to do anyway.”"
252,"The mayor has made improving bus service a priority, and many transit advocates said he could start by keeping the new bus lanes that are already on the ground."
253,"“It would be lame to peel a bus lane off after pledging in his state of the city to get bus riders moving,” Jon Orcutt, a former city transportation official, said. “These are standing city policies and — L train shutdown or no L train shutdown — they should continue to be city policies and programs.”"
254,"Even without a shutdown, commuters will need backup options during “the great L train slowdown” on nights and weekends, said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders. He added, “We can’t just go back to the norm and pretend nothing’s happening.”"
255,"The uncertainty about the alternate plan has also raised concerns among New Yorkers. On the Lower East Side, residents had braced for more gridlock and air pollution from the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge. Now they do not know what to expect. Susan Stetzer, the manager of a local community board, said she remained concerned “about all the unknowns.”"
256,"The 14th Street Coalition, which represents more than two dozen residential buildings, block associations and businesses in the West Village, Chelsea and Flatiron neighborhoods, has called for officials to abandon the plans for a busway and wider pedestrian areas on 14th Street — which in some places would narrow the street to two lanes from four lanes — and restrictions that would divert car and truck traffic to nearby streets. Some residents also want the crosstown bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets removed."
257,"Judy Pesin, 66, a member of the coalition, said the 14th Street changes would restrict deliveries to homes and businesses, slow down emergency vehicles, and make it harder for older people, parents with young children and those with disabilities to access cars."
258,"“Clearly the change in plans means it’s time to listen to the community,’’ she said, “because the commuters are still going to have a moving L train.”"
259,"The rooftop fund-raiser was meant to be a secretive affair, but word spread quickly among those with pending issues before the state. Lobbyists told their clients that the event would be a good thing to go to. "
260,"After all, the dinner was being held a little more than two weeks before the New York State budget was due, and what better way to make valuable connections than to pay tribute to the guest of honor, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo."
261,Among those present were the vice president of a school bus company seeking tax breaks for the purchase of buses; a recycling company founder looking for a broadening of the 5-cent deposit law; and an affordable housing developer lobbying for real estate tax credits. 
262,"The fund-raiser was held on March 14 on the 20th floor of the St. Regis Hotel, just off Fifth Avenue and a block from Trump Tower. The minimum donation per couple was $25,000. "
263,"The event, which was billed as a spring dinner with the governor, was strictly under the radar: It was not listed on Mr. Cuomo’s calendar, and even the invitation was vaguely worded, with the locale only provided in the R.S.V.P."
264,"And although a reporter who showed up at the fund-raiser was barred entry, The New York Times was able to piece together an account of the event through interviews with six attendees and a partial guest list of 35 invitees. The guests included senior Cuomo administration officials, including the state budget director."
265,"The fund-raiser provided a vivid example of how things work in Albany’s pay-to-play culture, where political contributions are often viewed by business leaders as a prerequisite for getting their perspective heard in the capital. It also offered a glimpse into the nexus of money and politics that is commonplace across the ideological spectrum and around the United States, and something that Mr. Cuomo has excelled in. "
266,"The governor is considered one of the Democratic Party’s most prolific fund-raisers, accumulating more than $30 million in his campaign war chest until last year’s costly re-election effort, when he spent dearly to fend off a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon. "
267,"The high-priced event seemed in stark contrast to Mr. Cuomo’s promise of “real campaign finance reform” made two months earlier, as he announced his support for a public financing system. In January, the governor signed new limitations on corporate donations and, in his State of the State speech, vowed to “combat big money in politics” and empower small donors."
268,"But the vast majority of Mr. Cuomo’s political fund-raising has come from big checks, and the event at the St. Regis, held in a room with a trompe l’oeil of the sky on a partly cloudy day, continued that trend."
269,"Corey Muirhead is a vice president at Logan Bus Company and interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association. School bus contractors are lobbying the state on several issues of interest to their members, including tax exemptions for the purchase of new school buses. "
270,"“I coordinate with my lobbyist and I go to events that they feel are important,” said Corey Muirhead of Logan Bus Company, who attended the dinner. “We have stuff that we want to see done up in Albany.”"
271,"Robert Mujica is the state budget director. He had been working out of Mr. Cuomo’s Manhattan office on the day of the fund-raiser, the governor’s staff said, and received an invitation as a matter of courtesy. "
272,"About 100 people mingled in a crowd that included the state budget director, Robert Mujica, and the governor’s top aide, Melissa DeRosa, before sitting down at more than a dozen tables for two slices of filet mignon, vegetables and what one attendee described as a “little peaked salad.” "
273,"According to the invitation, a limited number of tickets were available for $5,000; most single tickets were $15,000."
274,"The governor delivered a speech that touched on Amazon, the tumult in Washington, and the transition from campaigning to governing that he said some new Albany legislators had to learn."
275,"“I thought he gave a great speech. He really knew how to relate to the crowd,” said Conrad Cutler, whose company, Galvanize Group, gathers bottles and cans and returns them to the distributors, collecting the deposit and a 3.5-cent handling fee. “He addressed a lot of pressing issues involving health care and the M.T.A. He underscored his commitment to New Yorkers who have issues.”"
276,"Conrad Cutler is the chief executive of Galvanize Group, a company that collects cans and bottles to return them to distributors. Galvanize Group wants the state to approve an expansion of the bottle bill, which is backed by Mr. Cuomo and would make more bottles eligible for deposit. "
277,"Thirteen minutes before the fund-raiser officially began, Mr. Mujica emailed a statement to reporters, lashing out at the Democratic-led State Senate and accusing it of creating “false political expectations” with its budget proposals. "
278,"Then the dinner started, with attendees sporting badges with two names: theirs and Mr. Cuomo’s, the latter done up in his campaign logo."
279,"“As the governor said since Day 1, anyone who can get swayed by a single dollar has no place in government,” Richard Azzopardi, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said. He added that people who said their lobbyist told them to attend the fund-raiser should “fire their lobbyist and get their head examined.”"
280,"Mr. Azzopardi defended the presence of senior aides — including Mr. Mujica, who is in charge of the state budget being negotiated in Albany — at the fund-raiser, saying Mr. Mujica had “worked out of his New York City office that day and this event was after hours.” Staff members are routinely invited to events as guests, he added."
281,"Mr. Cuomo, for his part, came from Albany for the event and was in the capital the next day, according to his public schedule."
282,"One oddity at the fund-raiser? Neither attendees nor staff members from the Cuomo campaign could describe what office, if any, Mr. Cuomo, who was recently re-elected to a third term, was raising money for."
283,Nor could those contributing to him.
284,"“I didn’t ask. It’s obvious what it is. It’s the continual cycle of fund-raising,” said John Samuelsen, the president of the Transport Workers Union International and an ally of the governor. “That’s what he does. That’s what everybody seems to do.”"
285,"John Samuelsen, whose name is misspelled on his badge, is the president of the Transport Workers Union International. The union, especially its Local 100, represents tens of thousands of public transit workers in the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority. "
286,"Mr. Samuelsen said he arrived just after the governor had finished his formal address. He said he spoke to the governor for a couple of minutes about the subway. Mr. Samuelsen, who recalled wearing a Woolrich shirt to the event, said he could not recall how much he had donated to attend. "
287,"“Honestly, I’m not even in the weeds on that level,” he said, adding that his union has happily long spent money to support Mr. Cuomo. “The governor has been the best governor for the trade union movement ever.”"
288,"The roster of invitees included some well-known figures in New York real estate such as Douglas Durst; prominent political donors like the Republican billionaire John Catsimatidis; and past contributors to Mr. Cuomo like Elliot Gibber, who owns an egg products company and donated $73,000 to the governor’s 2018 re-election campaign. "
289,"“I walked in and walked out,” Mr. Gibber said. “I have huge facilities in New York State. I believe in the governor. He’s done a lot of work for education and private education.”"
290,"Mr. Durst gave but did not attend; Mr. Catsimatidis said he did not contribute or go to the event, explaining the governor’s invitation as a matter of their longstanding friendship."
291,"“I go back with the governor 20 years,” Mr. Catsimatidis said. “In 50 years in business, I have never gotten anything from the city or the state.” "
292,"“You know what I’ve gotten? Ungatz,” he said, of a slang term for nada, zip, zero. “That’s Italian, I think.”"
293,"Charlie Bachtell is the founder and chief executive of Cresco Labs, a cannabis company based in Chicago. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach a deal on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on the idea."
294,"Others who bought tickets did so while they had an issue of importance to them being decided in Albany, like Larry Regan, a housing developer seeking real estate tax credits who did not go to the dinner, and Charlie Bachtell, the chief executive of Cresco Labs, a Chicago-based cannabis company."
295,"Cresco Labs hired a lobbyist in New York for the first time this year, state records showed. Mr. Cuomo has said he wanted to reach an agreement on legalizing marijuana as part of the budget process, but he seems to have relented on that notion. "
296,A spokesman for the company declined to say why Mr. Bachtell had attended the fund-raiser. 
297,"Larry Regan is the president of Regan Development, which develops market-rate and affordable housing. Mr. Regan has been lobbying the state on real estate tax credits. He paid for a ticket, but did not attend the event, a spokeswoman said. "
298,"Others with an immediate interest in state matters included Maury Litwack of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas that would like an increase in the reimbursement for science and math education at nonpublic schools. The week before the budget is passed could decide the size of that program."
299,"“The governor has been a champion of the STEM program and Jewish causes,” Menashe Shapiro, a spokesman for Mr. Litwack, said. He said that while Mr. Litwack had briefly attended the end of the fund-raiser, “he did not write a check.” "
300,"Maury Litwack is the executive director of the Teach Advocacy Network, a coalition of Jewish day schools and yeshivas. The group wants the state to expand its STEM reimbursement program for nonpublic schools. "
301,"Mr. Muirhead, the bus company executive, said he attended in his role as interim president of the New York School Bus Contractors Association, which was lobbying the state government. He said a big issue for the group was a possible tax exemption on the purchase of new buses. "
302,"Mr. Cutler, the recycling executive, was also clear about his interest in the fund-raiser."
303,"“Governor Cuomo proposed to expand the bottle bill to all beverages except wine and liquor,” he said, noting that the bill does not cover a few select categories, like milk. “I agree with that because I make money on every bottle that’s redeemed, and for environmental reasons.” "
304,"MCALLEN, Tex. — Border Patrol detention centers in Texas’s Rio Grande Valley have soared well past their capacity in recent days, prompting mass releases of migrants onto the streets as local leaders scramble to house and feed hundreds of new arrivals daily."
305,"“They’re as stressed as we are,” Jim Darling, mayor of the South Texas border city of McAllen, said of Border Patrol officials. The officials have released more than 2,200 people from government processing facilities in the Rio Grande Valley since Monday, setting aside once again the Trump administration’s vow to end what it calls “catch and release” of those who cross the border without authorization."
306,"“We’re trying to determine how many sites we have to have. The last thing we want is people walking our streets and having to sleep in doorways,” Mr. Darling said."
307,"The primary migrant-services facility in the region, a former nursing home in McAllen now used by Catholic Charities as an immigrant respite center, is already reaching capacity, with nearly every inch of the low-slung red-brick building occupied."
308,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]"
309,"The air was thick with the smell of sweat Tuesday evening, with dozens of people waiting for assistance at the front of the building. Two government buses pulled up outside to drop off even more: 54 in one bus and 57 in the second. On Wednesday, migrants slept on blue padded mats on the floors of small crowded rooms as they waited for rides to the downtown bus station."
310,"In El Paso, the sudden release of about 150 migrants on Tuesday set in motion a flurry to try to accommodate them. A network of shelters run by the nonprofit Annunciation House had no more space, so city officials converted a public park into a staging area, until space for the migrants was found at local hotels."
311,"Unauthorized border crossings have spiked in recent months, with more than 76,000 migrants apprehended on the southwest border in February, an 11-year high. Processing facilities in El Paso and in the Rio Grande Valley region in South Texas have swelled with migrant families in recent days. Early Tuesday, Border Patrol agents at the border fence in El Paso apprehended a group of 194 men, women and children traveling together. About five minutes later, agents in another part of the city took in a second group of 252 migrants."
312,"Last week, agents in the McAllen area encountered a group of nearly 300 migrants walking toward a river levee, the largest such group seen this year. In a single 24-hour period, agents in that region had apprehended more than 1,000 migrants, most of them voluntarily turning themselves in and seeking protection under asylum laws."
313,"The unusually large numbers are what caused agents in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector this week to release some migrant families at an early stage, the agency said. The releases bypassed the usual procedure in which newly arrived migrants are handed over after initial processing to another federal agency, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which may detain them or release them with some requirement that they will show up for future court appearances."
314,"Instead, migrants traveling in families are being released directly by Customs and Border Protection, the Border Patrol’s parent agency, after being given papers instructing them to show up at a later date in immigration court. Local officials were told that Border Patrol facilities in the area were over capacity by about 2,100 migrants."
315,"The Border Patrol said in a statement that the recent increase in apprehensions led to a “limited availability of space” at the agency’s facilities in the Rio Grande Valley sector. Out of concern for the safety of officers and migrants, the agency said it had begun to release families after giving them a notice to appear in immigration court."
316,"“R.G.V. Sector will continue to coordinate with state and local stakeholders and nongovernmental organizations while these temporary measures are in place,” the agency said."
317,"The recent releases resembled a similar series of unannounced mass releases of migrants late last year in El Paso and San Diego. This time, however, federal immigration agencies appeared to be coordinating more closely with local officials, who in December had been caught off guard."
318,"The mass release in McAllen has caused a ripple effect along the Texas border. Officials in Brownsville, 60 miles east of McAllen, were told by Border Patrol officials to expect releases there in the coming days as well. It appeared that the Border Patrol intended to ease pressure on the McAllen shelter network by putting migrants on buses and dropping them off in Brownsville."
319,"Tony Martinez, the mayor of Brownsville, said the city was prepared to open the downtown bus station for 24 hours to accommodate migrants. After their release, many migrants board buses to join their relatives already living elsewhere in the United States."
320,"“At this particular point, we are having meetings on a daily basis so that we can monitor the numbers,” Mr. Martinez said."
321,"The scramble comes as Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was scheduled to visit McAllen on Thursday. Some immigrant advocates and elected officials were skeptical of the timing of the releases, suggesting they were part of a Trump administration effort to justify the president’s descriptions of a border in crisis and his declaration of a national emergency. Border Patrol officials deny such claims."
322,"Representative Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat whose district includes McAllen, criticized the mass release of migrants “without processing, without proper plans for housing and with no course of reasonable action” and questioned the administration’s motives."
323,"“President Trump, Secretary Nielsen, and the entire administration have been presented with the truth — there is no crisis on the U.S.-Mexico border,” he said in the statement. “Their response? Create one.”"
324,"The nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, which has been conducting legal interviews with migrants released from Border Patrol custody in the Rio Grande Valley, said it appeared that the government was deliberately releasing them hundreds at a time. Some of those released recently reported that they had been detained for up to eight days, the group said. Normally, Customs and Border Protection holds newly detained migrants for about 72 hours."
325,"Also raising suspicion was a recent drop in the number of migrants prosecuted for illegal border crossings at the federal courthouse in McAllen. Prosecutions during January and February ranged from about 400 to 700 per week. But the number of migrants brought to the courthouse dropped sharply last week, with only 176 prosecuted, and 88 had been charged during the first three days of this week, even though overall apprehensions remained high."
326,"“Families should never be detained, but this practice must be met with skepticism,” Astrid Dominguez of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Border Rights Center said in a statement."
327,"On Tuesday, Sister Norma Pimentel, the executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, posted an urgent plea for assistance on Facebook, asking for volunteers in both McAllen and Brownsville, as well chicken and vegetables to make soup, and cereal and bananas for breakfast."
328,"Sister Pimentel later stood outside the respite center in a light rain to help newly arrived migrants off a bus. The respite center received more than 800 migrants on Monday, another 800 on Tuesday and more than 600 by Wednesday afternoon. Sister Pimentel said she was told by Border Patrol to expect up to 800 a day for an unspecified amount of time. In recent months, the most that Catholic Charities had assisted in one day was about 400."
329,"“It’s not typical at all,” she said amid a crowd of migrants in the front lobby. “We were not expecting this. The numbers are very high. They just simply said they’re apprehending big numbers and they’re over capacity, and they need to create the space for those that are just arriving.”"
330,"She said city officials had identified two additional sites that can be used to house migrants if the numbers warrant. If those are not enough, the group plans to charter buses to Houston and possibly San Antonio, she said."
331,"As crowded as the respite center was, the conditions in the Border Patrol facilities were even more congested, some migrants who had just been released said."
332,"“There were so many people,” said Albertina, a 29-year-old Honduran mother who had just left the central processing center in McAllen. Albertina, who asked to be identified only by her first name, stood in line at the respite center holding her infant daughter, and said she was going to take a bus to join her family in Tennessee."
333,"A 45-year-old man from Honduras who identified himself as David said he had arrived with his 15-year-old son at a Border Patrol facility on Saturday. It was packed, he said."
334,“Two thousand?” he called out to a friend. “What do you think?”
335,"“Yes, must have been,” the friend said."
336,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
337,A bus company has called lawmakers in New York asking for an exemption. A mayor in New Jersey warned drivers they might be tolled twice when they leave the state. Truckers are putting together a lobbying strategy. And taxi drivers have written a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seeking a reprieve.
338,"One battle over congestion pricing is over. But now that the plan is officially coming to New York City, the next fight has begun: Who will pay, how much will it cost and who might get a break?"
339,"The outcry began almost immediately after Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers reached a deal last weekend to make New York the first city in the country to enact congestion pricing. Starting in 2021, drivers entering the heart of Manhattan could pay $11 to $25, money that will be used to pay for improvements to the city’s troubled subway."
340,"State leaders were careful to avoid including too many details in the legislation, in part over concerns that it would be harder to pass. Instead, they left many of the difficult decisions to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a yet-to-be-appointed six-member “traffic mobility review” board."
341,But that has opened the way for various groups to try to influence the outcome in the months ahead and to make their case for exemptions and discounts.
342,"“We will be having discussions with the panel to educate them on the trucking industry and the challenges they have when it comes to delivering in the zone,” said Kendra Hems, the president of the Trucking Association of New York. “We feel very strongly that the industry should be exempt from paying.”"
343,But state officials and transit advocates say allowing too many loopholes could prevent the city from achieving its two major goals: reducing congestion and raising $15 billion for public transit.
344,"“The intent is not to have a whole list of exemptions,” said Robert Mujica, the state budget director. “You’re trying to discourage people from driving into the zone — that’s the only way to reduce traffic.”"
345,But that will not deter people from trying.
346,"“Every constituency in town is going to ask for a special exemption and carve out, but part of what makes congestion pricing work is that it’s fair and applies broadly,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
347,"The stakes are high to get it right. New York could serve as an example for other cities, like Los Angeles and Philadelphia, that are also considering the idea. If it is a debacle, other cities might abandon their plans."
348,"In London, where congestion pricing began in 2003, the toll has risen to about $15 per day, from about $8. Residents who live in the zone get a discount, as do owners of low-emission vehicles. Taxis and other ride-hailing cars are exempt."
349,"The New York legislation included only a broad framework: The congestion zone is below 60th Street in Manhattan, except for the West Side Highway and F.D.R. Drive, two busy roadways on each side of the island. Emergency vehicles and those carrying disabled people are exempt. People who live in the zone and earn less than $60,000 a year can receive a tax credit."
350,The framework has left ample room for complaints.
351,"Leaders in New Jersey say its drivers could get gouged. Gov. Philip D. Murphy asked Governor Cuomo for a discount for those who use the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest bridge."
352,"Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, said on Twitter that New Jersey should seek revenge by tolling New York drivers to pay for upgrades for New Jersey Transit, the state’s sputtering commuter rail and bus network. If some bridges and tunnels are discounted and not others, he said, that could lead to major traffic jams at certain crossings."
353,"“If you selectively exempt people based on politics, that’s a big issue for us,” Mr. Fulop said."
354,"The backlash in the region has been swift. About 54 percent of New York City voters oppose congestion pricing and more than half believe it would not reduce traffic, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released on Tuesday."
355,"Drivers will likely pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business hours, and less at night and on weekends, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam who was one of the architects of the congestion pricing plan. But if the authority starts handing out exemptions, that would likely push up tolls for everyone else to $15 or more."
356,"“I think there should be just about no exemptions,” he said. “People using their cars contribute to congestion. It doesn’t matter what group they belong to.”"
357,"But even Mr. Schwartz has not been able to escape the calls for exemptions from friends and neighbors in northern Manhattan. “People are calling me asking for their own personal exemptions — even neighbors of mine,” he said. “I’m not terribly popular at the moment.”"
358,"Sean Hughes, a spokesman for Coach USA, which operates hundreds of buses in Manhattan daily, said he has been calling, emailing and meeting with state lawmakers to make a case for exempting buses. Mr. Hughes said buses reduce congestion by carrying people who would otherwise be driving."
359,"“Busing is a form of mass transit that is a solution to congestion,” he said. “We should be exempt.”"
360,"Several motorcycle clubs have also pressed state lawmakers for an exemption or discount, with their members saying that they should not have to pay the same fees as drivers since their two-wheelers contribute less to congestion than cars."
361,"“One car can take the space of six bikes,” said Joseph Notovitz, 64, a branding specialist from Long Island who regularly rides his motorcycle to and from Manhattan and weaves around cars trapped in gridlock."
362,"The transportation authority, the sprawling agency that oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads, will determine the tolls and exemptions based on recommendations by a “traffic mobility review” board. The authority’s board, which has representatives from across the region, must also approve the tolls."
363,"The authority will appoint the mobility board, which must include one member recommended by New York City’s mayor. One member must live in the area served by the Metro-North Railroad and another must live along the Long Island Rail Road. Its findings are due around November 2020."
364,"Mr. Mujica said the mobility board will review a traffic study analysis of bridges and tunnels and consider public input before deciding whether to credit drivers who already pay tolls. The board, which will likely have members with experience in public transportation and finance, will also come up with a plan for taxis and ride-hail vehicles, including Uber."
365,"Uber, the popular ride-hail app, has been a key booster for congestion pricing. The company says it has spent more than $2 million to support the proposal. Uber has paid lobbyists more than $1 million in New York since 2017 and spent nearly $200,000 on television ads and phone calls to support congestion pricing last year, according to state records."
366,"Uber officials say congestion pricing is the best way to relieve traffic in the city, instead of blaming Uber for congested streets and imposing a cap on new ride-hail vehicles. Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, declined to comment on whether Uber might seek an exemption from the congestion toll."
367,"State Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said that he is pushing for a credit for Long Island commuters who use the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge on the way into Manhattan. “These people should not get double tolled,” he said."
368,"The authority’s bridges and tunnels division will technically oversee the tolling program. Its acting president, Daniel DeCrescenzo, along with the new M.T.A. chairman, Patrick Foye, will have considerable power over the plan. So will Mr. Cuomo, who appointed Mr. Foye and has taken near total control over the transit agency."
369,"Taxi leaders are writing a letter to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Foye asking for an exemption for an industry that has already been decimated by the rise of Uber. Nicolae Hent, a Queens taxi driver, said the new tolls in Manhattan could add up to hundreds of dollars a month."
370,"“It’s another nail in the coffin,” he said. “Of course, I’m going to fight.”"
371,"TEHRAN — A suicide bomber killed at least 27 members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and wounded 13 on a bus in a restive region of southeast Iran on Wednesday, Iranian media reported. It was among the deadliest attacks in Iran in years."
372,"The Revolutionary Guards, an elite Iranian paramilitary force, quickly blamed the United States for the assault, which came during the week that Iran’s leaders have been celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, which overthrew the American-backed shah in 1979."
373,"The Revolutionary Guards did not explain precisely how the Americans could have been involved in the attack. But Iranian officials suggested it was more than coincidental that it happened as the Trump administration was hosting an anti-Iran-themed meeting in Poland that included delegations from Iran’s regional adversaries, Israel and Saudi Arabia."
374,"Dispatches by the official Islamic Republic News Agency and the Fars News Agency said the victims had been traveling between the cities of Zahedan and Khash near the Pakistan border, a haven for militant separatist groups and drug smugglers."
375,"There were conflicting accounts of the casualties, which often happens in Iran immediately after calamities. Fars initially reported that at least 20 people had died, then updated the death toll to at least 41 — suggesting that everyone on the bus had been killed. Without explanation, Fars later adjusted the toll to 27 dead and 13 wounded, consistent with what the Revolutionary Guards and other news services were saying."
376,"Fars said a bomber driving a car full of explosives on a highway had detonated it near the bus, and a video posted on the agency’s website showed what it said were the charred remains of the bus."
377,"On the social messaging app Telegram, a militant Sunni extremist group called Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for the attack, but officials did not confirm that the group was involved. Jaish al-Adl, which means Army of Justice, has links to Al Qaeda and has operated in southeast Iran for years."
378,A statement issued by the Revolutionary Guards said the bus had been “carrying the warriors of Islam soldiers who were returning from the region to their cities after completing their border mission.”
379,"While the United States and Israel have accused Iran of fomenting terrorism in the Middle East, Iran itself has also been the target of terrorist attacks since the Islamic Revolution."
380,"Last September, gunmen killed at least 25 people and wounded 60 in an assault on a military parade in Ahvaz, in southwestern Iran, where Arab separatists are active. The victims were a mix of Revolutionary Guards members and civilian onlookers."
381,"Less than two years ago, armed assailants, some disguised as women, stormed the Parliament building and the tomb of Iran’s revolutionary founder, in coordinated assaults that left at least 12 people dead. The Islamic State claimed responsibility, boasting that the attacks were its first ever against Iran, where the Shiite Muslim majority is loathed by the Islamic State’s Sunni extremist ideologues."
382,"A southeastern Iranian province, Sistan and Baluchistan, is home to several extremist Sunni groups such as Jaish al-Adl that have committed sporadic bombings, assassinations and other attacks on Iranian security forces and officials."
383,The latest attack came against the backdrop of a two-day diplomatic meeting in Warsaw organized by the United States and aimed partly at pressuring and isolating Iran.
384,"Iranian leaders have often accused the United States and its key Middle East allies, Saudi Arabia and Israel, of supporting armed opposition groups inside Iran with money, intelligence and weapons. Representatives of at least one Iranian opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or M.E.K., which has advocated regime change in Iran and was once considered a terrorist organization by the United States, were present at the Warsaw meeting."
385,"Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif of Iran, in a posting on his Twitter account, quickly drew a link between the Warsaw meeting and the deadly bus attack."
386,"“Is it no coincidence that Iran is hit by terror on the very day that #WarsawCircus begins?” he wrote. “Especially when cohorts of same terrorists cheer it from Warsaw streets & support it with twitter bots? US seems to always make the same wrong choices, but expect different results.”"
387,"A well-known Iranian hard-line politician, Hamid Reza Taraghi, also drew a connection between the attack and Iran’s most outspoken adversaries, including Maryam Rajavi, a leader-in-exile of the M.E.K. who sent a video message of support to  the group’s “Free Iran” opposition rally in Warsaw."
388,"Mr. Taraghi said “dozens of terrorist plots” intended to be carried out on Monday, when Iran officially celebrated the Islamic Revolution anniversary, had been foiled by Iranian intelligence services."
389,"The bus bombing was “not a big deal militarily, but this suicidal attack in the border area is a cowardly act,” Mr. Taraghi said. “For sure Saudi Arabia, America and MEK must be blamed.”"
390,"SRINAGAR, Kashmir — Fears of communal violence were once again raised in the disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday when a grenade blew up at a crowded bus stand, killing one person and wounding many others."
391,"Around the same time, videos of two Indian men beating Kashmiri street vendors in a northern Indian city went viral online, further stoking tensions."
392,"The violence followed a week of hostilities in Kashmir between India and Pakistan, both of which claim the mountainous region."
393,"On Thursday, witnesses said that a young man lobbed a grenade toward a crowd of people, including many students, who were waiting for a bus in central Jammu, one of the larger cities in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir."
394,A simple guide to the roots of the conflict and what could happen next.
395,"“There was a loud bang — everything went black in front of my eyes,” said Sat Kumar, a trader, who was taken to the hospital along with more than two dozen others who were injured in the attack, some critically."
396,"The young man who threw the grenade initially got away. But later in the day, Indian police officials said they had apprehended someone with the help of CCTV footage."
397,"Indian officials identified the suspect as a 17-year-old Kashmiri who was part of a militant group fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir. The police said that during an interrogation, he had confessed to throwing the grenade."
398,"Last month, a young Kashmiri separatist blew up a bus full of Indian soldiers, setting off a sharply escalating military crisis between India and Pakistan, which India has accused of supporting separatist militants."
399,"India and Pakistan have feuded for decades, and both wield nuclear arms. Other countries, including the United States and China, have urged the two sides to step away from conflict. The crisis was somewhat defused late last week after Pakistan returned an Indian pilot whose plane it shot down over Kashmir."
400,"Some in the region have wondered whether the bus stand attack might be connected to India’s coming elections and a nefarious effort to provoke animosities between Hindus and Muslims in the country. The Jammu area is predominantly Hindu, while the larger Jammu and Kashmir region is majority Muslim. Jammu has a history of religious tensions erupting into violence."
401,"M.K. Sinha, a police official in Jammu, urged people to remain calm. “The culprits will not be spared,” he said."
402,"India and Pakistan continue to eye each other warily, and artillery shells continue to fly across the disputed border in Kashmir. Last week, shelling killed several people on both sides of the border."
403,"In Lucknow, a large city in northern India, the police arrested four people on Thursday on suspicion of beating up Kashmiri street vendors after a video went viral that showed the attack."
404,"Wearing saffron shirts, the color favored by many Hindu nationalists, the attackers called the street vendors “terrorists” and said, “You sell here and throw stones there,” referring to protests in Kashmir."
405,The attackers slapped the Kashmiri men in the face and hit them with a long wooden stick.
406,"This was hardly an isolated incident. After the Indian convoy was attacked in mid-February, hundreds of Kashmiri college students at universities in India were chased off their campuses, and some were beaten up. And in New Delhi, the capital, some Kashmiris were thrown out by their landlords simply for being Kashmiri."

408,"New Yorkers who rely on the L train are bracing for months of upheaval when their line is partially closed for repairs. Subway leaders have warned of fewer trains on nights and weekends, crowded platforms and the need to divert riders to buses."
409,"In other parts of the city, subway riders have felt a sense of relief — and even schadenfreude — to be spared from the transit nightmare."
410,But their line could be next.
411,"With New York City’s subway in crisis, the only way to improve service is to shut down large swaths of the system to overhaul its ancient equipment. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, wants to greatly expand night and weekend closings in the coming years."
412,"“We need to start getting used to the idea that we’re entering a period of shared sacrifice,” said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group."
413,The disruption planned for the L line is in many ways a preview of what lies ahead for the rest of the system. In a city that takes pride in its round-the-clock subway — it’s one of the only systems in the world that never closes — the L train repairs will be painful: fewer trains starting at 8 p.m. on weeknights and a 20-minute wait between trains on the weekend.
414,Mr. Byford’s sweeping $40 billion plan to save the subway calls for installing modern subway signals on several lines at the same time. Some could be closed on most nights and weekends for two and a half years.
415,The service cuts will fall the hardest on New Yorkers who work nights and weekends like Amy Malale who lives in Queens and works on Sundays at a bookstore in Manhattan.
416,"“I question whether it is going to make the subways better,” Ms. Malale said as she rode an F train on a recent afternoon. “Two and a half years? That’s a scary thought.”"
417,"Transit workers have started to upgrade signals on the Queens Boulevard line, from Rockefeller Center in Manhattan to Kew Gardens in Queens. The F train in Brooklyn and the 8th Avenue line in Manhattan are next. Construction on the Lexington Avenue line, the nation’s busiest subway route, could start as early as next year."
418,"But Mr. Byford’s ambitious “Fast Forward” plan will not proceed without significant new funding from state leaders in Albany. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, is pressing for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the subway."
419,"“If Fast Forward is going to gain momentum or if it’s going to die a painful death, it’s going to happen at the hands of Albany legislators,” Mr. Sifuentes said."
420,"During station closings on nights and weekends, riders could have other options like extra buses, said Veronique Hakim, the managing director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Because the system is so large and interconnected, there are often alternate subway lines nearby, though that is not always the case in far-flung corners of the city beyond Manhattan."
421,"“What riders need is certainty and information,” Ms. Hakim said in an interview. “Being able to say this particular line is going to be closed from this hour to that hour. As long as you give people that information ahead of time, they can plan accordingly.”"
422,"But despite assurances from officials that the impact of the L train repairs will be minimal, transit advocates say the contingency plans are too meager."
423,The tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn had been set to close entirely for 15 months to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Officials planned to offer a “busway” on 14th Street across Lower Manhattan and high occupancy vehicle rules for the Williamsburg Bridge. Then Mr. Cuomo — upending years of preparation — intervened with a new repair plan that avoids a full closure and those alternatives were abandoned.
424,"When subway lines are closed in the years ahead, the routes should be replaced with dedicated bus lanes that prioritize transit riders over cars, said Joe Cutrufo, a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for bikers and pedestrians."
425,"“The subway doesn’t share the tracks with cars — neither should buses,” he said."
426,"While overhauling New York’s century-old subway will be disruptive, installing modern signals is the key to making the system reliable again. In London, another vast and aging system, the signals have been upgraded much faster. On one line with modern signals, trains regularly arrive every 100 seconds."
427,"In New York, only the L train and the No. 7 line have modern signals, known as communications based train control, or C.B.T.C. The installation was plagued by delays and took nearly two decades, but the L train is now the most reliable with a 90 percent on-time rate. The No. 7 line can run 29 trains per hour during rush hour, up from 27 trains before new signals were installed. Mr. Cuomo has also urged Mr. Byford to use a new technology called ultra-wideband radio that could allow the signal work to be done faster."
428,"On the F line, where the signals are currently being upgraded, some riders understand the need to shut down parts of the route. Patrick Smith said he watched an interview with Mr. Byford on “60 Minutes” last year that portrayed him as the subway’s cheerful savior. He supports Mr. Byford’s plan to fix the subway."
429,"“I think the crux of the situation is, how do you modernize a 110-year-old system without grossly impacting everyday life?” said Mr. Smith, who works in information technology and lives in Brooklyn."
430,"If the subway was closed on nights and weekends, Mr. Smith said he would be fine with taking a backup shuttle bus. “Short-term sacrifice usually pays off,” he said."
431,"Andrew Fox, who lives in Queens and works in construction on the weekend, said the subway often ran local during repair work which made his commute a “nightmare,” turning a 30-minute trip into an hourlong ride."
432,"“It’s only massively inconvenient,” he said. “From far out in Queens to Manhattan, a local train is just the worst.”"
433,"Mr. Sifuentes, the transit advocate, said he welcomed the disruption, as long as the authority provides “a really good bus route to compensate.”"
434,"“Shut my line down,” he said, “Give me C.B.T.C. I want that as soon as possible.”"
435,"Regularly closing the subway on nights and weekends would be a dramatic change for New York, where many people work outside the traditional 9-to-5 schedule. Those who work at places like medical centers and restaurants commute at all hours, even between midnight and 5 a.m., said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University."
436,"“Those are the key hours when office towers are cleaned,” he said, “when hipsters are out at comedy clubs and music venues and, of course, when the vast kitchens are baking bagels, boiling eggs and cutting up fruit.”"
437,"Christine Sherlock, a teacher who lives in Queens and teaches college classes on nights and weekends, said if she had to take a bus, instead of the subway, that could more than double her commute to two hours. Despite the hassle, she wants the subway to be upgraded."
438,"“It would be worth it,” she said, “in the long run.”"

440,"Early Monday, hundreds of thousands of New York City parents looked outside to find the streets slushy and wet, but hardly impassable."
441,"The problem? On Sunday night, Mayor Bill de Blasio had canceled school for Monday, warning of a potentially dangerous storm with up to ten inches of snow."
442,"In the morning, the decision immediately began to look like a miscalculation; 1.1 million students were home from their 1,800 schools for a few inches of slush. Even the city’s unreliable subways were running normally."
443,Good thing NYC kids didn’t have to go to school today.  Manhattan got slammed. #Snowmageddon pic.twitter.com/FPWyXkuIrs
444,"It is a fact of New York City politics that a mayor is only as popular as his most recent snow day decision. For decades, parents have scolded mayors for keeping schools open in big storms and closing them in small ones."
445,But Mr. de Blasio seems to be an especially popular target for parents’ anger.
446,"So far, in his five years in office, Mr. de Blasio has called seven snow days. In the decades between 1978 and 2013, there were only 11. Some parents praised former mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s reluctance to close schools, but he was also chastised and criticized."
447,"Sensing the growing frustration — or perhaps taking note of his Twitter mentions — Mr. de Blasio defended himself on Twitter around 10 a.m., saying his administration opted to make “an early decision” so that working parents could plan ahead."
448,"“For this mayor the safety of our kids is the first and last question in the decision,” Eric F. Phillips, the mayor’s spokesman, said on Monday. “The mayor gets as much real-time expert forecasting as he can, he drills those running the buses and the plows, and he makes the call with as much time as possible for parents to plan. This is a no-win dynamic for any mayor.”"
449,Mr. Phillips also noted that snowfall totals were higher in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan.
450,That wasn’t enough to placate frustrated New Yorkers.
451,"When Mr. de Blasio made his decision on Sunday night, meteorologists and city officials were predicting that the New York area could see as many as ten inches of snow by 7 a.m. As the wintry mix began to fall with temperatures just above freezing, those estimates decreased."
452,"Ultimately, while some areas around the city saw snowfall totals close to a foot, the National Weather Service reported that only five inches of snow fell overnight in Central Park, and totals were closer to two inches in parts of Brooklyn and Queens."
453,The decision to shutter the nation’s largest school system is a particularly unenviable choice any mayor must make.
454,"On one hand, the city is loath to close schools because the vast majority of New York City public school students are low-income, and many working families cannot work from home or afford a babysitter. With the city’s homeless student population at a record high, school can be the only place where vulnerable children get a hot meal all day."
455,But recent history shows just how ferocious the response can be when schools are left open in a bad storm.
456,"When an unexpectedly messy snowstorm hit New York and New Jersey last November, some students with special needs were stranded on their school buses for 10 hours without food or access to a bathroom as snow and ice accumulated. Furious parents wondered why their children were not let out of school before the snow started falling."
457,"The mayor was forced to apologize for his bungled handling of the storm, which likely influenced the decision to close schools on Monday."
458,"And just a few weeks after the mayor took office in 2014, the city was hit with nearly a foot of snow and Mr. de Blasio kept schools open. He faced a torrent of criticism from everyone from the United Federation of Teachers president to Al Roker."
459,"Mr. de Blasio’s then-schools chancellor, Carmen Fariña, defended their decision by declaring, “It’s a beautiful day.” The comment landed her days of unflattering coverage on the front pages of the city’s tabloids."
460,"Mr. de Blasio was not the only local official who shuttered schools on Monday. In New Jersey, where Gov. Philip D. Murphy declared a state of emergency, school districts began announcing closures or delayed openings as early as Sunday evening."
461,"Schools in the cities of Hoboken, Secaucus and Jersey City, all just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, were all closed on Monday. In suburban Bergen County, about 30 school districts opted to close for the day; roughly an equal number opted to open late. In adjacent Essex County, a handful of districts gave students a snow day, while schools in neighboring districts opened with a delayed start."
462,It was a patchwork approach — different schools in different districts doing different things — that caused confusion and consternation among parents weary of weather-related disruptions to their family’s routines.
463,"Snow day decisions involve a complicated calculus of politics and logistics. New York City’s response to the most recent storm typically influences the next decision; if the mayor was seen as overly alarmist over just a few inches, he may be more hesitant to cancel schools, but if he took heat for mismanaging a storm, it is easier to make the case for an abundance of caution."
464,"A morning snowstorm can be particularly tricky for schools because a massive fleet of yellow buses have to leave their depots, typically before the sun rises, and pick up tens of thousands of students. Those buses then interfere with the 1,600 snow plows the mayor said would comb the streets overnight. Heavy snow can impact subway service, and New Yorkers are familiar with city buses skidding and sliding across avenues in bad weather."
465,"Then there is the question of unreliable forecasts: Mr. de Blasio defended his administration’s response to the November storm by noting that the forecast only called for an inch of snow, when six inches that fell during rush hour — an especially inconvenient time — paralyzed the city."
466,"With the start of spring just a few weeks away, Mr. de Blasio was likely also betting that it would be the only snow day of the season. In the past, the city has been more hesitant to close schools early in the winter."
467,"At a news conference on Monday afternoon, Mr. de Blasio said that he and the schools chancellor had decided to close schools in order to protect children."
468,"“It indicated the kind of situation that was going to hit right as the school buses were rolling, and potentially very intense accumulation around that time,” he said. “It just did not look like a safe situation for kids based on the information that we had.”"
469,"It was a racial assault so vicious that it became one of the early chords of the civil rights movement, and led to the desegregation of the military."
470,"Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr., 26, was a decorated African-American veteran. He had just been honorably discharged from the United States Army in 1946 and was headed home to Winnsboro, S.C. Still in uniform, Mr. Woodard, was forcibly removed from the bus, brutally beaten and jailed by the white police chief in the town of Batesburg."
471,"But in the small town where Mr. Woodard was beaten so severely that he lost his sight, the crime went unpunished and largely faded from memory. Almost three generations later, a black Army veteran in Georgia and a white federal judge in South Carolina separately stumbled upon Mr. Woodard’s story and vowed to honor his memory."
472,"On Saturday afternoon, town and civic leaders and groups of veterans will walk the two blocks from the bus stop to the jail where Mr. Woodard was taken to honor his memory and acknowledge the cruelty that was done to him. Part of the trickle of small towns throughout the country confronting their violent, racist histories, the town of 5,000 — now called Batesburg-Leesville — will unveil a historic marker downtown as a permanent reminder of the racial injustice that happened there."
473,"[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.]"
474,"“Here is this hero that so many people have forgotten or didn’t know about,” said Don North, a former Army major from Carrollton, Ga., who spent three years researching and raising money for the marker. “This is about remembering him, what he endured and the legacy he left behind.”"
475,"Mr. Woodard enlisted in the Army in 1942, serving as a longshoreman in the Pacific Theater of World War II. After he was discharged, he left from Camp Gordon in Augusta, Ga."
476,"What happened on the bus is still unclear, but a dispute over a restroom break led the driver to call the police when they stopped in Batesburg, 35 miles southwest of Columbia."
477,Mr. Woodard and the bus driver argued after Mr. Woodard asked to take a bathroom break. The bus company’s policy required drivers to accommodate such requests. The driver later said Mr. Woodard had been drunk and unruly.
478,"The police chief, Lynwood Shull, and another officer ordered Mr. Woodard off the bus. He was beaten at various points while in police custody, despite protesting that he had done nothing to warrant the assault. Chief Shull jammed the ends of his blackjack into Mr. Woodard’s eyes, at one point striking him so violently that the stick broke."
479,"The next morning, Mr. Woodard appeared before the local judge where he was convicted of drunken and disorderly conduct and fined $50, the coda to a story that intimately portrayed the disrespect and horrific treatment of black veterans returning from service."
480,"“There were multiple episodes of black veterans abused across the South,” said Judge Richard Gergel, the federal judge who began researching Mr. Woodard’s history in 2011. “They were serving their country, fighting for American liberty and freedom and not given liberty and freedom when they came back home.”"
481,"News of the blinding of a World World II veteran traveled beyond the South, much of it carried by the black press. President Harry Truman was sickened by the assault and ordered a federal investigation. It was a highly unusual move at the time: investigating a white law enforcement officer for violating a black person’s civil rights."
482,"At the trial, Chief Shull said he acted in self-defense and had only struck Mr. Woodard once. Medical records never shown in court disproved Chief Shull’s claim. It took 28 minutes for an all-white jury to acquit the police chief."
483,"The judge who presided over the trial, J. Waties Waring, was deeply angered by the verdict, later issuing several decisions that helped upend Jim Crow laws."
484,"“Two of the people profoundly affected by this story were Truman and J. Waties Waring,” Judge Gergel said. “Truman formed the first presidential civil rights committee and Judge Waring, who was influenced by the travesty of justice, began writing landmark civil rights decisions.”"
485,[Judge Gergel has written a book about the case. Read our review here.]
486,"Mr. Woodard recovered in a veteran’s hospital and eventually moved to New York without his wife, who walked out on the marriage after the incident. His family in New York helped to care for him until his death in 1992. He was 73."
487,"Robert Young, 81, Mr. Woodard’s nephew and main caretaker, said that for some time his uncle was understandably bitter about what had happened. “But at some point, he just tried to live his life,” he said. “I still have this wonderful memory of him coming home for a break before he went overseas. He was standing in the kitchen in his Army uniform and my mom and sister were so excited to see him. He had made us proud.”"
488,Mr. Woodard’s story might never have been formally noted by Batesburg-Leesville if not for Mr. North and Judge Gergel.
489,"Mr. North was stationed at Fort McPherson in Atlanta in the early 1990s when he first heard about Mr. Woodard. A student of black military history, Mr. North researched more and decided a historic marker at the site of the bus stop was the best way to honor the veteran."
490,He launched the Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr. Historical Marker Association and submitted plans to state officials in 2017. The Disabled American Veterans organization funded most of the cost of the marker.
491,"Judge Gergel, who presided in the Dylann Roof murder trial in 2017, began poring over police, court and medical records looking for the tiniest details of the Woodard attack around 2011. He talked to the town’s city attorney, Chris Spradley. He had never heard of the case. Neither had Mr. Spradley’s father, who was a former mayor."
492,"The papers and archives were not enough to fully unravel an attack that was six decades old. So on a cool winter morning in December 2017, Judge Gergel traveled from Charleston to Batesburg-Leesville to see where it all happened, and walk the 250 or so paces from the bus stop to the jail."
493,"Town leaders met him there. They, too, wanted to find a meaningful way to honor Mr. Woodard."
494,"“I had not heard about this,” said Mayor Lance Shull, who is not related to the late police chief. “This event had been mostly swept under the rug. I know it can’t be corrected, we can’t erase what happened but we can acknowledge this horrible incident.”"
495,"“We want people to know it is not 1946 here anymore,” he added."
496,"The town jumped in to support Mr. North’s plans for the marker. Leaders also decided to do something else, equally permanent: they reopened the case in June against Mr. Woodard and a municipal court judge dismissed the drunken and disorderly charge."
497,"On Saturday, a group of town leaders, African-American and disabled veterans as well as Mr. Young and Mr. Gergel, who are meeting in person for the first time, will walk the two blocks through downtown and past the remnants of what Mr. Woodard likely last saw before being robbed of his eyesight: the railroad station, a drugstore, a hardware store."
498,"They will gather at the corner of a vacant lot where the old jail once stood. The state historic marker will rise from a tiny patch of earth, filled with freshly planted yellow nandina plants."
499,Mr. Woodard’s story is etched in the marker. In print. And Braille.
500,"The first challenge you face on arriving somewhere new is usually how to get around, but the right technology can make it easier. There are tools suited to specific destinations, or to modes of transport, whether you want to hail a ride in Tel Aviv, explore Paris by scooter or catch a bus from Bangkok to Chiang Mai."
501,"Here are some free transportation apps, beyond the usual Google Maps and Google Translate, to consider downloading before your next trip."
502,"Sometimes walking is faster than taking the bus, or the most direct route includes a tram and a bike ride. Citymapper helps you figure all that out, and it works in 39 cities around the world, including Tokyo, Copenhagen and Sydney. Plug in your starting and ending points, and get a list of possible routes organized by mode of transport. The app also displays trip duration and any applicable prices (like estimated cab or subway fares), along with tips for where to sit on the train and which station exit to use to reach your destination faster."
503,"You can receive alerts when it’s time to disembark, and when there are line delays or closures. You can even use it to plan your daily commute, and get a warning to leave before you’re late for work, or estimates on when you’ll get home depending on when you leave the office. The app also shows how many shared bikes and free bike spaces are available at a given location in real time, making pickup and drop-off more efficient."
504,"Depending on your destination, you may have to break your Uber or Lyft habit when you arrive: the former is banned in several European countries and parts of Australia, and operates in a gray area in others, like in Hong Kong . The latter only operates in the United States."
505,"You may also prefer to hail rides from licensed taxis. You don’t have to give up the convenience of an app to do it, though. Gett will get you a cab in Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom; and in New York City, the company has merged with ride-sharing platform Juno. Gett allows you to book a ride with an economy or higher-end car up to two weeks in advance, or on-demand. Like any good ride-sharing app, your driver’s location is displayed in real time while you wait to be picked up, but with Gett, you can pay in cash or through the app. "
506,"Taxify is a similar option that’s available in 60 cities across 29 countries, including throughout Europe and Africa. Like Uber or Lyft, its drivers are not actual taxi drivers however; the company is called Txfy in France to avoid confusion. Taxify offers different vehicle tiers, displays real-time driver location and it lets you pay through the app. Some destinations offer alternatives to cars. For example, you can hail motorcycles and auto-rickshaws in East Africa, and rent GPS-enabled scooters in Paris."
507,"If you want to explore Europe or North America without renting a car, Wanderu can help you find and book bus, train and ferry tickets instead. The app aggregates options from big-name carriers like Amtrak and Deutsche Bahn, as well as niche brands, like FlixBus and the Tallink Silja Line, a Baltic Sea ferry service."
508,"You can quickly sort options according to your schedule, budget and preferred mode of transport — maybe you want the cheapest overnight bus or the earliest luxury train."
509,"Currently, Wanderu has a separate flight finder powered by Skyscanner, but flights will be integrated into overall search results next year, so you’ll be able to see airfares along with ferries and ground transportation options in one place."
510,"A website called Bookaway provides a similar service in developing countries, including throughout Southeast Asia. You can search for bus, train and ferry options, and see whether a carrier offers amenities such as bathrooms and Wi-Fi before booking your tickets."

513,"For Dorothy Bolden and other African-American domestic workers in 1960s Atlanta, the simple act of riding the bus to their jobs in white neighborhoods became much more than just a way to get to work."
514,"The women were fed up. Every day, they worked long hours for little pay, and less respect, with few worker protections."
515,"So Bolden turned the buses into a setting for de facto union meetings, talking to other passengers about organizing a labor group that could fight for workplace rights."
516,"And in 1968, she helped start the National Domestic Workers Union of America, not a formal union but an education and advocacy group that she led for nearly three decades and that served more than 10,000 members around the country at its height."
517,Bolden’s leap from bus passenger to leader of a powerful labor organization was not far-fetched to those who knew her.
518,"She had already taken part in the civil rights movement, marching in protests alongside figures like Representative John Lewis of Georgia, who led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in the 1960s."
519,"“She spoke up, and she spoke out, and when she saw something that wasn’t fair, or just, or right, she would say something,” he said in a telephone interview."
520,[Read about how domestic workers are currently trying to organize.]
521,"She even approached her neighbor, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., for his advice on the plight of domestic workers."
522,"“I wanted him to help me organize,” she said in 1995 in an interview for Georgia State University’s Voices of Labor Oral History Project."
523,His answer: “You do it.”
524,"Bolden didn’t need much encouraging. She knew the grueling life of a domestic worker well, having started at a young age by helping her mother, who held the same job."
525,"On a typical day, she would “get up at 4 a.m. to leave home by 6 a.m., and be on the job by 8 a.m., perform all those duties necessary to the proper management of a household for eight hours, leave there by 4 p.m. to be home by 6 p.m. where I would do the same things I’ve done all over again for my own family,” she was quoted as saying in the book “Household Workers Unite: The Untold Story of African American Women Who Built a Movement” (2015) by Premilla Nadasen."
526,"She was unabashedly proud of being a domestic worker, and often spoke about the role’s importance."
527,"“A domestic worker is a counselor, a doctor, a nurse,” Bolden said in a supplement to The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta Constitution in 1983. “She cares about the family she works for as she cares about her own.”"
528,"And yet, she said, domestic workers “have never been recognized as part of the labor force.”"
529,"Bolden, who commuted on the buses every day, knew that they were safe spaces “where poor women could share grievances and concerns, trade stories of abuse, exchange information about wages and workload and learn about their rights,” Prof. Nadasen, a history professor at Barnard College, wrote in “Household Workers Unite.”"
530,"“To galvanize support, Bolden rode every city bus line and spoke to hundreds of maids,” she wrote."
531,"Bolden was well aware of the role that buses had played in the civil rights movement. In her Voices of Labor interview, she remembered watching television coverage of Rosa Parks after Parks refused to yield her seat on a bus in Montgomery, Ala., in 1955."
532,"“I was telling her to sit there,” Bolden recounted 40 years later in the oral history. “I know she couldn’t hear me, but I said ‘Sit down honey, don’t move.’ ”"
533,"As Bolden deepened her efforts in the civil rights movement, she started receiving threats. She said that men claiming to be members of the Ku Klux Klan called her house and spoke about “whipping my behind,” but in coarser terms."
534,"“I told them any time they wanted to, come on over and grab it,” Bolden said."
535,"“It didn’t scare me, didn’t bother me,” she added. “It made me angry, it made me determined to do what I had to do.”"
536,"Bolden was not the first to advocate for domestic workers, but she helped legitimize and organize them on a scale the country had never seen before, said Ai-jen Poo, the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, an advocacy group that she said works with about 120,000 domestic workers out of the roughly 2 million nationwide"
537,"“The National Domestic Workers Union was the first time there was ever a voice that was powerful in terms of raising standards for the work force and improving wages,” she said."
538,"Bolden’s group pursued national and local legislation, and started job placement and training programs that taught workers how to ask, diplomatically, for vacation time or higher wages."
539,"“You have to teach each maid how to negotiate,” Bolden was quoted as saying in “Household Workers Unite.” “And this is the most important thing — communication. I would tell them it was up to them to communicate.”"
540,"She required that all members of the N.D.W.U.A. register to vote, and in time the group wielded significant power in Atlanta and Georgia state politics."
541,"“Dorothy Bolden and these women emerged as not just a domestic workers union, but they emerged as politically smart and influenced the vote,” Lewis said."
542,"He added of Bolden: “You had to go through her, it didn’t matter if you were black or white, but if you were running for city office, or outside, you had to get her blessing.”"
543,Bolden eventually helped secure higher wages and greater workplace protections for many domestic workers in Atlanta.
544,"She also consulted with Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter during their presidencies. International Domestic Worker’s Day is now recognized on June 16."
545,"According to her family, Dorothy Lee Bolden was born on Oct. 13, 1924, in Atlanta to Georgia Mae (Patterson) and Raymond Bolden, a chauffeur. Her parents divorced when she was young. Her mother was a domestic worker, and Bolden began helping her when she was still little."
546,"At the beginning of her career, Dorothy Bolden earned as little as $7 for working up to 40 hours, some of her daughters said."
547,"Bolden was declared legally blind after a fall when she was young. Doctors told her there was little hope that she would see well again, but in time her eyesight mostly recovered."
548,"She attended Booker T. Washington High School before she became a full-time domestic worker. A short marriage to Frank Smith ended in divorce, and in 1944 she married Abram Thompson, who worked for the Railroad Express Agency, a shipping company. They raised six children together."
549,"Bolden’s group disbanded after she retired in the mid-1990s. She died on July 14, 2005, at 80."
550,"Domestic workers remain largely unprotected in the United States. Poo said that many still face “poverty wages, no safety net, no training, no predictability for hours,” problems that Bolden, and other activists, had inspired her to address."

553,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board voted on Wednesday to raise fares for New York City subway and bus riders in April. But the agency says that higher fares will not solve its deep financial crisis.
554,"The board voted to keep the base fare at $2.75 while eliminating the 5 percent bonus that riders receive when buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard. Commuters who rely on the authority’s sprawling network of trains, buses, bridges and tunnels will also see fare and toll increases of about 4 percent."
555,"On April 21, the price of a weekly MetroCard will rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass will increase to $127, up from $121."
556,The fare increase vote comes as state lawmakers decide whether to approve new revenue streams for the system. Transit leaders say they need billions of dollars to tackle huge budget deficits and to pay for critical repairs.
557,[Update: Subway fare rises on April 21]
558,"The board has approved modest fare increases every two years, but this is the first one since the subway descended into crisis in 2017. Without additional funding, transit leaders say they could be forced to make service cuts."
559,"The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said it was a difficult decision to raise fares, but that fares needed to keep up with inflation."
560,"“I don’t think anyone relishes this vote today, but I think it’s important to keep this agency running,” said Ms. Trottenberg, who also serves on the board."
561,"Still, some subway riders were angry about being asked to pay more to ride a system that is plagued by delays. Cameron L. Mitchell, a library assistant at Columbia University, posted on Twitter: “The M.T.A. expects us to pay more for service that continues to decline? No wonder ridership is down.”"
562,"In addition to a fare increase on the commuter railroads, the tolls on M.T.A. bridges and tunnels will increase on March 31. For E-ZPass users, the toll on most crossings will rise by 36 cents. At the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, where tolls are collected only when entering Staten Island, the E-ZPass toll will rise to $12.24, up from $11.52, and the toll via mail will increase to $19, up from $17."
563,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is pressing for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the transit system. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the authority, has warned that without congestion pricing, the authority might have to raise fares by 30 percent."
564,"The push for congestion pricing got a significant boost on Tuesday when Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm on the idea, announced his support for the proposal. In a joint plan, Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio also called for two new revenue sources for the transit system: a cannabis tax and an internet sales tax."
565,"On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio rode the subway to sell riders on congestion pricing. Cameras captured the mayor, who is known for traveling around the city in a black SUV, handing out fliers at a station in Brooklyn."
566,"“What I would say to drivers is this is what the City of New York needs, this is what all of us need,” the mayor told reporters. “8.6 million people are all in this together. If we don’t fix our subways, our economy is not going to work.”"
567,But a group of Senate Democrats representing Long Island said they had “troubling concerns” about congestion pricing and argued that the plan was too focused on the subway and did not do enough to benefit the Long Island Rail Road.
568,"Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate majority leader, warned that these opposing voices must be heard in the debate regarding transit funding. “I look forward to working with my Long Island delegation to ensure that the needs of Long Island are met,” she said in a statement."
569,"The fare and toll increases are expected to raise about $336 million each year, but only about half of the authority’s $16 billion operating budget comes from fares and tolls. The rest comes from dedicated taxes and state and local subsidies and other revenue."
570,"The board was expected to approve higher fares last month, but it delayed the vote after Mr. Cuomo strongly opposed the increases. Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, had raised the prospect of a separate proposal that would tie fare increases to service improvements."
571,"Another board member, Mitchell Pally, who represents Long Island, made a last-ditch effort to delay the fare increase for commuter railroads until the board could consider Mr. Schwartz’s idea. But the board voted down Mr. Pally’s motion to push back the decision."
572,"New Yorkers who rely on Access-A-Ride, the agency’s troubled paratransit service, wanted to keep the base fare at $2.75 since that is what they pay for their trips. A separate proposal would have increased the base fare for a single-ride MetroCard to $3 while doubling the pay-per-ride bonus to 10 percent."
573,"The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, has made the case that the system has improved markedly over the last year. The on-time rate, which once hovered around 65 percent, rose to 77 percent last month."
574,"The transit agency also recently unveiled the name of the new fare payment system it will introduce in May. The system will be called OMNY, which stands for “One Metro New York.”"
575,"Subway and bus riders will eventually be able to tap a bank card or a smartphone on an electronic reader to enter the system and the MetroCard will be retired. In May, the technology will appear on the subway for the first time on the 4, 5 and 6 lines, from Grand Central Station in Manhattan to Barclays Center in Brooklyn."
576,"If congestion pricing fails in Albany this year, the authority could face difficult choices, from a major fare increase to laying off workers. Even if congestion pricing is approved, it will not provide all the funding the authority says it needs to improve its network of subways, buses and commuter railroads."
577,Mr. Cuomo says congestion pricing could raise $15 billion. But the authority’s next five-year capital plan could cost between $40 billion and $60 billion.
578,"At the same time, critics say the agency has misspent money and failed to rein in soaring costs on projects like East Side Access, a new train station for the Long Island Rail Road under Grand Central Terminal. The cost has ballooned to more than $11 billion."
579,"The authority has a long list of priorities, from improving the bus network to installing more elevators on the subway. At a board meeting on Monday, accessibility advocates raised alarm over reports that the agency might scale back its plans to install elevators at 50 stations in the next five years."
580,"Mr. Byford, the president of New York City Transit, the agency that oversees the subway and buses, pledged to make elevators a top priority."
581,"“This president isn’t wavering,” Mr. Byford said. “My commitment to those 50 stations is rock solid.”"
582,OTTAWA — The driver of a truck pulling two trailers laden with bales of peat moss roared past four warning signs and an oversized stop sign at highway speed just before it was struck by a bus carrying a Saskatchewan hockey team last April.
583,"The collision at an intersection killed 16 people, most of them young players on the Humboldt Broncos, injured 13 and spread sorrow throughout Canada."
584,"But the details of precisely what happened on April 6, 2018, only emerged on Tuesday after Jaskirat Singh Sidhu, the truck driver, pleaded guilty in a Saskatchewan court. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation obtained a copy of a statement of facts negotiated by prosecutors and Mr. Sidhu’s lawyers."
585,"The five page document, based on an exhaustive investigation by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, concluded that Glen Doerksen, the driver of the bus, had tried to avoid an unavoidable collision. The bus skidded nearly 80 feet before striking the truck’s trailers. There were no skid marks from the truck."
586,"“The driver of the bus did not contribute to the collision,” the statement said. “The actions of Mr. Sidhu while operating the semi-tractor unit caused the collision.”"
587,"Mr. Doerksen was among the dead from the crash, which left both vehicles well off the road and showered the intersection with peat moss and debris."
588,"Exactly why Mr. Sidhu did not heed the warning signs and failed to obey a four-foot wide stop sign with a flashing light is unclear. The investigation found that Mr. Sidhu had not been impaired by alcohol and had not been using a phone. The road was dry and clear, and weather did not impair his vision of the intersection."
589,All the statement found was that Mr. Sidhu had “failed to recognize that his vehicle was approaching an intersection and did not heed the stop sign.” The report estimated the truck was traveling at about 60 miles an hour through the intersection.
590,"Mr. Sidhu, who lives in Calgary, Alberta, had only been driving heavy trucks for about two weeks. He had two weeks of prior training."
591,"Outside of the courthouse in Melfort, Saskatchewan, on Tuesday, Mark Brayford, a lawyer, said that when he recently took over Mr. Sidhu’s defense, the driver said that he had wanted to plead guilty."
592,"“I can’t make things any better but I certainly don’t want to make them worse by having a trial,” Mr. Brayford quoted his client as saying. “He wanted the families to know that he’s devastated by the grief that he’s caused them.”"
593,The Broncos had been on a two-hour trip north to a playoff game in the town of Nipawin. The players came from throughout Canada and stayed with Humboldt’s families.
594,"Long bus trips to games had been a regular part of life for the players, who ranged in age from 16 to 21. For many, the Broncos could have been a way to a college athletic scholarship or a pathway to a professional team."
595,"One player still remains hospitalized in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan."
596,"Canadians have left hockey sticks outside their doorways in memory of the dead, who also included team officials. A fund-raising campaign for survivors and victims’ families raised more than $11 million."
597,Mr. Sidhu pleaded guilty to 16 counts of dangerous driving causing death and 13 counts of dangerous driving causing bodily harm. The maximum penalty for the death-related charge is 14 years and 10 years for the injury charges.
598,A sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 28.
599,"“If he spends a day, if he spends 10 years times, that’s irrelevant,” Scott Thomas, the father of Evan Thomas, 18, who was killed in the crash, told reporters outside of the courthouse. “He was guilty, he acknowledged that. That’s all I needed to hear.”"

601,"SAN JOSÉ, Costa Rica — It’s a green big deal for a tiny sliver of a country. Costa Rica, population 5 million, wants to wean itself from fossil fuels by 2050, and the chief evangelist of the idea is a 38-year-old urban planner named Claudia Dobles who also happens to be the first lady."
602,"Every country will have to aspire to something similar, scientists say, if the world is to avert the most dire consequences of global warming. And while Costa Rica’s carbon footprint is tiny compared to other countries, Ms. Dobles has a higher goal in mind: Getting rid of fossil fuels would show the world that a small country can be a leader on an awesome problem and improve the health and well-being of its citizens in the bargain. "
603,"It would, she said, combat a “sense of negativity and chaos” in the face of global warming. “We need to start providing answers.” "
604,"Costa Rica’s green bid, though fraught with challenges, has a head start. Electricity comes largely from renewable sources already — chiefly hydropower, but also wind, solar and geothermal energy. The country has doubled its forest cover in the last 30 years, after decades of deforestation, so that half of its land surface is now covered with trees. That’s a huge carbon sink and a huge draw for tourists. Also, climate change is not a divisive political issue. "
605,"Now, if its decarbonization strategy succeeds, it could provide a road map to others, especially developing countries, showing how democratically elected leaders can grow their economies without relying on polluting sources of energy. But if it doesn’t work, in a country so small and politically stable, it would have equally profound consequences. "
606,"“If we can’t pull it off by 2050, it’s likely no other country can pull it off,” said Francisco Alpízar, an economist at the Tropical Agriculture Research and Higher Education Center in Turrialba, Costa Rica and a climate adviser to the government. “That would be really bad.”"
607,"For Ms. Dobles, the top priority is fixing transportation. It is the largest single source of Costa Rica’s greenhouse gas emissions. The number of cars and motorcycles on the roads is growing fast, according to a survey by a nongovernmental group called State of the Nation. The average car in the country is 17 years old. Congestion is a huge problem; morning traffic in the San José metropolitan area moves at an average of less than 10 miles per hour. Afternoons are worse."
608,"The National Decarbonization Plan, as it’s called, envisions electric passenger and freight trains in service by 2022, which is when Ms. Dobles’s husband, President Carlos Alvarado, finishes his term. Under the plan, nearly a third of all buses would be electric by 2035, dozens of charging stations would be built, and nearly all cars and buses on the roads would be electric by 2050. Unlike many other countries, Costa Rica does not rely on coal to produce its electricity."
609,"Revamping transportation is expensive and so it will require tackling things that have little direct connection to climate change — fixing the country’s fiscal health, for one, to be able to secure big foreign loans to fund such an ambitious project, and lowering unemployment, which is a pressing political demand. It also means addressing the aspirations of its upwardly mobile people."
610,"Stephanie Abarca is one of them. Purse and lunch bag in hand, on her way to work one morning, the 32-year-old Ms. Abarca was 100 percent behind the first lady’s green targets. Of course, Ms. Abarca said, Costa Rica should be a green “pioneer.”"
611,"But she faces more immediate problems. For her, getting to work means waking up at 4 a.m. to shower and dress, ride the bus for an hour, walk a few blocks (or run, if the bus is late), and board a slow-chugging, horn-blaring diesel train for another 20 minutes to finally get to her office. Most weeks, after a nearly two-hour commute each way, she is too exhausted for the 6 p.m. yoga class that her employer offers to relieve stress. By Fridays, she is running on fumes. "
612,"Her goal: She is saving up to buy a secondhand car, a subcompact Suzuki Swift. It would improve her commute, she said, knowing full well that it would also inject more carbon into the atmosphere. “Everybody wants to have a car,” said Ms. Abarca, a manager at a furniture company. “That doesn’t help.”"
613,"After transportation, agriculture and garbage account for the largest share of Costa Rica’s emissions. To curb emissions from landfills, the plan proposes new waste treatment plants, as well as recycling and composting systems, which are now virtually nonexistent. The country’s pineapple and banana growers would have to reduce emissions. So, too, its cattle ranchers, which could mean using less land. Costa Ricans, including the ones in the first family, are fond of meat."
614,"The president laughed when I asked him about going vegan. “I don’t think that will happen,” he said."
615,"How to pay for Costa Rica’s green ambitions remains a question mark. A rough, initial estimate puts the price tag at $6.5 billion in the next 11 years alone, which the government has said will be shared between the private and public sectors. Still, tax collection is poor, powerful industries are tax-exempt, and government debts have soared, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A widening deficit recently prompted ratings agencies to downgrade Costa Rica’s creditworthiness. And a fiscal overhaul that Mr. Alvarado pushed through last year prompted street demonstrations and a crippling monthslong strike by teachers. "
616,"Mr. Alvarado, 39, who wrote a historical novel before he became president last year, is fond of invoking the past. Leaders before him did improbable things too, he pointed out, like abolishing the army in the 1940s. He has called climate change “the greatest task of our generation.” He said he saw no point in waiting for bigger, more powerful countries to act first. By 2050, he pointed out, the couple’s son will be 37, the same age he was when he ran for the presidency."
617,"On the last Sunday of February, on a stage erected behind the Museum of Costa Rican Art, his administration sought to rally the country to the decarbonization plan. Guests filed in. The dress code was tropical casual: florals, linens, Panama hats. Sounds of the rain forest echoed through the space. Performers dressed as animals moved through the crowd. A jaguar slunk along the floor, occasionally rubbing against the pant legs of a politician, a macaw on stilts fussed with a well-dressed woman’s hair, a frog photo-bombed bystanders. "
618,"“Green is the New Black,” read the slogan on the first lady’s T-shirt."
619,"“This is a great transformation we have ahead of us,” the president declared. “We have to conquer it with data, with intelligence, but more than anything, we have to fill ourselves with courage to go forward.” "
620,Not everyone stands to gain.
621,"An industry group that represents bus owners said that if they were to electrify their fleets, as the government insists, they would need money from the government, or higher fares from their passengers, which would very likely create political difficulties for the government."
622,"Car importers want the government to crack down on used cars, which tend to pollute more. The biggest importer, Javier Quirós, said to pay for such an ambitious plan, the country might want to reconsider its ban on oil drilling. And Guillermo Constenla, the head of the largest party in Congress, balked at the idea of raising the gas tax."
623,"There’s another complication. Fewer new cars would mean less money for the government at a time when Costa Rica can least afford it. Taxes associated with fossil fuels, including new cars, account for more than 20 percent of public revenues, according to the Environment and Energy Ministry."
624,"The government is dangling the possibility of a comprehensive tax overhaul, a politically risky venture. Ms. Dobles has suggested higher taxes on gas-guzzling vehicles, also risky. "
625,"Ms. Dobles is certain that habits will change. As a child, she said, she spent an hour to and from school by bus; it’s where she got to know Mr. Alvarado. Most socializing was done at home, occasionally at a shopping mall. Her parents drove her around. “I never got to go outside, basically,” she recalled, except when she went to visit relatives in the countryside. Then she visited Paris, on a college scholarship. It was mind-blowing. She didn’t miss not having a car."
626,"It’s a feeling she wants Costa Ricans to have at home. For that, she said, the vast, sprawling San José metropolitan area needs to be fundamentally redrawn. More apartments, more shops, more sidewalks, more public spaces for people to socialize. And fast, modern, safe public transportation. Ms. Dobles wants her compatriots to see that this is not about emissions alone. “It’s also about quality of life,” she said. "
627,"Of course, if everyone in the world were to decarbonize, that would be a big problem for Costa Rica. Most of the 3 million tourists who came last year flew here, leaving a gigantic carbon footprint in the sky."

653,"Even when there are no subway delays, it takes Amy Sacks at least an hour and 20 minutes to get to work in the Bronx."
654,"The problem is that the subway still leaves her about a mile — and a bus ride away — from her office. “There’s always a transfer unless I use my feet for the second half,” said Ms. Sacks, a writer who lives in Manhattan."
655,"But the key to a shorter, easier commute lies just outside her office door: railroad tracks that run through the Bronx."
656,"The tracks are used by Amtrak trains, but would be opened to new commuter trains under a billion-dollar expansion by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of rail service linking Manhattan with suburbs north of New York City. Four new train stations for the Metro-North Railroad would be built along the line in the eastern Bronx, where subway service is sparse and buses are often slow and unreliable."
657,"The aboveground rails that crisscross the city are increasingly being seen as a way to alleviate some of New York’s most pressing transportation problems. City leaders and transit advocates say commuter trains could be put into service to fill transit gaps and reduce congestion on subways, buses and roads. In neighborhoods where new train stations are built, new jobs, housing and development could follow."
658,"“It leverages important assets that are already there and underutilized rather than having to build anew,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots organization of transit riders. “It saves money and time, and it brings new services online that we might not have access to — or at least not in a generation.”"
659,"There are 38 Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road stations in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, many in neighborhoods with sparse subway and bus service, according to a recent analysis by the city comptroller, Scott M. Stringer. But the comptroller noted that there is limited service at those stations, or tickets are priced so much higher than subway and bus fares that residents cannot afford them."
660,"Mr. Stringer and transit advocates have suggested pricing commuter trains within the city the same as subways — $2.75 for a ride, including free transfers to subways and buses — to encourage more riders."
661,"Transportation authority officials said they have been reviewing these issues and are conducting a pricing study on some Long Island Rail Road trains in Brooklyn and Queens. Since 2004, the price of commuter train trips within the five boroughs has been lowered on weekends through a program called City Ticket, which officials say has contributed to increasing ridership."
662,"Ridership in general on Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road has increased to the highest levels in decades, resulting in overcrowding. But transportation authority officials said projects are underway to significantly expand service, including building a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal with eight new tracks for Long Island Rail Road trains. The authority is also moving to add tracks on Long Island and run more trains across the region."
663,"New York’s rail network has also become part of the debate over congestion pricing, which would charge drivers a fee to enter Manhattan neighborhoods at peak traffic times to raise money primarily for fixing the subways. Both supporters and opponents have called for expanding rail service outside Manhattan to provide an alternative to those who drive because they do not have easy access to subways and buses."
664,"A state panel recently recommended expanding Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road service in transit deserts in the Bronx and Queens. Though that would likely increase the transportation authority’s costs and lengthen commutes for suburban riders who would have to sit through more stops, the report concluded that the idea, while complicated, was worth pursuing."
665,"“The importance of opening up commuter rails has really come to people’s attention,” said Kathryn Wylde, the chairwoman of the panel, who is the president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of top business leaders. “In places where there is no subway service and lousy bus service, they’re watching these nice commuter trains roll right through their neighborhood without stopping. It’s pouring salt in the wounds.”"
666,"In the Bronx, the M.T.A. plans to offer new commuter service by expanding and improving railroad tracks that are owned by Amtrak and run between Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan and New Rochelle in Westchester County. It would build four new stations on Amtrak-owned property in the neighborhoods of Morris Park, Parkchester, Co-op City and Hunts Point."
667,"The authority’s capital plan includes $695 million for the project — roughly half the estimated cost — including $250 million that was provided by Governor Andrew M. Cuomo. The remainder will be covered in the authority’s future capital plans, Aaron Donovan, an authority spokesman, said."
668,"Tom Wright, the president of Regional Plan Association, a transportation research and policy group, said the new commuter line would increase the passenger capacity of the rail network across the New York region, and give all riders — not only those in the Bronx — more transit options if a catastrophe were to cripple subway and suburban commuter train service."
669,"“Right now we’re using the system above capacity, so it doesn’t have any give from those kinds of shocks,” he said."
670,"The line could begin service as early as 2023. But in recent months, the project has stalled as M.T.A. officials have been unable to reach an agreement with Amtrak to use the tracks. Mr. Cuomo has met with Amtrak officials to try to resolve differences, an aide said."
671,"Amtrak has demanded that the transportation authority pay additional money to use the tracks and repair a bridge along the line, Mr. Donovan said. Amtrak faces major financial challenges to upgrade its aging network."
672,"“They’re just trying to milk it,” said Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, whose office has collected more than 5,000 petition signatures urging Amtrak to “get on board.” “Amtrak still thinks we are in the age of the robber barons. They need to stop playing monopoly with the commuters of the city.”"
673,"Jason Abrams, an Amtrak spokesman, said Amtrak and the transportation authority had met frequently in recent months to try to reach agreement on key issues such as design, construction and train operations “to ensure that the proposed expansion of Metro-North service does not adversely impact Amtrak intercity passenger rail operation.”"
674,"He said that Amtrak will significantly expand in 2021, with more high-speed Acela service between New York and Boston, and that the Metro-North project must be integrated with other transportation projects in the city and region."
675,"Still, city officials have forged ahead to lay the groundwork for new streetscapes and developments around the stations in the Bronx, New York’s fastest growing borough with more than 1.4 million residents. Nearly one-third of them live within a mile of one of the proposed four stations, according to city planners."
676,"Israel Nazario, 64, a retired stagehand, said he moved to Parkchester in 2008 partly because he heard that a Metro-North station was coming. He has to walk 10 blocks to the closest subway station. The train station would be about a block away."
677,"“I’ll save my legs because my legs aren’t what they used to be,” he said. “And instead of taking 40 minutes to get downtown, it’ll take me 20 minutes.”"
678,"During a recent community meeting, city planners displayed maps and diagrams showing the Morris Park station as an anchor for a medical and science hub. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to have this level of investment in transportation infrastructure,” said Carol Samol, the Bronx director for the city’s Planning Department."
679,"Ms. Sacks, who lives in Greenwich Village and works at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Morris Park, said direct train service from Penn Station could cut in half her nearly three-hour round-trip commute."
680,"“Besides the time, it’s very stressful because we’re always stopping,” she said. “We’re stuck often, and the trains are crowded and loud.”"

685,"Are New Yorkers having less sex in public? If you frequent New York City parks, you might think so."
686,"The police have given fewer tickets for public sex, according to an article by my colleague J. David Goodman. In 2007, 432 tickets were written for the offense of “sex in park.” In 2018, there were only six."
687,[Read the full article about sex in New York City parks.]
688,Possible explanations:
689,"• The police are writing fewer tickets. As Mr. Goodman writes, “Police officers are also increasingly looking to solve neighborhood problems without resorting to handcuffs or tickets.”"
690,"• Parks have been upgraded, drawing in more crowds and thus reducing opportunities for illicit encounters. Maybe New York has gentrified too much — from a wild, fun-loving mecca to a dull, money-chasing rat maze."
691,"• Smartphones make it easier to record and report from practically anywhere. The technology also helped usher in the “see something, say something” public awareness campaign that started in subways and spread to nearly every other corner of life."
692,"Decades ago, it was more cumbersome to alert the authorities to improper behavior in the desolate nooks of New York. Graffiti writers I knew, for instance, reveled in spray-painting overpasses as motorists passed by, unable to quickly alert the police."
693,"And now, who needs to call? Just put it on the Citizen app."
694,This is not to say public sex has gone away entirely.
695,"Duncan Osborne, an associate editor at Gay City News who has written about the policing of gay sex in city parks, told The Times, “Look, some guys like it,” and “They may see it, in sort of a strange way, as more private.”"
696,"He added, “Your family is not going to come wandering by.”"

699,"The report, from the National Transportation Safety Board, said investigators found no sign of mechanical failure or driver impairment. The probable cause was “unintended acceleration” and the driver’s “inability to brake,” it said."
700,"Before the accident, the driver, Raymond D. Mong, picked up a bus owned by the Dahlia Group in Flushing. Minutes later, recorders detected a rattling sound and swearing as the bus accelerated on Northern Boulevard."

737,It was 1986. I was fresh out of college and newly arrived in Manhattan to pursue my dream of becoming an advertising copywriter on Madison Avenue.
738,"I got an entry-level position at Launey, Hachmann & Harris. The job initially involved mostly answering phones and greeting clients getting off the elevator. It didn’t matter. I was thrilled to be starting my career in New York City."
739,"New York was a little rough around the edges then, but the cost of living was still relatively high. I was three months and six paychecks into the job when I realized there was no way I could make ends meet after rent (only $350!) in a shared Upper East Side apartment, student loan payments, food and other necessities."
740,I’ll never forget summoning the courage to walk into Bob Launey’s office to explain my situation.

746,"What smells like a “nightclub toilet,” evokes the feeling of “an underworld” and resembles a “working museum”?"
747,"That would be the New York City subway, according to international readers who have experienced it."
748,"The subway runs around the clock and carries millions daily across a sprawling network. But when we asked riders of public transit around the world how their systems compare, New York’s scored worse than most on several measures. "
749,[Read New Yorkers’ stories of major subway meltdowns.]
750,"Among the enviable features they described were Moscow’s chandelier-adorned platforms, Istanbul’s plans for a 500-mile expansion and Tokyo’s friendly attendants who locate lost items. "
751,"Below are some of their tales of exceptional public transit. They have been condensed, edited for clarity and paired with photos of their systems and New York’s."
752,What experiences have you had with public transit? Tell us in the comments. 
753,"I’m a senior majoring in Russian studies at Carleton College in Minnesota. When I studied abroad in Moscow last year, my father, a South Bronx native, came to visit. We took the metro many times, and he was shocked."
754,“Where are the rats?” he asked. “I can’t believe how clean it is on these platforms.” 
755,"Many of the stations are works of art. Kievskaya, one of my favorites, has chandeliers and glittering mosaics with scenes from Ukrainian and Russian history. My other favorite station, Dostoevskaya, has murals depicting some of Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s famous works, including “Crime and Punishment.” "
756,"The stations are held to a high standard of cleanliness, and there’s a constant police presence. Hooliganism is a serious crime, and it’s illegal to drink in the metro."
757,"New York impressions: The subway in New York doesn’t follow a schedule in my experience. One time, in the summer of 2017, I waited 40 minutes for a Q train on the way to Brighton Beach. There was construction, but come on, 40 minutes?"
758,— Schuyler Kapnick
759,
760,"I live in Tokyo and rely on three trains — JR and Tokyo Metro lines — to get to my job leading food tours at the Tsukiji fish market. My first train is famous for being packed during the morning commute. But riders are good for the most part about making room for as many people as possible. When things go smoothly, a new train comes on the JR Chuo line every few minutes. If there are ever delays, train stations, social media and TV news are quick to share the information."
761,"Trains are clean, and some cars are reserved for women and children. There are staff at the stations who are helpful and friendly. One time I left my keys on the train, and the staff at my station quickly figured out which train it was and where I could track it down. The keys were turned in and I retrieved them."
762,"Japanese culture respects others before yourself. My train ride is so quiet in the morning that a baby could sleep. There are rules, such as letting people off first, that everyone follows."
763,"New York impressions: I lived in New York for many years, and two things happened to me on the subway. First, I was held up. There were other riders in the car, and no one did anything to help. Second, I was on a train and a man had a gun. Everyone panicked, and people fled to the ends of the train. This doesn’t happen in Tokyo."
764,— Yukari Sakamoto
765,"As an American and former New Yorker, I am keenly aware of the public transit differences between here and New York. In Amsterdam it is a priority, a connecting web of trams, buses, trains and ferries that allows everyone to get around safely and on time. "
766,"I came to Amsterdam in 1989 to work for Radio Netherlands Worldwide and started living here full time seven years later. Now I’m retired, and as a senior on a limited income, I qualify for a free pass on all city transportation. This mobility has opened my life."
767,"When American friends visit, they think our system is like a dream. But it isn’t. It’s the result of decisions made by the city and national governments and supported by the citizenry, who benefit daily and are willing to pay taxes to support it. "
768,"New York impressions: When I moved to Amsterdam after 15 years in New York, I had no idea that transport could actually run on a schedule. All I knew was to schedule extra time. "
769,"I still don’t trust the timetables, mainly because I want to keep some of my New Yorker-ness!"
770,— Ruth Dreier
771,The metro here is known as the world’s longest art gallery.
772,"One card allows you to ride the commuter trains, metro, trams, ferries and buses. There are even driverless vehicles. Transit is safe, punctual and affordable. Between my commute from the suburbs and my work co-directing the Stockholm Fringe Festival, I take three to four transportation modes a day. The system is part of my office. "
773,"For the festival we rely on public transit to get our actors, crew and audience members to each venue. In fact we plan the locations and schedule around the metro lines. In 2012 we had a roaming performance that took place across different stations and trains. It won the Audience Choice Award."

776,"When my husband and I were both working remotely, we thought, “Why not do this from Berlin instead of home?” So we left Austin, Tex., and spent a month there in 2016. We returned last year to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary and my birthday. Berlin is our favorite big city, in large part because of how easy transportation is. "
777,"The U-Bahn was our primary method of transit for everything. Trips on it aren’t particularly memorable, and that’s how it should be. Systems are consistent across platforms and stations. There aren’t obstacles to smooth travel. What’s memorable, though, is the exquisite, ornate tiling in many of the stations. You also don’t validate your ticket when you enter a platform, which I think only works because of German culture."
778,"New York impressions: When I visited New York, the stations were grungier and more rundown than the U-Bahn. But the U-Bahn serves a city with 3.5 million people. It’s harder to maintain and clean a system in a city of 8.5 million. "
779,— Jamie Miller
780,"My family has a foundation that manages a robotics competition in Turkey. My work for it often requires taking public transit to meet with schools, sponsors and teams across Istanbul. When I was looking for an apartment, access to the metro and buses was basically my only criterion. "
781,"The metro is pretty fantastic. The trains can carry a massive number of people. We have mild overcrowding for an hour or two a day, but it’s usually not horrendous. Trains are almost never delayed thanks to good maintenance. My line, the M2, carries about 400,000 people each day without trouble. "
782,The trains have TV screens that play lots of things. My favorites are the cat (and sometimes dog) videos. 
783,"The metro sparkles: Trains and stations are shiny clean. What I like most, though, is how fast it’s expanding. There are plans to go from 105 miles of track to about 680 miles in the next decade or so."
784,"New York impressions: I’ve come to New York for robotics competitions. The subway gets you there. That’s about it. It was slow and broken, with lots of trash and decay. I felt like I was in an underworld."
785,— Alex Francis Burchard
786,
787,"My work addresses urban-planning issues. Before moving to Vancouver, I lived in San Francisco, where I helped take down the Embarcadero Freeway and create the Presidio, a national park. Here, I’m working to remove two old highway viaducts, which will be replaced by a new roadway, parks, housing, bike paths and more."
788,"The SkyTrain, our rapid transit system, has three lines that run through metro Vancouver. It plays a key part in a transportation strategy that makes walking, cycling and transit account for half of all trips in Vancouver. "
789,"The entire system is driverless. I’ve sat in the front seat of a SkyTrain, imagining that I’m the engineer as we race across the Fraser River. "
790,"Automation puts more money into maintenance and expansion. Six new stations opened in 2016. A project that will connect the suburbs to a major hospital has been approved, and an extension to the University of British Columbia is being discussed. "
791,"New York impressions: The subway is a critical public asset with impressive 24-hour service. But it’s antiquated, inefficient and not designed for all ages and abilities."
792,— Michael Alexander
793,
794,"I’m a professor of computer science and use public transit on weekdays to drop off my youngest daughter at school, get to my university, run errands and go to meetings. "
795,"Zurich’s system has many desirable features. Most trams and many bus lines have their own lane, so travel time is more or less predictable. "
796,"The buses, with few exceptions, and many trams have low floors, allowing a stroller, wheelchair or suitcase to be moved easily onboard. Most U-Bahn stations are also accessible."
797,"The timetables are fairly dense on many lines, and the evening and weekend schedules aren’t much thinner. On Friday and Saturday there’s a late-night network. I’ve never felt unsafe in any bus or tram."
798,Public transportation covers every part of the city. I don’t recall walking more than five minutes to a stop. It also has wide social acceptance; I know C.E.O.s who take public transit.
799,"We once had visitors from the United States who left a handbag with money, jewelry and their passports on a bus. It took a phone call to find out when and where to meet the bus, and the driver handed over the bag."
800,New York impressions: The subway is a nice working museum.

802,I go to Northeastern University in Boston and studied in London for six months in 2017. I return every so often to work with a friend there on a business venture. 
803,The Tube was the most amazing thing to happen to me. I could reach practically every spot in London in less than 40 minutes. 
804,"The system is extremely efficient, with frequent trains during the day. For me this is one of the main reasons that London has stayed ahead of many cities that haven’t aged as gracefully."
805,"The trains are extremely long and can fit tons of passengers. Some stops also serve as national rail stations. I could board a train near my apartment and head out almost anywhere in the United Kingdom, from London’s suburbs to Edinburgh."
806,"Transit fares are based on zones. One time I accidentally left the area that my card could access. It was 2:30 a.m., and I was six miles from my apartment. A security guard offered to pay for me and I was home within 30 minutes."
807,"New York impressions: I like that New York’s subway is extensive (more so than Boston’s), but it’s extremely poor quality. It’s closer to London in terms of having many stops in many places, but not close in much else."

811,"Bent on becoming a veterinarian like his grandfather and uncles, Joseph H. Boardman never forgot the epiphany that instead led to his becoming a state and federal transportation official and overseer of the nation’s passenger railroads."
812,"“My dad walked one day with me out of the barn, and we looked at Route 69, which goes by our farm,” he told Railway Age magazine in 2013. “A Greyhound bus went by. There weren’t many people on it, and I thought, That’s kind of a waste of money.”"
813,"But his father explained that “there are a lot of people that need to get around that don’t have a car, that don’t have a way to get around,” Mr. Boardman recalled, “and it got me thinking about that fact and the necessity for connections.”"
814,"He later realized that his hometown, Rome, N.Y., had prospered only because “we had connectivity to the rest of the world” — a canal (the Erie), a railroad, a bus system. And during college, when he worked as a bus driver to make ends meet, he said, “that really started me in transportation.”"
815,"Mr. Boardman, who eventually became the president and chief executive of Amtrak, presiding over increases in ridership and revenue, died on March 7 in Pasco County, Fla., where his family had a vacation home. He was 70 and lived in Rome. His wife, Joanne, said the cause was a stroke."
816,"Although his public agenda was mobility, Mr. Boardman had a track record for longevity. He was the second-longest-serving president of Amtrak, from 2008 to 2016. His years at Amtrak followed a record-breaking term, from 1997 to 2005, as New York State’s transportation commissioner."
817,"“Putting butts in seats,” he once said, “has occupied most of my career.”"
818,"At Amtrak, Mr. Boardman ordered new cars and electric locomotives, introduced digital ticketing and prioritized safety and reliability, particularly for the 300 or so Amtrak stations that provide the only public transportation into their communities."
819,"“Joe Boardman believed in his bones that all Americans should have the ability to choose to travel by train,” Jim Mathews, president of the Rail Passengers Association, said in a statement."
820,"Joseph Houston Boardman was born on Dec. 23, 1948, in Taberg, N.Y., a hamlet in Oneida County. The second of eight children, he was reared on a dairy farm run by his parents, Alfred and Frances (Houston) Boardman."
821,"When he was 17, he enlisted in the Air Force (“I think it was in large part because I didn’t want to do the haying that summer on the farm,” he said) and served in Vietnam."
822,"When he returned home, he applied to Cornell University with the expectation of becoming a veterinarian. He figured that if he did not get into Cornell, he would join the State Police."
823,"He was admitted, but he later decided to switch majors. He earned a bachelor of science degree in agricultural economics from Cornell and a master’s in management science from the State University of New York at Binghamton."
824,"Mr. Boardman married Joanne Rose Griffith in 1975. In addition to her, he is survived by their sons, Joseph Jr. and Philip; their daughter, Emily Beth Craft; four grandchildren; his brothers, James, David and William; and his sisters, Anne Hartman and Kathryn Duell."
825,"After managing the Rome Transit System, Mr. Boardman was named state transportation commissioner by Gov. George E. Pataki. In 2005, he was appointed administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration under President George W. Bush."
826,"During Mr. Boardman’s tenure at Amtrak, ridership grew by more than a million passengers annually in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Trains were added, and new cars were ordered to replace aging fleets."
827,"Mr. Boardman also championed high-speed intercity passenger service and fixing bottlenecks in New York, like the century-old tunnel under the Hudson River and the cramped Pennsylvania Station."
828,"“Everybody wants to be in New York, the financial capital of the world,” he said. “If they’re going to stay there, this has got to get fixed.”"
829,"Mustachioed and plain-spoken, Mr. Boardman was “as imposing as a grizzly bear,” Allan Rutter, a former federal railroad administrator, said in a prepared statement, “but his spirit was Phil Harris in Disney’s ‘Jungle Book’: warm, winsome, cheerful.”"
830,"Like Baloo the bear, the character voiced by Mr. Harris in the animated adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s “The Jungle Book,” Mr. Boardman was patient, a characteristic reflected in his management credo: “You are held accountable for the mistakes you make. There’s no question about it, but if you’re not forgiven for them, how are you going to improve for the future?”"
831,"After he turned 65 and was poised to retire, Mr. Boardman contemplated his own future connectivity."
832,"“I’ve got two grandchildren now,” he said. “One is in North Carolina and one is in New York. I can get to both places on the railroad.”"

839,Few — including Gergel — knew much about him.

841,"Now, despite judicial duties that included the 2017 trial of Dylann Roof, the young white supremacist sentenced to death for massacring nine African-American worshipers at a Charleston church, Gergel has written a book about a largely forgotten racial atrocity that turned a Confederate soldier’s son into an improbable giant of civil rights jurisprudence. (Gergel would not comment on the Roof trial.)"
842,"The book, published Jan. 22 by the Sarah Crichton Books imprint of Farrar, Straus & Giroux, “Unexampled Courage: The Blinding of Sgt. Isaac Woodard and the Awakening of President Harry S. Truman and Judge J. Waties Waring,” reinvestigates an unpunished crime that, in Gergel’s telling, ignited the modern civil rights movement, including Truman’s desegregation of the military and the Supreme Court’s historic ruling overturning school segregation."
843,"“I stumbled across the story and stumbled across Truman’s role,” said Gergel, 64, on a recent visit to New York. “It was a case that not only woke up Waties Waring, it woke up Truman.”"
844,"“There was no one like him,” he said of Waring. “In the South in the 1940s there was a sense that something had to change but no one could figure out how to break the Gordian knot of Jim Crow.”"
845,"What turned a Southern gradualist into a revolutionary? “I started digging,” the judge said. Beyond the book, his quest ended in a 2015 renaming of the Charleston federal courthouse as the J. Waties Waring Judicial Center."
846,[ Read our review of “Unexampled Courage.” ]
847,"The backdrop of the Woodard case was indeed harrowing. On Feb. 12, 1946, Army sergeant Isaac Woodard, 26, discharged with a chest of medals after three years of fighting in the Pacific in a segregated unit, boarded a Greyhound bus from Camp Gordon, in Augusta, Ga., en route to home in Winnsboro, S.C."
848,"There were conflicting accounts of what happened on that bus. Joyous soldiers, black and white, may have been sharing a celebratory bottle of whiskey. Woodard and the driver argued about restroom breaks and Greyhound’s rules requiring a driver to accommodate passengers’s needs."
849,"When the bus stopped in Batesburg, a small town about 30 miles from Columbia, the state capital, the driver summoned the town’s two police officers, Chief Lynwood Shull and his deputy, Elliot Long, and Woodard was ordered off the bus."
850,"Shull admitted using his blackjack on the sergeant. When Woodard wrested it away, Long, gun drawn, ordered him to drop it. Then, by the Gergel book’s account, Shull rained blows on Woodard so ferociously the blackjack broke. Woodard was left sightless, both eyes gouged out, and thrown in jail, igniting a racial fuse that would burn its way across America to Waring, the White House and eventually the Supreme Court."
851,"“It’s more than just an incident, it’s a huge historical moment,” said Patricia Sullivan, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and author of “Lift Every Voice: The NAACP and the Making of the Civil Rights Movement.”"
852,"As a law student at Duke University in the 1970s, Gergel had read of Waring. But passing mention of Woodard escaped him and he didn’t think much of Waring again until, as an intellectual property and personal injury lawyer and outside counsel to the city of Columbia, he was named to the federal bench."
853,"“In my installation talk, I spoke about Judge Waring,” Gergel recalled. “I saw blank looks.”"
854,"He plunged into research, using his inside knowledge of court dockets and evidentiary records. “I understood what I was looking at,” he said. “I knew what to ask for.”"
855,"Waring, he found, was an eighth-generation Charlestonian born in 1880, with ancestry going back to slaveholders and colonists who arrived in the 1600s. He served as an assistant United States Attorney in Charleston, and with the support of the racially demagogic South Carolina Democratic Senator Ellison “Cotton Ed” Smith, was named by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as one of three judges on the district court in 1942."
856,"His first years on the bench were undistinguished. But in 1944, Waring settled a case in favor of a black teacher paid less than white counterparts, astonishing her NAACP lawyer, Thurgood Marshall, later the first African-American Supreme Court justice. In a second equal-pay case, Waring ruled for the black plaintiff, under the prevailing separate-but-equal doctrine."
857,"Woodard, meanwhile, was convicted of drunk and disorderly conduct and settled his $50 fine with his last $44 cash. Doctors pronounced him irretrievably blind, and the government disclaimed responsibility as he had been discharged from the military five hours before his injury."
858,"Outrage built as news of the assault spread through what was then called the Negro press, attuned to anger over the 900,000 black veterans who had fought for democracy abroad and were now demanding it at home. Orson Welles denounced the beating on his national radio show. Joe Louis, Nat King Cole, Cab Calloway, Woody Guthrie and other stars staged a benefit in Harlem where Woodard spoke."
859,"In various archives, including NAACP files, Gergel found overlooked material on the reaction of Truman, who told an aide: “Enough is enough. Dammit, I’m going to do something immediately.” Truman directed the Justice Department and F.B.I. to pursue a criminal civil rights case against Shull. The case fell to Waring, who was skeptical of any federal role in enforcing racial justice and ready to dismiss the charges. But prosecutors were pressed to proceed and the trial began in November 1946."
860,Woodard testified that Shull had driven the handle end of the blackjack into each eye. Shull countered that Woodard had attacked him without provocation and that in self-defense he had struck Woodard a single blow. Medical records never introduced in court but later tracked down by Gergel and shown to a pathologist confirmed Woodard’s account.
861,"The trial took one day. The all-white jury came back in 28 minutes to pronounce Shull not guilty. Waring, deeply troubled by a bungled prosecution, called the sham trial his “baptism of fire.” Later, asked what changed him, Waring told reporters, “While on the bench, I developed a passion for justice.”"
862,"The following year, Waring ruled that the Democratic Party had to open its whites-only primary to black voters. He sent a white farmer to prison for a year for forcing an indebted sharecropper to work without pay, a form of enslavement commonly winked at by Southern courts. He issued orders enforcing black voting rights and with more blacks appearing on juries, desegregated the jury box."
863,"And in 1951, driven to search for a strategy to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 Supreme Court ruling legalizing segregation as long as the races were treated equally, Waring persuaded Marshall, still representing the NAACP, to present “a frontal attack” on segregation in a lawsuit brought on behalf of Harry Briggs, a black gas station attendant in Summerton, S.C., claiming that white children got bus transportation to school while black children did not. Waring was outvoted on a three-judge panel, but his forceful dissent attacking the policy as a violation of the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection of the law, strategically propelled the case into the Supreme Court where it was consolidated with similar cases and decided in 1954 as “Brown v. Board of Education” overturning school segregation."
864,"For his efforts, Waring was menaced by the Ku Klux Klan and threatened with impeachment. A cross was burned in his backyard. He required 24-hour protection."
865,"Waring left South Carolina for New York, dying there in 1968 at 87. Woodard died in the Bronx at 73 in 1992."
866,"Among Waring’s admirers, Gergel writes, was a young African-American minister who had masterminded a bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala. He “will long be remembered,” said the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., “for his minority opinion has now become a majority opinion.”"
867,Our guide to cultural events in New York City for children and teenagers happening this weekend and in the week ahead.
868,"‘ARE YOU ALICE: A NEW WONDERLAND TALE’ at the Tank (March 24, noon and 7 p.m.; March 28-29, 7 p.m.). At one time or another, everyone in the cast of this show can answer yes to the question posed by the title. Presented by Permafrost Theater Collective, in partnership with the Chameleon Fools Theater Troupe, this workshop production features multiple Alices as it explores episodes from Lewis Carroll’s original works and, according to the publicity material, “repurposes” them. Incorporating dance and puppetry, as well as music by Thomas Burns Scully, the staging offers encounters with the Jabberwock, the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, as well as less familiar characters like the Walrus and the Carpenter and the White Knight.thetanknyc.org"
869,"BROADWAY PLAYHOUSE: LYNN AHRENS AND STEPHEN FLAHERTY at Merkin Hall (March 24, 11 a.m.). This series from the Kaufman Music Center is well named. It serves as both a showcase for Broadway hits and as an opportunity for children ages 4 through 11 to play — to participate in theater games, sing songs and even go onstage — as they learn about composers and lyricists and watch an abbreviated musical. The focus this time is the work of Ahrens and Flaherty, the creative team involved in such Broadway shows as “Seussical,” “Once on This Island” and the current “Anastasia.” The pair won’t appear themselves, but young audience members may well leave humming some of the tunes these writers have produced.212-501-3330, kaufmanmusiccenter.org"
870,"FAMILY CONCERT: ‘WHO IS MILES DAVIS?’ at the Rose Theater (March 23, 1 and 3 p.m.). Children may not be familiar with cool jazz, but they know what cool is, and the trumpeter and composer Miles Davis epitomized both. Presented by Jazz at Lincoln Center, this narrated program will introduce them to Davis’s life and music, emphasizing the many influences that helped shape his signature sound. Sean Jones, also a trumpeter, will lead the concert, which will feature a variety of jazz musicians and a special guest: the drummer Jimmy Cobb, 90, a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master who played on several of Davis’s recordings, including the landmark 1959 album “Kind of Blue.”212-721-6500, jazz.org"
871,"INSPIRING WOMEN IN SCIENCE at various branches of the Queens Library (through March 30). Although female scientists have often toiled far from the limelight, the Queens Library is letting them shine this month. Its Inspiring Women in Science initiative offers dozens of family programs that both demonstrate these pioneers’ accomplishments and encourage young participants to pursue their own research. The activities include bingo and trivia games on women’s achievements; My Next Great Big Invention, a workshop that promotes scientific creativity; and the Code for Equality Challenge, in which children and teenagers can learn about computer coding. The library is also offering films, labs, demonstrations and presentations. This week’s speakers are the television meteorologist Stacy-Ann Gooden, the astrophysicist Moiya McTier, the chemistry professor Tirandai Hemraj-Benny (all appearing on Saturday) and the materials science and chemical engineering professor Miriam Rafailovich (Thursday). Locations and a full schedule are on the website.queenslib.org/womeninscience2019"

873,"‘THE MAGIC SCHOOL BUS: LOST IN THE SOLAR SYSTEM’ at the Borough of Manhattan Community College Tribeca Performing Arts Center (March 23, 11 a.m.). Who needs a NASA rocket when you’ve got the Magic School Bus? TheaterWorksUSA, an excellent producer of musicals for young people, has adapted one of the books in Joanna Cole’s series about the intrepid science teacher Ms. Frizzle, her curious students and the bus that is so much more than an ordinary vehicle. In this hourlong show, by Matthew Lee and Marshall Pailet, the class blasts off into outer space, where Ms. Frizzle becomes separated from her pupils. To bring everyone safely home, the kids have to learn to navigate not only the solar system but also the complexities of their own relationships.212-220-1460, tribecapac.org"
874,"‘UNDERNEATH A MAGICAL MOON’ at Flushing Town Hall (March 24, 2:15 p.m.) and the Leon M. Goldstein Performing Arts Center (April 14, 2 p.m.). This musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan” differs from most theatrical stagings. It uses no harnesses and wires to simulate flying, has a cast of only three and updates the action to the present. (Expect hip-hop pirates and mermaids who act like middle school mean girls.) But perhaps the biggest departure is that it tells the entire story from the viewpoint of Wendy Darling. Written by Mike Kenny, with a score by Ivan Stott, this acclaimed British production from the companies Tutti Frutti and York Theater Royal will bring Neverland to Queens on Sunday and to Brooklyn in April. (To encourage reading as well as theatergoing, Flushing Town Hall will offer discounted tickets to anyone arriving at the box office with a “Peter Pan” book.) 718-463-7700, ext. 222; flushingtownhall.org718-368-5596, onstageatkingsborough.org"
875,"‘WHAT’S SO FUNNY ABOUT MATH?’ at the National Museum of Mathematics (through March 31). You could call this statement an axiom: For many young people, algebra, geometry and trigonometry do not add up to laughs. But those students may change their minds — or at least chuckle — if they go to this exhibition of math-related cartoons, which even offers visitors a contest: Write the best caption for a sketch that’s lacking one. Curated by Bob Mankoff, the cartoon and humor editor at Esquire (and the former cartoon editor at The New Yorker), the show consists of 20 witty examples by illustrators like Dana Fradon, Roz Chast, Pat Byrnes, Nate Fakes, Dan Reynolds and Mankoff himself. In addition to their comical musings, the display includes a comment on each cartoon by a mathematician, scientist or other expert. (One wryly points out an error in the artist’s math.) Perhaps because I’m a word nerd, my favorite exhibit was Nick Kim’s drawing of alienlike beings, their bodies inscribed with mathematical formulas, bowing before one another and uttering polite phrases like “After you.” The caption? “Deferential equations.” 212-542-0566, momath.org"

877,It’s Tuesday. 
878,Weather: Bundle up. Temperatures start in the low 20s and by the afternoon will warm all the way up to the low 30s.
879,Alternate-side parking: Suspended through Ash Wednesday.
880,"The outlook for New York City yesterday went from, in the words of Bob Dylan, “give me shelter from the storm” to “an uneventful morn.”"
881,And yet the city’s public schools — the nation’s largest system — were closed for a snow day.
882,How did that happen?
883,Why did Mayor de Blasio call a snow day?
884,"Timing. He had to make a decision Sunday evening, when the forecast looked ominous. The weather changed overnight, but by that point, it was too late to adjust the plan."
885,"The call to close schools is made early, “with as much time as possible for parents to plan,” the mayor’s spokesman said. Then there are all the school buses to think about."
886,"As my colleagues Eliza Shapiro and Michael Gold wrote, buses leave depots before dawn and could interfere with the nearly 1,600 snow plows combing the streets."
887,How many snow days have there been in New York City?
888,"Seven since 2014, compared with 11 from 1978 to 2013, according to The City’s Alyssa Katz."
889,What happened with recent storms?
890,"• On Nov. 16, a sudden rush-hour storm took local officials by surprise, and thousands of commuters were delayed and stranded. Some students were stuck on a bus for 10 hours."
891,"• Then on Jan. 18, motorists were advised to stay off the road. It turned out to be not so bad."
892,"Did everyone get the forecast wrong, or did the weather change?"
893,"“Temperatures were just not as cold as predicted, so it didn’t allow for as much accumulation,” said John Murray, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “It was a challenging forecast, with uncertainty at play, and a few inches can make a dramatic difference.”"
894,Who else can tell you about the weather?
895,"Practically everyone gets their information from the National Weather Service. Its website is detailed and maybe not ideal for people who just want to know if they need an umbrella or scarf. For that, there are some very good newsletters (I can think of a few)."
896,"If you want a little more information, there is an array of weather apps."
897,"Liz Robbins, a former Times colleague and weather enthusiast, told me about some she uses: AccuWeather is easy to use; Dark Sky is precise and good for knowing when to grab an umbrella; and Weather Underground (clever name!) has helpful charts, graphs and radar maps."
898,"The takeaway: By the time the brunt of a storm arrives, it’s too late to figure out how to respond. Mayors often need to make decisions hours earlier, when many of the factors may be, literally, up in the air."
899,And now ... 
900,"Over to you, Diane."
901,"• Historic: Meet Lora Panepinto, one of the first girls in New York City to be officially welcomed into the club that for more than a century had been called the Boy Scouts."

903,"• Washington: Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, is seeking information about President Trump."
904,"• Crime: The police are investigating the death of a 27-year-old Uber driver, who was fatally stabbed in the Bronx on Saturday."

916,
917,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
918,The New York Times has rules about puns.
919,"“The successful pun pivots on a word that fits effortlessly into two contexts,” it says in The Times’s Manual of Style and Usage, commonly called the stylebook. “A pun should be a surprise encounter, evoking a sly smile rather than a groan.”"
920,"And, of course, use it sparingly, as “a trace element rather than a staple.”"
921,"“That’s well said,” Fred Firestone told me."
922,"Mr. Firestone is the host of Punderdome, a competitive pun-making contest."
923,"How Punderdome works: Contestants have about a minute to come up with as many puns about a broad topic as possible. Then they read their puns to the audience, whose reaction is calculated by a very official “human clap-o-meter.”"
924,Whoever emerges victorious squares off with a winner from a previous contest.
925,"The main rules: no hate, no hurt feelings and encouragement for all."
926,"So, what does Mr. Firestone think of the stylebook’s entry on puns?"
927,"To my surprise, he not only liked it, but said that was what he was attempting to emulate."
928,"“The conventional wisdom is ‘a pun is an eyeroll.’ What we try to do is set up a situation where it is really a side-split,” he said. “We don’t want people rolling their eyes, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ because I don’t think we’d get people coming back.”"
929,"And come back they have. Tonight’s show, at 7 p.m., at Littlefield in Brooklyn, is the 95th Punderdome to take place in New York City, Mr. Firestone said."
930,"Part of Punderdome’s success is its lax rules about what exactly a pun is. “We define it very broadly,” Mr. Firestone said."
931,"Audience members, who applaud or groan at the wordplay, “may not have a particularly correct definition of puns.”"
932,It’s Tuesday — have fun with words.
933,Dear Diary:
934,"I was coming out of the subway elevator with my son in his stroller, when I saw a rat on the platform barely two feet away."
935,"A rat is one of the few things that can truly unnerve me. So there I stood, clinging to the stroller and weighing my options."
936,"A man standing nearby was watching in amusement. He chuckled, smoothed his black mustache, approached the rat calmly and watched it for several seconds."
937,"Then, with a small, graceful jeté of his left black boot, he sent the rat sailing off the platform, through the air and onto the tracks, where it landed safely."
938,"The man looked down, smiled and shrugged. Then he turned toward me, took a small bow, turned again and walked away."
939,I hurried to squeeze onto the uptown express.

944,"So 2019 starts with whiplash. On Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that the L train was not completely shutting down for repairs after all. "
945,"Wait, what? "
946,"Despite nearly three years of hand-wringing, community meetings and general upheaval to prepare for the so-called L-pocalypse, the governor announced a new plan that would avoid requiring a full closing. "
947,"The backlash was immediate, the confusion compounding. And then on Friday, Governor Cuomo swerved slightly again, telling reporters that he actually needs the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board’s approval, which he said on Thursday that he did not need. He called an emergency meeting of the board."
948,"In the original plan, a 15-month shutdown was deemed necessary to repair corroded cables in the tunnels spanning the East River that were damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. "
949,"Instead, the governor said, they would be fixed with a new technology not yet used in the United States, with the work taking place only on nights and weekends. "
950,"In one hour on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo upended years of planning and hundreds of thousands of lives. It may be for the better. But will it even work? Why did he wait so long to do this? On the second day of L-Gate, more questions arose. We will answer them here as soon as we can. "
951,"Here’s what we do we know about what this means for Brooklynites, East Villagers and the rest of the city:"
952,"Maybe. The date of the authority’s board meeting has not yet been set. Generally, according to The Times’s transit reporter, Emma Fitzsimmons, the board goes along with what the authority has decided. But there are representatives of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office on the board, and the mayor expressed skepticism on Thursday. "
953,"The Times’s Albany reporter, Jesse McKinley, posted on Twitter what the governor told reporters on a conference call Friday morning: “If they decide to, great … if not … but make a decision.” @NYGovCuomo says. “It’s up to the M.T.A. board.”"
954,"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will keep both tunnels open during weekdays for full L train service and do its work on nights and weekends, shutting down only one tube at a time. "
955,"Trains will run in both directions, but that will result in long waits between trains — up to 15 and 20 minutes — during repair times. The authority still plans on running more G, M and 7 trains to handle passengers who are rerouted during the repairs. "
956,"If the board approves, the work would probably start at the end of April, which was when the shutdown was supposed to begin. "
957,Transit officials said it could take 15 to 20 months. The previously planned shutdown was supposed to take 15 months. The governor stopped short of guaranteeing that it would not go beyond 20 months. 
958,"“It’s a silly question, ‘am I going to promise on a construction project?’” he said."
959,"L-train riders who work nights and weekends, or those who play on nights and weekends. "
960,"A luxury ride share company that started just for the shutdown, The New L, said it would keep its wait list open, just in case the new plans didn’t work, and there was still a need for the $155-a-month service."
961,"Construction and congestion on side streets in the East Village could be abated, sparing neighbors fumes from supplemental buses and asbestos in the debris removed from the tunnel. "
962,"Andy Byford, who oversees New York City’s subways and buses, said there would likely not be a high-occupancy vehicle lane over the Williamsburg Bridge, as had been planned. Additional ferry service from Brooklyn to Manhattan will also not be needed. "
963,No decision has been made regarding shutting down 14th Street in Manhattan for bus service. 
964,"On Friday, the City Department of Transportation said a new two-way protected bike lane along Delancey Street that was recently opened at the foot of the Williamsburg Bridge on the Lower East Side will stay. The city is still reviewing other planned bike and bus lane changes. "
965,"In December, the governor asked experts from Cornell University's College of Engineering and Columbia University's Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science to suggest alternatives to a shutdown. "
966,"Their solution was to abandon the old electrical cables now embedded in a cement bench wall that runs along the base of the tunnel; construct a new racking system on the sides of the tunnel, and hang new cables wrapped in fireproof material; and then fortify the bench wall with fiberglass polymer. "
967,Sit tight. Kind of like waiting for a late-night L train.
968,"RIGA — Latvia's government has suspended Riga mayor Nils Usakovs, who is also the opposition's main candidate in next month's European Parliament elections, on suspicion of misusing more than $20 million of public funds."
969,"Usakovs, the leader of the pro-Russian Harmony party, denied any wrongdoing and said he would appeal."
970,"""This is absolutely a pure, clear political decision,"" Usakovs told reporters. "
971,"The Environmental Protection Ministry, which oversees Latvia's local authorities, said that, as mayor, Usakovs had failed in his duty ensure public funds were properly spent, including 18.4 million euros ($20.66 million) related to the municipality's public transport authority. "
972,"""The decision is about good governance in the public sector,"" Environmental Protection Minister Juris Puce told reporters."
973,"In December last year, Latvia's anti-corruption agency, KNAB, detained seven people on suspicion of corruption at Riga's traffic authority over the purchase of new trams, trolleybuses and buses. "
974,"At the end of January, KNAB agents also searched Usakovs' office and home in connection with the procurement deal."
975,Usakovs told reporters on Friday he had not been notified by KNAB that he was suspected of any crime.
976,"Usakovs is the first mayor of Riga of Russian descent. He has tried to rebrand Harmony as a Western-style Social Democratic Party, toning down the links to Russia and focusing on issues as education and social inequality."
977,It severed its official cooperation agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia Party in 2017.

979,"In our series My Detox, T asks creative people to share the homemade recipes they count on to cleanse and refresh."
980,"Some say exercise is the best way to beat jet lag. Eve Persak embraces that mantra. A triathlete, nutritionist and frequent flier, Persak typically clears customs and heads straight for the water — be it Hulopoe Bay when she’s in Maui or the Atlantic Ocean when she’s in Turks and Caicos — to swim. On her first trip to London, she explored the city almost entirely by jogging through the streets. “A friend suggested I take a tour bus,” she recalls, “I was like, ‘A bus?’ I like using my legs.” These days Persak travels quite a bit; since 2017, she has overseen the nutrition and wellness-related programs for the Como hotel group’s 15 destinations — the latest of which will open in Tuscany this spring. From her home base in Penestanan, in central Bali, she travels between the Como properties to advise on menus, offer nutritional counseling to guests and private clients, lead culinary-focused retreats and help shape SuperNature, Como’s gourmet organic grocery line (sold in its Dempsey Marketplace in Singapore). “Food can be therapeutic,” she says to explain the philosophy that guides each of her projects. “I really focus on ingredients that are minimally touched and respectful of the environment, and do something in the body.”"
981,"[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]"
982,"When cooking for herself, Persak, who grew up in Chicago, keeps it simple out of necessity. “In Bali, I have fewer cooking utensils and appliances — you need to be very resourceful,” she says. Her house is in a small village outside of Ubud, on a secluded path lined with frangipani, hibiscus and heliconia. Sometimes the electricity goes out, and, she says with a shrug, “there’s no one to call to fix it — you just have to wait for it to go back on.” Persak often rides her motorbike to the local markets, where she stocks up on fresh produce, which she likes to purée to create vibrant, vitamin-rich soups. Her current favorite is a warm evergreen soup, made from healing bone broth and fiber-packed cruciferous vegetables — such as broccoli, cauliflower and kale — garnished with grated, anti-inflammatory turmeric. Sometimes she will stir in miso paste for a dose of probiotics (“when I’m feeling I need some digestive settling”), or if her body demands more energy, she will add sliced avocado and a handful of pumpkin seeds (for “a bit of a crunch and extra zinc for immunity”)."

1066,"A social justice center in Tennessee with deep connections to the civil rights movement said that a fire that engulfed its main office last week may have been intentionally set, after a “symbol connected to the white power movement” was found spray-painted in the parking lot."
1067,"The organization, the Highlander Research and Education Center, which trained Rosa Parks and hosted the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., said it had lost decades of documents and artifacts in the fire at its campus in New Market, Tenn., outside Knoxville."
1068,"“Because of our history we are not surprised that this space, one where marginalized people working across sectors, geographies and identities show up consistently, has been repeatedly targeted over our 87 years of existence,” Highlander said in a statement this week acknowledging the white power symbol."
1069,The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and the Tennessee State Fire Marshal’s Office were investigating.
1070,A spokesman for the fire marshal’s office said on Wednesday that investigators had not determined the cause of the fire. The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
1071,"Sheriff Jeff Coffey told The Knoxville News Sentinel that the authorities had found graffiti at the scene that looked like a hashtag. The paper published a photo of the graffiti, which the Anti-Defamation League identified as a symbol that originated with the Iron Guard, a fascist movement in Romania in the 1930s and ’40s. It was unclear when the symbol was painted."
1072,"Mark Pitcavage, who studies hate symbols for the Anti-Defamation League, said the symbol was relatively obscure, but had been resurrected by some right-wing extremist groups. Most recently, he said, the man accused of killing 50 people last month at mosques in New Zealand had the symbol painted on one of his guns."
1073,"The United States has seen a rise in the number of hate crimes and hate groups in recent years, including a marked jump in the number of white nationalist groups. Most hate groups in the United States espouse some form of white supremacist ideology, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center."
1074,"The uptick has left many on edge, including people at the Highlander center, which said, “Now is not the time to dismiss how scary things are.” Since 2016, the center said, “the white power movement has become more visible, and we’ve seen that manifest in various ways, both subtle and overt.”"
1075,"The center, which was founded as the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn., in 1932, originally focused on organizing unemployed and working people and brought union organizers together for interracial workshops. But it soon became an incubator for the civil rights movement."
1076,"In the 1950s, it developed a literacy program that taught thousands of black people to read and write in an effort to help them register to vote."
1077,"In 1955, Ms. Parks attended a civil rights workshop at Highlander, just a few months before she refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking the Montgomery bus boycott in protest of segregated seating. In 1957, with Ms. Parks in attendance, Dr. King gave closing remarks at a conference marking the Highlander school’s 25th anniversary."
1078,"The unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement, “We Shall Overcome,” also has ties to the Highlander center. The school’s music director learned an original version of the song from tobacco workers and taught it to Pete Seeger, whose adaptation spread around the country."
1079,"The school’s policies, theories and association with high-profile civil rights figures often drew the attention of the authorities. It was investigated for Communist ties in the late 1950s and later shut down in 1961 by the state of Tennessee for holding integrated classes, among other complaints."
1080,"The school reopened the next day as the Highlander Research and Education Center, according to the center’s website. It has been at its current campus in New Market since 1972."
1081,"The Wisconsin Historical Society, which maintains the center’s archives, including audio recordings and photographs, said that a majority of its records were safe in Wisconsin."
1082,"But the staff at the Highlander center said the “devastating” fire had destroyed “decades of historic documents, speeches, artifacts and memorabilia from movements of all kinds, including the civil rights movement.”"
1083,"Despite the fire, the Highlander center vowed to continue to be a “sacred place” for marginalized groups."
1084,"“This is a time for building our power,” the statement said. “Now is the time to be vigilant. To love each other and support each other and to keep each other safe in turbulent times.”"
1085,MEXICO CITY — President Trump’s State of the Union speech hit hard on a topic that has dominated his term in office: defending the border with Mexico against what he described as migrants in “large organized caravans.”
1086,He also suggested that the Mexican authorities were encouraging the migrants to cross the border illegally.
1087,"“We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection,” Mr. Trump said in his speech Tuesday night."
1088,"Some aspects of Mr. Trump’s assertions are true but others are unsubstantiated or distorted. There is no evidence, for example, that the Mexican authorities are sending migrants to weak points along the border."
1089,"Migrants have said they have banded together in large groups, called caravans, because such groups help keep them safe from robberies and other dangers along the trek north through Mexico. But their size has drawn the president’s anger and made them one of his frequent targets."
1090,"As the migrants from Central America have moved north through Mexico, city and state governments have sometimes provided transport with help from churches and local aid groups."
1091,"Some small-town mayors opt to do this because they have limited resources, and it is easier to arrange transport than to house and feed several thousand people at a time. Some state governments provided this type of aid along parts of the route migrants traveled last October and November on their way to Tijuana, a busy border crossing station with the United States."
1092,"The stated purpose of the action is humanitarian, and women and children are given priority when space is short."
1093,"Mr. Trump was most likely referring to recent action taken by the state government of Coahuila, across the border from Texas. On Monday, Coahuila officials, with help from local businesses, provided buses for 1,700 members of a migrant caravan that left Honduras on Jan. 14."
1094,"The state government posted on Twitter photos of Coahuila Gov. Miguel Riquelme meeting with migrants the night before their journey and then visiting a temporary shelter set up to receive the migrants in Piedras Negras, just across the border from Eagle Pass, Texas."
1095,"The migrants were driven five hours from Arteaga, in southern Coahuila, to Piedras Negras, which has a population of more than 150,000 and does not fit the definition of a remote unprotected border area."
1096,"There is no indication that the transport provided by cities or states is deliberately targeted at areas lacking border protection. On the contrary, the Mexican authorities prefer to help migrants reach border cities with adequate shelter space."
1097,Mexico’s federal government is not providing transport of any sort to migrants.
1098,"In a statement on Tuesday, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, Mr. Trump’s homeland security secretary, said that the government was prepared for the caravan’s arrival."
1099,"“Illegal entry will not be tolerated, and we stand ready to prevent it,” she said. “The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has been working with the departments of State, Defense and Justice to ensure all possible resources are available to address this lawless caravan.”"
1100,Most of the migrants have said that they hope to apply for asylum in the United States through legal routes.

1102,"Los Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than 12 miles an hour. In San Francisco, car speeds have fallen to 10 miles per hour. And Seattle’s streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogether."
1103,"Major cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them. But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan, the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy — even though it was once considered politically toxic, according to municipal officials and transportation analysts."
1104,"“New York’s use of congestion pricing could be a game-changer,” said Travis Brouwer, an assistant transportation director in Oregon, which has considered congestion pricing for traffic-jammed Portland."
1105,"“If New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance, it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricing.”"
1106,"New York, the country’s largest city, will charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars. The tolls are expected to start in 2021."
1107,"Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time, closely watching New York’s move, “to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability and mobility,” said Kelly Cofrancisco, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney."
1108,"Los Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing, and Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in 2021."
1109,"“It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say ‘They’re doing this and it’s working,’” said Michael Manville, an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California, Los Angeles, who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing. “At the very least, it changes the conversation in other cities.”"
1110,"Not everyone is ready to sign up. Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit, where “driving isn’t a choice, it’s a necessity.”"
1111,"A handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place; it has helped clear roads in London, Stockholm and Singapore. But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poor."
1112,"Fueled by an economic boom, a revival of urban areas, a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon, the average speed in urban downtowns fell to 15 miles per hour last year, down from 18 miles per hour in 2015, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics company."
1113,"“I believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities,” said Phil Washington, the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “Here in Los Angeles, our congestion challenges are just as bad, if not worse, than Manhattan’s.”"
1114,"He added, “We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worse.”"
1115,"In New York, many details of a congestion pricing plan — including how much drivers will be charged — are still being worked out. The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started 18 months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business, civic and labor leaders, who saw no other way to tackle gridlock."
1116,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward, making it a centerpiece of the $175 billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled. Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor, threw his support behind it. They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the city’s crumbling subway system."
1117,"And city transit officials, facing a growing financial crisis, warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increases."
1118,"Congestion pricing’s moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country. Historically, cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones — only to find that those, too, became jammed, said Matthew Turner, an economics professor at Brown University."
1119,"As a result, America’s roads are carrying more traffic than ever. The number of people driving to work climbed to about 130 million in 2017, up from 121 million in 2012, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Of those, more than 116 million drove alone, and only 14 million car-pooled. Just 8 million workers took public transportation."
1120,"The increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health, safety and environmental implications. The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high."
1121,"Traffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities: The boom leads to an influx of new residents, businesses and construction. More than two dozen major American cities, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, have more congestion now than a decade ago, according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIX."
1122,"The most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of 97 hours last year, up from 82 hours in 2015. That, in turn, cost the economy roughly $87 billion in lost productivity last year, up from $74 billion in 2015, according to INRIX."
1123,"“It only takes one car that doesn’t get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic,” said Trevor Reed, an INRIX transportation analyst."
1124,"In Seattle, Amazon’s relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub. Now, major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlock."
1125,"“As we build a city of the future, we must reduce our reliance on cars,” Ms. Durkan said. “My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars, a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollution.”"
1126,"Road pricing has been used on some American highways since the 1990s, with tolled express lanes — or so-called Lexus lanes — built alongside regular lanes, offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for it."
1127,"Cities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets. “There’s a critical mass forming where people are saying, ‘enough is enough,’” said Stuart Cohen, the founding director of TransForm, a California-based group that released a recent report on congestion pricing. “They’ve tried everything else and nothing’s working.”"
1128,"Still, Charles Komanoff, a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan, said the idea of “putting a price on driving” clashes with America’s car-loving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom. He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to “shooting a rocket to the moon.” “There’s so much gravity — the forces opposing this are so powerful — it almost seems like defying nature,” he said."
1129,"Oregon looked at congestion pricing in 2005, but “our traffic wasn’t that bad, so people weren’t willing to pay a toll to escape it,” Mr. Brouwer said. But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices. State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the state’s first highway tolls on a seven-mile stretch through Portland."
1130,"Congestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs, and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transit."
1131,"“Social equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing,” Mr. Cohen said. “In West Coast cities, equity is very high on the political agenda.”"
1132,"But Mr. Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on. Congestion fees, he added, can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished drivers."
1133,"In Los Angeles, public buses traveled at an average of 11.8 miles per hour last year, down from 12.2 miles per hour in 2013, according to transit data. Mr. Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride free."
1134,A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing “because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of life.”
1135,"Still, congestion pricing remains a tough sell. After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging $5 to drive in some neighborhoods, Boston’s mayor’s office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricing."
1136,"In New York, drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below 60th Street, where the average speed for vehicles is down to 4.7 miles per hour, from 6.9 miles per hour in 1994."
1137,"John Corlett, a lobbyist for AAA in New York, said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls. “To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope,” he said."
1138,"But Sam Schwartz, an architect of the city’s congestion pricing plan, said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New York’s progress. “If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere,” he said."
1139,"San Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown, including expanded bus and rail service, installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes, said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which is leading the city’s congestion pricing effort."
1140,"“Everyone agrees there’s a problem,” Ms. Chang said. “There are multiple views of the solution. But frankly, we’ve tried a lot of them and they’re not enough.”"
1141,"New York City is starkly different today than it was 50 years ago. It is politically more liberal, and far more racially diverse. Yet one aspect has barely changed: The city’s public schools remain among the most segregated in the nation. "
1142,"The deep racial divide was highlighted last week, when eighth graders who had taken the specialized high school admission test received offers to attend New York’s highly selective public high schools. The statistics were striking: out of 895 slots in Stuyvesant High School’s freshman class, only seven were offered to black students. "
1143,"Racial and socio-economic segregation is even more pronounced in some parts of the city now than it was a five decades ago, though research released in the intervening years has shown that integration benefits all children."
1144,How did we get here? Why have schools remained so segregated for so long? And what can the city’s leaders do to change a fifty-year status quo?
1145,"On the morning of Feb. 2, 1964, students hunched over signs they would hoist the following day at a massive school boycott by hundreds of thousands of parents and children. They filled in bubble letters that spelled out “Fight Jim Crow, Boycott Schools,” and “Integration Means Better Schools for All.”"
1146,"The boycott was led by local civil rights activists frustrated with the city’s fitful efforts to integrate schools, a decade after the Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education rendered school segregation unconstitutional. "
1147,"Then, as now, the strongest supporters of integration believed the city’s efforts hewed too closely to a separate-but-equal ideology that the Supreme Court had struck down."
1148,"Backers of integration pushed not only against the mostly white families who staunchly opposed using transportation to achieve integration, but also against moderates who warned of what might happen if activists pushed families too far."
1149,"“The big city school systems face the threat of a serious split,” a Times reporter observed in early 1964. “Not between integrationists and segregationists but between civil rights leaders who are asking for total and instant integration of the schools and those who have long been working for a combination of school improvement and integration but are afraid that extreme and impractical steps may destroy the school system.”"
1150,That divide is felt at the highest levels of city government today. 
1151,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has urged patience and caution regarding integration, and argued that his administration’s power is limited: it could not, he said, “put forward a plan that says we’re going to instantly wipe away 400 years of American history.” Rather than creating a citywide integration plan, he has boosted funding for schools with low-income students. "
1152,"But Mr. de Blasio’s schools chancellor, Richard A. Carranza, has vowed to tackle segregation, which he frequently refers to as “the elephant in the room” — despite the fact his boss has long avoided using the words “segregation” or “integration.”"
1153,"“Sixty-four years ago the question of diversifying schools, integrating schools, was definitively settled by the United States Supreme Court in Brown vs. Board of Education,” Mr. Carranza said in a speech last year. "
1154,"“The question I have for all of us tonight is, 64 years later, what do we, the collective we, have to show for that? I will tell you that in communities across America, the answer is, not much.”"
1155,“We’ve got troubles of our own / So why not keep us close to home?
1156,"“Please, oh, please, leave us alone / Stop zoning, zoning, zoning.”"
1157,"In 1964, the backlash against integration arrived quickly. About a month after the February boycott, thousands of white parents — largely mothers — marched across the Brooklyn Bridge in slushy snow. They sang and chanted in unison against busing their children to schools outside their racially-segregated neighborhoods. "
1158,"Many of those parents said they were supportive of integration, but argued that busing was too extreme a solution. “Education — Yes. Integration — Yes. Transportation — No,” read one sign."
1159,"“Parents simply won’t stand to have their children shuttled around from school to school to please some extremists,” said Rosemary R. Gunning, a leader of the antibusing Parents and Taxpayers group, in 1964. "
1160,"“Few would have believed that we could see New Yorkers shamelessly parading for segregation,” Rev. Milton A. Galamison, who championed desegregation, said at the time about the march."
1161,"Last summer, Mr. de Blasio ruled out using busing to achieve integration. But even small-scale integration efforts in middle class neighborhoods have sparked enormous resistance from mostly white parents, who have objected to sending their children to schools even a few city blocks away from their zoned school."
1162,"In 2016, a proposal to send some Upper West Side children — who were zoned for a high-performing, mostly white, wealthy elementary school near their homes — to a lower-performing school, attended mostly by low-income black and Hispanic students, about a ten-minute walk away, was met with vitriol."
1163,A version of the plan — which ultimately impacted a relatively small number of schools — eventually passed after years of negotiations.
1164,But the recent push for integration has been led in part by liberal white parents. 
1165,"Some of these parents helped force the most comprehensive local desegregation policy yet: the elimination of screened middle schools in Brooklyn’s District 15, which includes upper-middle-class neighborhoods like Park Slope. Some parents there have said the election of President Trump prompted them to combat segregation in their children’s schools."
1166,"Still the District 15 plan, which was approved by Mr. de Blasio last fall, was modest compared to the integration blueprint unveiled in the spring of 1964 by the then-Board of Education. "
1167,"As many as 40,000 students would have been transferred to different schools through a combination of school rezoning and a pairing up of mostly white and mostly black schools. Students would then have been bussed to integrate the schools."
1168,"“The time for action is now,” declared then-schools superintendent Calvin E. Gross when he released the plan."
1169,"In 1965, a member of Parents and Taxpayers had a prescient message: “I think we could say that it looks like it’s going to be an argumentative year.” "
1170,"The prediction was correct; the Board of Education’s desegregation plan mostly fell apart over the next few years, as opposition mounted."
1171,"As the 1970s began, the debate that would set the stage for New York’s current integration fight was brewing at the State Capitol in Albany."
1172,"In the spring of 1971, lawmakers were crafting a bill that would codify the entrance exam as the sole means of admission into the specialized schools. "
1173,"And they were in a hurry: After critics said the exam was “culturally biased” and discriminatory against black and Hispanic students, the city schools superintendent at the time signaled a willingness to re-evaluate how students were being admitted into the schools."
1174,"That year, about 10 percent of the students who attended Stuyvesant, the most selective of the schools, were black. (Last year, one percent of Stuyvesant’s freshman class was black; this year, the number is even lower.) "
1175,"But before the Board of Education could study the issue in 1971, parents sprung into action. One group from the Bronx High School of Science released a flyer asserting that the specialized schools, “could be saved only if, once and for all, it is established that there can be no tampering with the standards of merit and achievement that have been the basis for admission.”"
1176,"The brief but spirited fight culminated in May 1971, when members of the New York State Assembly shouted each other down, lobbing accusations of racism and bias, before ultimately approving the bill. For the nearly fifty years since, students have to ace the entrance exam to win a seat at a specialized school. "
1177,"“Where are all the liberals who are always protecting blacks and Puerto Ricans? I don’t see them today,” said Louis Nine, a Democrat from the Bronx who opposed the bill, at the time. "
1178,"Mr. Nine’s Democratic colleague from the Bronx, Seymour Posner, insisted that the measure would protect “the opportunity for a bright kid, even if he’s not rich, to go to an exceptional high school.”"
1179,"In the 1970s, the specialized schools were overwhelmingly white. Today, they are mostly attended by Asian-Americans, many of whom are low-income immigrants."
1180,"In 2018, when Mr. de Blasio proposed a plan that would discard the exam and overturn the law, known as the Hecht-Calandra Act, he called the paltry numbers of black and Hispanic students in the specialized high schools “a monumental injustice.”"
1181,“Can anyone look the parent of a Latino or black child in the eye and tell them their precious daughter or son has an equal chance to get into one of their city’s best high schools?” the mayor asked.
1182,"Opponents of the mayor’s plan have said it could water down the schools’ academics and that it discriminates against Asian students, who would lose about half their seats at specialized schools under his plan. "
1183,"“We firmly oppose the amended bill that completely eliminates the test and substitutes unnamed subjective criteria,” said the leaders of the Stuyvesant and Brooklyn Technical High School alumni associations, in the wake of Mr. de Blasio’s proposal. "
1184,"A half-century after Hecht-Calandra passed, Mr. de Blasio has tried to make the case for why state legislators should eliminate it. But that plan has scant political support in Albany or downstate. "
1185,"But both supporters and critics of the mayor’s plan have pushed him to release a blueprint to integrate all of the city’s 1,800 schools, not just eight especially prominent ones. "
1186,No proposal has materialized. 
1187,"In 1977, a Times reporter observed that, after a decade of advocacy and discussion, the prospect of school integration in New York was dimming."
1188,"“If the dream of racially integrated public schools is slipping away now in much of New York City, what will have become of it five years from now, or ten years? The outlook, at best, is uncertain and troubled.”"

1190,"A 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in United States custody last December was suffering from a bacterial infection that was so advanced she probably would have been visibly sick for many hours, said several physicians who reviewed a newly released autopsy report of her death."
1191,"By the time the girl, Jakelin Caal Maquin, arrived at a children’s hospital in El Paso with seizures and difficulty breathing, she already had severe blood abnormalities, according to a part of the report that summarized her condition in the emergency room of the Children’s Hospital at the Hospitals of Providence Memorial Campus."
1192,The new findings were released on Friday by the El Paso County Office of the Medical Examiner. Customs and Border Protection officials and lawyers for the girl’s family have sparred over whether the severity of her infection — with a common streptococcus bacteria — should have been recognized and whether she should have been taken for medical care more quickly.
1193,"“Something like that takes hours to progress,” said Dr. Lee Sanders, the chief of general pediatrics at Stanford University."
1194,"Jakelin and her father, Nery Gilberto Caal Cruz, spent about eight hours in a remote area of the New Mexico border after they were apprehended by Border Patrol agents for crossing illegally into the United States as part of a group of 163 migrants. They were not placed on the first bus departing for the Lordsburg Border Patrol Station, according to a timeline released last December by Customs and Border Protection."
1195,"Officials said that Mr. Caal signed a form after he was apprehended that certified his child was healthy. However, lawyers representing Mr. Caal have said the form was in English, which Mr. Caal did not speak."
1196,"Many migrants interviewed in recent weeks after being released from Border Patrol custody said they or their children had been sick but they had not revealed the illnesses, for reasons ranging from fear that it would slow their processing to a lack of knowledge that medical care would be available. Pediatricians said that it would be difficult for Border Patrol agents with little or no medical training to judge how sick a child was."
1197,"Congressman Raul Ruiz, a Democrat from California who is an emergency physician, said in an interview that the new report highlighted the need for standardized medical checks at the border."
1198,"“Clearly there was no meaningful observation or evaluation of this child,” he said. “It is the legal responsibility of C.B.P. to provide for the humanitarian needs and the health needs of the children under their custody while being detained.”"
1199,"That duty is made more challenging by the fact that migrants are crossing in difficult to reach areas, where medical resources, including ambulances, are in short supply."
1200,"The agency said Mr. Caal notified border patrol agents that his daughter was sick and vomiting only immediately before their departure from the remote region. Still, the girl did not receive medical attention until the bus arrived at the station, roughly an hour and a half later, where Border Patrol agents trained as emergency medical technicians examined her and called for an ambulance. She was then flown to the El Paso hospital."
1201,"Jakelin’s death, and then the death just weeks later of another Guatemalan child, Felipe Gómez Alonzo, led the federal agency to  begin making improvements in evaluating children for medical problems and increase staffing of medical professionals. Congress has earmarked funds for that this year."
1202,"Lawyers for the girl’s family have called for an independent investigation, and said in a statement Friday that while the autopsy report “sheds some light on Jakelin’s cause of death, it still leaves many questions that require further review.”"
1203,"“The report’s findings suggest that Jakelin’s chances of surviving would have been improved with earlier medical intervention,” they said in the statement. According to the autopsy, Jakelin’s death resulted from streptococcal sepsis, a life-threatening response to infection."
1204,"Mr. Caal said Friday evening that although he had been informed about the release of the autopsy report, he had not yet seen it."
1205,"“I wanted to know what happened,” he said, speaking by phone from Philadelphia where he is staying with relatives. He had been concerned that the report might in some way affect his immigration case."
1206,"The agency, which has defended its handling of the case, did not offer a comment on the new report."
1207,"At a news conference on Wednesday announcing further increases in illegal border crossings, Kevin K. McAleenan, the Customs and Border Protection commissioner, warned that dangers remained."
1208,"“With 55,000 families, including 40,000 children expected to enter the process this month, we are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a C.B.P. facility,” he said. “But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses we’re seeing in the border, I fear that it’s just a matter of time.”"

1210,Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.
1211,"It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery."
1212,"The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning."
1213,"New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic."
1214,The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.
1215,"Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees."
1216,"Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks."
1217,"His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit."
1218,Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.
1219,"State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely."
1220,"Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond."
1221,"Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere."
1222,"Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone."
1223,But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.
1224,"After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing."
1225,"Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”"
1226,"Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing."
1227,"The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels."
1228,"Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later."
1229,"“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”"
1230,"One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates."
1231,"London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution."
1232,"Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h."
1233,"Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."
1234,"In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home."
1235,"But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted."
1236,"And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars."
1237,Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.
1238,"Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians."
1239,"Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic."
1240,"“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”"

1246,"James Hemings was born in Virginia in 1765; at 8 years old, he became Thomas Jefferson’s slave through an inheritance. (His younger sister Sally was also enslaved by Jefferson and later bore several of Jefferson’s children.)"
1247,"After Jefferson was appointed commerce minister to France in 1784, he and Hemings, then 19 years old, set sail for Paris, which is where Hemings began his cooking career, becoming the first American trained as a French chef. He studied in prestigious French kitchens and trained with a master pastry chef; his most important experience, however, came from the chef at the Château de Chantilly, which at the time was considered to have better food than Versailles. "
1248,"In 1787, Hemings became the chef de cuisine at Hôtel de Langeac, Jefferson’s personal residence, where he cooked for politicians and celebrities. He later would make the dinner for the historic meeting between Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in Virginia, where the two men engaged in political negotiations despite their longstanding feud."
1249,"Hemings was freed in 1796. After some travel, he returned to Monticello, Jefferson’s home in Virginia, to run the kitchen. In 1801, he committed suicide; a letter addressed to Jefferson said that the cause was “drinking too freely.” While his time as a free man was short, his legacy has proved to be long."

1252,President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a national monument built in Carver’s honor 
1253,"Agricultural scientist, inventor, the peanut man: George Washington Carver is remembered for many things, but his contributions forever changed how modern industries are run. Carver was born into slavery in the early 1860s, and went on to earn a master’s degree in agricultural science at Iowa State Agricultural College (Iowa State University today). In 1896, he moved to Alabama and became the director of agricultural research at the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute. There, he focused on projects to improve Southern agriculture. "
1254,"Through his research, he discovered that cultivating only one crop stripped the land of its nutrients and yielded less bountiful harvests. By introducing peanuts and soybeans to the nutrient-deprived soil, crops could thrive again — a discovery that also could feed Southerners. Once farmers integrated crop rotation into their fields, the South became a strong new supplier of agricultural products."
1255,"You may have heard Carver’s name associated with peanuts (boy, did he love them). Contrary to popular belief, Carver did not invent peanut butter. But he did develop more than 300 other food, industrial and commercial items with peanuts, such as plastics, dyes, soap, milk and cosmetics. He also invented 118 products from sweet potatoes, including molasses and postage-stamp glue."
1256,"After Carver died, in 1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had a national monument built for him, an honor that before then had been reserved only for presidents."

1259,Zephyr Wright drew in crowds with her comfort food. But the one person who may have benefited the most was Lyndon B. Johnson. 
1260,"Wright was born and raised in Marshall, Tex. In 1942, she started working for the Johnsons as a maid and cook to help pay her way through college; she ended up staying with the family until 1969, through the duration of Johnson’s presidency. While Johnson was in Congress, his home quickly became known for its food, as other politicians visited regularly and built relationships over Wright’s chile con queso and peach cobbler. Lady Bird Johnson once wrote, “I have yet to find a great chef whose desserts I like as well as Zephyr’s.”"
1261,"Wright was known to have told Johnson of her experiences with discrimination. Leonard H. Marks, the director of the United States Information Agency at the time of Johnson’s presidency, was one witness to this. “When Sammy and I drive to Texas and I have to go to the bathroom, like Lady Bird or the girls, I am not allowed to go to the bathroom,” Mr. Marks recounted Wright telling Johnson. (Her husband, Sammy, was Johnson’s driver.) “I have to find a bush and squat. When it comes time to eat, we can’t go into restaurants. We have to eat out of a brown bag.” "
1262,"When Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Wright was there. After he finished, he gave her a pen he used and said, “You deserve this more than anybody else.”"
1263,Wright died in 1988 from heart complications at age 73.
1264,One of the first black cookbook authors
1265,Her cookbook was originally published in 1881 and reprinted in 1995
1266,"Abby Fisher was known for her Southern cooking, particularly her pickles and preserves. In 1880, after winning a bronze medal at a fair in San Francisco, the jurors said, “Her pickles and sauces have a piquancy and flavor seldom equaled, and, when once tasted, not soon forgotten.”"
1267,"Fisher was born into slavery in South Carolina in 1832. She learned to cook in plantation kitchens in the South, where she developed her distinctive style. After the Civil War, she moved to San Francisco and opened a preserves business. Those close to her encouraged her to publish a cookbook; because she could not read or write, she ended up carefully describing her recipes to writers who assembled them for her. “What Mrs. Fisher Knows About Old Southern Cooking” was published in 1881 and included 160 recipes, corn fritters and okra gumbo among them. You can get lost in it yourself."
1268,One of the most influential figures in modern Southern cooking
1269,Renowned author and chef
1270,"Born in 1916 in Freetown, Va., Edna Lewis grew up on a farm, where she learned to cook. After her father died when she was 16, she moved to Washington, D.C., living there briefly before finally settling in New York. She worked a series of different jobs until she began cooking at Café Nicholson in Midtown Manhattan, offering a simple menu of dishes like biscuits and herbed roast chicken. She soon became a local legend, and cooked for the likes of Salvador Dalí and Eleanor Roosevelt."
1271,"She left Café Nicholson in 1954, and started catering and teaching cooking classes in the American Museum of Natural History. About 20 years later, she wrote “The Edna Lewis Cookbook.” She began working with the renowned editor Judith Jones on a second book. After Jones pushed Lewis to find a more distinctive voice, “The Taste of Country Cooking” was born, which would become Lewis’s most significant cookbook, expanding on her Southern roots and how she would grow, harvest and cook what they planted in Freetown. It is celebrated for its focus on the simplicity of Southern food and emphasis of farm-to-table eating."
1272,"She went on to publish “In Pursuit of Flavor” in 1988, and “The Gift of Southern Cooking,” written with Scott Peacock, in 2003. Lewis died in 2006, but she is still recognized today for being a leading food voice in America."

1274,The oldest barbecue restaurant in Montgomery that’s still in operation
1275,Their efforts contributed to the success of the bus boycotts
1276,"In 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus in Montgomery. Shortly after, bus boycotts began around the city. The Brenda’s Bar-B-Que Pit staff helped organize parts of the boycott, which soon propelled the civil rights movement into the national conversation."
1277,"Jereline and Larry Bethune first opened the restaurant in 1942; back then it was a nightclub, the Siesta Club, that sold food. It later became Brenda’s, named for one of their daughters. The restaurant became an unofficial center for the local civil rights movement, holding N.A.A.C.P. meetings, printing fliers and planning protests."
1278,"But even after the bus boycotts, Ms. Bethune quietly held lessons to teach other African-Americans to read so they could pass the literacy test, which functioned as a way to suppress the black vote during the height of the Jim Crow era. Donetta Bethune, the Bethunes’ granddaughter, described it as: “Let’s learn how to read. Let’s learn how to vote. Let’s go after our own rights so we never have to be treated in a way that we’re not equal to again. In the black community, that’s how they lived back then. Everyone helped each other, or else how could you get by or how could you make it through.”"

1322,"In a city like New York, where cars crawl along congested streets and subways lollygag on old tracks, a “walk to work day” can sound ideal."
1323,"Tomorrow, it’s official: National Walk to Work Day is April 5."
1324,"The day is meant to encourage people to get a little more exercise. If helps make buses or trains less crowded, even better."
1325,"According to a 2007 study, New Yorkers are among the fastest walkers in the world. On average, it takes only 12 seconds for New Yorkers to walk 60 feet; that’s about 3.4 miles per hour, and slightly faster than sitting on the M42 bus. According to a recent report, the M42 has an average speed of just 3.2 m.p.h. It’s the slowest bus in the city."

1333,"When it was time to return, we got a cab to take us to the airport. It was warm out, so my 4-year-old was standing up in front of me, leaning on the cab door and looking out the open window."
1334,"At one point, the cab picked up speed as it turned left off a southbound avenue onto a crosstown street."
1335,The cabby said another cab seemed to be following us. He said the driver of the other cab was waving in our direction and had an angry look on his face.
1336,"Our cab continued on, swerving in and out of lanes in an effort to stay ahead of the other cab. We were perplexed and somewhat nervous. Had we annoyed the driver of the other cab in some way?"
1337,"After several blocks, we thought we were clear of the other cab, when suddenly it was right alongside us."
1338,"The driver reached out his open window, grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it shut."
1339,"“I saw the door wasn’t shut and your son was leaning on it,” he said. “I didn’t want him falling out.”"
1340,And then he was gone.

1347,"The word fetid has appeared in 26 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Sept. 21 in “In Sweden, Trash Heats Homes, Powers Buses and Fuels Taxi Fleets” by Amy Yee:"
1348,"LINKOPING, Sweden — In a cavernous room filled with garbage, a giant mechanical claw reaches down and grabs five tons of trash. As a technician in a control room maneuvers the spiderlike crane, the claw drops its moldering harvest down a 10-story shaft into a boiler that is hotter than 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. A fetid odor emanates from plastic trash bags discarded by hundreds of thousands of homes."
1349,"The process continues 24 hours a day to help fuel this power plant run by Tekniska Verken, a municipal government company in Linköping, a city 125 miles south of Stockholm. It is one of Sweden’s 34 “waste-to-energy” power plants. Instead of burning coal or gas, this power plant burns trash."

1352,"DAKAR, Senegal — They sprint. They sweat. They squat to the ground and bounce backward. They sit side-by-side and lock arms for group situps. They dig trenches in the sand for stability, to get more out of each push up."
1353,"And, then, when the rush-hour traffic really backs up and exhaust fumes pour across this little, sandy triangle of an outdoor gym bordered by a highway and two exit ramps, sometimes the athletes vomit."
1354,"“Sports and pollution,” said Joseph Faye, a wrestling coach who was grappling with other young men there on a recent evening, “they don’t go together.”"
1355,"Increasingly in Dakar, where outdoor exercise is a way of life, the two are colliding."
1356,"On any given evening, thousands of runners, wrestlers, soccer players and fitness fanatics take to the beaches and streets for a strenuous workout."
1357,Practically the whole city transforms into a California-like muscle beach with bodies grunting and panting and pushing themselves to extremes on any empty patch of land.
1358,Sprinters mount a lighthouse-topped hill or fly down the steps leading from a grand mosque. Body builders lift chunks of broken concrete and heave themselves up on a rusty metal rod stretched across two wooden poles.
1359,"Backward exercising is a thing, with throngs of people squatting and sprinting in reverse."
1360,"But with every breath, these exercisers are inhaling air that the World Health Organization considers dangerous. Dakar’s air exceeds by more than five times the limits set by the World Health Organization of the amount of small particles that when inhaled can damage health."
1361,"The air in Dakar, with its windswept coastal roadway and waves lapping against craggy bluffs, sometimes can appear deceptively clear."
1362,"Other times, especially this time of year when a dust storm rolls in and traffic backs up, it can feel like walking through a cloud of chalk dust after someone bangs two erasers together, inside an oven."
1363,"“It’s a real problem for respiratory diseases,” said Nafissatou Oumar Toure Badiane, the chief of pulmonology at Fann University Hospital in Dakar, who noted that the number of childhood asthma cases at one of the city’s biggest hospitals had recently jumped."
1364,She estimated that a third of the population has some kind of lung ailment.
1365,And there are signs that air quality here is getting worse.
1366,"Dakar is growing, having almost doubled in size in the past decade as people pour in from the countryside and nearby nations in search of jobs. Some of its five million inhabitants are farmers who have given up in the wake of chronic drought dating to the 70s."
1367,The city’s reputation for peace in a restive region has lured more corporations. Oil and gas companies are laying claim to recent offshore discoveries. An entire new city north of Dakar is rising from the sandy dirt. Construction cranes dot the skyline.
1368,Constant smoke billows from a cement factory trying to keep up.
1369,Seventy percent of the nation’s vehicles are on the roadways in Dakar. New highways are being inaugurated to accommodate them.
1370,"Many of the cars are old and spew fumes in a range of colors that produce a particular taste on the palate. The black smoke is bold and mealy across the tongue; blue offers suffocating sourness, while white has subtle notes of the bus boarding area at New York’s Port Authority."
1371,"Trash is piling up outside the city at a monstrous dump where it is often burned, sending thick clouds of small, dangerous particles wafting straight into the city center."
1372,"Smelly black smoke pours over the walls from a French military base that regularly sets fire to some of its waste, choking morning runners who pass by."
1373,Then there are the dust storms.
1374,"Winds sweep down from the Sahara to the north during “harmattan” season between December and April, hurtling dust into the air that coats Dakar’s landscape with a powder so fine it slips under doorways and inside closed windows."
1375,Researchers fear the storms will get worse as rainfall levels decrease along the desert’s southern edge and the Sahara expands.
1376,"Senegalese officials say they are trying to improve conditions. The president’s new city was created to relieve congestion in Dakar. And the government banned some of the most polluting, rickety buses. But many are still on the roadways."
1377,"A decade ago, the government set up air quality monitoring stations across Dakar, and alerts go out to the public when air pollution reaches dangerous levels, most often during dust storm season."
1378,"Government data collected from the stations between 2013 and 2017 show that while the yearly percentage of days of “very bad” air quality declined, the number of “bad” days increased over the same period."
1379,"On the streets of Dakar, pedestrians and bikers are starting to wear masks, evoking images of cities like New Delhi or Beijing with far worse pollution issues."
1380,"Runners are cutting back their routines, scared off by clumps of black dust they blow out of their nostrils in the shower. Weight lifters on the roadways say they suffer more colds than in years’ past."
1381,"People who gather for free workout classes on a small beach along the wind-swept corniche, where cars line a clogged roadway and raw sewage pours into the ocean, say they cough as they walk home."
1382,So much dust coated the National Olympic Pool recently it turned a funny shade of green and needed to be drained.
1383,"“Sometimes it feels like I’m about to get choked,” said Elhadji Adama Niane, a champion swimmer who was panting after a recent workout there."
1384,"Mame Aly Dyigo, a soccer coach and retired professional player, said he has moved his team’s practices to the beach after exhaust fumes from nearby traffic were bothering players. He thought the sea breeze would help."

1386,"On a recent night runners from the Star Athletic Club, a prominent track club, were practicing in one of the city’s biggest outdoor stadiums, situated near one of the busiest highways. It smelled like a bus garage."
1387,"Sangoné Kandji, a champion long jumper and triple jumper, stopped and sniffed the air when this was pointed out."
1388,"“At least the wind blows over here a little,” she shrugged. “I think I’m just used to it.”"
1389,The bad air is too much sometimes even for wrestlers who face-plant into the sand regularly.
1390,Wrestling is the Senegalese national pastime but space to practice is squeezed in the booming neighborhood of Yoff where athletes were gathered recently on the little patch of sand bordered by the freeway ramps.
1391,"“It’s not easy to find a training field like this around here,” said Matarr Ndow, a wrestler practicing with his team."
1392,"Just across the freeway, new apartment buildings sprouted from a huge construction site. A bulldozer rumbled up an on-ramp. Rubberneckers slowed to watch the grown men in what looks like cloth diapers tug each other to the ground. Smoke belched from some of the idling cars."
1393,"“Every time I come here,” Mr. Ndow said, “I leave with a headache.”"
1394,To the Editor:
1395,"Re “Grief Turns to Rage Over Trump’s Trust of Kim” (front page, March 2):"
1396,The family of Otto Warmbier is rightly appalled at President Trump’s acceptance of Kim Jong-un’s claimed ignorance of the young man’s case. Mr. Warmbier died upon his return to the United States in 2017 after being held in brutal conditions in a North Korean prison for stealing a poster.
1397,"Why does President Trump put complete faith in the words of dictators alleged to have sanctioned murder, whether they are in Russia, Saudi Arabia or North Korea? Could it be that these men, unlike the men and women serving in our national intelligence agencies, feel like kindred spirits? Their word is final, regardless of fact. "
1398,"They possess the power, savor the privileges and exercise the rights of unchallenged autocrats, free from any democratic constraints. They demand, and get, total deference and respect based on fear and intimidation. This clearly seems to be the model that has guided President Trump as a businessman and now as a political leader. "
1399,It is clearly time for members of his party to come forward to defend democracy itself from a leader who does not value it.
1400,Bill NicholsSan Francisco
1401,To the Editor:
1402,Fred and Cindy Warmbier are finding out just how bad it feels to be pawns of Donald Trump. They were proudly on display at the 2018 State of the Union address. Now they have been thrown under the bus at the summit in Hanoi with Kim Jong-un. 
1403,The Warmbiers’ unimaginable grief over the gruesome loss of their son was compounded by the president. This is only the latest in the litany of despicable actions taken by Mr. Trump. 
1404,"It’s time to wake up, America: Your country and its values are being hijacked."
1405,"Maris Thatcher MeyersonBerkeley, Calif."
1406,"Congestion pricing has the potential to significantly change how traffic flows through Manhattan streets, how commuters get around the city, how companies like Uber and Lyft operate."
1407,"But most radically, if the policy spreads it could challenge a deeply embedded cultural idea, requiring people to pay for something Americans have long demanded — and largely believe they’ve gotten — free of charge. "
1408,"The idea of the open road evokes these intertwined meanings: The freedom to use it should be free. Residential street parking should be free. Traffic lanes should be free. Stretches of public curb dedicated to private driveways? Those should be free, too."
1409,"In other ways, the government has heavily subsidized driving, or hidden the reality of who pays for it in places no one sees. Local laws require off-street parking from businesses and housing developers, who pass on the construction cost of it to tenants and customers who may not drive at all."
1410,Federal and state governments fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee (and that have come to operate like less and less of one in an era of fuel efficiency).
1411,"“They add up to a pretty giant system of subsidies,” said Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But they don’t look like what we often consider subsidies.”"
1412,"This system looks to us, instead, like an entitlement — driving is an American right, and so the infrastructure that enables it should be free."
1413,"Congestion pricing is premised instead on the notion that public roads are a valuable and scarce resource. And we should pay in some places to use it not primarily to gin up revenue, but to help manage access for everyone."
1414,"“It’s a huge departure from how we’ve culturally thought about this over the years,” said Kari Watkins, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering."
1415,"In reality, the government is a monopoly provider of road space, and the government has largely chosen to give it away. It’s no surprise, then, that the vast majority of American commuters drive to work alone, or that all those lonely commuters (plus taxis, Ubers, buses and delivery trucks) cause congestion."
1416,"When the government holds down the price of something people value, Mr. Manville said, we get shortages. And congestion is effectively a shortage of road — one that occurs at the peak times when people want to use it most."
1417,"If we had that problem with other kinds of infrastructure or commodities, we’d charge people more for them. If airline tickets were particularly in demand, their prices would go up. If there were a run on avocados, grocers wouldn’t respond by keeping them as cheap as possible. "
1418,"“The roads hold such a special position in our brain that we use logic around them that we would never use around everything else,” Mr. Manville said."
1419,"Other countries have socialized health care, parental leave or housing, Jeffrey Tumlin, a transportation consultant at Nelson\Nygaard, pointed out. In America, we’ve socialized driving — and housing for our cars."
1420,"“We don’t let people put their self-storage containers in public parks, but it’s just fine to store their cars on other public land for free,” Mr. Tumlin wrote in an email. "
1421,"Peter Norton, a historian at the University of Virginia, traces this thinking to the 1920s and ’30s, when industry groups and government officials were debating whether to fund America’s expanding roads with tolls, which were by then common on bridges. "
1422,"Road builders were happy to have tolls, and they appeared in places like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But auto clubs and car manufacturers dependent on car sales opposed them. They preferred a gas tax, a cost less visible to drivers every time they got in a car. Together, they were remarkably savvy about branding the choice as one between “toll roads and free roads.” (A 1939 federal report even adopted that phrase as its title.)"
1423,"“Of course, there’s no such thing as a free road,” Mr. Norton said. “But they were making the ambiguous association between their cause and the great cause of freedom.”"
1424,"Industry publications at the time linked the need for “free” roads to patriotism, the Bill of Rights, even the Minutemen. "
1425,"Today, because most people seldom pay directly for roads — or because general funds do — it can seem as if no one does."
1426,"“Therefore the street transportation system has no cost,” said Yonah Freemark, a doctoral student in city planning at M.I.T., who runs the blog The Transport Politic. “And therefore we can just expect to have unlimited parking, we can expect to have unlimited access to neighborhoods, for whatever reason, for free.”"
1427,"Take those expectations to their logical conclusion in a major city today, and you get 10-mile-per-hour road speeds, rampant double parking, clogged intersections and worsening commute times. You get, finally, the political will for congestion pricing."
1428,"Now the culture of limitless, cheap driving may begin to shift in some places. But it will take much longer to change the physical environment that has grown up around that culture over decades, leaving many people without good alternatives to driving alone."
1429,"Where there are few other choices, like reliable bus routes, congestion pricing risks burdening poorer drivers in particular. But that is a problem we’ve thought about before, too, Mr. Manville said, if we’re now willing to treat roads as we do other infrastructure. He pointed to “lifeline” utility services: subsidized rates for electricity and gas offered to users with fewer resources."
1430,"“Fortunately, congestion pricing comes with its own built-in solution,” he said, “which is that it raises a ton of money.”"
1431,"It has been over 20 years since the debut of “How Stella Got Her Groove Back,” and even now, taking a sabbatical from life’s routine challenges is still portrayed as something only white female protagonists get to do (think Julia Roberts in “Eat Pray Love” or Reese Witherspoon in “Wild”)."
1432,"According to cinema, black women are too strong and too resilient to abandon their many obligations. They don’t suddenly bus it out of the city and away from their demanding families, as does the titular character in “Juanita,” a Netflix Original film directed by Clark Johnson. That makes Juanita (Alfre Woodard) a bit of a rebel."
1433,"Exhausted with no time to herself, Juanita spends most of her days working an unfulfilling job, babysitting her granddaughter and visiting her son in jail. She can’t even get a reprieve in her dreams, in which she concocts a shirtless Blair Underwood kissing her feet. He, too, asks to borrow money."
1434,"So one day she jumps on a Greyhound to a town called Butte (hilarious mispronunciations ensue), in Montana, in search of some peace of mind. There, she meets a real-life younger man (Adam Beach), a chef at a local diner, whose charm and warm smile give her excursion an even deeper meaning."
1435,"On the surface, “Juanita” is a fantasy that gives its older black heroine permission to chase her happiness, whatever that may be (the narrative wonderfully portrays it simply as elsewhere). But even more than that, the film is a testament to how necessary and urgent it is for black women to embark on purely selfish adventures in order to rediscover themselves. Although “Juanita” teeters off track a bit with the chef’s half-baked back story, it soars when it allows its lead to explore the complexities of love and unbridled joy. And Woodard completely owns it."

1437,The traffic choking New York City streets has brought new congestion fees on taxis and Ubers and rallied support around a broader congestion pricing plan to charge all cars and trucks entering the busiest neighborhoods.
1438,Now city officials are ratcheting up the fight against another traffic headache: parking scofflaws.
1439,"On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce new measures aimed at municipal employees who abuse city-issued parking placards that are intended to help them carry out their official duties, but too often are abused and contribute to clogged streets."
1440,"Many employees brazenly display the placards while parked illegally — including in crosswalks, on sidewalks and blocking bus and bike lanes — or while using personal vehicles when not working."
1441,"Under the de Blasio administration, the number of city-issued placards has soared and critics have accused the mayor of doing little to tackle the problem."
1442,"Now, city officials are promising a more aggressive campaign. A new enforcement team of traffic agents will issue tickets and target placard abuse in neighborhoods that have become hot spots, such as Downtown Brooklyn and Chinatown. Any placard found to be misused three times will be revoked under a new “three strikes” policy; previously, it had been left to the discretion of the agencies that issued the placards."
1443,"In addition, the city will make the misuse or fraudulent use of a placard a separate violation on top of any parking violation. Currently, placard abuse is treated as a parking violation and carries a $50 fine. City officials said they would push for changes to state law to establish a $250 fine for placard abuse."
1444,The city also plans to test out stickers as a replacement for paper placards to make it harder to transfer placards to unauthorized vehicles. It will also develop a digital parking system by 2021 in which physical placards will be unnecessary because license plates will already be linked to a database and parking violations will be automatically issued through a so-called pay-by-plate system.
1445,"Still, none of the mayor’s measures will significantly reduce the total number of city-issued placards, which have nearly doubled to 125,500 in 2018 from 67,297 in 2008, according to city records. The largest chunk, 50,000, is issued by the Transportation Department for its own employees as well as those at other government agencies, and others. The Police Department issues another 44,000 to law enforcement officers, and the Education Department, 31,500 to teachers and school employees to park near their schools."
1446,"Transportation advocates say the police fail to vigorously target scofflaws, in part, because some officers themselves abuse their placards."
1447,"Advocates also accuse city officials of doling out parking placards as political favors to the powerful teachers’ unions and others, including 50,000 new placards for teachers and school employees in 2017. They said the city has helped create the problem because more placards lead to more opportunities for abuse and the oversupply of placards has encouraged more people to drive to work, putting more cars on the road."
1448,"“The elephant in the room is whether they can reduce placard abuse to everyone’s satisfaction without a meaningful reduction in the sheer number of placards,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders."
1449,"The placards, Mr. Pearlstein said, have essentially created a large class of privileged city workers, many of whom would otherwise be taking buses and subways. “It’s a question of fairness,” he said. “Plenty of people have to get to work on time and do work that is important to the life of the city.”"
1450,"City officials said that 50,000 temporary placards for school employees were issued to resolve a labor dispute with the teachers’ union. But the number of placards dropped to 31,500 later that year when the Education Department moved to an online application system that set out clear eligibility standards. The department has also tightened oversight of placards, including tracking names and vehicle information for every placard in a database and printing permits on paper that cannot be illegally copied."
1451,"The previous mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, challenged the city’s tradition of bestowing parking placards on city employees and in 2008 his administration cut the number in half to 67,297 from 144,048 the year before. Mr. de Blasio’s aides said the number of placards had crept back up to 103,000 by the time he took office in 2014."
1452,"Bruce Schaller, a consultant who helped lead the Bloomberg efforts, said any comprehensive effort to curb placard abuse would sputter unless placard numbers were reduced."
1453,"Still, Mr. Schaller said he believed the new measures were at least a start. “If there’s real follow-through to what they’re announcing, then people should be able to see improvement,” he said. “Will it completely solve the problem? I can guarantee you no, but New Yorkers are more realistic than that.”"
1454,"The new measures follow renewed efforts by the City Council to cut down on placard abuse. Council members led by Speaker Corey Johnson have recently proposed bills that council aides said were similar to the mayor’s measures or would go even further, such as requiring at least 50 targeted enforcement sweeps every week by the Police Department that would be monitored by the Department of Investigation. The bills would also require enforcement officers to call for towing any vehicle blocking bike and bus lanes, crosswalks or fire hydrants."
1455,"“The council is thrilled the mayor has seen the light on placard abuse,” Mr. Johnson said. “And we are very much looking forward to working with him to remove this scourge from our streets once and for all.”"
1456,"This is not the first time Mr. de Blasio has vowed to take on the chronic problem. In 2017, the mayor announced a citywide enforcement plan, including creating a new anti-placard-fraud police unit. As a result, city officials said, the number of summonses for illegal parking has risen to 54,608 last year from 28,269 in 2016. But placard abuses have continued, with egregious examples often documented on social media."
1457,"“Placard abuse erodes faith in government and has no place in our city — it’s simply a question of fairness,” the mayor said in a statement. “Misused and fraudulent placards increase congestion and pose a public safety risk. These initiatives give us the tools we need to start making a real dent in this pervasive issue, to help build a fairer city for all.”"
1458,"Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which manages three business improvement districts, said she welcomed the new measures. The neighborhood, which is home to city agency offices and courthouses, has been inundated with placard-carrying drivers who double park on streets and block traffic, leave cars on sidewalks and take up metered spots meant for visitors and shoppers, she said."
1459,"“I think it will go a long way in starting to check this problem,” she said. “Sadly, Downtown Brooklyn is really the Wild West of placard abuse.”"
1460,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Daisuke Wakabayashi, a technology reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech he’s using."
1461,What are your most important tech tools?
1462,"I’m most particular about the tech products I use as basic tools of my job. I’m a maniac about keyboards and mice; I generally hate most of them. While I use Macs at home and at work, I dislike every Apple keyboard and don’t care for the company’s mice, either. The keys are too flat, I never know if I’ve pressed hard enough, and it hurts my hands after a while."
1463,"As my colleagues will tell you, I use a very loud mechanical keyboard made by Das Keyboards. These mechanical keyboards are similar to the ones that came with my family’s first IBM computer from the 1980s. I’ve also used the same mouse for the last five years."
1464,"Aside from that, I use an app called Voice Record Pro on my iPhone for recording interviews. If I’m recording a phone call — with permission, of course — I’ll use an app from Rev, which is also the service I use to have my interviews transcribed. It’s a little steep at $1 per minute, but the accuracy is so much better than the A.I.-only alternatives that cost like 10 cents a minute."
1465,Why are you so particular about your mouse and keyboard? 
1466,"I feel like I type faster and more accurately with this keyboard — which is important because I’m already a slow typer. What’s more, the tactile responsiveness when I push a key is so satisfying. It’s silly but it also makes me feel productive, each keystroke an audio reminder that I’m one step closer to my goal."
1467,"There are drawbacks. The keyboard is not as sleek and visually appealing as the Apple keyboards. They are also super loud, and the click-clacks can be distracting for people around you, as well as unsettling for people you’re on the phone with if you’re taking notes. I’ve often been stopped by sources who ask why I’m typing so feverishly, afraid that I’m pounding the keys because they said something they shouldn’t have. Now, I’ll sometimes take notes by hand using a pen and paper, and then transcribe them later if it’s a sensitive conversation."
1468,"My mouse for the last five years has been a wireless one from Microsoft. It’s called the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse. I like this mouse because it has good heft. Some wireless mice are too light, and they dart around like a hyperactive child. I also don’t want too big of a mouse, and then I feel like arm-wrestling with the device. This one provides a good balance. Also the bottom is plastic, and it’s quiet when I move the mouse around on my desk. The Apple ones make this cringey scraping sound. "

1470,"You cover Google, and in a past life you covered Apple. Both are fierce competitors with their own mobile operating systems, internet services, smartphones and computers. What do you see as the challenges for the companies going forward?"
1471,"Apple has focused on creating beautiful, easy-to-use products, but I find that its products are becoming harder to use. "
1472,"I think some of it is just a function of our devices being asked to do more — my iPhone is central to my life in ways that it wasn’t even three years ago — and how do you build in that additional capability without bogging down the software? Apple’s products are still beautiful, but I think that form is overtaking function in some areas. (See: headphone jack, lack of ports on laptops.) A device’s beauty is meaningful only if it is also useful."
1473,"Google’s issues are different. They’re not purely product questions, but are more fundamental. "
1474,"The company turned 20 last year, and it feels like it’s going through an identity crisis. Google was the anti-Microsoft in the early days. Many of its longtime employees were drawn to Google not purely because it was a moneymaking machine but because it also seemed interested in being a force for good in the tech industry. Who can forget “Don’t Be Evil” and all that? "
1475,"But as Google has grown increasingly dominant, it has become difficult to subscribe to a self-image of a whimsical do-gooder when everyone else sees you as Godzilla trampling across the internet landscape. We’ve already seen some employee revolts, and I suspect we’ll see more. Look at how it is wrestling with what it plans to do with search in China, which shows this identity crisis is filtering into its business and products decisions."
1476,"Outside of work, what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with? "
1477,"My wife and I have a 2-year-old son, and he just loves playing with our digital speakers. We have an Amazon Echo in the kitchen and a Google Home upstairs. They’re both connected to Spotify. He knows that he can ask Alexa or Google to play “Wheels on the Bus” or “Baa-Baa Black Sheep” and, voilà, the music comes on."
1478,"But these days he’s become more particular, and he likes a version of “Wheels on the Bus” performed by Mother Goose Club, so he’ll shout something like, “Alexa, play ‘Wheels on the Bus,’ the goose one, PLEEEEEEEEASE.” (We’ve tried to tell him that Alexa won’t do as he asks unless he says please.) Alexa and Google usually struggle to decipher this request, so Mom and Dad frequently intervene, but occasionally Alexa or Google understands him and he is delighted."
1479,"His other favorite activity is to ask Google to play sounds of different things. His favorite requests (in no particular order): animals, emergency vehicles and modes of transportation. Recently, he discovered that Google can play the sound of a dinosaur, and this excited him to no end."
1480,"But now my son thinks anything with an illuminated green ring means it’s a portal for Alexa. Recently, I found him shouting instructions to my wireless iPhone charging pad. It got me thinking, why doesn’t Amazon make an Echo that doubles as a wireless phone charging pad? My toddler the innovator."
1481,Major spoilers for “Us” (and some decades-old episodes of “The Twilight Zone”) are ahead.
1482,
1483,"In Jordan Peele’s horror hit “Us,” Adelaide (Lupita Nyong’o), a wife and mother of two, is haunted. During a visit to the Santa Cruz, Calif., pier as a child, she was briefly separated from her parents and stumbled upon an eerie funhouse — and her doppelgänger, Red. She hasn’t been the same since."
1484,"Now, as an adult returning to that same beach on a vacation with her husband, Gabe (Winston Duke), and two children, her fears have returned. Stirred by the memories of that fateful night, Adelaide confesses what she saw to Gabe. “My whole life I feel like she’s still coming for me,” she reveals. A disbelieving Gabe cracks a joke, but moments later, Red (also Nyong’o) and the counterparts of the entire family descend on the house, determined to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs."
1485,"“Us” is awash in cultural references and cinematic nods, but perhaps more than anything else, it feels like “The Twilight Zone,” the classic TV series that Peele is reviving next month on CBS All Access. In creating Adelaide and Red, Peele has reimagined a classic character and trope found in that anthology series: the protagonist forced to reckon with another version of him or herself, and the desperate need to be someone else."
1486,"The twisted path that connects “The Twilight Zone” to “Us” leads most readily to the Season 1 episode “Mirror Image,” which Peele has cited as an inspiration for his film. In it, Millicent Barnes (Vera Miles) waits at a bus station, and realizes she has crossed paths with her doppelgänger. Only she can see the curious figure; no one else at the depot believes Millicent’s claim, and she slowly begins to unravel."
1487,"Millicent explains to Paul, a man waiting for the same bus, that there must be a parallel universe and each person has a counterpart. For unknown reasons, the two worlds can converge, allowing the counterparts to enter our realm. “In order to survive,” she continues, “it has to take over — replace us, move us out, so that it can live.”"
1488,"The doppelgängers in “Us” aren’t explicitly described as coming from parallel universes, but Red calls her connection to Adelaide a “tethering,” an unshakable bond — and the movie makes it clear that once the two meet for the second time, as adults, they cannot coexist peacefully."
1489,"A version of this conflict between selves plays out heavily across many other “Twilight Zone” episodes. Season 5’s “Spur of the Moment,” for instance, follows Anne, an 18-year-old engaged to a stuffy but father-approved investment banker, who encounters an older woman in black while horseback riding. The woman, also on horseback, screams at Anne and chases her before losing ground."
1490,"By the end of the episode, it’s revealed that the miserable woman is Anne 25 years later, trying to stop her younger self from making the mistake of marrying the wrong man."
1491,"And in “Nightmare as a Child,” a young girl suddenly appears outside Helen’s apartment door; the girl turns out to be her younger self, there to remind her of a long-buried trauma that occurred when she was a child, and to warn her about how it will come back to haunt her in the present."
1492,[Read our interview with Jordan Peele about his relaunching of “The Twilight Zone.”]
1493,"Throughout “Us,” Adelaide shares with those “Twilight Zone” characters and others a psychological unraveling — there are flashbacks to her childhood soon after the hall-of-mirrors encounter, in which she overhears her parents confessing their worries about her to a therapist. At the beach, Adelaide’s eyes dart uncomfortably as she tries to maintain a dull conversation with the vapid Kitty (Elisabeth Moss), and she has an anxiety attack when she briefly loses track of her son."
1494,"On the other side of the mirror, Red’s motivations echo facets of “Twilight Zone” conundrums, too. There are traces of the Tethered in “Five Characters in Search of an Exit”; the Major — like Red — is not content to remain trapped in a giant cylinder, and is desperate to rally the others to escape. “The After Hours,” in which department-store mannequins institute a rotation where one of them gets to live along humans for a month at a time, gets at the same how-the-other-half-lives ideas as “Us.”"
1495,"Both episodes approach those yearnings for a better life in a decidedly more elegiac fashion than “Us,” which uses violence to demonstrate the overthrow of the ruling class. When Red and the others attack Adelaide’s family at the house, she pointedly describes Adelaide as having a shadow that lives a much less cushy lifestyle. While Adelaide had celebrated happy Christmases, married a “handsome prince” and had lovely children, Red’s existence was the opposite: cold, empty, sad."
1496,"Later, in their final showdown, Red expresses even more bitterness. “You could have taken me with you,” she grunts, referring to their first encounter in the funhouse."
1497,"But Adelaide didn’t. Instead, as we learn in the movie’s twist, Adelaide is actually Red, and Red is actually Adelaide — just as Millicent is ultimately replaced by her doppelgänger in “Mirror Image.” (Paul has her arrested for her erratic behavior.) This reveal brings more questions than answers: What are we to make of the fact that Red swapped places with Adelaide, and we’ve been unwittingly rooting for her all along? Is there a class below the Tethered, waiting to overthrow them next? Are any of the characters, whether Tethered or not, actually good?"
1498,"Whatever the conclusion, it’s meant to unsettle us, like the best of Serling’s “Twilight Zone” episodes. As Peele told The Times’s Dave Itzkoff, “I love human beings as the monster, as the horror.”"
1499,"They arrived by car and by bus and by train and even on their own four legs. Some strode onto the sidewalk and some skittered across the carpet. A few, almost certainly, let it be known that they expected to be carried by a human. All are here for this week’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. All of them — the Affenpinschers and the Borzois, the Xoloitzcuintlins and the Yorkshire terriers — will hope to rise through breed and group judging on Monday and Tuesday at Pier 94 to a place on the floor on Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden where the best-in-show winner will be crowned. But before that big moment, there will be thousands of small ones. New York Times photographers have fanned out to catch as many as possible. "

1513,"Sascha, the young protagonist of “Holiday,” co-written and directed by Isabella Eklof (who also co-wrote the striking 2018 Swedish film “Border”), has no back story. She materializes at an airport, rides on a bus and is soon at the house of Michael (Lai Yde), an older man who welcomes her to “the family.”"
1514,"Michael’s work as a minor drug lord on the Turkish Riviera provides a sybaritic but inelegant lifestyle, one punctuated with threat and then actual violence. At an ice-cream parlor, Sascha (Victoria Carmen Sonne) meets the younger, more laid-back Thomas (Thijs Romer), a boatman who tells her that if she were an ice cream, she would be strawberry cheesecake."
1515,"She corrects him: “Strawberry champagne.” She’s Danish, she tells him; he’s Dutch, he tells her."
1516,"Between her flirtations with Thomas, she watches as Michael and his friends menace a beachgoer. She gets into a motor scooter mishap. At one point, she and the younger folk repair to the TV room while Michael kicks the crap out of an employee."
1517,"Then one afternoon Michael brutally rapes Sascha, in the middle of the living room, in an explicit single take."
1518,"Eklof subsequently inverts revenge conventions in a way that dares the audience to call it perverse. She has cited the cinematic extremist Ulrich Seidl (“Paradise: Love,” “Import/Export”) as an influence: As with that filmmaker, it’s hard to tell whether she intends to communicate something genuine about the human condition, or just shovel hostility at her audience."
1519,"Because Eklof’s approach is formally very clean, showing some genuine, intriguing detachment, I’m apt to prefer it to Seidl’s work. But not by much."
1520,"SYRACUSE — After a three-hour flight delay caused by a mechanical issue, another two and a half hours in the air and a short bus ride from the airport, the Mets finally strolled into the Embassy Suites lobby here in Syracuse at 11:42 p.m. on Monday."
1521,"Sitting on a stool at the bar, Daniel Gassman, an electrical lineman, put down his glass of Jack Daniels and greeted each player with a fist bump."
1522,"“Holy cow,” he said. “The Mets have arrived!”"
1523,"The team was less excited. A day earlier, starter Noah Syndergaard made it known that many of the players viewed the one-night visit for a workout — in front of the new Class AAA affiliate’s fans at the Carrier Dome on Syracuse University’s campus — as an inconvenience."
1524,"Syndergaard insisted it was not “what championship teams do” between spring training and opening day, which is Thursday. His thoughts came as part of a venting session that included expressing frustration that his teammate Jacob deGrom, the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner, had not received a contract extension."
1525,"“I just think they should quit all this fuss and pay the man already,” Syndergaard said."
1526,"On Tuesday, as the Mets began their relationship with Syracuse, they also came to terms with deGrom on a five-year contract extension worth $137.5 million. Teammates seemed relieved."
1527,"“I was really excited,” outfielder Brandon Nimmo said. “Definitely glad we could put it behind us.”"
1528,"DeGrom did not make the trip to Syracuse. While his teammates slept, deGrom’s agent, Jeff Berry, and deGrom’s former agent, Brodie Van Wagenen, who switched sides of the negotiating table during the off-season by becoming the Mets’ general manager, finished deGrom’s contract extension."
1529,"Manager Mickey Callaway said he appreciated the clarity for deGrom, as the Mets’ star pitcher prepared to take the mound against the Washington Nationals and Max Scherzer, the three-time Cy Young winner, on opening day."
1530,"“It was never a distraction to us on the field,” Callaway said. “I want Jacob here as long as possible.”"
1531,"In February, deGrom announced that he wanted Berry and Van Wagenen to reach a deal by opening day. Week in, week out, deGrom kept track of the contract extensions that other Major League Baseball teams signed with their stars this spring. From Mike Trout to Chris Sale to Justin Verlander, players struck new deals as deGrom awaited his payday."
1532,"DeGrom, 30, was scheduled to make $17 million this season and was under contract for next season, too."
1533,"As recently as Saturday, deGrom acknowledged that a deal might not get done. The Red Sox had agreed to terms with Sale the day before on a five-year extension worth $145 million, while deGrom dominated in his final start of the spring with three perfect innings against the Braves in his final Grapefruit League start."
1534,"“Honestly, I really have been trying not to think about it,” deGrom said afterward. “Yeah, I said I wanted to get something done, but it’s getting close to opening day, and I think my focus is on that right now.”"
1535,"While deGrom’s contract was the biggest news of the day, Syndergaard seized the Syracuse stage. He was cheered when he ran onto the field, and Gryffin Howard, an 8-year-old Mets fan from Rome, N.Y., held a sign in his honor that read: “Thor! It’s Hammer Time!” Syndergaard threw a ball to Howard during his warm-ups."
1536,"“I understand that they’re on a busy schedule, but this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see in our backyard,” Howard’s father, Evan, said. “It’s appreciated. No hard feelings.”"
1537,"Later, Syndergaard waved a giant flag that featured Syracuse University’s block “S” logo. He ran with it like a cheerleader along the field’s sidelines, and concluded his performance at midfield, where he waved the flag wildly."
1538,"“That’s Noah,” Callaway said. “He got a lot of conditioning in running that flag around today, so he’s going to be in even better shape because he came here.”"
1539,"Syndergaard knows that he eventually wants what deGrom now has. The two pitchers made their major league debuts 362 days apart — deGrom on May 15, 2014, and Syndergaard on May 12, 2015 — and have assumed leadership roles in the clubhouse."
1540,"But deGrom has more consistently been among the best pitchers in the game. Last season was his finest performance yet, as he recorded a 1.70 earned run average and 269 strikeouts in 32 starts. DeGrom received little run support from the Mets’ lineup as he went 10-9 for a team that finished 77-85."
1541,Nimmo mentioned that the team was motivated to come out and prove its worth in March and April. He said there were constructive conversations during the flight delay on the trip from Florida.
1542,"“I would say it was probably a better thing than actually leaving on time,” Nimmo said, “because a lot of guys got to express their opinions and decide how we wanted to approach the season.”"
1543,He vowed that the team was going to “come out like bulldogs.”
1544,The Mets boarded two buses shortly after 2 p.m. on Tuesday. Three Onondaga County sheriff’s vehicles led them back to the airport.
1545,"Minutes later, Syndergaard sent one more message to Syracuse. Posting a photo of himself on Instagram with the “S” flag, he wrote, “THANK YOU SCRANTON! I LOVE YOU!”"

1547,The proposal was intended to help poor New Yorkers by offering them discount MetroCards for the subway and buses and put the city at the forefront of national efforts to find ways to address inequality.
1548,"But the launch of the program has turned into a mess for Mayor Bill de Blasio, who campaigned on improving the lives of those struggling in an increasingly expensive city."
1549,It did not start on time. No one knows how to apply. It is unclear who will qualify or even which subway and bus passes will be offered at half-price.
1550,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, had initially failed to embrace the idea — he agreed to pay for it only after being pushed by the City Council — and is now under fire for his handling of the rollout."
1551,"On Thursday, Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, stood outside City Hall with transit advocates to call on Mr. de Blasio to release details about the program."
1552,"“Now we have to make sure that the people who are not left behind are the people that this program is supposed to serve — struggling New Yorkers, New Yorkers living below the poverty line,” Mr. Stringer said."
1553,"Mr. de Blasio had initially resisted calls to have the city pay for the program. But Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, convinced him last summer to include funding in the city’s budget. The two men even held a rally at the Fulton Street subway station in Lower Manhattan to celebrate the agreement."
1554,"In June, Mr. de Blasio said the discount program, known as Fair Fares, would start on Jan. 1. Looking ahead six months, Mr. de Blasio said, “I’m confident we can work out the details in that time frame.”"
1555,"But as 2018 came to a close, transit advocates became alarmed that his administration had not released any details. On Dec. 12, they sent Mr. de Blasio a letter raising concerns about the timing of the rollout and reports that the discount would apply to only weekly and monthly passes. They did not receive a response."
1556,"On Wednesday, Mr. de Blasio told reporters that he would announce the details “in a few days” and that New Yorkers would understand if it “takes a few extra days.” Mr. de Blasio said the city was considering how it could include pay-per-ride MetroCards, which are often favored by New Yorkers who are living paycheck to paycheck."
1557,"The city agreed to pay $106 million for the first six months of the program. Under the agreement, it would apply to New Yorkers below the federal poverty line — a household income of about $25,000 for a family of four."
1558,[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo  canceled the full shutdown of the L train between Brooklyn and Manhattan.]
1559,"For transit advocates who aggressively pushed Mr. de Blasio to support the idea, his failure to start the program on time or to publicize it has been frustrating."
1560,"“To see people not taking this as incredibly seriously as they should be, it is disappointing to say the least,” said David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit. “This is not just any ordinary mayor, this is a mayor who guaranteed he’d make this the most equitable city in the nation.”"
1561,Mr. de Blasio has struggled at times to prove he is skilled at managing a sprawling city government. And he has recently received criticism for spending less time at City Hall and for his hands-off management style.
1562,"Mr. Johnson, who has been an enthusiastic supporter of Fair Fares, has not yet joined in the chorus of criticism over the start of the program. His office said in a statement on Wednesday that Mr. Johnson was “working to make sure that Fair Fares is a success.”"
1563,"“The Council has always believed that this program is for all New Yorkers living at or below the federal poverty line, and is committed to making sure that vision becomes a reality,” said Breeana Mulligan, a Council spokeswoman."
1564,"Mr. Jones, who was appointed to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board by Mr. de Blasio, said the discount program was urgently needed, especially since fares are expected to rise again in March. The base fare for subways and buses could jump to $3."
1565,"“This starts to become serious money for people,” Mr. Jones said."
1566,"As many as 800,000 people could qualify for the program, according to a report by the Community Service Society. The program could eventually cost $250 million each year."
1567,"Mr. de Blasio had liked the idea of a discounted fare, but he did not want the city to be responsible for its costs. Instead, he wanted to pay for it by resurrecting one of his favorite ideas, a new tax on millionaires. But that would have to be passed by the state legislature, an unrealistic scenario last year given that the Senate was controlled by Republicans until Democrats retook the chamber in November."
1568,The concept of offering transit discounts for low-income riders is gaining momentum in other cities. Seattle started a program in 2015 that has served as a model for other cities. Toronto is implementing a similar plan.
1569,"In New York, the lack of information this week sowed confusion. When someone asked an M.T.A. Twitter account how to get an application for the Fair Fare program, the subway account said to contact 311, the number for information about city services."
1570,"A spokesman for the mayor, Eric Phillips, had to clarify. He said the program had not started yet, but when it did, services like 311 would have the details."
1571,"“But we aren’t there yet,” he said on Twitter. “Stay tuned!”"
1572,"SAN DIEGO — Migrants who are allowed to remain in the United States to pursue asylum are usually given a choice when they are released from detention in San Diego: Go to the Greyhound bus station and fend for themselves, or try to find a cot and a shower at a local shelter."
1573,"One way or another, once the migrants have been dropped off by discreet white Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans in border towns across the Southwest, they are no longer the federal government’s problem."
1574,"President Trump has tried and failed to end a practice he derisively calls “catch and release,” and thousands of undocumented migrants apprehended at the border every month are still being granted routine entry to the United States while their cases are processed by immigration courts."
1575,"But as the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the government’s detention facilities, the Trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants’ safety after they are released. People working along the border say an ever larger number of families are being released with nowhere to stay, no money, no food and no means of getting to friends and relatives who may be hundreds or thousands of miles away."
1576,"Federal officials say they are unable to do more to help the migrants, and local governments have often been hesitant to get involved because of cost and potential liability."
1577,"Stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities, expanding along the border from California to Texas. Dating back well into the Obama administration, when the surge in migrant families began, these churches and other nongovernmental organizations have strung together millions of dollars worth of assistance to help keep migrants off the streets and speed their reunion with family members in the United States."
1578,"“The government isn’t doing anything — it’s been a total make-it-up-as-we-go thing,” said Kevin Malone, one of the founders of the San Diego Rapid Response Network, a consortium of faith-based nonprofits in the area. “People are working 24 hours a day trying to make this happen. Everyone is strapped.”"
1579,"While there has never been a good solution to the issue of what to do with migrants after they are released by immigration agents, recent steps by the Trump administration have exacerbated the situation."
1580,"Undocumented migrants are held initially at Border Patrol and ICE facilities as their claims for asylum are registered. Previously, government agents would help coordinate plans for their release, contacting family members in American cities and helping secure transportation, even sometimes paying for bus tickets. When charity-operated shelters were full, government agencies sometimes held them a little longer, until they could be transferred."
1581,"Those practices, known collectively as “safe release,” ended in October, according to a statement from ICE, because the agency has become overwhelmed by the number of migrants it has to process."
1582,"Part of the problem, government officials say, is that the courts have established a limit of 20 days for holding migrant children in detention, and the government has a very limited number of detention facilities that can handle both adults and children. An earlier attempt to detain them separately was struck down by the courts and rescinded. Waiting to coordinate releases with charity shelters can result in migrant families being held in detention for too long, officials say."
1583,"“After decades of inaction by Congress, the government remains severely constrained in its ability to detain and promptly remove families with no legal basis to remain in the U.S.,” the agency said. “To mitigate the risk of holding family units past the time frame allotted to the government, ICE has curtailed reviews of post-release plans from families apprehended along the southwest border.”"
1584,Yet those now trying to help the migrants say the government has abandoned its moral responsibility to make sure they are released safely.
1585,"Under President Obama, the government also had no infrastructure to provide services to newly released migrants; instead it relied on a cooperative relationship with private shelter operators. Now, the shelter operators say, that cooperation has become fraught."
1586,"Some charity networks have had to quickly become experts in refugee aid in American border towns. They provide showers, nutrition and clean clothes. Many “guests,” as the volunteers call the migrants, arrive hungry, sick or traumatized. They need fresh diapers for their infants and clean clothes for their older children."
1587,"The sole shelter in San Diego, run by Jewish Family Service of San Diego, has processed nearly 5,000 asylum applicants since it began operating two months ago. It was built “on a wing and a prayer,” according to Mr. Malone, and has had to move five times to find adequate space. Newly arrived migrants are provided with austere blue cots, portable showers and donated bread and fruit. They are also screened for illnesses."
1588,"Kate Clark, the director of immigration services at Jewish Family Service, said the organization stepped in nine weeks ago when it learned migrants were being “dumped at the border.” But despite California’s political leaders talking about being receptive to migrants, “every single night, our ability to ensure that none of the migrants are sleeping on the street is questionable, because of the capacity of our shelters,” Ms. Clark said."
1589,"Their operating costs run between $350,000 and $400,000 a month, largely raised by faith organizations and a GoFundMe account. Still, on days when 100 or more refugees are dropped off, they have little option, because of capacity constraints, other than to turn away families and leave them homeless."
1590,"“It’s been a difficult couple of years, but there’s never been anything like this,” said Etleva Bejko, the director of refugee services at the organization."
1591,"The charities have also had to learn how to cope with the illnesses that migrants can develop during the difficult journey from Central America, which many make on buses and on foot."
1592,"Marcela Wash, a registered nurse who has helped treat migrants in San Diego, said that many arrive dehydrated and in various states of medical distress. Rashes, scabies, and respiratory infections have been extremely common, she said. She estimated that 80 percent of the women she saw had lice."
1593,"“Their journeys were hard, of course, but many of these things they caught either at a shelter in Tijuana or in detention,” she said."
1594,"Once migrants are healthy enough to travel, the shelter pays to transport them to join relatives wherever they are in the country, while their cases proceed in court."
1595,"Some border towns have a more established base of nonprofit assistance for migrants, but they too have seen demands grow in recent months."
1596,"In El Paso, the Annunciation House has coordinated migrant releases with ICE for years. The migrants typically stay for a few days at the charity’s main building or at one of nearly two dozen churches, hotels and other sites that are part of its shelter network. In recent months, the charity has been assisting about 2,200 migrants a week in El Paso."
1597,"On a recent afternoon, the shelter’s headquarters, a red brick building about a mile from the border, bustled with activity, part migrant dormitory, part cafeteria and part triage center. Upstairs, a worker holding bundles of laundry walked past family dorm rooms with bunk beds, as the aroma of a dinner being prepared filled the halls. Downstairs, migrant families waiting for a ride to the bus station kept busy by helping to unload a UPS truck parked outside. A new batch of donations had arrived, to add to the towers of Amazon boxes full of clothing and other goods that people around the country had donated."
1598,"The cost of these operations can be crushing. In just two Texas border regions — the El Paso and McAllen areas — several Catholic groups, charities and local governments have spent roughly $2 million in recent years on migrant relief efforts."
1599,"On Friday, Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, was preparing to pay for several rooms at a hotel for the next seven days to handle an overflow of migrants from their shelter. The tab came to about $14,000. Depending on the number of migrants ICE releases, the shelter’s hotel expenses can climb as high as $150,000 a month."
1600,"Bureaucracy and politics can tie up more significant investments at the local level. Mr. Malone, the executive director of the San Diego Organizing Project, said San Diego municipal and county officials have suggested to him they have been waiting for the state to officially declare a crisis to lend a hand. He presumed that had to do with the bottom line."
1601,"“It became just a bunch of people pointing fingers,” said Mr. Malone. “And at the end of the day, the other question was, ‘Who is going to pay the check?’ That’s the real reason that no one talked about.”"
1602,"The California Department of Social Services gave the shelter $500,000, but the money could only be used for “case management,” including intake, registration and “know your rights” orientations. It could not be used for most of the shelter’s operating costs, or for transportation costs for the migrants, one of the primary needs. San Diego County has provided medical guidance and nursing and support staff."
1603,"“We want to help prevent a crisis,” Mr. Malone said. “It’s been our crisis, and I’ve been telling them, soon it’s going to be yours.”"
1604,Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
1605,"The city of McAllen, Tex., which has seen the largest number of migrant families during the recent surge, has contributed $517,000 since 2014 toward a relief effort run largely by Catholic Charities."
1606,"In El Paso, city leaders were forced to act after federal officials made a series of unannounced nighttime releases of hundreds of migrants during Christmas week. The city officials put migrants on municipal buses to keep them warm, took them to shelter sites and coordinated the response with the local Office of Emergency Management. El Paso officials were told that none of the cost would be reimbursed by the federal government."
1607,"“It’s kind of hard to ask the federal government for emergency relief when they’re creating the problem to begin with,” Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, said at a recent City Council meeting."
1608,"Mr. Garcia, who runs Annunciation House, said that in October, for the first time since 2014 that he could remember, there were several releases of migrants onto the streets of El Paso without any coordination."
1609,"“I started getting calls from the police department, and everybody and their grandmother was calling me to figure out what was going on,” he said. “I wish to God you could get into one of their offices to ask them, ‘What in the world were you thinking when you did that? What was the objective?’”"

1611,"Mayor Bill de Blasio threw his support behind congestion pricing on Tuesday as the best option to raise money for New York City’s failing subway, announcing an unusual alliance with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his frequent rival, to fix the system."
1612,"Their joining forces could give congestion pricing momentum as state lawmakers debate whether to embrace Mr. Cuomo’s proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. The idea has long faced difficult odds in Albany, and a proposal by former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was defeated a decade ago."
1613,"But with the subway in crisis and the streets of Manhattan choked by traffic, Mr. Cuomo has argued that the proposal is the best option for raising billions of dollars and reducing congestion. For months, Mr. de Blasio had resisted endorsing congestion pricing and instead favored a tax on wealthy New Yorkers."
1614,"With state lawmakers facing an April 1 deadline to consider congestion pricing as part of the budget, Mr. de Blasio decided to back the idea to help mitigate the region’s transportation crisis."
1615,"“This crisis runs deeper than ever before,” the mayor said in a statement, “and it’s now clear there is no way to address it without congestion pricing and other dedicated revenue streams.”"
1616,"Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio, two Democrats who are often bitter opponents, put aside their differences to show unified support for congestion pricing in the hope of persuading Democratic legislative leaders to rally their members. Democrats control both the Senate and Assembly for the first time in years, but some lawmakers are reluctant to approve new tolls, fearing a backlash from drivers."
1617,"Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio released a 10-point plan that called for reorganizing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads. They also proposed two new funding sources for the transit system: a tax on recreational marijuana sales, if they are legalized in New York, and an internet sales tax."
1618,"The two leaders embraced an idea that is popular among subway riders: using revenue from a state tax on cannabis sales in New York City to pay for subway upgrades, which state officials said could generate $125 million per year for the system. A separate tax on purchases like furniture from online retailers could raise an additional $320 million per year. Those two sources could allow the authority to issue bonds to raise $7 billion. Congestion pricing is expected to generate $15 billion, for a possible total of $22 billion in new revenue for the transit system, officials said."
1619,"Transit advocates, who have been pressing for new revenue sources for months, praised the plan."
1620,"“The governor and mayor are working together to address the transit crisis, and now we need the Senate and Assembly to do their part and pass congestion pricing as part of this year’s budget,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group."
1621,"On Tuesday afternoon, Carl E. Heastie, the Assembly speaker and a Democrat from the Bronx, said there was more support for congestion pricing in his conference than in years past, but that there were ample questions about the plan."
1622,"“I think there’s still many concerns from members, particularly those members in Queens and Brooklyn, who represent transit deserts,” Mr. Heastie said in Albany. “So, I would say more people are open to it, but by no means is it a fait accompli.”"
1623,"Without congestion pricing, Mr. Cuomo has warned that subway and bus fares could rise by 30 percent. Transit leaders say they are facing a huge budget deficit and need billions of dollars to upgrade the aging system."
1624,The authority’s board is expected to vote on Wednesday to approve a fare and toll increase of about 4 percent. The plan from Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio urged the agency to continue its practice of limiting fare increases to 4 percent every two years.
1625,"Their plan did not say how high congestion tolls might be, but they would not likely take effect until 2021. A task force created by Mr. Cuomo proposed last year that drivers pay $11.52 to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street."
1626,"Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, has called for city control of the subway and, in a statement, criticized the plan by Mr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio."
1627,"“While I am glad to see the Mayor finally taking an interest in congestion pricing and the Governor being open to M.T.A. reform, I strongly disagree with the idea that giving the State more control of City generated revenue and our transit infrastructure is going to magically solve our problems,” Mr. Johnson said."
1628,[Is 2019 the year when New York passes congestion pricing?]
1629,"Mr. Cuomo said the joint proposal addressed some concerns raised by past congestion-pricing plans. It calls for charging lower tolls outside of the rush hour and establishing tolls to enter Manhattan’s central business district rather than tolling the East River bridges. A driver could, for instance, cross the Brooklyn Bridge and take the F.D.R. Drive north, without paying the congestion fee."
1630,"“This is a different plan, I think, than previous congestion-pricing plans,” Mr. Cuomo said in a radio interview. “The mayor has a number of issues that he felt strongly about and so did I.”"
1631,"Congestion pricing, which has been embraced by cities including London, Singapore and Stockholm, has been debated in New York City since at least the 1970s."
1632,"The plan calls for toll exemptions for certain groups: emergency vehicles, vehicles transporting people with disabilities, and people who have an “identifiable hardship” or limited access to medical facilities within the congestion zone. It would also establish a “regional transit committee” to review toll and fare increases, and move to centralize legal and human resources work for various M.T.A. agencies."
1633,"Revenue from congestion pricing, the cannabis tax and the internet sales tax would be put in a “lockbox” for the authority’s capital plans, which pay for repairs and upgrades across the network. The top priorities will be the subway, accessibility, buses and the expansion of transit in the boroughs outside Manhattan."
1634,"The plan will face hard questions in the state Legislature, particularly in the Assembly, where Democratic leaders have expressed concerns about the effect of congestion pricing on commuters not well served by public transit."
1635,"In the Senate, leaders have been at war with Mr. Cuomo after the collapse of an agreement to build a campus for Amazon in Queens. Mr. Cuomo has blamed Senate Democrats for scuttling the deal — he did so again on Tuesday — and neither the Assembly or the Senate offered an immediate endorsement of the 10-point plan, with representatives from both chambers saying it was too early to gauge its chances."
1636,"Still, Mike Murphy, a spokesman for the Senate, said his conference would work with the Assembly, the governor and the mayor to “finally move forward on solutions to the M.T.A. catastrophe.”"
1637,"“Clearly, there is a crucial need for a dedicated stream of revenue to fix the crumbling M.T.A.,” Mr. Murphy added."
1638,"Mr. Heastie also seemed skeptical about spending money from any marijuana plan on subway repairs, saying that cannabis revenue should instead be directed toward low-income communities “that have been impacted by criminal justice issues.”"
1639,"On Tuesday, Mr. Heastie said he “was very clear with the governor and the mayor” that any marijuana revenue should first go to “community investment.”"
1640,"The M.T.A.’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, said he supported the plan, which included measures to reform an agency known for sky-high construction costs and a lethargic bureaucracy."
1641,"“This proposal is a holistic cure for much of what ails the M.T.A.,” Mr. Ferrer said in a statement, “and I hope to see it enacted swiftly for the benefit of our 8.5 million daily customers.”"

1643,"When New York City’s transportation commissioner returned from a recent trip to California, she seemed downright jealous. There were electric scooters in Oakland. New train lines in Los Angeles. Self-driving cars in the Bay Area. She tried them all."
1644,"“It is an incredibly exciting time to be in urban transportation,” the commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, told a breakfast gathering of powerful New Yorkers, pointing to California’s progress."
1645,Her glee signaled a noteworthy and sobering shift. Wasn’t it her city that was once the envy of the nation when it came to transportation?
1646,"Not anymore. The subways on the East Coast that allowed New York, Washington and Boston to thrive are showing their age and suffering from years of neglect, while cities on the West Coast are moving quickly to expand and improve their networks."
1647,"The Los Angeles area, the ultimate car-centric region with its sprawling freeways, approved a sweeping $120 billion plan to build new train routes and upgrade its buses. Seattle has won accolades for its transit system, where 93 percent of riders report being happy with service — a feat that seems unimaginable in New York, where subway riders regularly simmer with rage on stalled trains."
1648,"“It’s a tale of two systems,” said Robert Puentes, the president of the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonpartisan research center in Washington. “These new ones are growing and haven’t started to experience the pains of rehabilitation.”"
1649,"In New York, Ms. Trottenberg returned to a laundry list of messes: a subway crisis, buses that move at a snail’s pace, the looming shutdown of the L train between Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the rebuilding of the dilapidated Brooklyn-Queens Expressway."
1650,"“There is a political will to invest in expansion” on the West Coast, Ms. Trottenberg said in an interview, though she noted that New York’s system was still the country’s largest by far. Its daily subway and bus ridership of nearly 8 million dwarfs Los Angeles’s 1.2 million riders."
1651,"Still, transit systems on the East Coast are losing ridership. New York’s subway has not expanded in decades, besides a handful of new stations in Manhattan — one on the Far West Side and three on the Upper East Side."
1652,"City officials have been reluctant to embrace electric scooters or self-driving cars, even as scooters have become a popular way to get around a growing roster of cities — including Austin, Tex., and Detroit — and provide an alternative to sitting in clogged traffic. A proposal by Mayor Bill de Blasio for a streetcar in Brooklyn and Queens appears to be stalled."
1653,"There is at least one bright spot: Citi Bike has become an essential part of the city’s fabric. The bike-share system has 12,000 bikes across Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens and recently announced plans to expand under new ownership by the ride-hail company Lyft, which will triple the number of bikes."
1654,"Only a decade ago, the New York region was flying high. More than 90 percent of subway trains were on time, compared to about 70 percent today. In the 1990s, New Jersey Transit won a coveted award three times from the American Public Transportation Association."
1655,"But in recent years, the East Coast has been notably absent from the awards ceremony, the Oscars of public transportation. Cities including Seattle, Salt Lake City and Houston have captured the title of outstanding transit system."
1656,"“In some of these growing communities like L.A. and Seattle, they haven’t been blessed with great infrastructure, and they’re trying to play catch up, frankly,” Paul Skoutelas, the association’s president, said."
1657,"When Seattle’s King County Metro won the award in September, it was praised as “a system that is expanding and innovating to meet rising demand” — not to mention a program that offers lower fares for poor riders that has served as a model for New York and other cities. Transit ridership in Seattle is growing, and car use is down."
1658,"One key difference is the West Coast has the ballot measure, while New York State does not allow voters to directly approve measures like transit funding. In 2016, both Los Angeles County and the Seattle region approved measures to boost transportation funding. The Los Angeles proposal, known as Measure M, won nearly 70 percent of the vote, greenlighting $120 billion in spending by raising the sales tax."
1659,"“The ballot initiative allows them to proceed without the political angst you’d have in Albany,” said Jon Orcutt, a director at TransitCenter, a research group in New York. “It takes some pressure off politicians. The voters go out and do it, and that creates political cover.”"
1660,"Los Angeles plans to build 100 new miles of rail — essentially doubling the Metro system, whose first rail line opened in 1990. There are now six lines and 93 stations. Huge machines recently began digging new tunnels for a Purple Line extension to the county’s Westside — part of a plan to attract younger people who are more likely to favor transit and worry about the environmental impact of cars."
1661,"“We had a political miracle,” Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, said in an interview. “A permanent 1-cent sales tax.”"
1662,"Mr. Garcetti, a Democrat, hopes the new rail lines will boost transit ridership. The number of train and bus trips in Los Angeles has dropped in recent years, though he blamed that on low gas prices and national trends in declining transit ridership."
1663,"Mr. Garcetti makes a point of using the subway. He took the Red Line recently, from City Hall to MacArthur Park, to visit Langer’s for the city’s “best pastrami sandwich.” He is also deciding how best to regulate the electric scooters that have flooded Los Angeles."
1664,"“I want to make them work,” he said. “I’m excited by them. They’re generally taking car trips off the road.”"
1665,"New York has unique challenges when it comes to funding and governance, Ms. Trottenberg said. In Los Angeles, the transit system is controlled by Mr. Garcetti, while New York’s subway is controlled by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state lawmakers, many of whom rarely use the system and have shown little interest in making it a priority."
1666,"If New Yorkers had been asked to approve new transit funding in a ballot measure during the midterm election, Ms. Trottenberg believes it would have won."
1667,"“It would have to be a mixture so that we’re fixing the old, and you have to put in some new things in, too,” she said."
1668,"Instead, the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, is pleading with state leaders to approve new revenue sources when they return to Albany in January. Mr. Byford says it will cost more than $40 billion to fix the system — a figure that does not include any expansion or new lines."
1669,"In Seattle, a $54 billion ballot measure approved two years ago will help extend the region’s light rail system to 116 miles from about 20 miles."
1670,"Dow Constantine, the executive of King County, which is home to Seattle, said the city’s culture was changing, too."
1671,"“Folks are tired of sitting in traffic,” Mr. Constantine, a Democrat, said. “They’re mindful of the environmental implications of driving.”"
1672,"Seattle also wants to learn from the East Coast’s mistakes, Mr. Constantine said."
1673,"“I made sure we included funding for long-term maintenance,” he said, “so you don’t get the situation we’re seeing in New York and Washington where the systems have been neglected and it’s expensive and inconvenient to rebuild.”"
1674,"At long last, New York is getting what it deserves: broad agreement from Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to address the subway crisis that has frustrated millions of people and hobbled the economy of the largest city in the United States."
1675,"The two men, both Democrats, have wasted years in a damaging rivalry that has stymied progress on crucial infrastructure, like mass transit and housing. On Tuesday, they overcame their animus and released a plan to raise revenue for long overdue subway repairs and to reform the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways, buses and the region’s commuter rails."
1676,"At the heart of the proposal is a version of congestion pricing, which Mr. de Blasio finally backed outright for the first time — reason enough to cheer. Also included in the proposal are revenue from planned sales taxes on marijuana — which the Legislature is expected to legalize soon in the state — and money from an internet sales tax. The plan calls for loosely limiting fare increases to inflation of no more than 2 percent a year."
1677,"State and city officials said the $1.4 billion a year raised by the plan could be used to back bonds of $20 billion to $22 billion over five years, roughly the estimate of many advocates of congestion pricing as well. According to a news release from the governor and mayor, those new funds would be dedicated to the M.T.A.’s capital needs, “with priority given to the subway system.” Fare increases would go toward running the subways and buses. "
1678,"Now, state legislators will have to approve the plan, but votes for congestion pricing could be hard to come by. It will be up to the governor, as well as the State Senate majority leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins,  and the Assembly speaker, Carl Heastie, to persuade their colleagues of its merits. This latest plan still leaves several details to be determined, but concessions have already been made — for example, it doesn’t include tolls on East River bridges, as past versions have, instead digitally collecting a fee only on vehicles that enter the busiest part of Manhattan, below 61st Street. The mayor can use his bully pulpit to push for the plan."
1679,"As the legislation takes shape in the coming weeks, there are several other things to look out for: "
1680," While avoiding tolls on the East River bridges may make the plan more appealing to state lawmakers and others, it also leaves money on the table that the transit system needs."
1681,"The subways serve the most riders and are in the gravest state of disrepair. They need the most help. Because of that, the legislation ought to include a guarantee that an overwhelming majority of money generated by this plan will be permanently allocated for the subway system. The rest of the money, say 20 percent, could be used to upgrade commuter rails and improve service in so-called transit deserts in the boroughs outside Manhattan."
1682,"The proposal calls for the consolidation of the six entities within the M.T.A., a smart move that could cut costs and make the authority more efficient. Yet finding the deepest savings may require the state to renegotiate contracts with transit unions to change work rules. Ultimately, it may also mean consolidating the workforces of the Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North Railroad. And as the state changes the way contracts for major projects are negotiated — a needed fix — there should be far more transparency about bidding and procurement processes. More transparency is also needed around where the agency’s dollars actually go, and how they benefit subway riders compared with commuter rail passengers. An independent audit called for under the proposal is a good place to begin, but the public should be able to easily review these figures in the long-term as well."
1683,"State lawmakers may want to consider adding other sources of revenue. Reinstating the 0.45 percent commuter tax on the incomes of people who live in the New York suburbs would be one good idea. A former M.T.A. chairman has said the agency contributes seven times more to each Long Island Rail Road ride, and four times more to each Metro-North Railroad ride, than to each subway ride. Another idea worth considering is to tax second homes in New York City worth $5 million or more, known as the pied-à-terre tax."
1684,"Does the M.T.A. need to create a six-member oversight board for capital construction and congestion pricing, as the proposal suggests? It’s an idea that deserves careful consideration, especially since the purpose of the restructuring is to create clear accountability for the agency, not add more bureaucracy."
1685,"So there is work to do. But this latest proposal from the governor and the mayor is also the first sign that New York’s elected officials may indeed be capable of rising to meet the state’s most pressing challenges. Let’s hope the Legislature is, too. "

1710,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Facebook employees woke up on Wednesday morning, many found they could not perform even the most basic work tasks."
1711,Their calendars were not working. Nor were campus maps that help people find their co-workers. They were unable to check Facebook’s latest shuttle bus schedule. And they could not see what the company’s cafeterias were serving for lunch.
1712,"That’s because those features run on Facebook’s internal, custom-built iPhone apps — and Apple had shut them all down, according to nine current and former employees of the companies, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly."
1713,"The situation stemmed from a dispute after Facebook violated Apple’s rules by publicly distributing a research app that allowed it to snoop on users’ online activity. When Apple discovered the transgression this week, it revoked Facebook’s special access to apps and updates that run on its iPhone software."
1714,"That immediately cut off Facebook’s 35,000 workers from its internal iPhone apps. And the problem snowballed when mobile apps like Workplace and Messenger — two internal communication tools — also stopped working, frustrating employees and resulting in hours of lost productivity."
1715,"Late Thursday, Apple relented and restored Facebook’s access. Yet the episode was a stark reminder of where the power really lies in the technology world. While Facebook is the world’s biggest social network, Apple controls the distribution of apps — including Facebook’s — on its phones. That power is a longstanding concern for Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s founder and chief executive, making his company beholden to the rules of others."
1716,"The spat underscored the tensions between two of Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies, which have competed for years over talent and new technologies. Recently, each has taken potshots at the other over data privacy, with Apple’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, trading slights with Mr. Zuckerberg in interviews. Facebook also worked last year with a public-relations firm, Definers Public Affairs, to urge reporters to scrutinize Apple and other tech companies. And Apple has made changes to some of its tech features that limit the ability of Facebook and others to track users."
1717,"Apple did not immediately have a comment on Thursday after reinstating Facebook’s access to its internal apps. In a statement, Facebook said it was “getting our internal apps up and running” and added, “To be clear, this didn’t have an impact on our consumer-facing services.”"
1718,"In an interview on Wednesday, Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, said of the dispute with Apple, “Obviously we want to be in full compliance with all of our partners.” She added that the Facebook research app at issue hadn’t been a secret and had been operated only with its users’ consent."
1719,"Apple also briefly demonstrated its power on Thursday with another Silicon Valley giant, Google. Like Facebook, Google had violated Apple’s rules by publicly distributing an app, Screenwise Meter, through a special Apple developer program. The internet search company said some of its internal apps that run on iPhone software were temporarily disrupted."
1720,"Two Google employees, who declined to be identified because they were not allowed to speak publicly on the matter, said iPhone apps for internal services like hailing a bus or viewing cafeteria information were not working. In addition, apps testing unreleased updates of Google products such as Gmail and Google Maps were unavailable, these people said. The disruptions were earlier reported by the technology website The Verge."
1721,"A Google spokeswoman, Suzanne Blackburn, said in a statement that the company expected the issue to be resolved “soon.” A spokesman for Apple, Tom Neumayr, said it was working with Google to reinstate access “very quickly.” He declined to comment on whether Apple had revoked Google’s access or if it was a technical glitch."
1722,"Apple’s dispute with Facebook this week was rooted in the social network’s practice of scooping up information on its users’ practices, a way for it to gain insight into their digital habits so it can improve products to keep consumers regularly coming back to its site."
1723,"In 2013, Facebook acquired Onavo, an Israeli company that collected information on how customers used every app on their phones. Onavo’s findings helped Facebook executives predict which apps were rising and trending across App Stores."
1724,"That gave Mr. Zuckerberg, who colleagues have said was highly dependent on the data, the foresight to try to buy Snapchat long before it went public. Although that effort failed, Facebook has built products, like live video streams and group video chat, based on information gleaned from Onavo’s app."
1725,"Last year, Apple updated some of its privacy policies and forced Facebook to remove Onavo’s app from its App Store. But Onavo had other ways of collecting consumer data that bypassed some of Apple’s restrictions."
1726,"In 2016, the Onavo team had created a research app that vacuumed up all of a user’s phone and web activity; Facebook paid people ages 13 to 35 to install it. Then Facebook distributed the app under an Apple program with a special approval process if apps are used only for internal testing."
1727,"On Tuesday, the technology news site TechCrunch published a report detailing Facebook’s research app and its public use, which violated the rules of Apple’s program. Facebook immediately pushed back on privacy concerns and said it was not tricking users with the research app."
1728,"“There was nothing ‘secret’ about this; it was literally called the Facebook Research App,” Arielle Argyres, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement. “It wasn’t ‘spying’ as all of the people who signed up to participate went through a clear on-boarding process asking for their permission and were paid to participate.”"
1729,She added that fewer than 5 percent of users in the research program were teenagers and that all had obtained signed parental consent forms.
1730,"But Facebook had no comeback for sidestepping Apple’s rules. On Wednesday morning, Apple revoked Facebook’s “enterprise developer certificate” and paralyzed the social giant from deploying its internal iPhone apps."
1731,"“Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple,” Tammy Levine, an Apple spokeswoman, said at the time. “Any developer using their enterprise certificates to distribute apps to consumers will have their certificates revoked, which is what we did in this case to protect our users and their data.”"
1732,"Apple has been dealing with its own privacy problems. This week, a bug was discovered in its FaceTime app, whereby people could spy on the video and audio FaceTime calls of other users. Apple has pledged to fix the problem by the end of this week."
1733,"After Apple’s revocation, employees inside Facebook became furious with the Onavo team, according to four people familiar with the company’s deliberations. Some said they would have to wait weeks to get app updates or changes approved through Apple’s App Store. Several employees in Facebook’s hardware division said they were considering quitting because they could not get any work done."
1734,"Late Thursday, after Apple relented, Facebook employees began seeing the next day’s lunch menu again, as well as their calendars and their shuttle bus schedules. Still, they said, Apple had made its point."
1735,Rockefeller Center has long had a springtime ritual of displaying contemporary art — one work. Last year’s piece was by the German artist Anselm Kiefer.
1736,"This year, it will display 20, starting on April 25, through an arrangement with Frieze, the media and events company whose Frieze New York art fair will begin a week later, on May 2. EB Kelly, a managing director of Tishman Speyer, the real estate firm that controls Rockefeller Center, said a shuttle for art-fair patrons would run from Rockefeller Center to Frieze New York on Randalls Island, in the shadow of the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge."
1737,"The works bound for Rockefeller Center include several by the Polish-born Goshka Macuga, a set of sculptures by the American artist Walter De Maria, and four pieces by the Brazilian Conceptualist Paulo Nazareth depicting figures from the American civil rights movement: the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; Rosa Parks, who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala.; Tommie Smith, a sprinter who gave a black power salute at the 1968 Olympics; and Ruby Bridges, the first black child to integrate an elementary school in the South, in New Orleans in 1960."
1738,"Brett Littman, director of the Noguchi Museum in Queens, will curate the Rockefeller Center display, selecting and placing the works on the site."
1739,"“The plaza gets half a million people through it every day,” said Loring Randolph, the artistic director of the Americas for Frieze Art Fairs. “There couldn’t be a better place for the artists to have better exposure.”"
1740,Ms. Kelly of Tishman Speyer said Rockefeller Center moved to expand its spring display because “we decided to think about Rockefeller Center as a campus.”
1741,"That will mean putting artworks not just in the Channel Gardens, the central axis leading from Fifth Avenue to 30 Rockfeller Plaza, “but in locations where we’d never thought about art before,” like lobbies and planters, she said."
1742,"Even the flagpoles will play a part in the display, for an untitled work by the Ghanaian artist Ibrahim Mahama, who created a nearly 1,000-foot-long installation with jute bags at the Venice Biennale in 2015."
1743,I will die before I buy another car.
1744,"I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend."
1745,"Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?"
1746,Finished. 
1747,[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]
1748,"This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think."
1749,"Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. "
1750,"But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. "
1751,"That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought."
1752,"I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”"
1753,"But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank."
1754,"Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?"
1755,Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.
1756,"But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. "
1757,"Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon."
1758,"Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized."
1759,"That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all."
1760,"It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)"
1761,"It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. "
1762,"Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. "
1763,"But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not."
1764,"Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all. Anyone interested in a car with a loose clutch?"

1767,"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. — Dominic Smith, the somnolent first baseman for the Mets, strapped a new sleep apnea mask over his hair on a recent night, unfurled a five-foot hose affixed to an airway pressure machine and pressed the power button."
1768,Air streamed into his mouth and nose to force his airways open with pressure from the mask. He spoke of the apparatus like a new glove.
1769,"“Still breaking it in,” he said, lying on his back in a king-size bed at his rental house."
1770,"While this mask was new, Smith’s struggle to get a good night’s sleep dates back to high school. He learned he had sleep apnea in 2016 while in Class AA."
1771,"But when Smith reported to spring training this season ready to compete for the Mets’ starting first-base job, Brian Chicklo, the Mets’ head trainer, asked Smith about his repeated awakening and pauses in breathing at night, as well as his chronic sleepiness during the day. Chicklo also inquired about the mask. Smith, drafted No. 11 overall by the Mets in 2013, had not worn it in more than a year."
1772,"“I was just really focused on working out,” he said. “I didn’t make it a priority.”"
1773,"The Mets knew that was a problem. After the team reviewed Smith’s performance last season, when he posted nearly as many fielding errors (four) as home runs (five) in 56 major league games, Chicklo arranged for Smith to undergo a sleep study at a local test site upon arrival in camp."
1774,"Smith reported to the site at 6 p.m. after a daylong workout. In a small room with a bed, television, desk and chair, a nurse attached six monitoring wires to his head, two to his chest, two to each leg and one on his finger."
1775,"“They’re like, ‘Go to sleep,’ ” Smith said, “And I’m like, ‘Go to sleep? How am I going to go to sleep hooked up to all this stuff?’ ”"
1776,"After he managed to drift off, the test revealed that Smith stopped breathing 90 times every hour, a sign of sleep apnea. A doctor explained that severe cases start at 30 stoppages."
1777,"“They asked me, ‘How do you function?’ ” Smith said. “We chuckled about it. I was like, ‘I don’t know. I just feel normal. Get you some coffee.’ ”"
1778,"Smith, 23, started using the mask again a month ago to help him breathe at night and get more rest. He is going to need it; he is locked in a four-man race to start at first base this season. His spring awakening — a .400 batting average, 8 R.B.I. and alert play in the field heading into Sunday’s game — has turned heads, but he still faces stiff competition: The Mets’ top prospect, Pete Alonso, commenced the position battle by hitting a home run in his first at-bat of Grapefruit League play."
1779,"Last year, Manager Mickey Callaway scratched Smith from the lineup in the first spring game because Smith showed up late for the team’s 8:45 a.m. meeting. His untreated sleep apnea kept him drowsy and languishing in bed in the mornings instead of out the door. Now, Smith arrives at the facility by 6:15 a.m. most days. His bat is awake, as well."
1780,"“All of a sudden, we have a guy that’s unconscious out there,” Callaway said."
1781,"Smith has known for a while that he needed a jolt, but his handling of his sleep problems had been inconsistent. He first noticed breathing problems on New Year’s night in 2013, when he was a senior at Junipero Serra High School near Los Angeles. He woke up in the middle of the night and went into the room where his mother, Yvette LaFleur, was asleep."
1782,"“I swear I was just suffocating,” he said."
1783,"Smith came from a long line of snorers skeptical of doctors. He originally thought it was a tonsil issue, and was prescribed antibiotics. He did not even know what sleep apnea was until a doctor told him after he was drafted in 2013 that he might have a “mild case.”"
1784,"Even then, Smith didn’t make much of the diagnosis because he believed it would not affect him until at least middle age. On bus rides in rookie leagues and Class A over the next two years, he would fall asleep during conversations with teammates, who recorded his loud snoring. Smith could not recall where or when he had fallen asleep. Research studies have linked sleep apnea to memory loss and cognitive decline, as well."
1785,"“It’s to the point where people don’t even record me no more,” he said. “Planes, I was out. Hotel room, out. I was like, dang, we were just chilling. I don’t know how I fell asleep. What happened? Legit amnesia.”"
1786,"The sleeping issue was finally addressed when he reached Class AA Binghamton in 2016. He missed one game with the Rumble Ponies for an overnight sleep study and was told he had sleep apnea. He was given a continuous positive airway pressure machine, known as a CPAP, to help."
1787,"He used it for about a year before lapsing. During his professional career, weight had also become an issue. When he was drafted out of high school, he weighed 185 pounds and stood just under six feet tall. By 2016, he tipped the scales at 260 pounds. Weight gain has been linked to sleep apnea, and Smith noted that eating fast food on 3 a.m. bus rides through the minor leagues did not help his condition. Before entering camp last year, Smith adapted to a more disciplined diet. Out went pizza; in came brown rice and broccoli. Having lost weight, Smith believed he no longer needed the mask. For stimulation, he consumed coffee and 5-Hour Energy shots and experimented with workout supplements like P4 and Fast Twitch."
1788,"Still, he sometimes fell asleep at the wheel while stopped at red lights."
1789,"“Someone would say, hey, it’s a green light,” he said. “I’m like, oh shoot!”"
1790,"Smith also noted a disruption in his insurance coverage. When he was first promoted to the major leagues in August 2017, his insurance carrier changed from Blue Cross Blue Shield, which covered his first sleep apnea machine, to Aetna, which he said did not cover it. Focused on workouts, he pushed off finding a resolution and sought alternate sources of energy like coffee. He often crashed."
1791,"“By the time the game was over, I was so exhausted,” he said."
1792,"Consistency remains the greatest question about Smith. Brodie Van Wagenen, the team’s new general manager, and members of his front office detected an ebb in Smith’s performance early this spring when Smith struck out three times in a game. Afterward, in the clubhouse, Van Wagenen approached Smith at his locker."
1793,"“You didn’t wear your mask last night, did you?” Van Wagenen said."
1794,"Smith, who must use the mask at least four times a week for approximately five hours or his health care provider will stop paying for it, acknowledged that he had not. The mask, after all, can be irritating, and it requires him to sleep on his back instead of his stomach or side, as he is used to."
1795,Van Wagenen told him that his presence at the plate was noticeably listless that day.
1796,"“I had no concentration,” Smith said."
1797,"The previous day, the team’s bus had returned to the Mets’ facility around 9 p.m. after a game in Lakeland 126 miles away. Smith, a Los Angeles native, retired to his residence in a gated community, turned on his television and started to watch the Lakers game. By the end of the first quarter, Smith had fallen asleep before putting on his mask."
1798,"When he told Van Wagenen, the general manager recommended Smith set an alarm on his phone that would wake him up around 11 p.m. to ensure that he did not miss an entire sleep cycle."
1799,"The next day, Smith hit a three-run home run and went 3 for 4 from the plate."
1800,"“It is pretty remarkable,” Van Wagenen said. “Look at what his potential is.”"
1801,"Smith maintained that he is ready for all that Alonso and the season bring. In preparing during the off-season, Smith balanced football-style workouts and bench pressing to strengthen his upper body with yoga to tighten his core. He also believes encouraging words from Chili Davis, the Mets’ new hitting coach, and Callaway have inspired him to perform with confidence this spring."
1802,"“A lot of times, we get stuck in this pattern of feeling a certain way, and we think it is normal,” Smith said. “We don’t think much of it.”"
1803,"Smith will require close monitoring, but he seems to have finally embraced his sleep struggle. On a recent night, he returned to his house three miles from the team’s facility. The blinds were drawn in his bedroom at sunset."
1804,He referred to himself as “the snooze king” as he set his alarm clock.
1805,"“That’s going on my next bat,” he said."
1806,"With baggage fees and flight delays on the rise, carry-on travel has become more survival tactic than lifestyle choice. Beyond saving money, flying with only a carry-on prevents bags from getting lost in handling, and gives you more flexibility in case of cancellation, as planes are frequently grounded by weather that poses no threat to a train, bus, or car. "
1807,"Packing a whole trip’s worth into a small bag is often a challenge, but it gets easier with the right accessories. Here are a few suggestions to help."
1808,"If you’re comfortable carrying loads, a travel backpack fits about 33 percent more stuff into the same external dimensions as a four-wheeled carry-on suitcase."
1809,"Stuffing clothes into a compression sack before packing them into a larger bag helps maximize capacity. However, compression causes wrinkles, so pack accordingly."
1810,"Compressed, the Freerain24 occupies only as much space as a balled up pair of socks, yet it unfolds into a full-size, waterproof backpack once unpacked."
1811,"Although this multiport USB charger is about the size and price of a regular iPad charger, it can simultaneously charge up to four devices."
1812,"A collapsible bottle provides all the hydration you need, with none of the packing-space penalty of a regular water bottle."
1813,"I am 62 and no prude. Honest! I am also a grandmother with a part-time job, so I help out my daughter with child care twice a week. I am often sitting in the kitchen with my daughter and 5-year-old grandson when my son-in-law comes home and exchanges a passionate, open-mouthed kiss with my daughter. I think it’s terrible to subject a boy to the sight of his parents’ sexualized kissing. (I don’t want to see it either.) I am determined to say something, but my husband, who shies from conflict, suggested I check with you first. Thoughts?"
1814,CAROLINE
1815,"Let’s talk about modeling — and not the runway variety. I mean the kind where parents show their children, by example, what loving adult behavior looks like. I don’t believe I ever saw my parents exchange more than a purse-lipped peck. Now, add a dollop of gay shame from the ’70s (in my case) and presto! I had a hard time, as a young guy, synthesizing domesticity and sex."
1816,"Your grandson may be in a better starting position than I was (or than many of us were) by witnessing his parents’ romantic kissing as an ordinary feature of married life. And since these “open-mouthed” kisses are the worst offense you mention, I think you should let it go."
1817,"Because another big advantage your grandson currently enjoys is having a loving grandmother built into his weekly routine. Do your best to safeguard that — which means holding back, when possible, from criticizing the way your daughter and son-in-law run their household. As a parent of adult children, it often pays to be quiet about the ways their choices differ from yours."
1818,"I am 18, and I have a younger sister who is 14. Our relationship is tense (to say the least). When I was her age, I had acne. I grew out of it, but she’s just starting to get mild breakouts. Here’s the problem: She globs this cheap concealer on top of her pimples, which only makes them more noticeable (and last longer, in my experience). I’d like to help her, but I think she’d get mad — like I was teasing her. And I’m not! What would you do?"
1819,STELLA
1820,"Your letter made me happier than any other I got this week, Stella! It signals that you’re turning a corner with your sister. You may not be BFFs yet (or ever!), but you’re looking out for her, which is kindhearted, and worrying in advance about rubbing her the wrong way, which is thoughtful. All this augurs well for the future."
1821,"Go to your sister and say, “Listen, I had worse acne than you. It gets better, I promise. But can I tell you some things that worked for me?” If she’s open to hearing your suggestions, go for it! As for the cheap concealer, steer clear of telling her it’s making her look worse. That may only make her more self-conscious. Go with your other point: that it makes blemishes last longer. Good luck and keep at it, big sister!"
1822,"We are a couple in our 70s and good friends with a young couple in their 30s. But when we invite them to dinner, we have a hard time getting them to leave. Being young, they can visit late into the night. But we like to call it quits by 10. Recently, I was having a special meal and wanted to invite them, but I didn’t because of this problem. What can I do?"
1823,S.
1824,"Use your words! As hosts, it’s thoughtful to consider our guests’ desires, but there’s no need to cater to them absolutely. (Nor should you put much stock in telepathic messaging or theatrical yawns.) At 10 p.m., say, “Thanks so much for coming! We had a great time. But we have an early morning, so we’ll say ‘good night’ now.” They will thank you, gather their coats and leave. And it won’t be awkward, at all. I promise!"
1825,"A young relative posted on Facebook, asking for an early-morning ride to the airport from her university. Her mom (in another town) responded: “How much is the shuttle bus?” Her daughter answered: “LOL! But Uber is over $40.” So, now we know this young woman values her friend’s time and automobiles at less than $40 and thinks that riding on a bus with peasants is laughable. The poster and her family can afford $40, and the shuttle is comfortable, reliable and safe. (My wife uses it frequently.) Why does she feel entitled to make chauffeurs of her friends?"
1826,ANONYMOUS
1827,"I know someone who’s not volunteering a lift! And that’s your right, of course. Who knows, though? Maybe another pal is driving right by the airport that morning and won’t mind dropping her off."
1828,"But more important, life teaches us lessons over time. It seems as if your young relative has not yet learned how inconvenient and unpopular most requests for airport drop-offs (and pickups) are. After she’s been pressed into duty once or twice, I suspect she’ll figure it out pronto."
1829,"For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter."
1830,"MOBRIDGE, S.D. — Harold Labrensz spent much of his 89-year life farming and ranching the rolling Dakota plains along the Missouri River. His family figured he would die there, too."
1831,"But late last year, the nursing home in Mobridge, S.D., that cared for Mr. Labrensz announced that it was shutting down after a rocky history of corporate buyouts, unpaid bills and financial ruin. It had become one of the many nursing homes across the country that have gone out of business in recent years as beds go empty, money troubles mount and more Americans seek to age in their own homes."
1832,"For Mr. Labrensz, though, the closure amounted to an eviction order from his hometown. His wife, Ramona, said she could not find any nursing home nearby to take him, and she could not help him if he took a fall at home. So one morning in late January, as a snowstorm whited out the prairie, Mr. Labrensz was loaded into the back of a small bus and sent off on a 220-mile road trip to a nursing home in North Dakota."
1833,"“He didn’t want to go,” said Mrs. Labrensz, 87, who made the trip with her husband. “When we stopped for gas, he said, ‘Turn this thing around.’ ”"
1834,"More than 440 rural nursing homes have closed or merged over the last decade, according to the Cowles Research Group, which tracks long-term care, and each closure scattered patients like seeds in the wind. Instead of finding new care in their homes and communities, many end up at different nursing homes far from their families."
1835,"In remote communities like Mobridge, an old railroad town of 3,500 people, there are few choices for an aging population. Home health aides can be scarce and unaffordable to hire around the clock. The few senior-citizen apartments have waiting lists. Adult children have long since moved away to bigger cities."
1836,"“How often have you heard somebody say, ‘If I go to a nursing home, just shoot me?’” said Stephen Monroe, a researcher and author who tracks aging in America. “In the rural areas, you don’t have options. There are no alternatives.”"
1837,"The relocations can be traumatic for older residents, and the separation creates agonizing complications for families. Relatives say they have to cut back visits to one day a week. They spend hours on the road to see their spouses and parents."
1838,"“Before, I could just drop by five days a week,” said the Rev. Justin Van Orman, a Lutheran pastor who moved back to Mobridge to be closer to his 79-year-old father, Robert. “He knew I was there.”"
1839,"Not long after Mr. Van Orman’s father moved from Mobridge to a new nursing home about 50 miles away, Mr. Van Orman got a call saying his father had fallen out of bed. Mr. Van Orman had to decide: Should he upend his day to check on him, or wait and take the nursing home’s word that his father was O.K.?"
1840,"Similar scenes are playing out in other heavily rural states. Five nursing homes closed in Nebraska last year, with more at risk of closing. Six shut down in Maine — a record, according to the Bangor Daily News."
1841,"Thirty-six rural nursing homes across the country have been forced to close in the last decade because they failed to meet health and safety standards. But far more have collapsed for financial reasons, including changing health care policies that now encourage people to choose independent and assisted living or stay in their own homes with help from caregivers."
1842,"Some nursing homes cannot find people to do the low-paying work of caring for frail residents. Others are losing money as their occupancy rates fall and more of their patients’ long-term care is covered by Medicaid, which in many states does not pay enough to keep the lights on."
1843,"South Dakota chips in less than any other state in the nation to pay for long-term care for residents on Medicaid, said Mark B. Deak, executive director of the South Dakota Health Care Association. He added that the state’s low payment level — a product of South Dakota’s fiscal conservatism and distrust of government-run health care — has now created a crisis."
1844,"Five South Dakota nursing homes have shut down in the past three years, and dozens more are losing money because the majority of their residents rely on Medicaid. At current reimbursement rates, nursing homes in the state lose about $58 a day for each resident on Medicaid, Mr. Deak said. It adds up to $66 million a year in losses statewide."
1845,"“The state has not held up its obligation to seniors,” Mr. Deak said. “How many more nursing homes closing is it going to take?”"
1846,Gov. Kristi Noem has proposed a 5 percent increase in the state’s Medicaid reimbursement rate. Mr. Deak said that would not be nearly enough to cover the losses.
1847,"The 89-bed Mobridge Care and Rehabilitation Center was rated overall as “below average” by Medicare’s Nursing Home Compare program, though for patient care, the home received four out of five stars in the agency’s assessment. The brown brick building was getting old, and had been damaged by a bad summer storm in 2018."
1848,"The nursing home had been part of a chain that switched hands and foundered financially, ultimately ending up in court-appointed receivership. In November, the receiver told a South Dakota judge that the chain’s operations were bleeding money, and that it needed to close down the two homes in the chain that were deepest in the red. Mobridge was one."
1849,"The South Dakota Department of Health did not object, and the judge agreed to the closure. Word began to spread through the home and through town: The residents had about two months to find somewhere else to go."
1850,"Black Hills Receiver, which had taken over operation of the nursing home, said in a November statement announcing the closure that it was working with residents, their families and employees “to make this transition as smooth as possible.” The company declined an interview request."
1851,"On paper, South Dakota and other rural states still have enough long-term care beds for people who need round-the-clock care. The problem is where they are. When a nursing home closes in a small town, the available beds are often so far away that elderly spouses cannot make the drive, and the transferred residents become cut off from the friends, church groups and relatives they have known all their lives."
1852,Even the closest town can feel as though it is a world away when a blizzard rakes across the prairie and turns the two-lane road out of Mobridge into a billowing scarf of snow.
1853,"For six days this winter, Loretta Leonard could not make the 20-mile drive to see her husband, Dick, who is 91 and suffers from severe dementia, at his new nursing home. When he was living close by at the Mobridge home, she often visited him twice a day, sitting down at the piano to play the old polkas and hymns and Depression-era tunes their daughters sang growing up."
1854,"“He always knew me,” Ms. Leonard, 88, said. “Sometimes I wonder whether he knows me anymore.”"
1855,"The part-time bus driver for the Mobridge nursing home began keeping a list as he dropped people at their new homes: “Residents Who Left.” One resident was moved to Aberdeen, 100 miles east. A husband and wife went 73 miles down Highway 12 to Ipswich. Roommates said goodbye. Fast friends landed in different homes. One person ended up in Nebraska."
1856,"“Like cattle,” said Nadine Alexander, a certified nursing assistant who worked at the Mobridge nursing home for 29 years. “They were just hauling them out.”"
1857,"On the snowy day that Harold Labrensz left Mobridge for his new nursing home in North Dakota, not even the bus driver wanted to make the trip. For seven hours, they crept north along icy roads before arriving."
1858,"Mrs. Labrensz chose the facility because it was close to her son’s home, and she was able to find a small efficiency apartment just across the street from the nursing home. They spent 68 years together working their land, fishing and raising a family, and Mrs. Labrensz said she wanted to stay close."
1859,"“We spent our whole life together,” she said."
1860,"She was also close by when, three days after arriving in North Dakota, Mr. Labrensz died. The date was Jan. 31 — the same day that, 220 miles away, the Mobridge nursing home officially closed its doors."
1861,"Wedding photographers can’t possibly capture every moment of your special day, but guests can easily fill in the gaps on social media."
1862,"Using a designated wedding hashtag, attendees can post photos on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and other platforms, serving as a sort of personal paparazzi."
1863,"Fifty-four percent of couples create a wedding hashtag, according to WeddingWire’s 2018 Newlywed Report, and one in four views photos on social media immediately after the reception."
1864,"“Hashtags allow you to be able to see your wedding photos in real time,” said Jeffra Trumpower, the creative director at WeddingWire. “We’re living in an era of instant gratification.”"
1865,"Creating a hashtag has become a core step in the wedding-planning process, said Kari Dirksen, the owner and lead planner at Feathered Arrow Events, a Los Angeles-based wedding and events planning business. “I’d say 90 percent of my clients incorporate a hashtag into their wedding,” she said."
1866,"With so many hashtags from which to choose, couples may feel pressure to create something clever and distinctive. Some may even hire professional hashtag writers."
1867,"Marielle Wakim, the founder of HappilyEverHashtagged.com, started her business in 2016. “I went to 14 weddings that year, and almost every couple asked me for help coming up with their wedding hashtag,” said Ms. Wakim, who is also an editor at Los Angeles Magazine. “I write puns for a lot of our magazine’s headlines, so I had the right experience.”"
1868,"Ms. Wakim offers three price packages: one hashtag for $50, three for $95, and $125 for five. “A lot of couples want options,” she said."
1869,Need help crafting your own hashtag? Here are some tips to ensure your hashtag isn’t an #epicfail.
1870,"“Puns are the lifeblood of hashtag writing,” said Christopher Shelley, a hashtag writer at the Wedding Hashers (which charges $20 for three hashtags) and a wedding officiant."
1871,"A natural starting point is to think about creative ways to incorporate your last name. For instance, Ms. Wakim created this hashtag for Tres Penny and Katie Smith: #PennyFoundHisDime. She also created the hashtag #HopelessRahmantics for Shabnam Mahmood and Rezwan Rahman."
1872,"If you’re stumped for ideas, Mr. Shelley recommends grabbing a thesaurus and jotting down words that sound like either person’s first or last names. For a groom with the last name Hurst, the Wedding Hashers created the hashtag #LoveAtHurstSight."
1873,"Though clever hashtags are the most popular, “not everyone loves puns,” Mr. Shelley said. If you’re looking for something more straightforward, consider using an alliteration, like #ForeverFong or #FinallyForman, or combining each person’s first or last name, like #DebraandAdamAugust2019. Incorporating your wedding’s location is another option, like #NelsonsInTheBarn or #TaylorsTakeNYC."
1874,"Pro tip: Capitalizing the first letter of each word will make your hashtag more readable at a glance, Mr. Shelley said."
1875,"If you want a lot of options, ask friends on Facebook, Instagram and other social media for hashtag suggestions. You can also solicit ideas from wedding vendors, such as your photographer, wedding planner or caterer. “I would get as many people involved in the brainstorming process as possible,” Ms. Wakim said."
1876,"A recent poll of WeddingWire’s users found that the typical wedding hashtag is 16 characters (not including the #). In Mr. Shelley’s opinion, the shorter, the better. “You want a concise hashtag that people can remember easily,” he said. “Also, the longer your hashtag is, the more likely people are to make a typo.”"
1877,"There are a handful of automated hashtag generators online that will create free hashtags, but they can lead couples to cringe-worthy ideas, Mr. Shelley said. (To test one of them out, I plugged in my name, Daniel Bortz, and the name of my fiancée, Alexandra Wald. The generator suggested lame ideas such as #AdventuresOfDanielAndAlexandra, #BortzPartyOf2, and #TheDanielAndAlexandraWedding.)"
1878,"The point of creating a wedding hashtag is to have your guests use it when posting photos from your wedding day, which is why Ms. Trumpower recommends couples create something distinctive. “You don’t want to compete with someone else’s hashtag, because you don’t want to be sifting through a ton of other people’s photos,” Ms. Trumpower said."
1879,"Once you’ve created a hashtag you like, do a search on social media to see if it already exists. If it does, Mr. Shelley said, adding the date of your wedding, like #LisaandMikeMay012019, could solve this problem."
1880,"Some couples choose to go big. When Mike and Heather Julian got married in Santa Barbara, Calif., on April 29, 2016, they used oversize magnets to showcase their hashtag, #FinallyTheJulians, on the side of a shuttle bus that transported guests to and from the venue. “Small signs can be overlooked, but you can’t ignore a six-foot hashtag on the side of a bus,” Ms. Julian said."
1881,"There are a number of other places where you can display your hashtag. Among them: a welcome chalkboard, guest book, ceremony program, cocktail napkins, dinner menus, photo booth props, favors, drink stirrers and table number signs."
1882,"Ms. Dirksen also recommends couples promote their hashtag on their save-the-date mailings, wedding website or at pre-wedding events likes the bridal shower."
1883,SAN FRANCISCO — I am an asylum seeker from Honduras and a mother of three children. For over a month my youngest daughter was separated from her father and me by the United States government. I still don’t know where she was during that time or who took care of her. 
1884,"She’s a toddler, so she can’t tell me if something bad happened to her. I don’t know if she thinks we chose to abandon her. All I know is she came back pounds thinner, with lice and a hacking cough, and she cried for days, traumatized by a government that keeps children from their parents because they are migrants."
1885,"We fled Honduras to the United States because we feared for our lives. I grew up in the capital, Tegucigalpa. In the past few years, my neighborhood has become one of the deadliest in the city. We had had run-ins with the gangs in the past. On Oct. 18, gang members came to our house looking for my partner, Kevin. "
1886,"They showed me their guns and told me, “If you don’t leave in 24 hours, you know what will happen to you.”"
1887,"I knew what they were capable of. When my eldest daughter was 2 years old and I was pregnant with my son, their father was murdered and his body dismembered by gang members. Even after he was killed, we got death threats. We tried moving to another town until things cooled down, but the gangs found us there and extorted us."
1888,"The death threats started again after Kevin and I got together and our daughter Grethshell was born. People who are deported from the United States as he was are targeted by the gangs, because they are presumed to have money. With the new threats, I grabbed the little money we had, around $80, and filled the children’s backpacks with clothes for them and a doll for Grethshell, who was 15 months old. I picked up my son at school and we made our way to the bus station to meet Kevin. "
1889,"We bought tickets to the closest town in Guatemala, and from there we took another bus to the southern Mexican border. In Mexico, out of money, we traveled on the freight train nicknamed “la Bestia,” the Beast."
1890,"While we waited for the train in Puebla, Mexican immigration agents showed up and beat people and threw them in vans. In the chaos, I grabbed my two older children and hid in the nearby bushes. Kevin, who was carrying Grethshell in a sling, took off in a different direction. That was the last time I saw them together."
1891,"During the journey, we had come up with a plan in case we were separated. My uncle lives in San Francisco and that’s where we would reunite. “We’ll find each other there,” Kevin said. “We’ll be safe there.” "
1892,"We arrived at the border at Calexico, Calif., on Dec. 31. Despite appealing for help, I was turned away by the Border Patrol agents. Desperate to reunite our family, I found us a way across in the early morning hours of Jan. 1. "
1893,"We were caught by agents after we crossed and taken to one of the detention centers known as “hieleras,” or iceboxes, because they are kept so cold. There I learned that Kevin was taken to the same detention center with Grethshell and she had been separated from her father. Two fellow migrant women told me that five agents held him down while they ripped her from his arms. Other migrant women were asked to watch her. "
1894,"When I and my two other children were released on Jan. 2, my uncle confirmed what the women had told me. Kevin was charged with a felony for returning to the United States after having been deported. He was taken to jail, while our daughter was sent to a shelter for migrant children in San Antonio. "
1895,"The family separation was not reported to the court on his charging documents. The charges against him were dropped, but Immigration and Customs Enforcement is still using those initial charges as an excuse to keep him detained indefinitely while he fights for asylum."
1896,"I was told I would be reunited with my daughter in a week, but first I needed to fill out paperwork. Then I was told to provide a credit card with up to a $4,000 credit line for her flight, an impossibility for me. Officials refused to say who was looking after her. Finally I got fed up and went to the press. Grethshell was finally put on a plane and brought to me after I threatened to go to the address I had for the shelter manager and get her myself."
1897,"When a social worker put my daughter in my arms on Jan. 30, she was inconsolable. My whole body shook as I held her and tried to soothe her, telling her that everything would be O.K. She was so sick I had to take her to the doctor the next day. For three weeks she resisted me, fearful, when I tried to hold her. She still cries out for her father at night."
1898,"I know I am not alone. There are around 311,000 immigrants who have requested asylum after escaping violence in their home countries like us. Our future is uncertain. My children and I were just evicted from the home we shared with six other people. I’m trying to survive as a single mother of three. I don’t know if we’ll be granted asylum or sent back to our deaths at the hands of the gangs."
1899,"When I asked to be let into this country because my family was in mortal danger, a Border Patrol agent told me I was weak. That it would be better if I went to Canada. “I don’t care if one of your kids dies,” he said. I wonder what that agent would have done if someone had threatened to murder his children. Wouldn’t he have risked everything to ensure their safety? "
1900,"As the United States decides what kind of country it wants to be, Americans need to reckon with the humanitarian crisis the current administration has created and what these policies have done to families like ours who have come here seeking protection."

1907,"He was born 100 years ago in a red-clay corner of Georgia, though for many Americans, Jackie Robinson burst onto the stage fully formed in 1947, a 28-year-old rookie in Dodger flannels."
1908,"That’s the enduring image, the Robinson captured on film at Ebbets Field and fixed in the national imagination: the silent but dynamic hero, broad-shouldered and trim, shattering the color barrier as he ropes another liner, dances off third or hook-slides home in a cloud of dust."
1909,"That vision of Robinson — late to the majors, but still in his playing prime — is on display in this gallery of 100 photographs honoring the centennial of his birth on Jan. 31. Many of the selections come from the archives of The New York Times, rounded out with images from other sources, such as U.C.L.A. and Ebony magazine."
1910,"As these photos make clear, Robinson’s decade in major-league baseball was just one act in a remarkably rich and complex life — one of vision, fortitude, dignity and endurance — shaped by the currents and contours of American history even as it recast them."
1911,"There was also Jackie the boy, grandson of slaves, hauled cross-country as a toddler from a life of sharecropping to the promise of Pasadena by a determined single mother, a Great Migration pioneer."
1912,"And Jackie the amateur athlete, his college exploits chronicled by a booming black press. When The Pittsburgh Courier’s Randy Dixon wrote about the injustice of a segregated sport passing up a star in 1941 — “Exhibit A in So-Called Democracy, the Case of Jackie Robinson” — he didn’t even mean baseball. Robinson had just dazzled in an exhibition between college all-stars and the Chicago Bears, outshining a roster studded with N.F.L. first-round picks."
1913,"Back then, baseball was his fourth-best sport. When Lt. Jack Roosevelt Robinson faced a court-martial for standing his ground after a civilian driver ordered him to the back of a bus at Camp (now Fort) Hood, African-American papers like The Courier identified him as a “football and basketball star” — though he was also an N.C.A.A. champ in the long jump, a certain Olympian if not for the war."
1914,"When he joined the Kansas City Monarchs out of the Army, it was an unglamorous means to an end, enduring relentless bus rides for the $100 a week he could send to his mother and save for his own future, envisioning a life as a coach, teacher and athletic director."
1915,"And then he was the graying Jackie — on the far side of that fateful playing career — the first African-American enshrined in Cooperstown, using his baseball fame not to dabble in civil rights but to dig in full-time."
1916,"Always, and especially, there was Jackie the husband and father, proud, loving, grieving — honest about the joy and pain in his private life, with his family sharing everything that came with being Jackie Robinson in a flawed nation."
1917,"As his friend the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — just 15 when Robinson was court-martialed — would write, “back in the days when integration wasn’t fashionable, he underwent the trauma and the humiliation and the loneliness which comes with being a pilgrim walking the lonesome byways toward the high road of Freedom. He was a sit-inner before the sit-ins, a freedom rider before the Freedom Rides.”"
1918,"At just 53, Robinson succumbed to diabetes and heart disease in 1972. Though he has been gone now nearly as long as he lived, he packed so much into his half-century that his legacy continues to resonate, his foundation helping thousands of students and putting the finishing touches on a museum in Tribeca."
1919,"These are the images of a ballplayer, a change agent, a human being and humanitarian — of America, in progress."

1921,"I did not personally feel the tectonic shift that took place on April 15, 1947, when Robinson made his Dodgers debut. Alas, I did not see Robinson’s first game, nor even his last, a decade later. I came of age years after he played his final game for Brooklyn."
1922,"But I wish I could say, with a straight face, that I actually heard Robinson’s name while still in the womb. He was, in fact, still on the Dodgers then. And yes, my mother was that big a fan of Robinson and the Dodgers and surely was urging him on out loud while she was pregnant with me. Indeed, tales of the lengths to which she and other family members went in order to listen to Dodgers games on the radio were among my favorite bedtime stories as a child."

1929,"As New York edges closer to adopting congestion pricing, a major obstacle could stand in the way: the suburbs, where many lawmakers and commuters see the plan as benefiting the city at their expense."
1930,Leaders in Albany announced this week that they had reached a consensus that a congestion pricing plan to charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods was needed to raise billions of dollars for the failing subway.
1931,"But the details have yet to be worked out, and Long Island lawmakers want revenue from congestion pricing to flow to the commuter trains their constituents ride."
1932,[Driving into Manhattan may soon cost well more than $10. Here’s more on how congestion pricing would work.]
1933,"“At the end of the day, congestion pricing for Long Islanders should mean a better Long Island Rail Road,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who leads an influential six-member Long Island delegation that is part of the Senate’s Democratic majority."
1934,"But suburban demands for a generous slice of the congestion-pricing pie gloss over a stark financial reality: Long Island already benefits from a far larger pot of transit money than New York City, and its commuters who drive tend to be wealthier than most city subway riders."
1935,"The Long Island Rail Road accounts for just 3.5 percent of all transit rides provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the railroad and the city’s public transit."
1936,"Yet the M.T.A. subsidizes each ride on the Long Island Rail Road by $7.68, compared with $1.58 for everyride on New York’s subway trains and buses."
1937,"Even the Metro-North Railroad that serves suburbs north of the city, which the authority also manages, gets less than the L.I.R.R. — $6.54 per ride."
1938,"The Long Island Rail Road has also received nearly $3 billion for repairs and improvements since 2015, accounting for 9 percent of the M.T.A.’s five-year capital spending plan."
1939,Another $4.8 billion went to two huge projects: a new terminal underneath Grand Central Terminal that will serve Long Island Rail Road trains and new tracks on Long Island for more trains.
1940,"“In the past, they’ve gotten their fair share — and you could even say they’ve gotten more than their fair share because some of these megaprojects have been over budget,” said Jamison Dague, the former director of infrastructure studies for the Citizens Budget Commission."
1941,"Still, many Long Island residents and officials say their trains have grown crowded and service has deteriorated with constant delays and cancellations. “Whatever is happening, it isn’t working,” Mr. Kaminsky said. “To ask them not to drive when mass transit may not be up to the task, I think, would be seen as unfair.”"
1942,Legislators from the Hudson Valley have also called for congestion pricing revenues to be directed to the Metro-North Railroad.
1943,"“We’ve just felt neglected and forgotten about by the M.T.A. for years,” said Senator David Carlucci, who represents parts of Westchester and Rockland counties, adding that he could not support any congestion pricing plan without dedicated money for Metro-North."
1944,"A congestion plan backed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio could raise about $1 billion annually in fees for driving into Manhattan from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for the transportation authority, which could also benefit suburban commuters."
1945,"But transit officials say at least $40 billion is needed to turn the creaky subway, which carries an average 5.6 million riders every weekday, into a modern 21st century system."
1946,"Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit, while those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive north past 60th Street would not have to pay."
1947,"Suburban senators have called for exemptions or toll credits for crossings heavily used by commuters — the Robert F. Kennedy, the George Washington and the Governor Mario M. Cuomo bridges. They also want improvements in bus service in transit deserts, and for suburban commuters to be represented on a proposed committee to review M.T.A. capital projects."
1948,"Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers and the majority leader, has said “there is a need for a dedicated stream of revenue to fix the crumbling M.T.A. but any fix must benefit all parts of the M.T.A.”"
1949,"Providing too many exemptions or toll credits would undermine the goal of reducing traffic and could result in higher fees for others to ensure enough revenue is collected, state officials said."
1950,"Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing, said he believed lawmakers were engaging in typical Albany negotiations since congestion pricing is part of the next state budget, which is due April 1."
1951,"“They’re laying out their interests,” she said. “That’s very standard for this time of year.”"
1952,"About 36,000 Long Island residents drive to work in Manhattan, including about 5,000 who participate in car pools, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Three times as many, or 108,000 commuters, take the train to work anywhere in New York City."
1953,"Long Island drivers who would pay congestion fees are generally better off financially than subway riders who live and work in the city: Long Island drivers have a median income of $72,500 compared with $41,400 for subway riders, according to the analysis."
1954,"Steve Levy, the executive director of the Center for Cost Effective Government, a conservative fiscal policy group on Long Island, said congestion pricing was simply another way to squeeze more money out of commuters and taxpayers and fails to address the M.T.A.’s “out-of-control spending.”"
1955,"“Enough is enough,” he added."
1956,"Even Long Island residents who support the idea of congestion pricing say it could create more problems. “In practice, there’s no way to make it work because the Long Island Rail Road is so broken,” said Jen Hosford, 45, a risk manager whose commute by train to Manhattan has never been worse. “If you’re going to add that many people, where are they going to go?”"
1957,"Graphic novels provide a uniquely intimate reading experience. Through words and images, readers are invited into homes and schools; they are free to peek into corners and to quietly observe the worlds of the characters we meet. NEW KID (HarperCollins, 256 pp., $12.99; ages 8 to 12), the cartoonist Jerry Craft’s new graphic novel, is a gift to readers who love the genre."
1958,"Craft invites us into the world of Jordan Banks, one of the few African-American students at a fancy private school. As a realistic graphic novel starring a kid of color, “New Kid” is a desperately needed addition to middle-grade library collections everywhere. This funny, heartwarming and sometimes cringe-inducing take on middle school is sure to resonate deeply with its young audience."
1959,"Jordan is an art-loving seventh grader who, against his will, is sent by his parents to the prestigious (and mostly white) Riverdale Academy Day School. Jordan’s struggle is neatly echoed by his parents: His mother, who works at a largely white publishing firm, thinks Jordan needs to learn how to handle feeling like an outsider if he will ever succeed in corporate America. Jordan’s father, on the other hand, runs a community center in their Washington Heights neighborhood and fears his son is losing touch with his roots."
1960,"Jordan is caught somewhere in the middle, and his coming-of-age tale means navigating the path between his new, more affluent peers and his friends and loved ones in his neighborhood."
1961,"A timely, and very funny, visit from his grandfather helps Jordan see that he does not need to choose one life or another, but can embrace the aspects of both worlds that bring him happiness."
1962,"“New Kid” is a classic coming-of-age tale in many ways. Jordan dreams of being more like Batman, and he yearns for a growth spurt. He must navigate new friends, school bullies and fears of being spontaneously kissed by a girl who seems to like him. But Craft also gives us an intimate look at the particular struggles faced by Jordan as a minority kid at a mostly white school."
1963,"His daily bus ride alone is exhausting. Jordan wears his hood and his sunglasses while he’s in his own neighborhood so he appears tough and can feel safe. Once he’s in the next neighborhood over, he takes his hood down and pulls out his sketchbook."
1964,"As he approaches school, however, he must put his markers away again for fear that someone will think he is going to tag the bus. As two of his new schoolmates put it, he must appear kinda cool, yet nonthreatening."
1965,"In addition to figuring out how to find his way through Riverdale’s sprawling campus, he must also deal with garden-variety aggression as well as microaggressions from classmates and teachers alike. His homeroom teacher, Ms. Rawle, continually calls Drew, another black student, by the wrong name. When Drew and Jordan choose to spend a frigid recess indoors together, Ms. Rawle is concerned that they don’t “associate” with other students."
1966,These aggravations build in intensity until a cafeteria altercation with the class bully threatens to get Drew suspended — but Jordan channels his superpowers and finds a voice to express his point of view about the injustices he’s faced throughout the year.
1967,"While he may not yet be in full Batman mode (after standing up to his teacher, he runs to throw up in the boys’ room), he is one step closer to Bruce Wayne: comfortable in the boardroom and in rough neighborhoods, and willing to stand up for the little guy."
1968,"“New Kid” is at once tender and tough, funny and heartbreaking. Hand this to the middle-grade reader in your life right away."
1969,"Lincoln Peirce, creator of the best-selling Big Nate series, hits it out of the park again with his newest book, MAX AND THE MIDKNIGHTS (Crown, 277 pp., $13.99; ages 8 to 12). This rollicking, irreverent tale of knights, troubadours and magicians proves Peirce is a middle-schooler at heart. Told in a hybrid comics and novel form, with a fast-moving plot and bad puns aplenty, “Max and the Midknights” will keep even the most reluctant of readers engaged to the end."
1970,"Max is an apprentice to Sir Budrick, who happens to be the least talented troubadour of the 14th century. Max, however, has no interest in the life of a traveling entertainer and dreams of becoming a valiant knight instead."
1971,"When Sir Budrick (who is also Max’s uncle) is kidnapped by the evil King Gastley of Byjovia, Max teams up with a ragtag bunch of kids to save him."
1972,"The plot is filled with twists, the most delightful of which is revealed fairly early on. Max, as it turns out, is a girl, not a boy, as readers may assume. (I recommend you don’t tell kids ahead of time!) This revelation adds a new layer to her dreams of knighthood, and feels like a deliciously subversive jab at the tired notion of “girl books” versus “boy books.”"
1973,"The story moves at a fast clip, and Max, with the help of the magician Mumblin, embarks on a quest with her friends and her uncle (who is now a goose — it’s a long story) to restore the rightful King Conrad to the throne of Byjovia."
1974,"Along the way they encounter zombie warriors, exiled knights, fire-breathing dragons and one truly evil sorceress. Through acts of bravery and with a little help from her friends, Max claims her rightful title of Knight of the Realm."
1975,"“Max and the Midknights” is a vastly entertaining mix of action, adventure and humor. The lighthearted tale also touches on deeper topics of gender nonconformity, as characters question why girls can’t be knights or magicians, or why boys can’t write books or tell stories. At its heart, however, it is pure fun."

1977,"New York City’s subway and bus system needs higher fares to shore up its finances and to make much-needed improvements in service. But on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said he opposed the increase, once again publicly humiliating the behemoth transit agency in an attempt to force it to change."
1978,"The brinkmanship has deepened the sense of crisis at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, throwing into doubt the future of the agency’s leadership and leaving riders wondering about what will happen to fares and promised renovations after years of decay."
1979,"With his comments, Mr. Cuomo, who has insisted that he does not actually control the authority, has put pressure on the M.T.A.’s leaders to more quickly overhaul the system. The issue, though, is whether being so publicly blunt about the agency, as Mr. Cuomo has been twice this month, is the most effective way to turn things around there."
1980,"On Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo argued against a fare increase and questioned whether the agency actually needed the money."
1981,"“I have no faith in what they say,” Mr. Cuomo said in an interview, in reference to the fare hike debate."
1982,"Mr. Cuomo made clear that his comments were part of a broader strategy to bring about reforms. Asked whether the agency might have to cut service without the revenue, Mr. Cuomo said, “No. Tighten your belt. Make the place run better.”"
1983,"With a fare vote scheduled for Thursday, a close ally of the governor, Lawrence S. Schwartz, has intervened to force the agency to examine other options. The board is considering fare proposals that could raise the cost of a MetroCard swipe to $3 in March."
1984,"But Mr. Schwartz, an M.T.A. board member and former top aide to Mr. Cuomo, plans to offer his own proposals, which include tying fare increases to better service and investing additional money toward combating fare evasion, which the agency says has become a serious problem."
1985,"“I’m dead set against voting for any fare increases without performance improvements tied to it,” Mr. Schwartz said in an interview, adding, “I don’t know what will happen on Thursday.”"
1986,"The uncertainty over the fare increase highlights the growing dysfunction at the authority, which has increasingly been subject to the whims of Mr. Cuomo and his allies. For years, subway leaders had been planning to close the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Then Mr. Cuomo abruptly called off the shutdown this month."
1987,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has criticized the agency, complaining of its stodgy bureaucracy and saying he wants to “blow up the M.T.A.” The idea of calling off the fare increase — something Mr. Cuomo has supported for months — sounds good in theory. The subway is still far from reliable nearly two years after the system descended into crisis."
1988,"But the transit agency’s financial plan relies on modest fare and toll increases, every two years, across its sprawling system of subways, buses, commuter railroads and paratransit service. The fare increase is expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year."
1989,"The authority is working to make reforms and improve service with its existing resources, said Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority."
1990,"“The M.T.A. board will have robust discussion and decide on the best course of action in the context of the M.T.A.’s dire financial position, which requires fare and toll increases as well as new, sustainable, adequate sources of funding in order to balance the budget while avoiding painful service cuts,” Mr. Tarek said in a statement."
1991,"The authority’s board has been considering two options for fare increases of about 4 percent: The first would keep the base fare at $2.75, but end the bonus for buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard; the second would increase the base fare to $3 and double the bonus to 10 percent. A weekly pass would rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass could increase to $127, up from $121."
1992,"Even with the fare increase, subway leaders say the system is in a grim financial situation. They have warned that without new revenue sources, their only options would be even higher fare increases or drastic cuts to subway and bus service. The agency expects to have a deficit of nearly $1 billion by 2022."
1993,"Mr. Cuomo supports congestion pricing — a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan — as a new revenue source for the authority, which could generate $15 billion over a decade. The governor has said that congestion pricing will be a top priority during the current legislative session."
1994,"At a board committee meeting on Tuesday, transit leaders expressed concern about how the agency’s credit rating had been downgraded twice last year by Standard & Poor’s. David Jones, a board member, asked what would happen if state lawmakers did not approve congestion pricing this year."
1995,"“If the legislature were to not pass congestion pricing, we would be effectively back at the drawing board trying to figure out what our next steps would be, to be quite honest,” said Patrick McCoy, the authority’s finance director."
1996,Mr. Cuomo has complained that the creation of the authority was “diabolical” and intended to keep elected officials from being held accountable for tough decisions.
1997,"“It was purposefully designed so that everyone can point fingers at everybody else, and nobody’s responsible,” Mr. Cuomo said this month. “Why? Because no politician wanted to be responsible. You’re talking about trains and subways and fare increases. And no politician wants to be the one who suggested a fare increase.”"
1998,"The authority’s board votes on major issues for the regional transit system like fare increases and service changes. The board typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by the mayor. Mr. Cuomo also selects its chairman and had a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership like Andy Byford, the subway’s leader."
1999,Mr. Schwartz said he had decided to search for other fare options on his own and had not discussed the matter with Mr. Cuomo.
2000,"“We have to try to do it in a way where those who are economically vulnerable or rely on the system the most are impacted the least,” Mr. Schwartz said. “And I want to assure riders that New York City Transit and Metro-North and Long Island Rail Road are going to be held accountable for performance metrics.”"
2001,"Mr. Schwartz did not give specifics about his proposals, but did say that in order for fare increases to take place, leaders would have to show, for instance, that on-time rates were improving."
2002,"Lisa Daglian, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a watchdog group, said she was concerned about what would happen to the system without a fare increase."
2003,"“How does that money get made up?” she said. “All of the Plan B scenarios are bad and they’re not something riders should want. Nobody wants a fare increase, but nobody wants service cuts.”"
2004,"At the board meeting on Tuesday, riders made heartfelt pleas against a fare increase. Valerie Joseph, who relies on the Access-A-Ride paratransit service, said she had limited income and could not afford higher fares."
2005,"“Raising the fare,” she said, “I won’t even have money to eat.”"
2006,"SWINDON, England — Mr. and Mrs. Average are said to live in this southwestern English town better known as a political bellwether than for any charm. Its 54.7 percent vote for Brexit in 2016 was one of the first results announced, an early indicator of upheaval. Now, with less than a month until the March 29 deadline for Britain to leave the European Union, it’s again aligned with most of the country, this time in its cluelessness as to what is about to happen."
2007,"To paraphrase Churchill, much invoked by Brexiteers as a symbol of the rule-Britannia greatness they believe will return once Britain is freed from its European shackles: Never was so little known by so many about so much."
2008,"Britain is in a funk. “Just get this over with,” is a plea I heard often from Brexit-battered Brits, as if they were waiting to have a limb amputated. After nearly three years, they’re done. All the oxygen has been sucked from the room by the Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May’s floundering attempt to end the country’s 46-year membership in the European Union."
2009,"It’s not easy to make an egg from an omelet, as Pascal Lamy, the former head of the World Trade Organization, has observed. I grew up in a Britain where “the Continent,” a faintly distasteful geographical mass associated with rabies and garlic, was far away. The E.U. changed that. Now, through finance, trade, law, values and culture, Britain is mixed into a borderless market of 28 nations and more than a half-billion people that has brought peace, stability and an unprecedented, if uneven, prosperity to Europe. Britain’s decision to break from that is a curious act of self-harm, linked, like the election of Donald Trump, to the desperation of our times."
2010,"The country’s main political parties, the Conservatives and Labour, buffeted by the Brexit maelstrom, are in crisis — beset by desertions, insurrections and division. As elsewhere in Western democracies shaken by the failings of liberalism, hard-line factions to the left and right have gained sway. They offer rekindled socialism or make-Britain-great-again nationalism as the answer to inequality and ennui."
2011,"The center looks weak, even if defectors from Labour and the Conservative Parties last month formed an Independent Group to try to resurrect it. Parliamentary democracy, which is what Britain is, and democracy-by-plebiscite, which is what the 2016 vote was, are in a standoff: A sovereign Parliament has rejected May’s proposal while advocates of Brexit, on time and at any cost, bay about the sacred irreversible “will of the people.” Britain today poses the question of what 21st-century democracy is."
2012,"May and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour Party leader, have both made desperate concessions in the past week. They did so from weakness. May’s acknowledgment that Brexit could be delayed (the union would have to agree to that and would want to know why) and Corbyn’s support for a second referendum (a grudging move from a lifelong Euroskeptic heading a pro-E.U. party) added to the mayhem."
2013,Anything is possible. That’s now official. Britain could approve an amended May deal (essentially a fudge preserving British participation in the single market and customs union for now); crash out of the union like a lemming over a cliff; defer a decision; hold a second vote; or some weird combination.
2014,"I met with David Renard, the Tory leader of Swindon’s borough council. He’s getting impatient. He says he wants British sovereignty back, rescued from a web of European Union regulations. He thinks Britain should get out, even without a deal. “The British people voted to leave. It would be an affront to democracy if we do not on March 29,” he told me. “Let’s get on with it! A lot of people would see a delay as the liberal elite establishment trying to find a way to stay in the E.U.”"
2015,"As a paid-up member of that establishment, I would see a delay and a second vote (one does not necessarily follow from the other) as an act of very British common sense. "
2016,"By focusing the zeitgeist’s every frustration on Brussels, the “Take Back Control” campaign in 2016 was a brilliant exercise in emotional transference. “Remain” equaled the status quo. To many people, for reasons that had little or nothing to do with the union, that was an unattractive proposition."
2017,"As a practical matter, however, the decision to leave has been a disaster. “Fantasy Brexit,” was based on lies, like the imminent invasion of 80 million Turks. (Turkey joining the E.U. is about as likely as Saudi Arabia becoming a democracy.) Now Britain has had a three-year crash course in “Reality Brexit.” This has involved slower growth, lower investment and the collapse of the illusory idyll. Some 40 free trade deals were promised to replace free trade arrangements Britain benefits from as a union member. The government has concluded a handful, one of them with the Faroe Islands."
2018,Trump is not forever. Brexit is. Britain’s youth oppose it. A decision of this import should be grounded in reality.
2019,"I sat for a while outside the Debenhams department store in downtown Swindon. The scene was not a happy one: stores for rent, people struggling to get by. Swindon is an hour by train from central London, the purring hub of pro-E.U. sentiment. It might as well be on another planet — and it’s still far better off than many towns in Britain. No wonder, I thought, that a majority here did not want to “remain.” "
2020,"Last month Honda, Swindon’s second-largest employer, announced the closure of its plant, with the loss of 3,500 jobs. There were various factors. They included a free trade agreement Japan has concluded with the European Union (making manufacture in Japan more attractive). Honda did not cite the elephant on its production line: Brexit."
2021,"Imagine you’re in a board meeting in Tokyo looking at fathomless uncertainty in Britain for the foreseeable future: What would you decide? One angry Honda worker, with 24 years at the Swindon factory, had no doubt about the real culprit for his job loss: “The government’s completely incompetent handling of the whole thing doesn’t help either, does it?” he said in a Channel 4 interview that went viral. “They can’t even decide for themselves what Brexit means. This is idiocy of epic proportions.”"
2022,"Idiocy aside, it’s not easy to execute a decision based on mass delusion. As Robert Smith, a Swindon-based marketing director for a law firm, told me: “The gig economy is not Europe’s fault.” Nor is the large flux of migrants across the world, billionaire-favoring taxes and stagnant wages."
2023,"“The European Union is our national scapegoat,” Sam Gyimah, a Tory M.P. who quit May’s government last November, told me. As minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation, Gyimah labored hard to make Brexit work. The more he labored, the less it seemed to make sense. “We get 1.5 pounds from the E.U. for every pound we put in,” he told me. “The University of Cambridge gets more than all of Romania.” Britain had invested heavily in Galileo, a global navigation satellite system created by the European Union. Now it has been shut out."
2024,"When May produced her “deal” — in fact a proposal to defer for at least two years all the difficult decisions — Gyimah quit. “Look,” he told me. “There’s no majority for any option in Parliament. Therefore this has to go back to the people.”"
2025,"The people are restive. Renard told me the Swindon council is “making plans for civil unrest as a precaution,” should Brexit be delayed."
2026,"Liberalism worked well for a while. It was good at freeing people from bigotry, sexism, racism, nationalism and prejudice. It was less good at providing people with meaning to their lives, beyond hedonism and materialism. In 2008, with the financial crisis, the wheels came off. Those responsible walked away. A lot of people felt empty, and were drowning in debt. What had the elite ever done for them? Bigotry and nationalism made a storming comeback. That’s Brexit in a nutshell."
2027,"The reality, however, is that Brexit only compounds the problems. Will Dry, a student, voted for Brexit in 2016. He was 18 then. All his family told him Europe meant unemployment and refugees."
2028,"Now Dry has taken time off from Oxford University and works to fight Brexit in London. He came, he told me, to “the realization we did not have a plan.” His new view is that “it’s far better to cooperate with neighbors and allies than ditch them.”"
2029,"With Lara Spirit, another student on leave from college, Dry is a co-president of O.F.O.C. (Our Future Our Choice — don’t try to pronounce the acronym), a youth movement that has sent a blue bus around Britain emblazoned with the words “Please stand up for our futures. Signed, young people.” The bus is a rebuke to the Brexiteers’ notorious red bus that, in 2016, spread the lie that more than $462 million a week going to the E.U. would be spent post-Brexit on the National Health Service. “I’m confident there will be a second vote,” Spirit told me."
2030,"Polls suggest Britain would now vote to stay in the European Union, perhaps by a 54-46 percent margin. Hugo Dixon, the deputy chairman of a grass-roots movement for a second referendum, suggested this slogan: “Fix it. Not Brexit.”"
2031,"That’s good. Liberal democracy has failed too many of its citizens. Brexit and Trump prove that. The elites of these societies have to acknowledge their arrogant inattention. The answer is to fix problems — in education, the health service, taxation and uncontrolled immigration, to name a few."
2032,"To return to Churchill, he declared in 1936 at another moment of British wavering: “So they go in strange paradox, decided only to be undecided, resolved to be irresolute, adamant for drift, solid for fluidity, all powerful to be impotent.” Three years into its agonizing Brexit odyssey, Britain is finally realizing that scapegoating Brussels has gotten it nowhere. It's going to have to fix its national problems — and the European Union could help."

2035,"Like migrating birds, buyers interested in leaving New York City often find their way with the help of water. Indeed, many explorations of the suburbs begin by nosing north along the Hudson River."
2036,"But not all waterfront is equal. Most buyers flock, at least initially, to the Hudson’s eastern edge — to Westchester Rivertowns like Hastings-on-Hudson, Irvington and Tarrytown — bypassing the western side, which includes Nyack, a string of villages that are part of the towns of Orangetown and Clarkstown, in Rockland County."
2037,"That’s shortsighted, say residents, business owners and brokers, as Nyack has as many antique houses, restaurants and live-music showcases as its peers."

2075,"The Hudson’s left bank — where prices can be a third of those in Westchester — also seems more bohemian, with an enduring legacy of writers, painters, actors, filmmakers and musicians."
2076,"“We realized it was really artsy, and really fun,” said Maureen Aiad, 34, a doctor who lives in the area, recalling the house-hunting trips she took in the fall of 2018, which included a stop at a lively street fair."
2077,"Ms. Aiad, who was sharing a two-bedroom rental on the Upper West Side with her husband, Jakub Bartnik, a doctor who is 33, their infant daughter and a black Labrador, initially heeded the call of Westchester. She thought it might offer a roomy house with a spacious yard."
2078,"But she found the yards too small and the prices too steep. And Nyack, more than many places in the area, seemed to defy the stereotype of suburbs as politically conservative, said Ms. Aiad, who works at a hospital on Long Island."
2079,"“I didn’t realize how blue it is,” she said of the village, where some of the lawns have signs proclaiming “Love Your Neighbor.” “It’s easy to feel welcome here.”"
2080,"In January, Ms. Aiad and her husband closed on a four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom, ranch-style house, with a bluestone patio and a finished basement — and, most important, about an acre of land — in the village of Upper Nyack. They paid $929,000, she said, noting that if it had been across the river, it might have cost $1.3 million."
2081,"What has helped to raise Nyack’s profile is its location at the base of a prominent bridge. The busy, 3.1-mile Governor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge, which replaced the Tappan Zee last year, carries I-287 between Rockland and Westchester counties. Travelers on the highway, which hugs Nyack’s southern border, whiz past some of the area’s most attractive blocks."
2082,"Also key in promoting Nyack, in ways obvious and subtle, is the artist Edward Hopper, who lived there for almost three decades. His childhood home, which now houses galleries, enjoys a prominent berth on North Broadway. Known for his street scenes, Hopper also painted local buildings, like Pretty Penny, the cupola-topped house that once belonged to the actress Helen Hayes."
2083,"Other creative types who have called Nyack home include the writer Carson McCullers, the director Jonathan Demme and the actress Rosie O’Donnell. Musicians are also numerous, said Jerry Grossman, 68, the principal cellist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in New York."
2084,"Mr. Grossman, a former Upper West Side resident, bought his first place in Nyack in 1996. He now owns a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house for which he paid $850,000 in 2001. He likes the area’s walkability. For the most part, blocks are flat and lined with sidewalks, although the terrain is hillier to the west. "
2085,"“Walking around, chatting with friends and neighbors,” he said, as he headed to a performance of “Don Giovanni.” “I love that.”"
2086,"Nyack is also impressively diverse, Mr. Grossman noted. Immigrants who live there, according to census records, hail from Haiti, El Salvador and Brazil. “This is not some lily-white suburb,” he said."
2087,"Nyack is often used as shorthand to refer to several places with similar names. Of them, the three villages along the Hudson — Upper Nyack, Nyack and South Nyack — have the most in common in terms of style, history and popularity with renters and buyers."
2088,"Together, they encompass about seven square miles and 12,400 people, according to the census."
2089,"Upper Nyack has the leafiest lots and the largest houses, particularly along the river, which is dotted with estates that evoke the grandeur of France’s Loire Valley. Clustered around East Castle Heights Avenue is Van Houten’s Landing, a compact National Register historic district. Its Italianate houses once belonged to shipbuilders whose vessels hauled vegetables, iron and red sandstone to New York. (Departing from the same spot later were steamships loaded with passengers.)"
2090,"Newer homes, in Cape Cod and colonial styles, are inland. Open space is to the north, courtesy of Nyack Beach State Park and Hook Mountain, a National Natural Landmark because of the 200 million-year-old rocks."
2091,"Whimsical Victorians, with curlicue carvings, fish-scale shingles and gingerbread trim in colors like lemon, olive and pink, can be found in South Nyack, where streets dead-end at private docks. Nyack College has a large campus there, although the Christian school is planning to eventually close the 600-student facility and sell it."
2092,"Squeezed between the two is the village of Nyack, with its dense mix of houses, apartments, bars, cafes and restaurants. Several large-scale luxury housing developments are rising there, including Pavion Apartments, a low-slung complex on South Franklin Street with 135 units, from studios to two-bedrooms."
2093,"Also underway is TideWater, a 128-unit, three-building waterfront condo complex with a public esplanade on a former Standard Oil site. Controversy dogged the project over the height of its buildings, now at 52 feet. The area has previously known conflict: Next door is the Clermont condo complex, whose tall, stucco-sided tower drew flak when it was built in the 1980s."
2094,"Nyack also has co-ops, like the Salisbury Point complex, a red-brick, postwar property with 120 apartments next to the bridge in South Nyack."
2095,"In late February, there were 50 homes listed for sale in the three villages, according to the real estate site Zillow."
2096,"The least expensive was a one-bedroom at the Ivanhoe co-op, a 1960s complex in Nyack, for $198,000, while the priciest was a Queen Anne-style house with six bedrooms, six bathrooms and eight fireplaces, on 1.42 riverfront acres, for $4.995 million."
2097,"Activity has slowed in step with that of the surrounding region, although prices seem healthy. In 2017, 97 single-family homes sold, at an average of $575,000, according to William Raveis Baer & McIntosh Real Estate, a local agency; in 2018, 76 single-family homes sold, at an average of $713,000. (Brokers said the average was boosted by a seven-bedroom Dutch colonial built in 1906 that sold for $5.1 million.)"
2098,"Rents run the gamut. In February, one-bedrooms listed on Zillow, many in houses, ranged from $1,300 to $2,300 a month."
2099,"Some of the village of Nyack’s downtown was considered seedy in the 1980s, but antiques stores led a turnaround, residents said. Now, on blocks with few vacancies, night life beckons."
2100,"Latino, Filipino, Japanese and Israeli restaurants can be found along Main Street and North and South Broadway. The Runcible Spoon, with muffins and cupcakes, is popular with the cyclists who sometimes ride en masse through the area. The Hudson House, whose wine cellar occupies an old jail, is a mainstay."
2101,"Maureen’s Jazz Cellar, a cozy spot that opened in 2016, offers Grateful Dead tribute bands on Thursday nights. Art Cafe holds concerts in the singer-songwriter vein."
2102,"For kindergarten through fifth grade, Upper Nyack School is a public option that enrolls 430 students. Nyack Middle School has 640 students in sixth through eighth grade."
2103,"On state exams during the last school year, 51 percent of students in third through eighth grade met standards in English, versus 45 percent statewide; on state math exams, 61 percent met standards, versus 45 percent statewide."
2104,"Nyack High School has about 1,000 students. On the SAT exams for 2017, students averaged 566 on the reading and writing section, compared with 528 statewide; on the math section, students averaged 555, compared with 523."
2105,"Nyack, unlike some suburbs, lacks commuter trains, so driving is common. To hop a Metro-North, some residents drive to Tarrytown or grab a Westchester-bound bus. A bike lane is slated to open on the northern side of the Cuomo bridge this year."
2106,"Alternately, there are Rockland Coaches buses that travel to the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan, by way of the Lincoln Tunnel, in around an hour and 10 minutes. A 20-trip pass costs about $185."
2107,"Historians say Nyack popularized yoga, thanks to Pierre Bernard, who ran an ashram-style resort in the early 20th century called the Clarkstown Country Club. Not so much a place to swing clubs as a retreat for downward dogs, the organization catered to society women, including some Vanderbilts. It was described as a “Sanskrit sect” by The New York Times, while critics derided it as a cult."
2108,"The Omnipotent Oom, as Mr. Bernard was known, eventually sold his sprawling estate. Eagle’s Nest, his Tudor-style house, is now Shuman Hall, an administrative building at Nyack College. Other estate buildings became dorms."

2110,"BARRON, Wis. — The crime began with a chance encounter: From the moment Jake Patterson spotted a 13-year-old girl boarding a school bus last fall, he “knew that was the girl he was going to take,” Wisconsin investigators said in court documents released on Monday."
2111,"In the days that followed, Mr. Patterson, 21, mapped out his plot to abduct Jayme Closs, a middle-school student whom he had never met before, the investigators said. He took a shotgun from his father, switched out his car’s license plate and bought a mask from Walmart. He shaved his head and face — to leave no traces — and wiped clean his shotgun shells. He twice drove out to Jayme’s house in the small town of Barron, but saw cars in the driveway or people awake inside, the report says."
2112,"Then, late on an October night, Mr. Patterson pulled up again to the home of the Closs family — people he had never met — and killed Jayme’s father, James Closs, with a single blast of the shotgun. He then forced his way into a bathroom where Jayme and her mother, Denise, were hiding in a bathtub, the investigators said. He ordered Denise Closs to cover her daughter’s mouth with black tape, then killed Denise. Then he tied up Jayme and forced the teenager into the trunk of his car — all of it in a matter of four minutes."
2113,"The details of Jayme’s abduction and captivity, outlined in documents released as Mr. Patterson was formally charged in the kidnapping and killings, were elaborately planned, gruesome and terrifying. They told the story of a girl who was forced to spend three months held against her will in the cabin of a volatile stranger after having witnessed the deaths of her parents. It was the situation every parent fears — and one that experts say is exceedingly rare: a targeted attack on a child by a total stranger."
2114,"Mr. Patterson, who was ordered held on $5 million bail, did not enter a plea during a brief court appearance on Monday. Investigators say that he confessed to them and provided the details they described about the planning behind the abduction. Mr. Patterson’s lawyers did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment."
2115,"Wearing an orange jumpsuit, Mr. Patterson appeared via video from the Barron County Jail and answered “no” and “yes, sir” to basic questions from the judge. Mr. Patterson, who wears glasses and has close-cropped, receding brown hair, showed no obvious emotion during the court appearance. At various points, he yawned and rubbed his chin."
2116,"The allegations have upended Barron, where residents spent weeks searching for Jayme as scores of investigators swarmed to the small town and followed thousands of tips and false sightings. Residents said they were thrilled that Jayme had managed to escape from her captor last week. She has since been staying with family members, who posted a photograph of her smiling and holding her dog, Molly."
2117,Mr. Patterson is accused of kidnapping Jayme Closs and murdering her parents.
2118,"But residents were stunned by the investigators’ descriptions of what had happened — the randomness of it, but also the chilling and seemingly intricate planning."
2119,"Some parents were newly hesitant about school buses, and wondered aloud what else might no longer be safe."
2120,"“I’ll be taking my child to school,” said Amy Christensen, the manager of Skippy’s Pub in downtown Barron, a town of about 3,400 people. Since this happened, Ms. Christensen said, she has let her 3-year-old daughter sleep with her. “I’ve been holding her close every night,” she said."
2121,The charges against Mr. Patterson buck national trends in homicides and kidnappings.
2122,"In 2017, fewer than 10 percent of homicide victims were killed by strangers, according to the F.B.I. And according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, cases in which strangers abduct children are very rare; of more than 25,000 reports of missing children that the group received in 2018, only 77 were abductions by nonfamily members, said Erin Farrell, a center representative."
2123,"The prosecution’s 12-page complaint, which included details from interviews by law enforcement officials with Jayme and Mr. Patterson, provided chilling answers to questions that had haunted Barron ever since Oct. 15, the night that the Closses were killed and their daughter vanished."
2124,"Mr. Patterson spotted Jayme last year as he was driving to a job he held briefly at a cheese factory while she boarded a school bus. Within days, the authorities said he told them, he was assembling supplies to abduct her and taking steps to disguise his identity. Prosecutors said he resolved to kill anyone else in the Closs home, rather than allow anyone to threaten his plan."
2125,"“He indicated that if he had been stopped by police, it was likely he was going to shoot at police officers with the three shotgun shells that he had remaining,” Brian Wright, the Barron County district attorney, said in court."
2126,"In fact, Mr. Patterson told investigators that he saw police cars speeding toward the Closs home about 20 seconds after he left with Jayme bound and stuffed in the trunk. After slowing down for them, Mr. Patterson continued about an hour north to Gordon, where he took Jayme inside a cabin and forced her to change her clothes."
2127,"In the 88 days that followed, Jayme told investigators, she was kept inside the cabin and forced to hide under Mr. Patterson’s twin-size bed when he had guests over or when he left. Sometimes, she went without food, water or access to a toilet for as long as 12 hours, she said."
2128,"Mark Fruehauf, the district attorney in Douglas County, which includes Gordon, said more charges could be filed in the coming weeks related to Mr. Patterson’s actions after the initial kidnapping. Mr. Fruehauf did not offer details, but court filings said Mr. Patterson used force and threats to prevent Jayme from escaping."
2129,"When she was forced to hide under the bed, Jayme told detectives, Mr. Patterson would box her in with totes and laundry bins that he secured with barbell weights. He would turn on music to prevent guests from hearing any noise she made. And one time, when Mr. Patterson believed she had tried to escape, Jayme said he struck her and threatened worse consequences if she tried again."
2130,"But last Thursday, after Mr. Patterson told Jayme he was leaving for a few hours, she managed to force her way out from under the bed, she said. She grabbed a pair of men’s shoes — apparently Mr. Patterson’s — and ran to a nearby road, shoes ill fitting and on the wrong feet, crying out for help. A woman who was walking by with a dog took her to a nearby home. “I’m Jayme Closs,” the woman recalled the girl saying. “I don’t know where I am.” And then: “Please help — I want to go home.”"
2131,"Mr. Wright, the prosecutor, called Jayme’s escape “incredible.” He said, “You can see the amount of control that he was exerting over her, and at some point she found it within herself at 13 years old to say, ‘I’m going to get myself out.’”"
2132,"As sheriff’s deputies took Jayme to safety, they set out to look for Mr. Patterson. A short time later, deputies saw the car that Jayme had described to them, and pulled him over."
2133,"Mr. Patterson, who had apparently been out looking for Jayme, told the deputies he knew why they had stopped him, investigators said."
2134,"“I did it,” he said."

2136,Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.
2137,"It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery."
2138,"The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning."
2139,"New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic."
2140,The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.
2141,"Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees."
2142,"Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks."
2143,"His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit."
2144,Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.
2145,"State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely."
2146,"Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond."
2147,"Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere."
2148,"Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone."
2149,But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.
2150,"After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing."
2151,"Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”"
2152,"Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing."
2153,"The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels."
2154,"Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later."
2155,"“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”"
2156,"One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates."
2157,"London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution."
2158,"Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h."
2159,"Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."
2160,"In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home."
2161,"But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted."
2162,"And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars."
2163,Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.
2164,"Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians."
2165,"Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic."
2166,"“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”"
2167,"I can’t remember what country I was flying over, or even what month it was, just that the “Mamma Mia!” sequel, “Here We Go Again,” was playing on the back of the airplane seat in front of me and I was sobbing like I had never sobbed before."
2168,"One survey shows that even 41 percent of men will tear up at 10,000 feet. It has to do with the air pressure, dehydration, the stress of being herded like cattle, and the bloody marys we down to get through it all. I’d certainly done my fair share of crying on planes, as The New York Times’s first 52 Places Traveler, charged with the incredible and often body-punishing task of reporting on all those destinations while traveling solo around the world for a year."
2169,"This was a different kind of cry, though. It was a movie cry, induced by that magical alchemy of Abba songs and a plotline that reminded me of my own quite alive, free-spirited mother whom I hadn’t seen in months and missed very much. Pop culture tends to reflect us back onto ourselves, and crammed into my tiny economy-class corner of that plane, watching two generations of actresses sing about finding inner strength while abroad, it may have been the first time I felt truly homesick. I missed my friends and my family, sure, but I also missed this, the cleansing power of getting swept up in the emotion of something I was watching or hearing — much to the discomfort of my seatmates."
2170,"Before 52 Places, I had spent more than a decade as a culture writer for New York magazine. Of all the things I was leaving to embark on this experience of a lifetime — my loved ones, my job, my apartment — pop culture felt like the one link to home I could carry around in my pocket and rely on to keep me company when everyone I knew was asleep in a different time zone. Then as the trip went on, I got busy, the relationship grew distant. This essential pillar of my life began to crumble."
2171,
2172,"MOVIES ARE MY COMFORT FOOD, and have been since I was 8 and my parents gave me my first memorable Christmas gift: a VHS tape of “Singin’ in the Rain,” which I watched on repeat for the next five years. As an isolated teenager in New Mexico, all I had to do was drive half an hour to the abundance of movie theaters around Santa Fe to visit other countries and lives. And as an adult, pop culture wasn’t something I consumed casually. I breathed it, partly because my job required it and partly because I loved being in the know. TV shows I’d missed the night before, I’d stream on Hulu over breakfast. Podcasts got me through my morning subway commute. Daytimes, I’d be reporting on something I’d seen. Evening brought more movie-viewing and conversations with friends about the entertainment-industry tissue that connected us all."
2173,"Had weight and size not been an issue, I would’ve packed a small screening room in my luggage."
2174,"In lieu of that, I had an iPad, iPod and iPhone prepped with enough downloads to get me through 2020. What if I found myself on consecutive five-hour flights with nothing to entertain me? How else would I make my way through a hundred dinners alone in unfamiliar cities?"
2175,"I was armoring myself with the familiar, in my native language — movies, music, TV shows, books — to ward off my fears of everything new and scary. After an exhausting day of speaking Spanish in Costa Rica, I could unwind with an episode of “Orange Is the New Black.” Stuck in the limbo of a logistical snag? That was just the right amount of time to indulge in a rom-com on Netflix, or text with my friends back home about that rom-com on Netflix."
2176,"Then, on the first plane ride of my trip, from New York to New Orleans, I was too nervous and excited to look at my iPad. More plane and train and bus and car rides went by, and the iPad stayed in the bag, as I slept, or worked, or watched incredible scenery. Soon it became dead weight, an annoyance that only left my bag at airport security checks. I barely noticed when I forgot it in a Denver hotel room; then, five months in, I left it at a friend’s house in Los Angeles and never missed it."
2177,"That worry of being bored never came up again. Culture was all around me. I went to more museums that I had in five years. (Astrup Fearnley Museet in Oslo and the Clyfford Still Museum in Denver were highlights). I never heard Ariana Grande’s song thanking her exes, but I can say definitively that “Despacito” was the most popular song on the planet in 2018. There are talented street musicians everywhere from Belgrade, Serbia, to La Paz, Bolivia, who can play it ably on everything from accordions to trumpets."
2178,"It wasn’t until old friends started tweeting out their Top 10 lists for the year that I realized I’d seen only six movies, all on planes or Netflix: “Mamma Mia 2,” “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” “Set It Up,” that one where the Rock goes “Die Hard” on a skyscraper, and two Netflix Christmas movies."
2179,"They’d been delightful, but the real treat came this January on the plane back from Taiwan to the United States at the end of my 52 Places trip, when “Crazy Rich Asians” popped up on my seatback screen. It was just over six months since it came out and I squealed with excitement to the nice Chinese girl sitting next to me. She didn’t speak much English, but she nodded, smiling, and turned on a Chinese-language soap opera for herself."
2180,"For months, I’d been devouring Twitter threads and think pieces about the impact of “Crazy Rich Asians.” I’d followed along as three Korean friends from New York magazine tweeted about seeing it together, and weeping, for the third time. Over the years I’d written about the lack of realistic Asian representation in American pop culture because I’d felt it, too. A history teacher saying “ching-chong-chong” and slanting his eyes while teaching my class about China in middle school. Asian men like my dad being used as the butt of sexual jokes."
2181,"So much of coming home after a profound experience like a long trip, especially one taken alone, is reckoning with how much you’ve changed and how much everything you left behind has stayed the same. But while I was gone, Hollywood had changed."
2182,"I watched the penultimate scene three times: Hollywood’s new star, Henry Golding, rushes onto an airplane to get back the girl (a radiant Constance Wu), in a clichéd moment straight out of a dozen rom-coms. It didn’t feel clichéd or over the top. I’d just come from two months of tasting the richness of Asian cultures in India, Bhutan, Japan, China, South Korea, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand, and that scene felt right, like it had a place in the world I’d been fortunate enough to see over the last year. And then I watched the whole movie over again."
2183,
2184,"A WEEK AFTER I GOT BACK, I went to Utah for the tail end of the Sundance Film Festival, which I’d attended for years as a January ritual for work. Some people were surprised that I’d headed back on the road so soon, but wandering around Park City, puzzling out how to make it to screenings in the middle of a snowstorm, felt more like home to me than the apartment I hadn’t lived in for a year."
2185,"Home is full of uncertainty and questions about the future. Crying alone in a dark theater, now that is something I know how to do."
2186,"At first, my selections were shaky. I started off with a dull Keira Knightley whistle-blower drama I’d picked on reflex, because I was used to seeing movies with stars I could interview. Soon, though, I found myself drawn to foreign dramas and documentaries that could take me back to the places I’d been and missed so much. A rom-com, “Top End Wedding,” transported me to Darwin, Australia, and into the lives of Aboriginal families like the ones I had briefly met in October. “Monos,” a spectacularly shot Colombian psychodrama about child soldiers, brought me deep into the jungles of a country I long to revisit. “Midnight Traveler,” shot entirely on smartphones by a family of Afghan refugees, showed me a side of border crossings I’d never encountered."
2187,"One night, the young filmmakers and journalists in our rental condo were having a party. I took a bus back there after watching a harrowing documentary, “One Child Nation,” about Chinese population control policy, and found myself standing in the street, unable to go in. Heavy snow was falling, turning the light from the streetlamps into lace. Music wafted down the stairs, and in the window I could see silhouettes of happy revelers with red Solo cups. A coming-of-age drama about a young Muslim girl was showing at a theater not too far away. Another dark room, another world to visit. I turned around and got on a bus."
2188,Before reading the article: 
2189,"For today’s article, you will read an obituary for Dorothy Bolden, a domestic worker who started a movement for the protection of domestic workers in the United States in the 1960s. She died in 2005. This piece is from Overlooked, a history project recalling the lives of those who, for whatever reason, were left out of The Times’s obit pages."
2190,"Before you read about Bolden and the movement she started, watch this four-minute Op-Ed video, about what it’s like to be a domestic worker in the United States today."
2191,Then answer the following questions:
2192,• What are some of the duties of a domestic worker?
2193,"• Why are domestic and care workers more vulnerable to workplace abuses, like long hours, low wages, sexual harassment and discrimination?"
2194,• How are these injustices rooted in the legacy of slavery?
2195,"Now, read the article, “Overlooked No More: Dorothy Bolden, Who Started a Movement for Domestic Workers,” and answer the following questions: "
2196,"1. In 1968, Bolden helped start the National Domestic Workers Union of America. What did this organization do?"
2197,2. How did Bolden prepare to lead this struggle?
2198,"3. What do domestic workers do? According to Bolden, why are they so important to society?"
2199,4. What role did the city buses play in this movement?
2200,"5. The author writes that “Bolden was not the first to advocate for domestic workers, but she helped legitimize and organize them on a scale the country had never seen before.” How so? Give three examples from the article."
2201,6. The last few paragraphs of the article describe Bolden’s early life. How might these experiences have motivated her to become an advocate for domestic workers?
2202,7. What is Bolden’s legacy in the movement for domestic workers? Where does the movement stand today?
2203,"Finally, tell us more about what you think: "
2204,How much has changed since Bolden’s time?
2205,"Recently, the National Domestic Workers Alliance wrote an open letter dedicated to the women of the Oscar-nominated film “Roma,” which portrays the life of a domestic worker. Read the letter, then tell us:"
2206,"• Do you agree that domestic work “is valuable, but it is not valued” in our society? What examples from what you have read and watched today, popular culture or your own life support your opinion?"
2207,• Do you think there should be a federal law to protect domestic workers? Why or why not?
2208,"A hospital in Yemen supported by Save the Children was hit Tuesday by a deadly airstrike that charity officials blamed on the Saudi-led coalition, an attack carried out on the war’s fourth anniversary."
2209,"At least seven people were killed, including four children, when a missile struck a gasoline station only yards from the entrance to the Kitaf hospital in rural northwest Yemen about 60 miles from the city of Saada, Save the Children officials said."
2210,"The attack damaged the waiting rooms and occurred at the busiest time of the morning for the hospital, said Jason Lee, Save the Children’s deputy director in Yemen."
2211,"He said the organization had lodged a strong protest over the airstrike with the Saudi-led authorities, who had the coordinates of the hospital and should have known to avoid the area."
2212,"“This is a gross violation of humanitarian law,” Mr. Lee said in a telephone interview from Sana, the Yemen capital."
2213,"In a statement, Carolyn Miles, the charity’s president and chief executive, who recently visited Save the Children’s health facilities in Yemen, said, “We are shocked and appalled by this outrageous attack.”"
2214,"There was no immediate comment from the Saudi-led coalition, which controls the airspace over Yemen. Despite repeated Saudi pledges to honor prohibitions on attacking civilian targets, the conflict has been punctuated by airstrikes on hospitals, markets and public gatherings, including funerals and weddings."
2215,"One of the worst airstrikes came in August, when at least 29 children under the age of 15 were killed on a school bus. That attack contributed to what already was growing outrage over Yemen’s civilian casualties, and it played a role in mobilizing congressional efforts to halt American military support for Saudi Arabia’s war effort."
2216,"While the Houthi rebels, Saudi Arabia’s adversaries in the war, have also been criticized for targeting civilians and recruiting child soldiers, humanitarian groups and the United Nations have attributed many of the civilian casualties to the Saudi-led coalition."
2217,"Data released earlier this month by the United Nations refugee agency indicated that more than 4,800 civilian deaths and injuries were reported in Yemen last year — an average of 93 civilian casualties per week. The agency said 30 percent were killed or injured inside their homes and a fifth of all casualties were inflicted on children."
2218,"Saudi Arabia led a military campaign it called Operation Decisive Storm that intervened in Yemen around March 26, 2015, with a bombing campaign to oust the Houthis, who had evicted the Saudi-backed government and occupied much of the country. The Saudis have accused Iran, their regional rival, of supporting the Houthis."
2219,"Despite Saudi predictions of a quick victory, the conflict has turned into what the United Nations has called the world’s worst man-made humanitarian disaster."
2220,"Last month, the United Nations relief agency said “the severity of needs is deepening” in Yemen, where 24 million people, close to 80 percent of the population, need protection and assistance, and famine threatens hundreds of thousands."
2221,"“The escalation of the conflict since March 2015 has dramatically aggravated the protection crisis in which millions face risks to their safety and basic rights,” the relief agency said in its 2019 Humanitarian Needs Overview."
2222,"KABUL, Afghanistan — On a clear and cold day in March 2013, Farshad Usyan put his medical studies aside to become a photographer for Agence France-Presse. Good thing he wasn’t actually given a camera that day."
2223,"“I wouldn’t have been able to turn it on,” he recalled."
2224,"Yet the wire service took a chance on the 20-year-old novice, just as it had with his eldest brother, Qais, a self-taught photographer who had supported the family working for the wire service. When his brother died, Mr. Usyan took up photography to help support his mother, three brothers and his sister-in-law. But a passion for the medium grew when, like Qais, he realized it provided a way to convey the aspirations he had for change in Afghanistan."
2225,"“When you see both their pictures, I think it’s undeniable that Qais made a big impression on Farshad,” said Pedro Ugarte, then Agence France-Presse’s photo director for the Asia-Pacific. “They both had a special sensitivity toward their subject. I would think his way of looking at the world today comes from his brother.”"
2226,"Mr. Usyan grew up under the Taliban in the northern city of Mazar-i Sharif. His parents weren’t religious, but they were uncompromising when it came to education for their seven children. What the Taliban forbade, their uncle would teach them by the glow of an oil lamp in an underground room at the extended family’s home — Persian, geography and history, along with reading any books they could find."
2227,Then the Americans came.
2228,"The Taliban willed the people of Mazar to pray for victory. One night, Mr. Usyan went to sleep under their rule. When he got up the next day, they were gone. He looked up to his brother Qais, who was ambitious, generous and community minded. He established youth associations and helped orphaned children through sport and theater. He encouraged his younger brother’s need for knowledge through the ideas of Marx and Che Guevara."
2229,"Mr. Usyan was still in high school when Qais, looking for a way to illustrate his ideas about Afghan society, taught himself how to use a camera. Agence France-Presse hired him as a stringer in 2009, and his grass-roots perspective informed his photography. Mr. Usyan, whose English was better, wrote captions for him. After filing, the two looked at Mr. Usyan’s phone, awed when the photographs appeared, like magic, on the wire, and celebrated when the pictures were chosen as the agency’s “Top Shots.”"
2230,"Qais was at home in Mazar one day in early 2013, when he complained of a headache. He was taken to the hospital but died two days later. Mr. Usyan suspects his brother was deliberately poisoned during a night of drinking with friends; perhaps it was revenge sought by a corrupt policeman Qais had photographed, or a friend jealous of his job. Cases of blindness and death from bootleg liquor, however, are also common in the region."
2231,No answers ever emerged.
2232,"There was little time for grief. Qais’s death, along with their father’s a year earlier, meant that responsibility for providing for the family fell to Mr. Usyan and his older brother Anil."
2233,"Mr. Ugarte, the Agence France-Presse’s photo director in the region, recalled that Shah Marai, then the agency’s chief photographer in Afghanistan — who was later killed in a suicide bombing in Kabul, in 2018 — went to Mazar to pay his respects on behalf of the agency, and also to look for another photographer. “After he came back,” Mr. Ugarte recalled, “he told me he had met his brother, who had never worked as a photographer before, but he was confident he could turn him into a good one.”"
2234,The move helped the Usyan family as it did Agence France-Presse: an Afghan solution for an Afghan problem.
2235,"A couple of weeks later, Mr. Usyan accepted Mr. Marai’s offer, even though he had never used a professional camera. The next day, he spent the 10-hour bus ride to Mazar-i Sharif figuring out by trial and error out how the settings on his brother’s camera worked. “I took pictures of anything,” he said. “Even the garbage can inside the bus.”"
2236,"Three days later was Nowruz, the Persian New Year, when tens of thousands of Afghans descend on Mazar-i Sharif to celebrate. Mr. Marai, unsure of his young recruit’s capabilities, flew to Mazar to cover the ceremonies alongside him. When The New York Times chose an Agence France-Presse image for its gallery of photos of the day, it was Mr. Usyan’s."
2237,"Roberto Schmidt, Agence France-Presse’s chief photographer for South Asia then, remembered Qais Usyan as “the jewel” of the agency’s stringers in Afghanistan. What was incredible about Farshad Usyan, he said, was that “knowing he had no experience, he picked up almost seamlessly” from his brother."
2238,"Mr. Schmidt, who has covered conflict for decades, said that “it’s difficult for photographers who’ve grown up in conflict seeing what goes on the front pages of the newspapers.” Many, he suggested, feed the international media with representations of their country they feel the world expects, perpetuating, in the case of Afghanistan for instance, the myth of intractable conflict. "
2239,"But Farshad Usyan’s instinct was to avoid those tropes. Instead, his gentle demeanor inclined him away from scenes that focused only on the violence expected of Afghanistan and toward more mundane struggles: child laborers, poverty and the effects of climate change, as well as unexpected vignettes from a more modern Afghanistan in Mazar’s snooker parlors and barbershops."
2240,Mr. Usyan still works toward a future more like the one his parents allowed him to aspire to. It is a journey that began long before he picked up his camera.
2241,"“Qais,” he said, “inspired me in life more than in photography.”"

2243,"I was expelled from Venezuela on Tuesday after a contentious interview with Nicolás Maduro, the country’s strongman. He stood up in the middle of our conversation and his security agents confiscated our television cameras, the memory cards and our cellphones. Yes, Mr. Maduro stole the interview so nobody could watch it."
2244,"We got the interview the old fashioned way: by making a phone call and requesting it. A producer from Univision — the television network where I’ve worked since 1984 — contacted the government’s communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, and asked if Mr. Maduro wanted to do the interview. The leader said: “Come to Caracas.” And so we did, with official entry papers in hand."
2245,"The interview started on Monday evening, three hours late, at the Miraflores Palace. Mr. Maduro had spoken a few minutes before with Tom Llamas of ABC News, and he seemed to be in a good mood. The humanitarian aid that the political opposition — with the help of an international coalition — had tried to get into the country over the Colombian and Brazilian borders had been largely stopped, and Mr. Maduro felt emboldened. This was supposed to be a good day."
2246,"But it wasn’t. The first question I asked Mr. Maduro was whether I should call him “Presidente” or “Dictador,” as many Venezuelans do. I confronted him about human rights violations and cases of torture that have been reported by Human Rights Watch, and with the existence of political prisoners. I questioned his claim that he had won the 2013 and the 2018 presidential elections without fraud and, most important, his assurances that Venezuela was not experiencing a humanitarian crisis. That’s when I opened up my iPad."
2247,The day before I had recorded on my cellphone three young men looking for food on the back of a garbage truck in a poor neighborhood minutes away from the presidential palace. I showed those images to Mr. Maduro. Each frame contradicted his narrative of a prosperous and progressive Venezuela 20 years after the revolution. That’s when he broke.
2248,"About 17 minutes into the interview, Mr. Maduro stood up, comically tried to block the images on my iPad and declared that the interview was over. “That’s what dictators do,” I told him."
2249,"A few seconds after Mr. Maduro left, Mr. Rodríguez, the communications minister, told me that his government had not authorized the interview and he ordered his security agents to confiscate my team’s four cameras and other equipment and the video cards on which we had recorded the conversation."
2250,"Somebody shouted to take me out of the presidential palace immediately, but instead two security agents escorted me to a little room where they ordered me to give them my cellphone and its password. They were concerned that I had recorded the audio of the interview and they didn’t want any leaks. But I refused. "
2251,"Soon after, my colleague María Martínez, one of the best producers in the country, was thrown into the same room. María, to the security agents’ frustration, managed to make a quick phone call to Univision News’s president, who warned the State Department and many news organizations about what was happening. The rest of our team, I later learned — five Univision employees — were taken to the press room, and then out to a government bus."
2252,"In our little room, someone turned off all the lights, and a group of agents came in and forcefully took away my cellphone and my backpack. They furiously went through all my personal stuff. They patted me down from head to toe. María went through the same humiliating experience with a female officer. I asked if we were being detained. They said no — but still they didn’t let us leave the room."
2253,Finally they told María and me to join our colleagues on the bus. They said they wanted to take us to our hotel. But we refused again. At that point we were very concerned about our safety and the possibility of being taken to a detention center or an even darker place.
2254,"We were taken to the street, where Mr. Rodríguez came out to complain about the interview and the way we had conducted ourselves. I told him that our job was to ask questions, and that they had stolen our interview and our equipment. By then, we later realized, the first reports about our detention were already being published. They couldn’t keep it a secret anymore. It was about 9:30 p.m., more than two hours after the end of the interview."
2255,"Our driver, who had been waiting all this time on one of the side streets, suddenly appeared. At that point, the same people who had detained us wanted us to leave. Fast. And so we did. "
2256,"We piled into the car and went back to the hotel. Members of the government’s intelligence agency cordoned off the hotel so we couldn’t leave. A few hours later, an immigration official came to inform us that we would be expelled from the country in the morning. Around 1 a.m., a self-described “captain” — one of the men who had detained me at the presidential palace — came to my room and returned my cellphone in a plastic bag. All of its contents had been deleted. I assume they had first hacked into whatever they could. "
2257,"We experienced only a taste of the harassment and abuse that Venezuelan journalists have been suffering for years. We have two Venezuelans in our crew — the correspondent Francisco Urreiztieta and the cameraman Edgar Trujillo — and they would have faced terrible risks if they stayed in their own country. Luckily, we all made it safely back to Miami. But our cameras and the records of our interview remained behind. "
2258,"What is Mr. Maduro so afraid of? He should release the interview for the world to see. If he does not, all he has proved is that he is behaving exactly like a dictator. "

2263,"When President Trump said on Twitter that an Uzbek man charged with using a pickup truck to kill eight people “SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY,” the man’s lawyers asked a judge to bar prosecutors from seeking execution, saying the decision had become too politicized."
2264,But a federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Thursday that prosecutors could seek capital punishment despite the president’s comments.
2265,"Defense lawyers had argued the president’s tweet and other statements he made on Twitter had put political pressure on the attorney general at the time, Jeff Sessions, to seek a death sentence. The lawyers pointed to public reports that Mr. Trump was considering firing the attorney general for not following his wishes, and said Mr. Sessions would not be able to make an impartial decision."
2266,"NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people, badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!"
2267,"In his ruling, Judge Vernon S. Broderick wrote that Mr. Trump’s statements advocating for the death penalty “were perhaps ill-advised given the pendency of this case.” Still, the judge said the argument that Mr. Sessions was improperly motivated to seek execution was “pure speculation made without a scintilla of direct factual support.”"
2268,The judge said that without more evidence he could not interfere with “the attorney general’s presumptive authority to make charging decisions.”
2269,"In September, Mr. Sessions went ahead and directed prosecutors to seek the death penalty for the defendant, Sayfullo Saipov, 31, if he is convicted at trial, even though Judge Broderick had not yet ruled on the motion concerning the president’s tweets. Six weeks later, Mr. Trump fired Mr. Sessions."
2270,"Mr. Saipov is accused of driving the truck down a crowded bike path along the Hudson River on Oct. 31, 2017, and, after smashing into a school bus, jumping out and running down the highway, shouting “God is great” in Arabic. He was taken into custody after being shot by a police officer."
2271,"He has pleaded not guilty to eight capital counts of murder and other charges, and is scheduled for trial in October."
2272,Judge Broderick wrote that Mr. Saipov had “offered no evidence that the president’s remarks impacted the attorney general’s decision-making process in any way.”
2273,"To the contrary, the judge said, Mr. Sessions had “categorically renounced other provocative remarks made by the president” and had vowed that the Justice Department would “not be improperly influenced by political considerations.”"
2274,Federal prosecutors and Mr. Saipov’s federal public defenders declined to comment on the ruling.
2275,"LONDON — Three suspicious packages that appeared to contain homemade bombs capable of igniting a small fire were found Tuesday in and around transport hubs in London, the authorities said."
2276,The three packages were described as similar: all midsize white envelopes with padded manila envelopes inside.
2277,"The London Metropolitan Police said that a counterterrorism unit had been called in, and was treating the incidents as linked, but that it was “keeping an open mind regarding motives.”"
2278,"No one was injured, but the police issued warnings for people to be vigilant around city transportation hubs."
2279,"“These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened,” a police statement read."
2280,"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the incidents."
2281,"“While transport services continue to operate as normal,” he said, “I urge all Londoners and visitors to our city to remain vigilant, and report any potential suspicious packages to the police.”"
2282,"Just before 10 a.m., the police received a report of a suspicious package at the Compass Centre, an office building on the grounds of Heathrow Airport."
2283,"Employees at the building opened the package, “causing the device to initiate,” and part of the envelope to burn, the police said."
2284,"The building was evacuated and remains closed, but flights at Heathrow were not affected. The office building is outside the airport’s security perimeter."
2285,"Less than two hours later, at approximately 11:40 a.m., the British Transport Police were called to investigate another suspicious package, this one in the mail room at Waterloo Station, a bustling rail terminal in central London."
2286,"That package was not opened, and officers rendered the device safe. The station was not evacuated and train services continued to operate normally."
2287,"Then, at 12:10 p.m., the police were called to a report of a suspicious package at the offices at City Aviation House, which is on the property of London City Airport. That package, too, was not opened, the building was temporarily evacuated."
2288,Flights to and from that airport were not affected.
2289,The authorities issued advisories to transport hubs across London to “be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.”
2290,"The Irish police are also involved in the investigation into the incident. According to British and Irish news reports, at least one of the packages had an Irish stamp on it."
2291,"A spokeswoman for An Garda Siochana, Ireland’s national police service, said it was assisting the Metropolitan Police but would not elaborate further."
2292,"While the motive behind the transit center packages is still unknown, London has been target of terrorism many times over the last 15 years."
2293,"On July 7, 2005, suicide bombers killed 52 subway and bus travelers in London. In 2017, there were various deadly attacks on pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, on London Bridge and near the Finsbury Park Mosque. And a bomb that partially exploded on a commuter train that year burned 23 people."
2294,"Late last year, a parliamentary report detailed a “litany of errors” by the authorities surrounding those incidents."
2295,"BERLIN — For all Berlin’s attractions, it is a small, wooden shack that tops the must-see lists of many tourists here."
2296,"The former guard house stands behind a row of sandbags at a busy intersection in the heart of the city’s downtown, beneath a sign announcing “U.S. Army Checkpoint.” The world knows the spot better as Checkpoint Charlie."
2297,"It was at this crossing, during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, that Soviet and American tanks stood muzzle to muzzle in a standoff that threatened to plunge humanity into yet another war, this one to be fought with nuclear weapons. After six tense days, the two sides backed off without firing a shot. But the site remained ground zero of the Cold War division that split the world into opposing blocs."
2298,"“There is no equivalent anywhere, where tanks stood off and the world worried we were on the brink of World War III,” said Hope M. Harrison, a professor of history at George Washington University, who has studied Cold War Berlin and the city’s development since the Berlin Wall came down. “That is what is so unique about Checkpoint Charlie.”"
2299,"Now, as a reunited Berlin prepares for the 30th anniversary of the Wall’s fall later this year, Checkpoint Charlie is the site of another confrontation, this one pitting developers against historians."
2300,"After intense negotiations and public debate, the city of Berlin approved plans in 2017 to put up commercial and residential buildings, including a Hard Rock Hotel, on the last two undeveloped plots on the site. The project would be on the Soviet side of the checkpoint, facing the Americans’ wooden shack. Space for a museum was included, but it was to be integrated into the commercial buildings with exhibition space largely underground."
2301,The plans set off an intense backlash among those who see Checkpoint Charlie as one of the defining places of 20th-century history.
2302,"The developer, Trockland, was accused of “proposing to transform Checkpoint Charlie into a theme park” in an open letter written by Thomas Flierl, a former culture minister for the city, with five other city planners, architects and historians."
2303,"The commercial focus of the project would overshadow the checkpoint that remained, putting private interests above the public’s need to remember and learn from the site, they wrote."
2304,"The outcry grew so charged that in December the authorities in Berlin suddenly abandoned the project. The city’s development office now says it is working on a plan B, which it hopes will be ready in a year."
2305,"Heskel Nathaniel, Trockland’s co-founder and chief executive, said he was committed to maintaining the historical integrity of the site, whichever concept advances."
2306,"“We have been working with the Berlin government very closely for three years to integrate the elements that are important for the city — commercial, memorial and exhibition spaces,” he said. “But we don’t see a consensus in Berlin, instead a lack of confidence and clarity.”"
2307,The lack of a permanent memorial to Checkpoint Charlie’s history has stoked disputes for decades.
2308,"“That story needs to be told there,” said Ms. Harrison, who is a member of an advisory board for a Cold War museum that has been planned for decades at Checkpoint Charlie, but that has yet to be built."
2309,"In the decades since the Wall fell, the former crossing point’s history has always taken a back seat to commerce and crass tourism."
2310,"Above the sign in English, Russian, French and German informing visitors “You Are Leaving the American Sector,” another sign shows them the way to KFC. Two doors down, the golden arches offer yet another taste of the United States."

2327,"On the eastern side of the United States Army guard house — a replica of the original, which is in a museum — young men in aviator glasses and 1960s-era military uniforms stand side by side. In one hand, they clutch the Stars and Stripes. The other they use to give a thumbs up, or throw an arm around tourists willing to pay a few euros for pictures with them."
2328,"Long gone are the East German guards who would beat a hapless tourist who happened to stray to their side of the boundary. These days, the biggest threat at Checkpoint Charlie is posed by the buses and taxis that dodge selfie-snapping tourists who step into the bustling intersection to grab pictures of the mock soldiers at enough of a distance to avoid the fee."
2329,"To date, only temporary installations exist to inform those who are more interested in the history of the place than in selfies."
2330,"For those seeking deeper dives on the history of Berlin’s partition, there is the Berlin Wall Memorial several miles north, with its documentation center and outdoor exhibition stretching almost one mile along the former border strip."
2331,"But even without a formal museum, and even with the site’s tackier elements, those drawn to Checkpoint Charlie on a recent day said the site was too important to lose."
2332,"Dominick Devismes, taking a detour during a business trip to Berlin, studied an outdoor exhibition showing black-and-white images from the Cold War that revived memories from his childhood in France."
2333,"“They must keep it, otherwise the young people will forget,” Mr. Devismes said. “Like Berlin, it remains symbolic.”"
2334,"Some visitors remembered the place from a time when a watchtower stood above red-and-white striped barriers, which passing cars had to weave through to reach the other side. And the soldiers were real, as were their weapons."
2335,"Del Kittendorf of Marietta, Ga., experienced Checkpoint Charlie in 1983. He had been at a Lutheran Church gathering in what was then East Germany, and he crossed into the West."
2336,"“They checked under the bus with mirrors and in all of the luggage racks — it was crazy,” he said. “This place deserves to be preserved. We must keep the memory and honor the history.”"
2337,"Other visitors were too young to remember the Cold War, but felt obligated to come see the spot that embodies Berlin’s defining role in that postwar era."
2338,"“It’s where you come when you come to Berlin,” said Daniella Collison, 19, who was visiting from Sydney, Australia, with her boyfriend, Max Reinold, 22. He quickly pointed out its importance as a monument: “I learned about it in history class.”"
2339,"Both rejected the idea of building a Hard Rock Hotel at the location. Gesturing to the fast food restaurants and souvenir shops behind the guard house, Mr. Reinold said, “It’s already commercial enough.”"
2340,"BERLIN — In Germany, women are paid an average of 21 percent less than men, one of Europe’s widest gender pay gaps. In Berlin next week, for one day only, the public transportation system will offer them a corresponding discount."
2341,"The BVG, which runs the city’s bus, tram and subway systems and is the country’s largest public transit authority, will offer women an unlimited day pass for 5.50 euros, about $6.20, instead of the regular €7."
2342,"The Frauenticket, or women’s ticket, is limited to Monday, which campaigners in Germany have designated as Equal Pay Day, and the authority is calling the promotion “Mind the Pay Gap.”"
2343,"“The women’s ticket not only challenges the discriminatory wage gap in our country, but also shows that the BVG itself is doing something about it,” Sigrid Nikutta, the authority’s director, said."
2344,"Despite its reputation as a socially progressive country — and its long-serving female leader — Germany has the third-widest pay gap in the European Union, according to 2017 figures from the bloc’s statistical agency. Only the Czech Republic and Estonia, both much smaller countries, did worse. (It also lags the United States, where the figure was 19.5 percent in 2017.)"
2345,"Quotas for the representation of women on corporate boards became law here in 2015, but the number of women in the national Parliament has declined since then, with the arrival of a male-dominated delegation from the far-right Alternative for Germany. There are now two male lawmakers for every female one."
2346,"The city state of Berlin, which is governed by a coalition of progressive and socialist parties, has been actively pushing women’s rights, and for the first time this year made March 8, International Women’s Day, an official holiday in the city."
2347,"Iris Spranger, a member of the city’s House of Representatives who campaigned for that measure, is also supportive of the transportation system’s public relations exercise."
2348,"“The women’s ticket is an original idea to highlight the gender pay gap,” she wrote in an email. “The lively discussion alone shows that it was a good idea.”"
2349,"According to Ms. Spranger, even more important than the ticket is the fact that the BVG has had an equal-pay policy since 2003."
2350,"Equal Pay Day, which in Germany this year falls on Monday, has been around since 1988. It symbolizes the extra days into the new year that German women have to work to earn the same as men."
2351,"The public transport system in Berlin attracts over three million riders a day and has rails spanning almost 300 miles. Its yellow subway cars have become symbols for the city, as have its cheeky ads."
2352,"In one of its online ads for the women’s ticket campaign, the BVG says: “Gender-specific wage gap. Sounds stupid. Is stupid. We’ll close it.”"
2353,"Men found using the special tickets, the authority said, would be treated like regular fare evaders and charged €60."
2354,But in a city where day passes are largely purchased by tourists — regular riders tend to buy monthly tickets — few men seemed to be taking offense at the idea.
2355,"“With the campaign, we also call on women to apply for jobs with us,” said Ms. Nikutta, the first woman to run the BVG and the first leader to make it profitable."
2356,Few lists from The New York Times are as eagerly awaited as Travel’s annual roundup of 52 Place To Go this year.
2357,"Last year, Saskatoon was among the global destinations. This year, Calgary, Alberta, and Lake Superior’s ice caves near Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, landed on the list along with the Setouchi Islands of Japan and Puglia, Italy, among many others."
2358,[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]
2359,"Though I wrote about the ice caves, I played no role in their selection, or that of Calgary. To find out how they made the cut, I spoke with Amy Virshup, who took over as Travel editor for The Times last autumn and was immediately thrown into the compilation of the list."
2360,Readers with a good memory may recall that Calgary was also on the 52 Places list for 2014. But Amy assured me that the city’s return wasn’t a case of institutional amnesia.
2361,"“The new library seemed like such an incredible building, and new buildings, new infrastructure are part of our catalog of reasons that we go to places,” Amy told me."
2362,"“That it was also in a neighborhood that was kind of coming back made it interesting. Also the fact that the library is kind of unusual, with sculptures, a performance hall, a cafe, and that it is trying to redefine what a library is.”"
2363,"The library Amy was talking about is the city’s new Central Library. Like the relatively new main library in Halifax, Nova Scotia, which I’ve had the pleasure of visiting a couple of times, and the Grande Bibliothèque in Montreal, which opened in 2005, Calgary’s new building is defying earlier predictions that libraries would wither away in the digital age."
2364,The ice caves are on the list for a completely different set of criteria. Amy said that she and the other travel editors were looking for experiences or places that may disappear or change because of climate change — last-chance destinations.
2365,"“They were so incredibly beautiful and fascinating, the idea that they were going to go away seemed so incredibly sad to me that I thought we should highlight them,” Amy said."
2366,"The caves are also not particularly well known. Since the list was published this week, I’ve heard from former residents of the Sault who weren’t aware of the natural wonders just an hour or so away from the city."
2367,"If you’re curious about how the full 52 Places list comes together, Amy has put together a detailed explanation."
2368,"In 2018, for the first time, we gave one writer the exhausting, if exciting, task of visiting all 52 places within the year. Jada Yuan’s accounts were a hit with readers. If you missed it in last week’s Canada Letter, make sure you read her final report on a year of nonstop travel."
2369,"The 2019 traveler, Sebastian Modak, was chosen from a wide pool of applicants. He’ll take a slightly different approach, Amy told me, drawing on his background as a multimedia producer to tell his stories."
2370,"As for Canada, Amy said that she wants Travel to take its readers to the country’s less obvious destinations."
2371,"“A lot of our Canadian travel has focused on either a handful of cities or natural beauty like Banff,” she said. “But we know there’s a lot to explore in Canada.”"
2372,"So here’s our challenge for Canada Letter leaders: If you have a favorite destination that you think has been generally overlooked, email us at nytcanada@nytimes.com, explaining why others should visit. Please include your name and where you live. A photo would be a welcome addition. We may use the contributions to create our own mini list of places to visit in Canada."

2389,It is a peculiarity of New York City history: The mayor does not control the subway that is so essential to the city’s success.
2390,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has some influence over the transit system, but he is largely at the whim of state leaders who have controlled the subway since 1968. Now Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, wants to change that."
2391,"Mr. Johnson introduced an ambitious plan on Tuesday to wrest control of the subway from the governor and state lawmakers, many of whom live far from the city and rarely, if ever, take the subway."
2392,"“We must take control of our destiny,” Mr. Johnson said during his first State of the City speech. “We must have municipal control of our mass transit system.”"
2393,"Mr. Johnson, a Democrat who is likely to run for mayor in 2021, released a 100-page report calling for the creation of a city-controlled entity called “Big Apple Transit” to oversee subways and buses. The idea of the mayor taking charge of the subway has long been debated, but Mr. Johnson’s report is the most comprehensive proposal in years."
2394,"New York City is unique in having its transit system run by state leaders. In Los Angeles and Chicago, the systems are mostly controlled by the mayor, allowing those leaders to set their own priorities and to undertake major upgrades. In Chicago, Mayor Rahm Emanuel has overseen a comeback of its aging subway. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti helped win support for a $120 billion ballot measure to expand the rail system."
2395,"But some argue that it makes sense for the state to control New York’s subway since it is part of a much bigger regional transit network. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is a sweeping agency that oversees the subways, buses, commuter railroads and key bridges and tunnels."
2396,"The debate over the subway’s future comes as state lawmakers in Albany are deciding whether to approve new revenue streams for the subway. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has pressed for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll drivers entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise billions of dollars for the transit system."
2397,"Mr. de Blasio recently threw his support behind congestion pricing and announced a plan to fix the system with Mr. Cuomo, with whom the mayor has frequently clashed. Their joint plan called for reforms of the transit agency and for new funding from taxes on recreational marijuana and internet sales."
2398,"A spokesman for the mayor, Eric F. Phillips, said Mr. de Blasio was focused on “immediate actions to fix the broken subway system.” A city takeover of the subway was worth discussing, Mr. Phillips said, but “in best-case scenario would take years to achieve.”"
2399,"Other leaders like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Christine C. Quinn, the former City Council speaker, have called for mayoral control of the subway in the past."
2400,"Still, Mr. Johnson’s proposal faces long odds because the governor and the State Legislature would have to sign off on the new structure."
2401,"The city once ran the subway, but the state took over the struggling system in 1968, in a power grab by Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller. Officials wanted to preserve the 20-cent fare and hoped that the tolls on bridges and tunnels would subsidize the costs of the subway."
2402,"Mr. Johnson has drawn attention to the fact that he regularly takes the subway, unlike the mayor and the governor. Mr. de Blasio occasionally rides the subway while Mr. Cuomo rarely uses the system. Mr. Johnson has made the subway a priority, pushing for congestion pricing and half-price MetroCards for poor New Yorkers."
2403,"Transit advocates praised Mr. Johnson’s proposal, as did Joseph J. Lhota, the authority’s former chairman, who ran against Mr. de Blasio for mayor. Mr. Lhota, who supported the idea of mayoral control during his campaign, praised Mr. Johnson’s “vision for the city.”"
2404,"“It’s refreshing to see someone stand before the people,” Mr. Lhota said, “and say, ‘Hold me responsible. Hold me accountable.’”"
2405,"Mr. Johnson’s speech had the feel of a campaign rally as he sought to position himself as a leader capable of thinking big, in contrast to Mr. de Blasio, who has been criticized for a lack of bold new initiatives in his second term. Mr. Johnson also challenged the state Legislature, saying that the City Council would approve congestion pricing if Albany failed to do so, though it is not clear whether the Council has the authority."
2406,"The speech made clear that if Mr. Johnson runs for mayor, he would use the city takeover of the transit system as a signature issue, just as Mr. de Blasio focused on early childhood education when he first ran for mayor in 2013. Mr. Johnson was introduced by his mother, Ann Richardson, who is from Boston and has the accent to match, telling the audience about her son’s “kind loving haht.”"
2407,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has received a wave of criticism over his handling of the transit system. Although he exerts great control over the agency, he has argued that he does not have enough power and that one person or entity should take charge and be accountable to the public."
2408,"A Cuomo spokeswoman, Dani Lever, responded to Mr. Johnson’s speech with a short retort: “The city already owns the New York City Transit system,” in reference to a long-running debate over whether the city technically owns the system — a contention that Mr. de Blasio’s office has disputed."
2409,"The authority is governed by a board that typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. Mr. Cuomo selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership."
2410,"Mr. Johnson was careful not to mention Mr. Cuomo’s name or to attack him directly, though he criticized the unpopular decision by the Cuomo administration to divert transit funding to struggling ski resorts. Mr. Johnson joked that a mayor would never make that decision over fears that it would lead to tabloid headlines of “Mayor to City: Go Sled!”"
2411,"Mr. Johnson also raised concerns about whether the subway’s leader, Andy Byford, could fix the system with its current structure under Mr. Cuomo."
2412,“Imagine what Andy Byford could do without the built-in dysfunction of the M.T.A. slowing him down?” he asked.
2413,"Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the authority, defended the agency. Transit officials, he said, are working hard to improve service and to convince state lawmakers to support a congestion pricing plan before the April 1 budget deadline."
2414,"“We are laser-focused on the passage of congestion pricing,” Mr. Young said, “and obtaining the funding we need to deliver the transit system that New Yorkers deserve.”"
2415,"As congressional negotiators were wrestling their way toward a compromise bill to fund the federal government this week, one sticking point emerged: the demand by Democrats to reduce the number of beds for immigrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And while the details are complicated, Democrats claim that the legislation, which President Trump is expected to sign Friday, will bring the number of beds to 40,520, down from 49,057."
2416,"But while well intentioned — the list of problems with the immigrant detention system is long — if the Democrats get their way, they will likely make conditions much worse for the tens of thousands of undocumented migrants and asylum seekers in limbo on both sides of the border."
2417,"Cutting back beds highlights two major objections to the detention system. First, the system is an integral component of a private prison-industrial complex owned by a handful of companies, whose profits rely on mass incarceration. "
2418,"Second, because of the Trump administration’s criminalization of prospective asylum seekers and undocumented migrants, the vast majority of detainees are either Central American families fleeing horrific violence or law-abiding Central American and Mexican members of American society. About 58 percent of detainees have no criminal record, and only 20 percent have been convicted of serious felonies (including selling marijuana)."
2419,"We have spent the last few years researching migrant flows into the United States, and this data is consistent with research our team has conducted with roughly 300 returned Central American and Mexican migrants. For the most part, Central Americans were detained after crossing the border as they awaited an asylum hearing, while the majority of Mexicans spoke of being raised in the United States, playing by the rules and being apprehended for minor traffic violations — speeding, a broken taillight or driving without a license. None of the handful of deportees who were found guilty of more serious crimes had languished in immigration detention. They had been summarily deported after serving time in federal prison."
2420,"Detention facilities also hamper the ability of both prospective refugees and undocumented migrants to gain asylum or to successfully plead their case to remain in the United States. Such facilities limit inmates’ communication with the outside world, a situation further compounded by their remote location. And once locked up, detainees are deprived of the means to earn the income required to hire the professional lawyers they need to have a realistic chance of success."
2421,"The treatment migrants receive in detention centers is inhumane. While the traumas that detained children face are well documented, the adult immigrants we interviewed also told countless stories of abuse, including racist taunts, physical aggression and the deprivation of their most basic needs. "
2422,"Jason, a young man voluntarily traveling back to Mexico by bus, was apprehended on the bus and detained because his visa had expired two weeks earlier. He was sent to a detention facility. He told us of begging for food, only to have a guard toss a burrito onto the floor of a fly-infested cell that reeked of excrement. Israel Concha, a young man stopped for speeding and separated from his pregnant wife, described an immigration hearing in which he was prevented from even touching his newborn son."
2423,"Such stories make it easy to see why Democrats pushed to shrink ICE’s capacity to detain people. But cutting back on capacity will not solve the abuses of immigration detention. In fact it is more likely to make things worse (a fact that Democrats have quietly conceded by allowing ICE to adjust the facilities’ capacity if they need to, which is why Republicans claim the actual number of beds allowed is much higher). "
2424,"It is foolhardy to imagine that, in response, the Trump administration will simply detain fewer people, in order to guarantee them all a bed. If anything, it will double down its enforcement of existing policies, rendering the lives of detainees even more of a living hell."
2425,"Increasing numbers of prospective asylum seekers, subjected to the Remain in Mexico policy, would be dispatched to dangerous tent cities in Mexican border towns to wait their turn. Undocumented immigrants would be herded into increasingly cramped quarters or into county jails where conditions are even worse. "
2426,"Florizel, an undocumented Mexican teenager and convert to Mormonism whom we interviewed, described being apprehended and held in a county jail surrounded by pedophiles and murderers, “They left me in the cell for like almost like a whole day without water without food. And it was really cold. I would ask them, ‘Hey, but I didn't do anything!’ And they would just tell me to ‘shut up, friggin’ Mexican.’”"
2427,"Despite its horrors, many apprehended undocumented immigrants opt for detention as the least awful option. Those without a criminal track record are typically given a choice. They can leave the United States voluntarily, or be placed in detention to fight their removal. The vast majority of people we interviewed chose detention because they want a chance to defend themselves and can’t face the prospect of upending their entire lives by leaving. "
2428,"Mr. Concha opted for detention with the faint hope of preserving his life in the United States. “I wanted to fight ’til the end,” he told us. “I had a company and all my family was here. I wanted to know the final outcome instead of wondering all my life, ‘What if I would have fought? What if I did have a chance? What if the laws change?’”"
2429,"To the extent that Democrats are serious about immigration reform, restricting beds is more a gimmick than a solution. Absent the comprehensive reform desperately needed, Democrats should use their new political capital to protect migrant rights. That means demanding more humane treatment at detention centers, guaranteeing the right to asylum for refugees from the region, assuring due process for the majority of undocumented migrants who are upstanding members of our society, and requiring that ICE focus its resources on detaining and deporting only those migrants who have committed truly serious crimes. "

2434,Ricky Gervais plays a nasty widower in a new Netflix series. And the Tim Roth-led “Tin Star” returns to Amazon.
2435,"AFTER LIFE Stream on Netflix. The premise of this dark comedy series can be summed up in a piece of advice given in its first episode: “I should warn you — he might say a few things that are a bit, uhh, brutal.” That line, spoken by Matt (Tom Basden), the head of the local newspaper in a small British town, is said in reference to Tony (Ricky Gervais), an editor of the paper. The show is about Tony; he’s a former nice guy who, after the death of his wife (Kerry Godliman), decides that life would be easier if he started being a jerk to everyone, all the time. It’s a bit like a cynical, reversed version of the positive-thinking Jim Carrey comedy “Yes Man,” with the smile turned upside-down."
2436,"TIN STAR Stream on Amazon. Backcountry brooding is the lifeblood of this series, which stars Tim Roth as a British expat who gets hired as the police chief of a community in the Rocky Mountains. The first season ended in a betrayal that left Roth’s character for dead; the second season, which hasn’t been available stateside until now, picks up right after that. Expect rough justice."
2437,"JUANITA (2018) Stream on Netflix. It’s a great American tradition, hitting the road in search of fulfillment. The desire for self-discovery is partly what drives Juanita (Alfre Woodard) to grab a map and pick a destination at random in this earnest solo road trip comedy, which is based on a novel by Sheila Williams (Roderick M. Spencer, Woodard’s husband, wrote the screenplay). Juanita is exhausted: by city life, by her three adult kids. So she buys a bus ticket to Montana, kicking off a nomadic trip filled with lighthearted culture clashes and another age-old theme: the balance of romance and autonomy."
2438,"ROCK ’N’ ROLL HIGH SCHOOL (1979) Stream on Amazon and Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, iTunes, Vudu and YouTube. This punk rock time capsule turns 40 this year. Directed by Allan Arkush and starring the members of the Ramones, its plot involves a mass record burning and comically wicked school administrators and hall monitors. Its soundtrack has songs by the Ramones (naturally), Devo and Alice Cooper. “Rock ’n’ Roll High School” purports to be little more than summer fun,” John Rockwell wrote in his review for The New York Times. “And, in its zanily unpretentious way, it is certainly that.”"
2439,"RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (1981) 8 p.m. on Paramount Network. Steven Spielberg’s continent-hopping, Nazi-melting, swashbuckling archaeological adventure movie started the Indiana Jones franchise. Paramount Network is showing it alongside its prequel, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), which airs at 10:35 p.m. Spielberg has been in the news this month following reports that he intends to propose rules to limit streaming services’ ability to compete for Oscars. But if streaming is your speed, all four Indiana Jones movies are also available on Netflix."

2441,Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was not at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board meeting in Lower Manhattan on Thursday. But his influence was obvious.
2442,"Transit leaders had been sounding the alarm for months over the need for a fare increase. A vote was scheduled for Thursday. Then Mr. Cuomo and his allies on the board intervened, and the vote was delayed for at least a month."
2443,Now subway and bus riders have no idea if the agency will increase fares or even cut service to tackle a growing budget hole.
2444,"“I’m not for service cuts. Let me be very clear about that,” the authority’s acting chairman, Fernando Ferrer, told reporters after the board meeting."
2445,"Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, has opposed the fare increase. He has relentlessly criticized the transit agency in recent weeks and told it to instead “tighten your belt.”"
2446,"Mr. Ferrer, however, said he believed a fare increase was necessary."
2447,"“We’re serious about cleaning our own house and putting the M.T.A. on a diet, but that alone isn’t going to solve our problems,” Mr. Ferrer said."
2448,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
2449,"The board was expected to consider two proposals for a fare and toll increase across its network of trains, buses, bridges and tunnels. The higher fares would have taken effect in March."
2450,"Then last week, Lawrence S. Schwartz, a board member and ally of Mr. Cuomo, raised the prospect of a third proposal that would tie fare increases to service improvements. On Thursday, Peter Ward — who, like Mr. Schwartz, was a Cuomo appointee — made a motion to delay the fare vote."
2451,"“There’s some confusion, and some new suggestions have been made,” Mr. Ward said. “I’m concerned that we’re making a decision today when we need to be a little bit slower, a little more thoughtful, and need to consider a few more options.”"
2452,"The vote to delay the fare discussion was unanimous, including “yes” votes by three board members appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio. Mr. de Blasio, a frequent adversary of Mr. Cuomo when it comes to the subway, said on Thursday that delaying the vote was “smart.”"
2453,"Board members want assurances that state lawmakers will approve new funding for the transit agency during the current legislative session, Mr. de Blasio said."
2454,"“The thing we need to focus on is a solution in Albany,” Mr. de Blasio said."
2455,"Subway riders are likely to cheer the fare reprieve. But the delay also brings further uncertainty for commuters who are grappling with unreliable service and questions over Mr. Cuomo’s recent decision to call off the L train shutdown. The board has raised fares every two years, but this is the first fare increase to be considered since the subway descended into crisis in the summer of 2017."
2456,"Without a fare increase, the authority expects to lose about $30 million in anticipated revenue each month. If the board votes on a fare proposal next month, it is unlikely to take effect before April."
2457,"It is unclear what fare options the board might consider. Mr. Schwartz has not revealed the details of his plan, though he said it could require subway leaders to show improvements in the on-time rate for trains."
2458,"The board was considering two options for fare increases of about 4 percent: The first would keep the base fare at $2.75, but end the bonus for buying a pay-per-ride MetroCard; the second would increase the base fare to $3 and double the bonus to 10 percent."
2459,"A weekly pass would rise to $33, up from $32. A monthly pass could increase to $127, up from $121."
2460,The fare and toll increase was expected to bring in an additional $316 million per year.
2461,"The debate over fares comes against a backdrop of a power struggle over the system and political pressure from Mr. Cuomo, who controls the authority. Some board members have raised concerns over the board’s independence after Mr. Cuomo scrapped the L train shutdown without their approval."
2462,"One board member, Andrew Saul, said the board should have an opportunity to vote on Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan, which would make repairs to the line’s crucial tunnel between Brooklyn and Manhattan on nights and weekends. Any effort to go around the board, he said at the meeting, would be “a really bad mistake and sets a really bad precedent.”"
2463,"Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan has been called a temporary fix and criticized over safety concerns. A draft memo about the logistics of the plan, obtained this week by the transportation website Streetsblog, warned of major disruptions for riders, including making stations at First and Third Avenues in Manhattan “exit only.”"
2464,"Shams Tarek, a spokesman for the authority, defended the new L train plan on Thursday and argued that avoiding a full shutdown of the tunnel would benefit riders. But it would also mean that “far less alternate service will be needed.”"
2465,"“Just like the previously announced alternative plan, the new one — which is not yet completed and will incorporate significant community input — will accommodate every affected customer through alternate means like other subway lines,” Mr. Tarek said in a statement."
2466,"At the same time, the authority is facing a dire budget crisis. Even if the proposed fare increase is eventually approved, subway leaders have warned of steeper fare increases and major service cuts if state lawmakers do not approve new revenue sources for the system this year."
2467,"Mr. Cuomo has called on state lawmakers to approve congestion pricing, a proposal to pay for subway upgrades by tolling cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan. On Thursday, Mr. Cuomo appeared open to a fare increase if it also came with reforms."
2468,"“Money alone does not solve a problem,” he said. “Management reforms alone won’t solve a problem. You need both.”"

2470,The Metropolitan Transportation Authority board makes decisions that affect the lives of millions of commuters in New York City and the region. Yet most people have no idea who is actually on the panel.
2471,"On Thursday, the board delayed a vote on whether to raise fares and tolls for people who rely on the authority’s sprawling network of subways, buses, commuter railroads, bridges and tunnels. The board could vote on several fare proposals in February."
2472,"The board, a coterie of prominent New Yorkers, is in a power struggle with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who has taken near total control of the transit agency. "
2473,"The board includes wealthy business leaders and the city’s transportation commissioner. One former member, Nancy Shevell, even married a Beatle (Paul McCartney) in 2011 while serving on the board."
2474,Here’s what New Yorkers should know about the board:
2475,"The board votes on major issues like fare increases, service changes and capital improvement projects. The board typically has 17 voting members, including six members chosen by the governor and four by New York’s mayor. There are several vacancies, and the board has only 13 voting members right now."
2476,"The management of the M.T.A. also exerts significant power. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term, selects the board chairman and has a role in hiring the agency’s top leadership. "
2477,"Mr. Cuomo has used his influence over the agency’s leaders to set priorities for the system, an approach that some board members say has favored aesthetics over maintenance. Mr. Cuomo recently called off the L train shutdown and proposed a new way to repair the subway tunnel that carries the line between Brooklyn and Manhattan. Transit leaders say they do not need the board to sign off on Mr. Cuomo’s plan."
2478,"But a watchdog group, Reinvent Albany, said the board should vote on the L train plan, citing the state public authorities law, which states that the board must approve “fundamental financial and business strategies and major actions.”"
2479,Most board members are not household names. But each one has at least a few friends in politics.
2480,"In addition to the members nominated by the governor and the mayor, there are three delegates from Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk Counties. There are four suburban members from Orange, Dutchess, Rockland and Putnam Counties — a group known condescendingly as “quarter-pounders” because they share one vote."
2481,There are also several nonvoting members who represent workers and riders. 
2482,Here are a few of the board’s notable members:
2483,"Mr. Ferrer, a former Bronx borough president, is a co-chairman at Mercury, a public strategy firm. (He has taken an unpaid leave of absence while he is chairman.) He rose to the top job in November when the previous chairman, Joseph J. Lhota, resigned. Mr. Ferrer, a friendly Cuomo loyalist, acts as a pinch-hitter of sorts: He has served as acting chairman twice before. Mr. Cuomo’s office said it would appoint a new chairman, which requires confirmation by the State Senate, in “the coming weeks.”"
2484,"Mr. Jones, who was recommended by Mayor Bill de Blasio, is president of the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty nonprofit. He has been a fierce champion for the “Fair Fares” program to offer discount MetroCards to poor New Yorkers. "
2485,"Mr. Moerdler, a Cuomo appointee, is a partner at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. Perhaps the most quotable board member, Mr. Moerdler has spawned the moniker “First Degree Moerdler” on Twitter for his fiery screeds. He has decried “fake news.” He recently declared, “We are not empty suits.” Mr. Lhota once challenged him to “be a man” during a tense exchange, and Mr. Moerdler responded by saying, “Bring it on.”"
2486,"Mr. Schwartz, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo, is an executive at OTG, an airport concessions company. He is known as being Mr. Cuomo’s enforcer on the board and wants to present his own fare proposals aiming to tie higher fares to service improvements. "
2487,"Ms. Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, was recommended by Mr. de Blasio. She raised concerns about Mr. Cuomo’s L train plan, which has been criticized as a temporary fix and possibly dangerous for riders. Ms. Trottenberg had a tense exchange with Mr. Ferrer at a recent meeting, asking him: “Is the decision made? Do we have any actual role here?”"
2488,"The other voting members are Susan G. Metzger, Mitchell H. Pally, Scott Rechler, Andrew Saul, Veronica Vanterpool, Peter Ward, Carl Weisbrod and Neal Zuckerman."
2489,M.T.A. board members are not paid. Some accept a MetroCard to use when they ride the subway or bus — or an E-ZPass to cross bridges and tunnels — when on official business.
2490,"The board once had access to an unlimited E-ZPass account, though that perk was revoked in 2008 in response to pressure from Mr. Cuomo, who was then the state attorney general. (One former board member, David S. Mack, a wealthy real estate executive, racked up more than $2,000 a year in E-ZPass transactions.)"
2491,"Having a spot on the board is viewed as public service and a high-profile role in the life of the city. Ms. Shevell, its most glamorous member, stepped down after her wedding to Mr. McCartney. "
2492,"OAKLAND, Calif. — The Golden State Warriors run a practice drill that Coach Steve Kerr did not intend as a tribute, even if he named it after someone who taught him a great deal. He calls it the “Lute Olson drill,” and it is a blur of activity: a 3-on-2 exercise that Kerr uses to get his players up and down the court."
2493,"“It’s a good way to get a little running and rhythm and shooting,” he said."
2494,"The Warriors, who are pretty good at those things, have elevated basketball into modern art in recent seasons. But Kerr, as he helps define basketball’s present, cannot help but dip into his past. He learned that drill in 1983, when he was a freshman guard at the University of Arizona playing for Olson, who was in the early stages of building a college powerhouse. Kerr, ever the student, was already absorbing as much as he could."
2495,"Olson, 84, retired as the men’s basketball coach at Arizona in 2008, but his influence resonates. Not so much, oddly enough, at the college level, where, of late, Arizona has had its well-publicized struggles along with the rest of the Pac-12 Conference. Instead, Olson’s impact exists largely in the N.B.A. — and with the Warriors, in particular."
2496,"Bruce Fraser, one of Kerr’s longtime assistants, played for Olson in the 1980s before working under him as a graduate assistant. And Andre Iguodala, the veteran Warriors forward, played at Arizona from 2002 to 2004, when he sought to emulate an older teammate named Luke Walton."
2497,"“All the fundamentals,” Iguodala said. “Things like footwork, body positioning and just being a smart player.”"
2498,"Walton, who now has the thankless task of coaching the Los Angeles Lakers, is still considered a member of the Warriors’ extended family after serving as one of Kerr’s assistants for two seasons. Before Walton joined the Warriors in 2014, Kerr did not know him well. But Olson recommended him, and that was more than enough."
2499,"“If you came out of Arizona during that era, you knew how to play the game,” Fraser said. “And that was mostly because of Lute.”"
2500,"Olson, who has had health issues in recent years, emphasized basketball basics. Each practice began with a series of chest passes. Players worked on their weak hands. The Warriors, who warm up by launching half-court heaves, are slightly less regimented."
2501,"“If Coach Olson walked in and saw some of this, he’d be shaking his head,” Fraser said. “He’d think we’re so loose.”"
2502,"The Warriors are still mindful of the essentials, though, especially at training camp, where they dribble around traffic cones and throw passes at pitch-back nets configured with targets. If they channel the Harlem Globetrotters, their flamboyance is rooted in bedrock principles."
2503,"“And I think you could tie a lot of that back to Coach Olson and Arizona,” Fraser said."
2504,"Kerr played for several legendary N.B.A. coaches — Phil Jackson, Gregg Popovich, Lenny Wilkens, Cotton Fitzsimmons — and he took pieces from each as he developed his own style. Jerry Marvin, his former coach at Palisades High School in Los Angeles, made a big impression, too. But these were coaches with unique approaches."
2505,"“I think the common thread is their force of personality,” Kerr said. “They all saw the game a little differently and ran different stuff, basing a lot of it on their personnel. But it’s not what made them great coaches. It was having great talent, and then developing a great culture and system so that their talent could flourish.”"
2506,"Olson, for example, adapted to the strengths of his roster. He became more guard-oriented over the years, especially after he recruited high-profile players like Damon Stoudamire, Khalid Reeves and Gilbert Arenas. (Kerr noted how he had been one of the “slow guys in the backcourt” when Olson was just starting out at Arizona.)"
2507,"But Olson was not necessarily trying to outwit anyone by being especially innovative. Basketball, Kerr said, is not like football, where a mastermind like Bill Belichick can lean on his tactical genius to mold the New England Patriots into the most dominant N.F.L. team of his era."
2508,"“Football is so strategic,” Kerr said. “But in basketball, there aren’t many guys I can think of historically who are the best coaches on earth who were just offensive wizards or defensive wizards. It was more about the culture they built and the way their teams played together — not a style or a system.”"
2509,"It has become a hackneyed concept in sports, as if teams can just crack the code on demand, but Olson was all about culture, his former players say. Jason Terry, a retired N.B.A. guard who played at Arizona from 1995 to 1999, recalled his recruitment. He was not a shy young man, but Olson, at that point firmly established as one of the game’s top coaches, had the sort of gravitas that intimidated him."
2510,"On the second day of Terry’s official visit to Arizona, Olson and his wife, Bobbi, had him over for pancakes."
2511,"“These unbelievable pancakes,” Terry, an analyst for Turner Sports, said in a telephone interview. “That was a big part of the recruitment. But I also remember that he kind of came over and put his big paw on my shoulder, and I jumped. He was like, ‘Nothing to be scared of young fella. It’s great to have you in my home.’ And from that point on, you were just at ease.”"
2512,"Olson, Terry said, was the first coach he had who never used profanity. Olson would glare. His face would go red. And those big paws would shake."
2513,"“But he would never yell,” Terry said. “He would just say your name over and over and over.”"
2514,"Above all, Olson imbued his players with the sense that they were a part of something larger than themselves. Before the national championship game in 1997, two prominent alumni — Kerr and Sean Elliott, both of whom had graduated to the N.B.A. — boarded the team bus. Olson had invited them to address his players, and their message was simple: Do it for all of us who have come before you but could never quite get the job done."
2515,Terry saw that Olson had tears in his eyes. Arizona went on to win its first national title by defeating Kentucky in overtime.
2516,"“We knew that we couldn’t let him down,” Terry said."
2517,"With the Warriors, Kerr definitely swears on occasion. (Ask Draymond Green.) And the N.B.A. is not college basketball. But Kerr still tries to foster an atmosphere that is more about the collective whole than about its supremely talented parts. Kerr loathes isolation sets. He celebrates ball movement. And he stages team dinners on road trips, where family members are welcome."
2518,"As for the Pac-12, these are rough days. Arizona, under Coach Sean Miller, has been entwined in a corruption scandal, and the conference could send just one team to the N.C.A.A. tournament. Iguodala described the Pac-12 as garbage (he used a more colorful word), though he expressed hope moving forward. Kerr was more diplomatic."
2519,"“It’s been a dry spell,” he said. “And I really don’t know the answer.”"
2520,"In fact, the Pac-12 has not won a national championship since Kerr boarded the Arizona team bus back in 1997 and delivered his pregame pep talk. But in his own way, as the Warriors chase another title, he is still carrying the mantle for the conference and his old coach."
2521,"East London’s kinetic buzz of nightclubs, galleries, mosques, boutiques, synagogues, workers, government housing and condos, not to mention the traffic and the food markets that curry up the air … well, it can make a newcomer dizzy."
2522,"It dazzled José Sarmento Matos. He had moved to East London from Portugal to attend graduate school at the London College of Communication, and was sharing a flat with a friend of a friend. He didn’t know the city, and it took him a half-hour to get to his classes by bus. That commute became his road to discovery. Mr. Sarmento Matos learned to manage the hubbub of East London, unpack it and capture it, all with his camera."
2523,"Every day, as he worked on his master’s degree in documentary photography and photojournalism, he practiced the furtive art of street shooting wherever he went."
2524,"“My camera was a reason to explore more, walk more, observe more and learn more about the city,” he said, “and specially about East London.” He also honed his craft as he peeled back East London’s layers. He discovered that the East End’s angles and architecture made magic with light and shadow, and that its colors and multiculturalism offered a trove of artistic possibilities."
2525,"More than five years and thousands of images later, “Documenting East London” reveals his part of the city and his confident visual style. The play of light and shadow and the highlighting of single images within a frame make his photos look almost like oil paintings. (In fact, he considers the Baroque master Caravaggio, who combined human scenes with dramatic chiaroscuro lighting, a major inspiration.)"
2526,"Whether documenting commuters, shoppers, vendors or picnickers, Mr. Sarmento Matos also illustrates a classic truth: The knowing eye at the right place and the right time can elevate an ordinary scene into something different."
2527,"“Documenting East London” shifted from an exercise “to becoming an assumed personal photography perspective about this part of the city,” Mr. Sarmento Matos said. It also became a visual series documenting, indirectly, the changing cultural landscape of that traditionally working-class section of London, he added. East London is trendier than it has ever been, with more places for the wealthy to eat, drink and be merry, and fewer places not-wealthy people can afford. The fashionable people Mr. Sarmento Matos documented were not just passing through."
2528,"Mr. Sarmento Matos, 30, has already exhibited “Documenting East London” in Lisbon at Espaço Cultural Mercês, and he hopes it will soon be a book. He  now freelances for The New York Times and other publications and teaches documentary photography at the London College of Communication. In 2015, Magnum Photos named him in its “30 under 30” list."
2529,"The East London series is a departure from his usual projects, like one on call centers in India and the Philippines, and another on “Manila Before Duterte.” He has just finished a two-year project on the Portuguese diaspora in Venezuela and the reverse diaspora from Venezuela to Portugal."
2530,"“Usually in my other documentary work I go much more in-depth,” he said, adding: “However, sometimes I need a break from it. When I am in London or in the streets, I get a break from that intense intimacy. ‘Documenting East London’ is quite the opposite of all my other documentary work. This is my voyeurist side.”"

2532,"In 1969, a Chicago advertising agency was working on an ad concept that would parody the social justice marches of the day to sell hair-care products. One of the staff members assigned to execute it, a black woman named Barbara Gardner Proctor, wasn’t amused."
2533,"“It was during the days of the black revolution,” Ms. Proctor recalled 20 years later in an interview with C-Span, “and they wanted me to do a ‘foam-in’ demonstration in the streets, with women running down the streets waving hair spray cans. I said I would never do that.”"
2534,"She was fired, which set the stage for a bit of history."
2535,"“It became quite apparent to me,” she said, “that if I did not begin to control my own destiny, I was going to have it changed about every five years.”"
2536,"And so the next year she became, by all accounts, the first black woman in the United States to found her own ad agency when she established Proctor & Gardner. There was no partner; she simply used her married name and her maiden name to create the impression that there might be a male associate, in case any potential clients had chauvinistic leanings. Eventually she built Proctor & Gardner into a multimillion-dollar company."
2537,"Ms. Proctor, whose career also included a small role in bringing the music of the Beatles to the United States and a shout-out from President Ronald Reagan during a State of the Union address, died on Dec. 19 in Chicago. She was 86."
2538,"Regina Young, a former employee and family friend, said that she had recently fractured a hip in a fall and also had dementia. Her death came to light only last week."
2539,"“Barbara Gardner Proctor was a legendary pioneer in advertising, entering the business during the 1960s ‘Mad Men’ era when black people generally could not get hired in advertising firms,” Judy Foster Davis, a professor at Eastern Michigan University and the author of “Pioneering African-American Women in the Advertising Business: Biographies of Mad Black Women” (2017), said by email. “As the first African-American woman to establish an advertising agency, she succeeded in a field which was — and continues to be — quite exclusionary with respect to women of color in high positions.”"
2540,"Ms. Proctor, who started her company with no capital or experience as a chief executive, was matter-of-fact about her leap of faith. “You can only do it when you don’t know you can’t do it,” she said."
2541,"Barbara Juanita Gardner was born on Nov. 30, 1932, in Black Mountain, N.C. Her mother, Bernice, who later worked at the Pentagon, was an unmarried teenager, and when she moved to Washington to attend secretarial school, Barbara was sent to live with a family in Asheville, N.C. When Barbara was about 4, her grandmother brought her back to Black Mountain to live with her."
2542,"She grew up there in a house without electricity or running water, in an area where everyone, white or black, was poor. When the C-Span interviewer asked her about overcoming steep odds, she said, “I didn’t know they were odds; that was life.” Only when she went back to Asheville for high school, she said, did she realize how sparse the circumstances of her childhood had been."
2543,"After graduating in 1950 she attended historically black Talladega College in Alabama, earning a degree in English and education after three years, then staying an additional year to earn a degree in psychology and sociology."
2544,"After graduation in 1954 she worked for a summer as a camp counselor in Kalamazoo, Mich., a stop on what she thought was a path to a teaching career."
2545,"“The only thing you could train for if you were a black girl in the South, rural, poor, was a teacher or hairdresser, and a nurse,” she said, describing her prospects in the mid-1950s. “So of those three I chose to be a teacher.”"
2546,"But on the way back to North Carolina she stopped in Chicago to buy some clothes for her new profession — and, as she often told the story, bought too many and was left without enough money for the bus back east."
2547,"“In a sense I’ve been 30 years trying to get my bus fare back home,” she said in the 1989 interview."
2548,"A beauty shop owner let her have a room to stay in, and while she pondered how to earn that bus fare she pitched in at the local Urban League office."
2549,"“I thought I was volunteering,” she said. “After two weeks I got a check, and I realized that I had a job.”"
2550,"She did social work with the Urban League for about a year, then fell into a completely different line of work, which led to an unusual footnote in her career — the one involving the Beatles."
2551,"Ms. Proctor had listened to the radio a lot while working late and was so struck by the voice of one disc jockey, Sid McCoy of WCFL, that she arranged to meet him and then offered to organize the vast inventory of records at his family’s record store. He in turn arranged for her to begin writing liner notes for Vee-Jay Records, a local concern for which he scouted jazz talent."
2552,"Soon she was working in distribution for Vee-Jay, a job that took her to Europe to swap records with representatives from other companies at a time when representation of rock acts was more fluid than it would soon become."
2553,"In 1962, she traded records by the Four Seasons, a Vee-Jay act, for discs by the Beatles, who had not yet made an impact in the United States, and arranged for Vee-Jay to sign the group to a limited contract. It released some Beatles records, including “Please Please Me” and “From Me to You,” in 1963, but they didn’t catch fire, and gambling debts racked up by Vee-Jay’s president threw the company into turmoil. Vee-Jay also released a Beatles album, but bigger fish, notably Capitol Records, soon dominated the group’s American representation."
2554,"In 1964, Ms. Proctor took a job with the Post-Keyes-Gardner advertising agency, which, according to Dr. Davis’s book, forced her to begin using her married name, Proctor, to distinguish herself from the unrelated founding partner, although her 1960 marriage to Carl Proctor had ended the previous year."
2555,"“The first job I had was writing the back labels to Pine-Sol bottles,” she recalled."
2556,"A few job changes later she found herself at an agency called North, where the dispute over the hair-foam campaign led her to found Proctor & Gardner."
2557,"She started with nothing, then used a $1,000 loan from a friend to rent an office above a pizza shop. Then she went to the Small Business Administration seeking a loan."
2558,"“They asked what I had for collateral, and I said, ‘Me,’ ” she wrote in a first-person article in The Chicago Tribune in 1990. She got an $80,000 loan. Six months later she had her first account, Jewel Foods, a Chicago grocery chain."
2559,"Other clients followed, including Kraft Foods and Sears, Roebuck & Company. She was written about in The Wall Street Journal, Ebony and other publications, and, in early 1984, “60 Minutes” broadcast a segment about her. Just a few weeks later, five minutes into his State of the Union address, President Reagan made her even more well known."
2560,"Speaking about the nation’s recovery from the economic downturn of the early 1980s, Reagan cited “small-business people with big ideas, people like Barbara Proctor, who rose from a ghetto to build a multimillion-dollar advertising agency in Chicago.”"
2561,"But her company, which had billed more than $13 million worth of business in 1983, was beginning to decline, partly because larger agencies had begun to recognize the importance of minority consumers, a segment of the business from which she had benefited, and had begun to hire and promote black women. She was also hampered by her own principles."
2562,"“Acknowledging the social impact of advertising,” Dr. Davis said, “she refused to create ads or work with products she believed were detrimental toward women or black people.” Cigarettes and hard liquor were among the products she would not represent."
2563,"In 1995, the company filed for bankruptcy. Ms. Proctor made a brief effort to reboot with an eye toward the emerging internet market, but gave it up and retired."
2564,"Her survivors include a son, Morgan Proctor, and two grandchildren."
2565,"Ms. Proctor credited her success in part to her accidental landing in Chicago, a city that she thought was more open to experimentation than the Eastern advertising centers might have been."
2566,"“It is probably the only city where I could have had the latitude to grow and to be as different as I was in those times and still have some measure of success,” she wrote in the 1990 article."
2567,The C-Span interviewer asked her if during her career she had ever thought of moving.
2568,"“Never,” she said. “I would not leave Chicago to go to heaven.”"
2569,"WASHINGTON — A bus emblazoned with the United States Air Force logo was idling outside the Capitol on Thursday, members of Congress on board, ready to depart for Joint Base Andrews and a waiting military aircraft. Inside, Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in her office making final preparations to lead the congressional delegation on a secret visit to American troops in Afghanistan with a stop in Brussels."
2570,Then came word from the White House: President Trump was grounding their plane and killing the trip.
2571,"Mr. Trump’s decision to upend Ms. Pelosi’s travel plans was a remarkable bit of one-upmanship in an increasingly bitter government shutdown drama in which Mr. Trump and Ms. Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker, are the main antagonists."
2572,"The day before, Ms. Pelosi had suggested that the president cancel or delay his State of the Union address this month, citing security concerns amid a prolonged partial shutdown that has forced thousands of federal employees to work without pay. Mr. Trump at first said nothing, but 24 hours later, without mentioning her request, the president released a sarcasm-tinged letter in which he told her the trip was off."
2573,"“In light of the 800,000 great American workers not receiving pay, I am sure you would agree that postponing this public relations event is totally appropriate,” Mr. Trump wrote. “I also feel that, during this period, it would be better if you were in Washington negotiating with me and joining the strong border security movement to end the shutdown.”"
2574,"“Obviously,” Mr. Trump added, she still had the option of flying commercial."
2575,[Read more on how Nancy Pelosi’s aides are accusing the Trump Administration of leaking her travel plans.]
2576,"The letter amounted to the latest reminder, if any was needed, that the stalemate over Mr. Trump’s demand that Democrats support his request for $5.7 billion to build a border wall has reached such a poisonous pitch that even the most tradition-bound rituals of government — the president’s annual address to a joint session of Congress, lawmakers’ periodic trips overseas to gather facts and perform oversight — have been consumed in a storm of ill will and competing agendas."
2577,"It came on the 27th day of the shutdown, a day on which there were once again no negotiations between the two sides. But there was some indication that House Democrats, increasingly concerned that they have not sufficiently countered Mr. Trump’s demands for a wall with ideas of their own, were privately weighing offering their own plan for more effectively securing the border."
2578,"The move would be something of a shift in strategy for the Democrats, who have steadfastly refused to engage in a debate with Mr. Trump about border security as long as the government remains shuttered."
2579,"“There have been concerns by some members saying we need to tell our constituents what we’re for and what it would look like in terms of border security,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee that handles homeland security. “That is probably a way to respond to that, and a way that does not violate what we are saying: open up the government and then we will talk about border security.”"
2580,"Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, who told a group of committee chairmen at a closed-door meeting on Wednesday that it was time for their party to go public with its own border security ideas, reiterated the idea in an interview."
2581,"The president, he said, “is making this about border security, but what he is proposing would not provide real border security — it’s a stupid, static wall which is a symbol, and it’s not a great symbol, and it would be ineffective.”"
2582,"Among the investments that Mr. DeFazio said should be made instead are more money for Coast Guard equipment and personnel to intercept maritime drug shipments, better technology to scan vehicles legally crossing the border to detect illegal drugs, resources for costly reconfiguration of border crossings to make them more secure, and funds for additional personnel to police them."
2583,"“It’s a horrible waste of money when we have real needs,” Mr. DeFazio said of Mr. Trump’s wall, “so I just want to highlight the real needs to counter his fake proposal.”"
2584,"Ms. Pelosi hinted at such a proposal in a morning news conference on Thursday, where she also said that Mr. Trump had yet to respond to her request about delaying his speech. “Very silent more than 24 hours,” the speaker told reporters."
2585,But the lull did not last long.
2586,"Mr. Trump’s decision to revoke Ms. Pelosi’s military transport drew howls of outrage from Democrats and some Republicans, and threw into disarray a long-planned trip by the speaker and senior lawmakers — including the chairmen of the House Intelligence and Foreign Affairs Committees — to visit American allies and troops stationed overseas."
2587,"Democrats, newly in control of the House and eager to use their power to challenge Mr. Trump, vowed that they would not be bullied into scrapping the trip altogether."
2588,"“We’re not going to allow the president of the United States to tell the Congress it can’t fulfill its oversight responsibilities, it can’t ensure that our troops have what they need whether our government is open or closed,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the chairman of the intelligence panel."
2589,"“We are a coequal branch of government,” Mr. Schiff said, suggesting that the president apparently did not understand the new reality in Washington. “It may not have been that way with the past two years when he had a Republican Congress willing to roll over anytime he asked, but that is no longer the case.”"
2590,"Mr. Schiff was on the bus outside the Rayburn House Office Building near the Capitol when Mr. Trump fired off his letter, along with Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and several other lawmakers in what made for an unusual tableau."
2591,"Instead of heading for Joint Base Andrews and boarding a military plane, the lawmakers sat stunned on their bus, unsure of what to do next, until it eventually drove slowly to the Capitol driveway — some journalists jogging or riding electric scooters to keep up — to disgorge its perplexed passengers. At one point, the House sergeant-at-arms, the chamber’s chief law enforcement officer, turned up to puzzle over the security arrangements for the lawmakers, whose secret travel plans were now public. And the speaker, holed up in her office with aides as reporters mixed near the Rotunda with tourists oblivious to the drama, calmly plotted her next steps."
2592,"In the hallway one floor below, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, sputtered with anger."
2593,"“It’s petty, it’s small, it’s vindictive,” Mr. Hoyer said. “It is unbecoming of a president of the United States, but it is unfortunately a daily occurrence.”"
2594,"White House officials — including Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff — had been irked by Ms. Pelosi’s invocation of security concerns as her premise for urging Mr. Trump to move his speech, and sought to put her in her place after she had emphasized that she represented a coequal branch in governing, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions."
2595,"Depriving Ms. Pelosi of an aircraft was the easiest way to remind her, they said. So Mr. Trump made a play for dominance and one-upmanship reminiscent of his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, when he was mayor of New York. White House aides were tickled by the move, even as some acknowledged that Republican House members might fear for their own trips going forward."
2596,Some of Mr. Trump’s usual allies were less amused.
2597,"“One sophomoric response does not deserve another,” Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said in a statement."
2598,"“Speaker Pelosi’s threat to cancel the State of the Union is very irresponsible and blatantly political,” he added. “President Trump denying Speaker Pelosi military travel is also inappropriate.”"
2599,[Read the letter here.]
2600,"Later in the day, the Trump administration had some good news for State Department employees, announcing that despite the stalemate it was asking furloughed workers to return to work on Tuesday, citing the department’s vital national security mission."
2601,"It was the latest instance of the administration determining that an agency or department has a critical mission and its employees should return to work. But unlike in other parts of the government, the State Department employees will be paid, at least for work performed in the next pay period."
2602,"Military planes are traditionally provided to congressional delegations for foreign trips, which are typically kept secret because of security concerns, particularly when lawmakers are heading to war zones and the delegation includes high-ranking congressional leaders. The White House has known about the trip since early last week, when it was brought to its attention by the Defense Department, according to White House officials."
2603,"A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, noted that Mr. Trump had traveled to Iraq to visit with American forces there during what he referred to as the “Trump Shutdown.” He added that the trip by the congressional delegation had a similar purpose."
2604,"“The purpose of the trip was to express appreciation and thanks to our men and women in uniform for their service and dedication, and to obtain critical national security and intelligence briefings from those on the front lines,” Mr. Hammill said."
2605,"A White House spokesman said that all coming official visits by lawmakers, known as congressional delegations or “codels,” would be canceled until the shutdown is over, and by day’s end on Thursday, officials announced that Mr. Trump had also canceled plans to send Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland."
2606,"But Melania Trump, the first lady, kept her plans to fly on a military jet to West Palm Beach, Fla., to go to the family’s Mar-a-Lago compound."
2607,"As of late Thursday, multiple congressional officials could not say, citing security concerns, whether Ms. Pelosi’s trip to Afghanistan was still on."
2608,"LOS ANGELES — I first met Alex Caputo-Pearl, the union leader at the head of the teachers strike here, in 2002, back when he was teaching social studies at Crenshaw High School. "
2609,"He started out as a young Teach for America recruit in 1990, the program’s inaugural year. Alex, a Maryland native, told me he always envisioned Los Angeles as the most promising place in the country to stage a campaign to restore the promise of equality to public education, and to fight for justice for underserved students of color and underappreciated teachers. The fact that the times — the crime-and-punishment ’90s and early aughts — weren’t particularly good for his particular vision didn’t matter. Alex dug in. Among other things, he co-founded the Coalition for Education Justice and started a social justice academy."
2610,"Now the times seem to have finally caught up with his vision. In 2014 Alex became president of United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing more than 35,000 teachers and school staff members in the Los Angeles school district, and he immediately began infusing it with an activist energy it had lacked for a long time. On Monday, after two years of the union and the district failing to agree on a new contract, teachers began a strike that feels like the culmination of everything Alex came here to do."
2611,"Los Angeles hasn’t seen a teachers strike in 30 years, and the risks are huge. But nearly 100 percent of the union members voted to strike because they believe it is necessary if public education is going to be restored to its rightful status as one of the Golden State’s great attractions. "
2612,"Los Angeles may seem like just one of the teachers strikes — in Kentucky, West Virginia, Arizona and Colorado — that have roiled the country in the last year. But the fight here feels more existential. "
2613,"For decades, California has innovated and prospered while its public education system has drifted downward. Once known for its quality public schools, in the 2015-2016 academic year, California ranked 41st among all states in cost-of-living-adjusted per-pupil spending. Now, as inequality grows and living here becomes increasingly unaffordable, reversing the decline in public education is not about idealism — it is about the state’s survival. It feels like a now-or-never moment, a final chance to commit to the public schools that have been eroded by politics, racial wariness and insufficient and invidious alternatives like charter schools."
2614,"Money is what we’re told the conflict is mostly about. The Los Angeles district says it simply can’t afford the union’s demands, which include raising salaries immediately by 6.5 percent, hiring more nurses and counselors, and reducing class sizes. The superintendent blames the state for not properly funding schools. The union agrees that the state needs to step up, but also accuses the district of hedging about its own finances and what it can afford to do."
2615,"Regardless, money has always been a symptom, not the cause, of a deeper problem."
2616,"California’s view of its own schools started souring in the late ’70s, when voters passed Proposition 13, a state initiative billed as “tax reform” that froze property tax rates and dealt a serious blow to local school funding. The anti-tax/anti-big-government sentiment driving the measure was part of a conservative backlash that had been building since the Supreme Court’s 1954 decision to desegregate public schools."
2617,"The late ’70s was also Los Angeles’s moment of reckoning with desegregation. A mandatory busing order had proved hugely unpopular in the San Fernando Valley and provoked an ugly fight (mandatory busing lost). Suddenly public school was no longer another site of opportunity and advancement in California, but a public space being contested by black people. Los Angeles and California shifted from being theoretically golden for all to being golden for a deserving few."
2618,There is a measure on next year’s ballot that would close Proposition 13’s corporate tax loophole and potentially generate billions more for schools. But the outcome is uncertain. 
2619,"Race remains a factor. In the last decade, California’s demographics have shifted, with Latinos edging out non-Hispanic whites as the biggest ethnic group. “With the vast majority of our students coming from low-income neighborhoods of color,” Alex wrote in an op-ed essay in The Los Angeles Times last week, “racial discrimination” is the only way to describe the persistently poor conditions. "
2620,"The strike began Monday in heavy rain, a rare event here (even in winter). Watching thousands of teachers thronging the streets in their bright rain gear drove home the seriousness of the issues they are striking for. "
2621,"I can’t help but think of my husband, Alan, who died in 2015. He was a teacher for 37 years, and would have certainly been on the picket line with his colleagues. Alan had sharp criticisms for everyone — the union, the district, the political climate that underfunded schools, the parents who consistently failed to come to his parent nights. "
2622,"But he mostly criticized himself. Though well-loved at Hamilton High, he never rested on his laurels. At the end, he was tiring physically, but not professionally; he struggled with depression and worried constantly about not being good enough, about not being able to do more for students who always needed more, especially students of color."
2623,"His kind of unsentimental and unyielding passion has characterized the Los Angeles teachers strike thus far. “There’s a moment here where we can build the kind of movement we need,” Alex said in a recent interview with his alma mater, U.C.L.A. "
2624,"That’s a lot to hang on a moment, but Los Angeles remains a capital of ambition, a place to realize dreams that feel outsize or overdone in other places. If it can happen anywhere, it can happen here."
2625,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
2626,"Rafi Eitan, the canny Israeli spymaster who commanded the Nazi-hunting team that captured Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and many years later was unmasked as the handler of Jonathan Jay Pollard, the American Navy intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty to passing on more than 1,000 secret documents to the Israelis, died on Saturday in Tel Aviv. He was 92."
2627,"The death was confirmed by the Ichilov Medical Center, where Mr. Eitan had been hospitalized, Israeli news organizations said. In a statement, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Mr. Eitan “among the heroes of the intelligence services of the State of Israel.”"
2628,"Mr. Eitan, a bespectacled man with thinning hair, was a legend in his country because so many feats of espionage and international intrigue seemed to bear his fingerprints. He exploited loopholes in national security to achieve masterful strokes of espionage, counterterrorism or simple revenge."
2629,He played important roles in the surgical strike on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981 and the assassinations of the Palestinian commandos who carried out the massacre of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972. He was also suspected of being involved in the late-1960s disappearance of at least 100 pounds of highly enriched uranium from a nuclear fuel plant in the Pittsburgh area; many believed that the uranium was diverted to Israel to help its atomic bomb program.
2630,"“In principle, when there is a war on terror you conduct it without principles,” Mr. Eitan said in an interview with the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz in 2010. “You simply fight it.”"
2631,"No single deed garnered as much attention as the kidnapping of Eichmann, the SS official who drew up plans for the Final Solution, the mass deportation of Jews to camps for extermination."
2632,"Mossad, the Israeli counterpart of the Central Intelligence Agency, had learned from a German prosecutor that a young German woman in Buenos Aires had befriended a young man there named Nicolas Eichmann, who lived with his family in a suburb of the city. His father, it was determined, was using the alias Ricardo Klement."
2633,"Through surveillance, Mr. Eitan and his team established that Klement, who appeared to be Eichmann, returned home from work by bus each day. On May 11, 1960, Mr. Eitan and his team, pretending to be a group of men fixing a stalled car, snatched Eichmann after he got off the bus."
2634,"“I grabbed him by the neck with such force that I could see his eyes bulge,” Mr. Eitan recalled. “A little tighter and I would have choked him to death.”"
2635,"They drove three miles to a safe house, where Eichmann was kept for seven days, during which he admitted that he was indeed Adolf Eichmann."
2636,"“We did not want to show Eichmann how nervous we all were,” Mr. Eitan told an interviewer. “That would have given him hope, and hope makes a desperate person dangerous. I needed him to be as helpless as my own people were when he had sent them in trainloads to the death camps.”"
2637,"The team dressed Eichmann in the outfit of an El Al airline crew member, forced him to drink a bottle of whiskey to make him wobbly, and escorted him onto a departing airplane as if he were an under-the-weather steward. An actual El Al crew member remained behind in Buenos Aires so that there would be no discrepancy in the manifest. The team was also aware of the Argentine whereabouts of the demonic Nazi medical experimenter Josef Mengele, but Mr. Eitan had blocked any attempt to seize him because it could have jeopardized the capture of Eichmann."
2638,"The kidnapping was condemned in Argentina as a violation of that country’s sovereignty and of international law, but it was met with deep satisfaction and vindication by tens of thousands of Holocaust survivors. Eichmann faced a trial in Jerusalem that drew renewed attention to Germany’s systematic genocide. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity and was executed by hanging in 1962."
2639,"In his book “Gideon’s Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad” (1995), the British author and investigative journalist Gordon Thomas wrote that Mr. Eitan spoke to Eichmann in the execution chamber."
2640,"“Eichmann looked at me and said, ‘Your time will come to follow me, Jew,’ ” Mr. Thomas quoted Mr. Eitan as recalling, “and I replied, ‘But not today, Adolf, not today.’ ”"
2641,"Rafael Eitan was born on Nov. 23, 1926, in the British Mandate of Palestine to Zionists who had immigrated from Russia three years earlier and lived in a small settlement near Tel Aviv. Not yet a teenager, Rafi joined the Haganah, the forerunner of the Israeli Army, to defend the settlement against Arab attacks and was later recruited into its more elite branch, the Palmach."
2642,"With Jews pressing the British for an autonomous homeland, his most dazzling venture was to crawl through sewers to blow up a British radar installation on Mount Carmel. It earned him the sobriquet “Rafi the Smelly,” to distinguish him from another Rafael Eitan, who went on to become chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces. Mr. Eitan also played an important role in smuggling Jewish refugees from Nazism into Palestine."
2643,"Mr. Eitan was twice wounded in the 1948 war for independence. After telling his superiors that it was difficult for him to run in the field, they assigned him to an intelligence unit. His spying career had begun, though he took time to earn a degree from the London School of Economics."
2644,"Over the next few decades he served as operations chief at Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and as Mossad’s deputy operations chief. In 1965, posing as an Israeli government chemist, he visited a nuclear fuel plant in Apollo, Pa., outside Pittsburgh. It was later discovered that a large quantity of enriched uranium had vanished. Though the case has never been solved, some American analysts concluded that it was more than a coincidence that Mr. Eitan’s visit had occurred around the time of the disappearance."
2645,"In 1985, Mr. Pollard, an intelligence analyst for the Navy assigned to monitor classified materials on global terrorist activities, was arrested on charges of spying for Israel and turning over thousands of documents to it. He confessed and was sentenced to life imprisonment. After serving 30 years, Mr. Pollard, now 64, was granted parole and released from prison in 2015."
2646,"The Pollard affair strained the close ties between the United States and Israel and raised the specter of divided loyalties among some American Jews — though today, after revelations in 2013 of the United States spying on allies through the National Security Agency, the double-dealing seems routine."
2647,"Israeli officials at first tried to depict the Pollard case as a rogue operation by Mossad. But Shimon Peres, Israel’s prime minister at the time, publicly apologized and allowed State Department officials to question Mr. Eitan, who had been the adviser on terrorism to a previous prime minister, Menachem Begin, and had overseen Mr. Pollard’s spying. Mr. Eitan later told journalists that he had acted with “permission and authority.”"
2648,"According to Mr. Thomas, the British author, Mr. Eitan was also for a time a secret adviser on counterterrorism to MI6, the British foreign intelligence agency, and had helped Mossad agents track an Irish Republican Army bomb squad in Gibraltar that was then killed by British special forces."
2649,"In the wake of the Pollard affair, Mr. Eitan lost his executive intelligence post but was made head of the state-owned company Israel Chemicals, a job that ended in 1993 when he was 67."
2650,"He and his wife, Miriam, were said to have had three children and several grandchildren, but there was no immediate information on his survivors."
2651,"Mr. Eitan’s role in the operation to capture Eichmann was dramatized in the 2018 movie “Operation Finale,” in which he was played by Nick Kroll."
2652,"In supposed retirement, Mr. Eitan undertook large agricultural and construction projects in Cuba and, like other Israeli spymasters, fashioned something of a political career. He represented the Gil Pensioners Party in the 2006 elections for the Knesset, Israel’s parliament. It won seven seats, and he briefly served as minister for pensioners. But Mr. Eitan lost his seat in 2009."
2653,"His one other avocation was sculpture, and Mr. Eitan produced more than 100 pieces over more than 30 years. None, however, have been as savored for their cleverness as his espionage operations."
2654,A documentary about the country singer Charley Pride airs on PBS. And “Chef’s Table” returns on Netflix.
2655,"AMERICAN MASTERS — CHARLEY PRIDE: I’M JUST ME 9 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). “When Jackie Robinson went to the major leagues, I was picking cotton beside my dad,” the singer Charley Pride recalls near the beginning of this documentary. “And I said to myself, ‘Here’s my way out of the cotton field.’” While Pride didn’t end up becoming a baseball star, he did break his own ground as a trailblazing country music star — and as one of the relatively few black performers to reach his level of success in the genre. This hourlong documentary charts Pride’s rise, beginning with his childhood in Sledge, Miss., where he was born in 1938 to a family of sharecroppers. Dolly Parton, Brad Paisley, Whoopi Goldberg, Marty Stuart, Willie Nelson and others make appearances."
2656,"TONE BELL: CAN’T CANCEL THIS 10 p.m. on Showtime. The comedian Tone Bell, known as the fiancé in the CBS sitcom “Fam” and a war-veteran-turned-security-guard in Netflix’s “Disjointed,” discusses student loans (paid) and Alaska (cold) in this comedy special."
2657,"INTERSTELLAR (2014) 10:25 p.m. on FXM. Environmental catastrophe is at the center of Christopher Nolan’s anxious and ambitious space movie, which stars Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway as astronauts on a mission to find humans a new home planet. That the search is necessary is a product of a Dust Bowl-like blight that has rendered Earth unable to produce most crops (other than corn). In his review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the film “distills terrestrial anxieties and aspirations into a potent pop parable, a mirror of the mood down here on Earth.”"
2658,"CHEF’S TABLE on Netflix. The sixth season of this food profiles a new set of a chefs. Asma Khan, who founded the Indian restaurant Darjeeling Express in London and put together a kitchen staffed entirely by women, talks here about formative experiences growing up in India. In another episode, the American chef Mashama Bailey gives a tour of her restaurant, the Grey, built in a former segregated bus station in Savannah, Ga. As in previous seasons, both the chefs and their food are presented simply, admiringly, and with a minimalism that reads as a rebuke of the bloated excess favored by food competition shows."
2659,"LOVING VINCENT (2017) Stream on Hulu; Rent on Amazon, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. If you’re on a Vincent van Gogh kick after seeing “At Eternity’s Gate,"" consider this lush animated feature about the artist’s life from the directors Dorota Kobiela and Hugh Welchman. An Oscar contender in 2017, the film was marketed as the first full-length animated film to be made entirely of oil paintings on canvas. It follows a young man (Douglas Booth) investigating the painter’s death about a year after it happened. In his review for The Times, A. O. Scott wrote that the viewer “becomes accustomed to the images, and astonishment at the film’s innovative, painstaking technique.”"
2660,"UMM AL-FAHM, Israel — With three weeks to go, the Israeli election is so close that Arab voters, who make up only a fifth of the population, could help bring Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s long career to an abrupt end."
2661,Mr. Netanyahu has been fanning the flames of anti-Arab sentiment almost daily.
2662,"He has warned Israelis that his main challenger, the retired army chief Benny Gantz, would “hand over parts of the homeland to the Arabs” and that he would make alliances with Arab parties that “want to destroy” Israel. Mr. Netanyahu has also joined forces with a racist faction whose leaders support expelling Arab citizens and call them “the enemy.”"
2663,Such appeals have worked for Mr. Netanyahu in the past. This time they might backfire.
2664,"Small Arab communities like the Druze, who prize their loyalty to the state and often vote for right-wing parties, show signs of deserting Mr. Netanyahu en masse, according to a new poll from the University of Maryland. The poll also suggests that Mr. Netanyahu’s racial provocations may spur turnout among Arab voters motivated to usher him out of office."
2665,[Read our overview of the Israel elections.]
2666,"If the race between Mr. Gantz’s Blue and White party and Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud remains a nail-biter, the swing of a single seat in Parliament could be decisive."
2667,"And the two Arab parties could, as Mr. Netanyahu warns, help make Mr. Gantz the prime minister through postelection deal-making."
2668,"“We need to tell Netanyahu, ‘Thank you for your incitement, now go home,’” said Afif Abu Much, 37, a computer engineer and political activist from Baqa al Gharbiyye, a town abutting the West Bank."
2669,The danger for Mr. Netanyahu is that his belaboring of the threat posed by Palestinians could drive them to the ballot box.
2670,"Based on a new survey of more than 700 Arab voters, Shibley Telhami, director of the University of Maryland’s Critical Issues Poll, projects that Arab turnout will rise to 69 percent of eligible Arab voters, up from about 64 percent in 2015."
2671,"“For now, it looks like this strategy is working against Netanyahu, not for him,” Mr. Telhami said."
2672,"But with three weeks to go, anything could happen. Mr. Netanyahu’s strategy has proved reliable before and could still succeed if it depresses the Arab vote while energizing right-wing Israelis."
2673,"It was already a stormy time for Arab citizens of Israel, who were jolted last year by passage of a basic law formally declaring their country the nation-state of the Jewish people alone. The law, pushed through by Mr. Netanyahu, downgraded the Arabic language and dealt a blow to ideals of equality."
2674,"Mr. Abu Much still winces at the memory of a slogan in Mr. Netanyahu’s first election, in 1996: “Bibi is good for the Jews.” The implication for Arab voters, many of whom prefer to be called Palestinian citizens of Israel, was clear."
2675,"In his most recent campaign, in 2015, Mr. Netanyahu played on racial enmity on Election Day, warning that Arabs were being bused to the polls “in droves.” It energized his supporters, and he won handily, though he drew stern rebukes from the Obama administration and was forced to apologize."
2676,"In a sly wink to that remark, Israel’s leading Arab politicians, Ayman Odeh and Ahmad Tibi, are running ads showing themselves smiling in front of buses and urging voters to “flock to the polling stations.”"
2677,"This year, with little fear of White House pressure and ample reason not to wait, Mr. Netanyahu has stirred the pot on a daily basis."
2678,"“It’s not new, but he’s made it into an art form,” said Amal Jamal, a professor at Tel Aviv University who specializes in political communication. “Begin and Shamir were also racist. Even Rabin also said a few things that, if they were said against Jews in the U.S. or the U.K., the whole world would be standing on its back feet. But Netanyahu has turned it into the center of the campaign.”"
2679,Mr. Netanyahu’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
2680,"The prime minister’s haranguing against Arabs and their parties was so conspicuous that a popular Israeli model and television host, Rotem Sela, took Mr. Netanyahu to task, writing on Instagram that “the Arabs are also human beings,” that “all people are born equal,” and that “this is a country of all its citizens.”"
2681,"To which Mr. Netanyahu responded with a fresh affront, saying matter-of-factly that Israel was decidedly not a state of all its citizens. “Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish people — and not anyone else,” he said, adding a day later that Israel’s “Arab citizens have 22 nation-states around them and they do not need another.”"
2682,"Again, the implication was clear: “It means he’s depicting Arab citizens not only as second-class, but as traitors, as a fifth column, as illegitimate,” Mr. Jamal said."
2683,"The barbs seem to be taking a toll on the Druze, an Arab ethnic group whose members serve in the Israeli army, prize their loyalty to the state and had been a source of significant support for Mr. Netanyahu. More than half of likely Druze voters are now backing Mr. Gantz, Mr. Telhami said, and Druze support for right-wing parties as a whole — already exceptional among Arabs — has plunged to less than 20 percent from around twice that."
2684,"“We are very disappointed,” said Manal Birani, 47, a Hebrew and math teacher in Daliyat al-Karmel, a Druze town near Haifa. “Very angry. I hope that Gantz will win. When he says, ‘I’m against the nation-state law and I’ll help you to change it,’ he wants to change it.”"
2685,"But many Arabs say they cannot root for Mr. Gantz, who announced his candidacy with ads trumpeting the numbers of “terrorists” he had killed as army commander during the 2014 war in Gaza."
2686,"“Gantz started his campaign with a confession of war crimes,” said Majd Kayyal, a 28-year-old novelist living in Haifa. He said he would not vote: “I don’t care with what instrument I will be oppressed.”"
2687,"In Umm al-Fahm, a hilly town of 54,000 in the so-called Northern Triangle of heavily Arab Israel, residents complain that violent crime receives little attention and the police do little except hand out traffic tickets."
2688,"“When it’s a Muslim Arab killing another Muslim Arab, there’s nothing done,” said Raja Mahmeed, 37, a fishmonger in a crowded strip mall. “This all comes from the Israeli politics — ‘Let them kill each other,’” he said."
2689,"Mr. Mahmeed said he would vote either for an Arab party or for Meretz, a left-wing party that put up big billboards in the center of town."
2690,"But others, disillusioned by Arab political infighting, say they are sitting out the election. “It’s useless,” said Samir Mahmeed, 37, a barber shop manager from the same extended family. “Who would I choose? I want to choose someone who works for the Arab community, for Umm al-Fahm. No one’s doing anything for the Arabs.”"
2691,The practical consequence is that Arabs who abstain — either out of support for a boycott or frustration with the options — are likely to benefit Mr. Netanyahu.
2692,"Perhaps the most poignant finding in Mr. Telhami’s new survey was the steady increase in the number of Arabs identifying themselves as Israeli first, rather than Arab, Palestinian or Muslim. That number has been steadily ticking up, to 17 percent, from 12 percent in 2011."
2693,"At the same time, other polls have shown that nearly half of Israeli Jews would favor expelling all Palestinians, and a large majority believes Jews should have privileges that Arabs do not."
2694,"“It’s heartbreaking,” Mr. Telhami said. “Just as Arabs are getting to be more and more Israeli, the Jews want them to be less Israeli.”"
2695,"Raja Mahmeed, the fishmonger, said he considered himself both an Israeli and a Palestinian Israeli."
2696,"“Believe me, the people themselves, in the market, in the street, we and the Jews live together,” he said. “Our problem is just with Netanyahu, the extreme right wing. If we could just have them leave the government, we could live in peace.”"
2697,"The blackface performances that 68-year-old Bernie Oakley remembers from the 1960s weren’t held during booze-fueled college fraternity parties. They were held at fund-raisers for local schools. And his father, who considered himself an anti-racist Sunday school teacher, was the M.C. "
2698,Mr. Oakley was one of about 75 readers who wrote to tell us about their memories of witnessing or participating in blackface or other racist behavior when they were young.
2699,"After Gov. Ralph Northam of Virginia admitted, then denied, being in a photo that included someone in blackface and that appeared in his medical school yearbook, we asked readers to tell us about similar memories. "
2700,((Read more about the presence of blackface and other racist imagery in college yearbooks.)) 
2701,"Many recalled seeing or participating in racist activities at school, where it was sanctioned by adult role models, when they were children."
2702,"Their memories, spanning seven decades from 1940 to 2010, chronicle the evolution and persistence of racist episodes within schools and among groups of children."
2703,Several described struggling to reconcile their enjoyment of those things with their anti-racist beliefs and to unlearn what they were taught. 
2704,"Here are some of their responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. In the comments, tell us if you have similar memories as a child, and how they affect you today."
2705,"(In some instances, we have replaced a common racist slur with _____.)"
2706,"My mother, my sister and I spent the entire summer of 1942 in Mississippi. I recall vividly boarding an empty bus with my younger sister en route to our house after a day at camp. After paying our fare, we plopped down in seats four or five rows behind the driver. He promptly motioned for us to move to the most forward seats near him, like a teacher admonishing us for talking in class. We soon learned why. "
2707,"The bus filled to the brim with black people, who all had to sit or stand behind the only white people on the bus: two kids, 10 and 11 years old. "
2708,"The unfairness of this did penetrate my young mind. I was fortunate to spend most of my life in a Northeast university environment, where admissions of blacks in the 1960s forced me to confront, in myself, the intrinsic and often unconscious prejudices we Northerners carry. "
2709,"But even now, in retirement at age 88, the blackface stories from Virginia and elsewhere are giving me angst. I really did enjoy the comedy of earlier years; remember Rochester in the Jack Benny show? "
2710,"We laughed and felt no animosity toward blacks, but now — helped by the current news — I can see that we were unaware of how hurtful the stereotyping would be to a person of color."
2711,"In the late 50s, when I was 8 or 9 years old, I remember attending minstrel shows put on as fund-raisers for schools. My father was the M.C. of these shows. They were a very popular event in my hometown, Burlington, N.C. "
2712,"On the stage would be a line of people sitting in chairs. Each person would have a talent that they would perform for the show. At each end of the line were two white men in blackface who would tell slightly off-color jokes in an exaggerated, Southern, black dialect. "
2713,I enjoyed the shows. They were very entertaining.
2714,"Of course, I now know how offensive those portrayals of black men really were. They were the perfect example of black men being depicted as not-very-smart clowns. "
2715,"At the time I was proud of my father. He was a Sunday school teacher in our Methodist church. From a very early age, he taught me to reject the racial discrimination and segregation in our town."
2716,I told my 40-year-old son the story of the minstrel shows a week ago. He was surprised to find his grandfather’s role was so prominent. He only knew my dad as a very liberal Democrat who loved to make fun of conservative Republicans.
2717,"I was a 12-year-old kid at my cousins’ school-sanctioned minstrel show near Providence, R.I., where many kids were in blackface. I thought nothing of it, because like legions of others back then, I lacked the sensitivity to understand how hurtful that behavior could be. "
2718,"But when is this witch hunt that started in Virginia going to end? We’ve all done insensitive things, but it seems if we all want some tender mercy for our own misdeeds, we better be willing to give some."
2719,"I am from a small town in Minnesota. When I was a preschooler in the 1950s, we all sang the ubiquitous “Ring Around the Rosy” that ended with “Last one down is a _____baby.” I am horrified that we were ever taught this version. I am aghast to this day."
2720,"In 1963, when I was in seventh grade in Lake Arrowhead, Calif., I had a minor role in a high-school production of a play about Helen Keller. I wore black makeup on my face and the back of my hands and was taught to speak my lines in a warped Southern “slave” accent. "
2721,"There were no black students in our school nor any black families in the district, but the teacher/director chose to leave the parts in and find kids to play them. While the makeup was not exaggerated blackface, it was apparent that I was a white kid in makeup. "
2722,I wanted to be a part of the show and accepted the role as all I would get after not being chosen to play Helen Keller. I felt false. I never believed in the accuracy or authenticity of my character. But being part of the magic of a theatrical production made me decide to do it.
2723, I feel sorry now. We should have made the teacher change the role.
2724,"During the summers, my main entertainment in hot, very humid New Orleans was swimming at a pool. "
2725,"After legislation deemed that the city pools had to become integrated, the local government decided to close them. The bigotry affected every citizen whose right to utilize the pools had been taken away. I have no interest in ever returning to New Orleans because despite its marvelous cuisine and rich historical sights it left me with sad and embarrassing memories."
2726,"When I was growing up in southern Louisiana in the 1970s, the word “_____” was used nearly every day around me. When an adult had to develop an alternate way of accomplishing something/making it work, especially if it looked bad or was done in a “lazy” way, it was always termed “_____-rigged.” "
2727,"I am a proud inventor as an adult woman. I love problem-solving and learning about electronics, machine or car repair because I am very curious. But 40 years later, my inescapable first thought is to call it “_____-rigging.” "
2728,I was also taught to sing “Eeny Meeny Miny Mo” to include “catch a _____ by the toe.” 
2729,I don’t know how I escaped this indoctrination. It’s plainly and simply disgusting to me today.
2730,"My high school — South High School in Denver, Colorado — had Johnny Reb as our mascot. Confederate flags flew at all of our school events. "
2731,"I have a picture of my car in our senior year homecoming parade with a purple Confederate flag painted on the hood. NO adult (parents, teacher or otherwise) in my life thought to clue me in to how racist this was. "
2732,This still angers me and pains me. I can only imagine what black students and their parents at my school experienced and felt about all of this.
2733,"I remember being in fourth grade in West Seneca, N.Y., and having to race the only kid of color in our school for P.E. class. I was not popular; I was fat, and awkward. But this kid, because he was poor and black, was less liked than I. "
2734,"When the race began, a couple of kids held onto his shirt and started singing “Fight, fight, the _____ and the white, one is black and the other is right.” The P.E. teacher stopped the race, and we had to start all over again. "
2735,I don’t remember if anyone was reprimanded for what happened. But it was so unsettling that it has stuck with me 35 years later. I don’t think this young boy stayed at my school for much longer. I often wonder what happened to him. It makes me sad. 
2736,We were driving back to Maryland through Pennsylvania in 1996 after a family visit; I was about 8 years old. I saw a large cross on fire that stood in stark contrast to the night sky. 
2737,"I thought it was beautiful and pointed it out, thinking it was something done to show religious pride. My mother told me it was the work of evil men, men who were not Christlike at all in their violence and hate. I didn’t even know what the K.K.K. was."
2738,"How sad it is that nobody taught me about racism or slavery or civil rights before then. It makes me feel ashamed of myself for not being a more curious child, and shame on my community for keeping us in a state of ignorance until we were “old enough to understand and not be traumatized by it.”"
2739,"Indigenous students were treated very poorly in my entire public school experience in Bismarck, N.D. "
2740,Some kids from my school made T-shirts for a football game against another school with a high indigenous population. 
2741,"The slogan on the shirt read “Pack the Bowl, Clear the Rez.” It showed a pipe being cleaned out over the Bismarck Community Bowl, the field where they played homecoming games, and racist drawings of indigenous people falling out onto the field. "
2742,“Clear the Rez” was a particularly chilling thing to invoke in a state with a history of forced assimilation and genocide of indigenous folks. 
2743,Ask any non-Native American adult in Bismarck for their best impression of an “Indian voice.” Almost everyone there will give you the exact same racist skit about people from the town of Fort Yates. It is so normalized there that I had no idea people everywhere in the United States didn’t feel like that.
2744,"After going to school at Bismarck High, I had to unpack and unlearn some awful phrases and attitudes. Even though I knew these things were racist, it was hard to get them out of my mind for years."
2745,"My parents raised me to stand up for people being picked on, but I didn’t do it as much as I should have. Sometimes I would argue, but I was a gay transgender kid in a very hostile town to that, and as much as I tried to stand up for everyone, I really failed at that sometimes. I am deeply ashamed."

2748,The N.F.L. on Sunday ended months of uncertainty by officially announcing Maroon 5 and the rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi as the lineup for this year’s Super Bowl halftime show.
2749,"In an indication of how fraught the debate around the high-profile performance has become, Scott released a statement on Sunday announcing that he and the N.F.L. will partner on a $500,000 donation to the social justice group Dream Corps — a move that seemed to be aimed at stemming a backlash from groups that have criticized the football league’s policies."
2750,"Sources familiar with the N.F.L.’s Super Bowl plans had confirmed the rock band Maroon 5 as the headliner as long ago as September, and Scott emerged last month as a reported addition to the Feb. 3 halftime performance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. Big Boi, the newest name on the bill, is a member of the Atlanta rap group Outkast."
2751,"But the run-up to this year’s halftime announcement had turned into a skirmish over sports and politics, as artists and others criticized the N.F.L. over its treatment of Colin Kaepernick and other players who have taken a knee during the national anthem in protest of racial injustice."
2752,"In February, the rapper Cardi B, who was featured on Maroon 5’s hit “Girls Like You” last year, told the celebrity news website TMZ that she would consider performing at a halftime show “when they hire Colin Kaepernick back.”"
2753,"In a song released last June, Jay-Z rapped, “I said no to the Super Bowl, you need me, I don’t need you.”"
2754,"Scott’s involvement, specifically, has prompted criticism from some. In an interview with TMZ, the Rev. Al Sharpton said he thought Scott “should do what a lot of other major artists have done — say, ‘I’m not going to participate.’”"
2755,"“You can’t fight against Jim Crow and then go sit in the back of the bus,” he added."
2756,"In a pair of tweets, the rapper Meek Mill responded to the news that Scott would be performing with, “For what????” and “He don’t need that he on fire already!”"
2757,"And Gerald Griggs, first vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the N.A.A.C.P., told The Guardian that the chapter had contacted artists and asked them not to perform. “The majority of artists we’ve reached out to are standing in solidarity against the N.F.L.,” Griggs said. “They do not want to be associated because of the protest that was started by Mr. Kaepernick against racial injustice and police brutality.”"
2758,"For his part, Van Jones, the president of Dream Corps and a founder of the group, celebrated the announcement in a post on Twitter, addressing Scott by his handle."
2759,"“This is great news!” Jones wrote. “Welcome, @trvisXX. Glad to have you with us, brother!”"
