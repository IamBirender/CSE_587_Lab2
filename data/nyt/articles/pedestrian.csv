0,"WASHINGTON — A Maryland man inspired by a 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, France, has been detained for allegedly plotting to drive a stolen truck into pedestrians at a busy shopping and entertainment complex alongside the Potomac River in hopes of creating “panic and chaos,” the U.S. Justice Department said on Monday."
1,"The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland said it charged 28-year-old Rondell Henry of Germantown, Maryland, with interstate commerce transportation of a stolen vehicle. It said the government has since petitioned a federal court to detain Henry pending trial after learning more about his motives."
2,"“I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving. I wasn’t going to stop,"" the government quotes Henry as saying in its motion seeking detention pending trial."
3,"A detention hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Thomas M. DiGirolamo."
4,"Henry's public defender, Michael Citaramanis, declined to comment."
5,"In its criminal complaint, the government said that on March 26, the Alexandria Police Department in Virginia received a report about a leased U-Haul truck that was stolen from a nearby mall."
6,"The driver who rented the truck initially reported seeing a man in a blue BMW follow the U-Haul off Interstate 395 and park in a space near the U-Haul at the mall. When police arrived at the mall, they found the BMW still parked there and discovered it was registered to Henry."
7,"A day later, the stolen U-Haul was found in National Harbor, a bustling development along the Potomac in Maryland across from Alexandria, Virginia, that features bars and restaurants, shops, a Ferris wheel, a luxury hotel and residential apartments."
8,Video surveillance showed Henry parking and getting out of the truck. He was arrested the next day.
9,Prosecutors say that Henry has harbored “hatred” for those who do not practice the Muslim faith and was allegedly inspired by videos he watched of foreign terrorists.
10,"Specifically, they said he was inspired by the 2016 terrorist attack in Nice, France, in which a man drove a truck at high speed into crowds, killing 86 people, and for which Islamic State claimed responsibility."
11,"Henry ""walked off his job in Germantown, Maryland, in the middle of the day, determined to walk down the extremist path,"" the government alleged in court papers."
12,"""Recognizing that his older four-door sedan would not cause the catastrophic damage that he desired, the defendant drove around the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area looking for a larger vehicle to steal."""
13,"According to a posting http://www.mymcpnews.com/2019/03/27/concern-for-missing-germantown-man-19 on the Montgomery County Police Department, Henry was reported missing and was last seen by his co-workers on March 26."
14,"The Justice Department said that before setting his sights on National Harbor, Henry wanted to try driving the truck into pedestrians at Dulles International Airport in Virginia."
15,"He arrived at the airport around 5 a.m. on March 27, but the airport ""lacked the large number of unloading pedestrians the defendant hoped to find,"" the court filing says. He also tried to find a way through security at the airport, but struck out multiple times."
16,"Henry then made his way to National Harbor, arriving around 10 a.m. that same day. He later told police he wanted to create “panic and chaos,” just like ""what happened in France,” prosecutors said."
17,"Henry still did not find a large crowd, however, so he decided to wait. He broke into a boat and hid there overnight, the government said."
18,"The next day, police had tracked down the stolen truck and were there waiting. After Henry jumped over a security fence, the government said, he was arrested."

20,"The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high, contributing to what has been an “alarming rise” in such deaths in recent years, according to a new study."
21,"An estimated 6,227 pedestrians were killed in traffic in 2018, according to the study from the Governors Highway Safety Association, a projection based on data from the first half of the year. That figure represents a striking rise from a decade earlier, when 4,109 pedestrians were killed in traffic."
22,"“I’ve been in this business for 36 years and I’ve never seen a pattern like this,” said Richard Retting, who wrote the report and has worked in a variety of traffic engineering and safety roles for the New York City Department of Transportation, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and other federal and local transportation agencies."
23,"The report cited alcohol use, speeding, unsafe infrastructure and the prevalence of SUVs as some of the biggest problems contributing to the fatalities. It also suggested that the increased use of smartphones may contribute to such deaths."
24,"“We can’t say in any definitive way that the amount of wireless data and the amount of smartphone use is an exact cause, but the relationship is uncanny and it’s not unrelated,” said Mr. Retting. “The fact is that many, many smartphones are used while people are driving cars.”"
25,"With smartphone use on the rise, both drivers and pedestrians are at risk of being increasingly distracted. According to the report, the number of smartphones in active use increased more than fivefold between 2009 and 2017 and was matched by an even larger increase in annual wireless data traffic."
26,"Some of the increase can be attributed to population growth, but that was not the largest factor, according to Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “That doesn’t mean that it’s acceptable,” he added."
27,"“We are driving more and driving deadlier cars,” said Emiko Atherton, director of the National Complete Streets Coalition."
28,"Also of concern: City dwellers who cannot afford to drive are being pushed into suburbs that are not designed to be walkable, Ms. Atherton said."
29,"“When you combine high-speed, high-volume roads with sprawl, it’s a perfect recipe for death,” she added."
30,"In recent years, cities across the country have worked to tackle the problem, adopting “Vision Zero” plans, modeled on a successful Swedish initiative of the same name, with the goal of eliminating traffic fatalities outright. But while many cities have made progress toward that goal, pedestrian deaths have proved difficult to eradicate."
31,"In New York, for example, overall traffic deaths fell to their lowest levels in more than a century last year, though pedestrian deaths increased, mirroring the longer-term trend nationwide. The last time the number of pedestrian deaths in the country was higher was 1990, when 6,482 people were killed."
32,"Nationally, overall traffic deaths fell 6 percent from 2008 to 2017, but pedestrian deaths rose 35 percent over that same period."
33,"“Vehicles are becoming safer, but as pedestrians we don’t have that same armor protecting us,” Mr. Adkins said."
34,"Many of those deaths are occurring at night. From 2008 to 2017, the number of nighttime pedestrian fatalities increased by 45 percent while daytime pedestrian fatalities increased by 11 percent."
35,"A 2016 analysis in New York found that the end of daylight saving time contributed to the problem: Earlier sunsets and darkness in the fall and winter were linked to more pedestrian traffic fatalities. In response, the city has since instated an awareness campaign to remind drivers of the increased risk during winter."
36,"In its effort to reduce pedestrian deaths, the city has focused on what the data show, redesigning particularly dangerous streets, reducing speed limits and even giving pedestrians a head start over vehicles when crossing streets, according to Polly Trottenberg, New York’s transportation commissioner."
37,"“It’s geography, it’s seasonality and time of day, it’s speed management, it’s driver behavior,” she said."
38,"Five states accounted for nearly half of the projected deaths: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia and Texas."
39,"Florida is the deadliest state for pedestrians, according to a January report from the National Complete Streets Coalition, a program within the nonprofit advocacy group Smart Growth America. But it has made considerable strides toward reducing pedestrian deaths, Mr. Retting said."
40,"For example, he said, the state has invested $100 million to improve lighting in about 2,500 locations throughout the state to make it easier to see pedestrians using or crossing roads at night."
41,"“That’s the kind of action that’s called for,” Mr. Retting said."
42,"The state also recently overhauled its roadway design manual with a renewed focus on “putting the right road in the right place,” said DeWayne Carver, who manages the state’s Complete Streets program. Florida has also put a pedestrian and bicycle safety plan in place."
43,"Such infrastructure improvements are keys to improving safety, he said, but technological improvements can help, too."
44,"Last year, for example, the nonprofit Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that Subaru’s collision-avoidance system, EyeSight, led to a 35 percent reduction in pedestrian-related insurance claims."
45,"“One of the things we can do as consumers and as a nation is to get this kind of technology in every car,” Mr. Retting said."
46,"The National Complete Streets Coalition report ranked states and metropolitan areas using a calculation called the Pedestrian Danger Index, which controls for the number of people who live in the state as well as the number of people who walk to work."
47,"Florida cities accounted for eight of the 10 most dangerous metropolitan areas for walking, and the state itself ranked first in the nation with 5,433 pedestrian deaths between 2008 and 2017."
48,"The problem of pedestrian fatalities is nearly as old as the car itself. In early 1886, Karl Benz, of Germany, applied for a patent on what is often credited as the first gas-powered automobile. A decade later, Bridget Driscoll became its first pedestrian victim, according to Guinness World Records."
49,"Federal prosecutors said Monday they had filed a criminal charge against a 28-year-old man who they say planned to run down pedestrians on the National Harbor waterfront, a popular tourist site along the Potomac River near Washington."
50,"The man, Rondell Henry of Germantown, Md., was inspired by the terrorist group ISIS when he stole a U-Haul van from a parking garage in Alexandria, Va., on March 26, according to the United States attorney’s office in Maryland. He has been charged with interstate transportation of a stolen vehicle."
51,"Prosecutors say Mr. Henry, a computer engineer, drove the van early on March 27 to Dulles International Airport, where he got out and tried, unsuccessfully, for more than two hours to find a way through security. Mr. Henry then got back in the U-Haul and drove to the National Harbor in Maryland, arriving around 10 a.m., they said."
52,"According to prosecutors, Mr. Henry walked around looking for an ideal spot to mimic a 2016 Bastille Day attack in Nice, France, in which a truck barreled through a crowd of spectators, killing more than 80 people."
53,"Because the crowds at the National Harbor waterfront on March 27, a Wednesday, were thin, he delayed his plans, prosecutors said. He broke into a boat and hid there overnight, according to court documents."
54,"The next morning, police officers discovered the stolen U-Haul and arrested Mr. Henry after he leapt over a security fence from the boat dock, according to prosecutors. The authorities first identified Mr. Henry through registration records left in his BMW, which was parked in Alexandria, near where the U-Haul was stolen, they said."
55,"Mr. Henry did not have an escape plan, as he did not plan to survive the attack, prosecutors said."
56,"“I was just going to keep driving and driving and driving,” he is quoted as saying in a motion for detention filed on Monday by federal prosecutors. “I wasn’t going to stop.”"
57,"A detention hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 12:45 p.m. in Federal District Court in Greenbelt, Md."
58,"Thomas Mooney, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Henry on state burglary and malicious destruction of property charges related to the National Harbor episode, said he would plead not guilty. A public defender representing Mr. Henry on the federal charge did not immediately return a call for comment on Monday afternoon."
59,"Mr. Henry was reported missing after he left work around noon on March 26, and his family was concerned about his “physical and emotional welfare,” according to a public notice issued by the Montgomery County Police Department."
60,"A spokeswoman for Hughes Network Systems, a broadband satellite company in Germantown, said Mr. Henry had previously been employed there as an independent contractor. The company declined to provide details about his position."
61,"Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of George Washington University’s program on Extremism, said there is a long history of using vehicles as weapons of terror. In 2010, Al Qaeda promoted the use of cars to run over people in its online magazine, in an article titled “The Ultimate Mowing Machine.”"
62,"It was not until the rise of the Islamic State in 2014, however, that vehicular attacks became a common occurrence in Western countries. The most devastating was the 2016 attack on Bastille Day. It was followed by an attack on a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 as well as numerous smaller ISIS-inspired attacks in Europe and in North America."
63,"An ISIS motto has become, “It doesn’t matter what you do, as long as you do something,” Mr. Hughes said. And vehicles, of course, are easier to obtain than other weapons."

65,"The number of traffic deaths in New York City dropped in 2018 to the lowest level in more than a century, a sign of progress for Mayor Bill de Blasio’s plan to eliminate fatalities on the city’s streets."
66,"The news, however, was not all promising: Although overall deaths declined, the number of pedestrians killed in traffic increased last year, city officials said on Tuesday."
67,"Mr. de Blasio has implemented a number of safety improvements in his aim to eliminate all traffic deaths by 2024, a program he named Vision Zero after a Swedish plan."
68,"The total number of people killed in traffic crashes in New York City fell to 200 last year, down from 222 deaths in 2017 and the lowest level since the city began tracking such deaths in 1910, according to preliminary data from the city."
69,"The reduction is part of a five-year decline from 299 deaths in 2013, the year before Vision Zero began and the speed limit on most streets was lowered to 25 miles per hour."
70,"“Vision Zero is clearly working,” Mr. de Blasio said in an interview, calling the drop since 2013 stunning."
71,"But pedestrian deaths, which account for the largest share of traffic fatalities, increased last year to 114, from 107 in 2017 — a troubling sign that the city’s streets remain dangerous for many New Yorkers."
72,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat who began his second term a year ago, called the rise in pedestrian deaths disappointing. He said the city would do more to redesign streets to make them safer and to enforce laws requiring vehicles to yield to pedestrians."
73,"“Drivers haven’t taken their responsibility to yield very seriously,” Mr. de Blasio said. “There has been a lot of enforcement, and there will be more.”"
74,"The number of bicyclist deaths dropped last year to 10, from 24 in 2017, according to the city. The number of people who died in vehicles also fell to 37, from 58 in 2017. But the number of motorcyclist deaths increased to 39, from 33 in 2017."
75,"Nationally, more than 37,000 people died in traffic crashes in 2017, according to federal transportation data that is not available yet for 2018. The number of traffic fatalities in the United States fell by about 2 percent in 2017, but that followed increases in deaths in 2016 and 2015."
76,"In New York, safety advocates have pressed Mr. de Blasio to move faster to improve streets. Marco Conner, deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said there were still too many deaths and injuries."
77,"“It’s an achievement, and it should be celebrated,” Mr. Conner said of the drop last year. “But I think the big question is: Why aren’t we doing more against the enormity of the epidemic? We’re only really taking baby steps.”"
78,"The people who lost their lives represent a cross section of New Yorkers: A 5-year-old girl, Abigail Blumenstein, and a 1-year-old boy, Joshua Lew, were killed by a driver in Brooklyn while crossing the street with their mothers; an 89-year-old woman, Beatrice Kahn, was hit by a car in the Bronx; and a 9-year-old boy, Giovanni Ampuero, was struck by a driver who fled the scene in Queens."
79,"In August, a 23-year-old Australian woman died after she was hit by a garbage truck while riding a bicycle near Central Park. She was cut off by a livery cab that entered a bike lane. Her death led to calls for better bike infrastructure, such as protected lanes with a physical barrier."
80,"The city’s transportation commissioner, Polly Trottenberg, said that her agency completed 138 street improvement projects last year and added more than 20 miles of protected bike lanes. She called the 2018 figures “encouraging results unparalleled among American cities.”"
81,"New York City was once plagued by a huge number of traffic fatalities, which reached a peak of 1,360 deaths in 1929, even though there were far fewer cars than there are today. As recently as 1990, there were 701 traffic deaths, making the current lower figures even more notable."
82,"The city’s Vision Zero program faced a major hurdle last summer when state lawmakers failed to reauthorize speed cameras posted at 140 school zones — a policy the city said reduced speeding during school hours by as much as 63 percent. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson, intervened to keep the cameras on."
83,"Mr. Johnson recently won the “Vision Zero Hero of the Year” award from Streetsblog, a website that reports on street safety, besting Mr. de Blasio for the top honor. The website praised Mr. Johnson for his support of speed cameras and congestion pricing, a proposal to collect tolls from cars entering Manhattan that Mr. de Blasio has resisted."
84,"Mr. Conner, of Transportation Alternatives, said Mr. Johnson had become a strong advocate for prioritizing street safety above cars — a leadership role that Mr. de Blasio had failed to achieve."
85,"“The mayor is still tied up in somewhat of a windshield perspective,” Mr. Conner said in reference to Mr. de Blasio’s reliance on cars to travel across the city."
86,"Mr. de Blasio dismissed the criticism that Mr. Johnson had taken the lead on Vision Zero, calling the safety program one of the “central missions” of his administration."
87,"“There’s plenty of credit to be shared,” Mr. de Blasio said."

89,"Like the L train repairs, it is a necessary but deeply unpopular project to rebuild a vital link in New York City’s transportation network."
90,"It would upend lives, worsen congestion and temporarily close for years a cherished landmark — the Brooklyn Heights Promenade — that is known the world over for its sweeping views of the Manhattan skyline."
91,"Now the project’s critics are taking a cue from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who called off the L train shutdown after assembling outside experts to come up with an alternative. Residents of Brooklyn Heights, one of the city’s most historic and affluent neighborhoods, are leveraging their skills, connections and considerable resources to find a less painful way to fix a crumbling stretch of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway that runs past their homes and serves as the base of the promenade."
92,"The Brooklyn Heights Association, a leading neighborhood voice, has gone beyond simply attacking the city’s plans for the B.Q.E. to actually developing its own. The alternative plan is still largely an untested concept and would require extensive vetting, though the association did hire a consulting firm to do an initial review."
93,"Even the association says its plan is not meant to be the only solution, but is intended to expand public discussion and challenge city officials to think more creatively about repairing a six-lane highway that carries 153,000 vehicles daily."
94,"“It’s great to oppose something, but it’s always better to have something else to propose,” said Martha Bakos Dietz, a retired lawyer who is the association president."
95,"Citing the averted L train shutdown, the association recently sent a letter to city transportation officials calling for a panel of outside experts to rethink the B.Q.E. project. “The parallels seem clear: Each project poses huge engineering challenges, and in each case the government’s initial approach would impose unthinkably devastating consequences,” Ms. Dietz wrote."
96,"The alternative is a rebuttal to two plans put forward by the city last fall to rebuild the B.Q.E. and the promenade that sits on top of it. They are physically joined together in a triple-cantilever structure that resembles a giant concrete wedding cake. Three lanes of traffic run on each of the two lower levels. The 1,825-foot walkway is the icing on top."
97,"The first plan would replace the promenade with a temporary, elevated six-lane highway where traffic could be redirected from the lower levels while the triple cantilever is rebuilt. The second plan would take a piecemeal approach, closing some vehicle lanes and the promenade at any given time and rerouting traffic around construction."
98,"Both plans have drawn fierce opposition from Brooklyn residents, especially the first one, which they say would bring a “promenade highway” with cars, trucks, and exhaust fumes right to their doors. These critics also say city officials have been so focused on rebuilding an outdated expressway — the triple cantilever section opened in 1954 — that they have failed to envision the possibility of anything different."
99,"“The shame or tragedy of where we find ourselves is: Their mind-set is to rebuild what was opened in 1954 and yet we all know that going forward, transportation needs are going to be vastly different,” said Richard F. Ziegler, a lawyer who has been helping lead the association’s efforts. “They are being backward-looking instead of forward-looking.”"
100,"The association’s plan calls for building a temporary, two-tiered roadway alongside stretches of the B.Q.E. in a “parallel bypass method.” One stretch would run beside the promenade — instead of on top of it — on land that includes a parking lot and part of some berms on the eastern edge of Brooklyn Bridge Park."
101,"That would allow the promenade to remain open during much of the construction, move vehicles on the B.Q.E. farther away from homes with the walkway serving as a buffer and reduce traffic backups, according to the plan’s supporters."
102,"Hundreds of people, including Scott M. Stringer, the city’s comptroller, and Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, recently rallied on the promenade against the city’s plans and called for a more transparent public process. An online petition urging the city to go back to the drawing board has been signed by more than 62,000 people."
103,"The group behind the petition, A Better Way N.Y.C., has grown to more than 750 volunteers and raised tens of thousands of dollars in donations to fund its campaign, which has included hiring lobbying and public relations firms as well as the Regional Plan Association, a transportation research and policy group, to analyze B.Q.E. traffic. “We want to be part of finding an innovative solution that leaves the city better off,” said Hilary Jager, a former assistant United States attorney who is part of the group."
104,"The Brooklyn Heights Association plan was developed by Marc Wouters, an urban planner and architect who lives in the neighborhood."
105,"Mr. Wouters did not provide a cost estimate, but said he expected it to be cheaper than the city’s plans, which are estimated to cost $3.2 billion to $4 billion."
106,"Polly Trottenberg, the city transportation commissioner, said her agency was analyzing the association’s plan as it also continues to explore other options for rebuilding the B.Q.E. “We’re working through the technical details, but we appreciate them putting it forward,” she said."
107,"Ms. Trottenberg said she expects to end up with four to six options, which will be weighed in public discussions as part of a thorough review process that will last about two years. “We certainly acknowledge that the two we led with were extremely controversial,” she said."
108,"In the spirit of the L train, Ms. Trottenberg added, “we too want to bring in a broader set of experts to look at this issue” and are open to “all kinds of new thinkers and voices.”"
109,"All three plans for the B.Q.E. would require state legislative approval for land use. The association’s plan, which could affect the berms in Brooklyn Bridge Park, would probably require additional state approvals. The berms shield the park from noise from the expressway and also anchor its landscape."
110,"“We have questions and concerns about this proposal, but are involved in the discussion,” said Eric Landau, the president of the Brooklyn Bridge Park Corporation, which operates the park."
111,"The other day, people strolling on the promenade said they supported any plan that would keep it open. “It’s New York City,” said Shaji Mathew, 56, as he took in the views. “You can see the water, the helipads and the high-rise buildings.”"
112,"Montserrat Vargas, an artist in Brooklyn Heights, said it was empowering for residents to be involved in what happens to the B.Q.E. and the promenade. “We as citizens can make things happen and can make change,” she said."
113,"This is not the neighborhood’s first battle over the B.Q.E. The association, which dates to 1910, once helped to thwart the city planner Robert Moses’s effort in the 1940s to run the expressway through the heart of Brooklyn Heights."
114,"Mr. Moses did not give up. He countered with a plan to build an elevated, six-lane expressway along the edge of Brooklyn Heights — similar to the city’s plan — noted Peter Bray, the association’s executive director. Residents again fought back. Mr. Moses eventually settled for a two-tiered highway that was covered over by the promenade to help contain the noise and pollution."
115,"Now, all these years later, residents are again fighting that six-lane highway that Mr. Moses envisioned."
116,"“His ghost is back,” Ms. Dietz said."

118,"Re “Pedestrians Still in Danger, Despite Drop in Traffic Deaths” (news article, Jan. 2):"
119,Pedestrians are a danger to themselves. Jaywalkers appear out of nowhere when they dart into the street between cars and trucks. Many will cross against the light if they see no immediate approaching vehicle — or if they just happen to be in a hurry.
120,"Intersections with left-turn signals render many pedestrians clueless that vehicles have the right of way (hint: that’s why the “walk” icon is not lit up). The worst offenders are those who cross streets looking at their phones, including mothers pushing strollers. Just as we’re taught to drive defensively, it is equally important to walk defensively. "
121,And let’s not forget the bicycle couriers who move in a state of anarchy unto themselves.

123,The opioid crisis in the United States has become so grim that Americans are now likelier to die of an overdose than in a vehicle crash.
124,"That’s according to a new report by the National Safety Council that analyzed the causes of preventable deaths in the country in 2017. The probability of dying from an opioid overdose, according to the report, is one in 96. The chances of dying in a vehicle crash? One in 103."
125,"Most Americans are still most likely to die of natural causes, chiefly heart disease (a one in six chance) or cancer (one in seven). But the report shows, in stark numbers, that everyday events — such as falling down — might be effectively more dangerous than rare ones, such as getting hit by lightning."
126,"“Human beings, we just are not good at estimating our own risk,” said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council, who oversaw the report. “We tend to fixate or focus on the rare, startling event, like a plane crash or a major flood or a natural disaster, but in reality, when you look at the numbers, the everyday risks that we face and have become so accustomed to form a much greater hazard.”"
127,"Medicine has improved our ability to combat fatal illnesses. But while deaths from natural causes have gone down, deaths from preventable causes have ticked up, and the result is that Americans’ life expectancy has actually decreased over the past few years, Mr. Kolosh said."
128,"Here’s a look at the trends, and the top 10 causes of preventable deaths."
129,The total number of deaths from opioid overdoses first surpassed the total number of deaths from vehicle crashes years ago. But the report found that 2017 was the first year in which accidental opioid deaths exceeded the number of accidental vehicle crashes. (Intentional overdoses or vehicle crashes were counted as suicides.)
130,"“Something that was a nonissue 30 years ago now looms as this incredible monster of an issue,” Mr. Kolosh said. "
131,"Overdoses of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, have been driving the increase, according to data on opioid deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
132,"Car crashes continue to be a leading cause of preventable death, with pedestrians accounting for a bigger proportion of the fatalities, especially in urban areas. While Mr. Kolosh said the reasons behind the increase have not been thoroughly studied, distracted driving is widely considered to be a factor. "
133,"When it comes to deadly car crashes, the report made a notable finding: About half of the people who died in the crashes studied were not wearing seatbelts."
134,The probability of dying in a fall increased to one in 114. Mr. Kolosh attributed the uptick to the fact that more older adults are reporting falls. Some of them at first might not seem particularly serious.
135,"“They’re slipping or tripping in their bathrooms, or in their kitchens,” Mr. Kolosh said. But researchers are finding that even some of these minor falls may lead to hospitalization and a chain of events that may then result in death."
136,"Among the ways to prevent falls, according to the CDC: Exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and balance."
137,Heart disease: one in six
138,Cancer: one in seven
139,Lower respiratory disease: one in 27
140,Suicide: one in 88
141,Opioid overdose: one in 96

148,"The power of great cooking to serve as a reminder of lost family members is the subject of “Ramen Shop,” a drama from the Singaporean director Eric Khoo that also demonstrates the power of Instagrammable cuisine to spice up an otherwise straightforward, sentimental film."
149,"The movie begins with a search for family — and the recipe for a fondly remembered bak kut teh, a pork rib soup. Masato (Takumi Saitoh), born to a Singaporean mother and a Japanese father, departs Japan after the death of his emotionally distant dad, a celebrated ramen chef in Takasaki. His father strived to create new flavors that blended cultures; he is said to have kept his deceased wife’s memory alive in every bowl. To preserve that tradition, Masato seeks out a long-unseen uncle (Mark Lee) — and his recipe for the Proustian pork rib broth — in Singapore."
150,"A food blogger (Seiko Matsuda) aids him in that search, which means that otherwise pedestrian conversational scenes are enlivened with shots of dishes like fish head curry and digressions on how Pandan leaves are used in Southeast Asian cooking to add flavor and color. The anticipated bak kut teh recipe may tempt viewers to take notes."
151,"“Ramen Shop” is not all as sweet or insubstantial as that summary suggests. It also deals, heavy-handedly, with the legacy of Japan’s occupation of Singapore during World War II — a past that weighs on Masato’s family history. But this gentle film doesn’t linger on horrors too long. It demands only your appetite."
152,Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.
153,"On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night, the authorities said."
154,"While the car was in autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver’s seat."
155,"The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter dated Monday that there was “no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation.”"
156,"But it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night given the vehicle’s speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.”"
157,The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office said an investigation into the case was continuing.
158,"In June, the Tempe Police Department released a report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show “The Voice” on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash, The Arizona Republic reported."
159,"Uber declined to comment Tuesday, as did the Tempe police. The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decision."
160,"The March 2018 crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from self-driving technology, and many wondered how prosecutors would approach a criminal investigation."
161,The crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it. Few such federal or state rules exist.
162,"“It’s not very well trod at all,” said Frank Douma, a research scholar at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies. “To my knowledge, there is not any sort of real bright-line statement about who’s liable when.”"
163,"Mr. Douma said prosecutors’ announcement Tuesday tracked with how typically people, and not car manufacturers, are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel. But, as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated, he said, such cases raise questions about that way of thinking."
164,"“Is this driver, or was this driver, behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving?” he said. “It’s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making.”"
165,"The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did its review at the request of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, which had a potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with Uber in a safety campaign. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday."
166,The New York Times reported last March that Uber’s autonomous cars in Arizona struggled to meet the company’s expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the company’s competitors.
167,"Uber suspended testing of self-driving vehicles after the crash. In December, the vehicles returned to public roads, though at reduced speeds and in less-challenging environments."
168,"In a preliminary report about the crash released in May, the National Transportation Safety Board said the Uber car’s computer system had spotted Ms. Herzberg six seconds before impact, but classified Ms. Herzberg, who was not in a crosswalk, first as an unrecognized object, then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycle."
169,"The Uber car, equipped with Uber’s sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer."
170,"But Uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,” according to the report, putting the onus on the safety driver to intervene."
171,The agency said Uber’s safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact.
172,"The Republic reported last March that family members of Ms. Herzberg had “resolved” a case against Uber. The Republic said that the family was represented by the law firm Bellah Perez, which said Tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the case."
173,"BERLIN — Targeting foreigners, a man repeatedly drove his car at pedestrians celebrating New Year’s Eve in western Germany, injuring four people before being arrested, the police and prosecutors said Tuesday."
174,"The suspect made comments disparaging of foreigners when the police detained and questioned him, Herbert Reul, interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the attacks took place, told reporters on Tuesday."
175,"“This is a case of a German deliberately driving into groups of people, people who for the most part were foreigners,” Mr. Reul said. “That means this man clearly intended to kill foreigners.”"
176,"At least three adults and one child, among them a Syrian and an Afghan, were struck and severely injured, officials said."
177,"The 50-year-old suspect, whose name was not released, had a history of psychiatric illness but no previous police record or known affiliation with far-right extremist groups, said Friederike Zurhausen, the police chief for the area where the first attacks took place."
178,"At 11:40 p.m., the attacker appeared to target a pedestrian on a main artery in Bottrop, a city in the culturally diverse, industrial Ruhr region, the authorities said. People in the street were able to flee and no one was injured."
179,"He then drove his silver Mercedes toward the city’s main square, where people were lighting fireworks to celebrate the New Year. There, he struck the four victims, including a woman who remains in life-threatening condition, Mr. Reul said."
180,"The man then fled to Essen, a larger city nearby, where he tried to steer into a group of people waiting at a bus stop, officials said. They noticed his erratic driving and were able to flee and alerted the police, who apprehended the suspect shortly afterward."
181,"Tensions between Germans and foreigners have increased in Germany since the arrival of more than 1 million people in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and seeking asylum in Europe’s largest economy."
182,"Although the country has successfully absorbed a majority of new arrivals, a series of violent incidents has highlighted the frictions and fueled mistrust on both sides."
183,"As 2016 began, men described as North African or Arabic in appearance assaulted hundreds of women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Near the end of that year, a truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market killed 12 people and injured 48."
184,"At the same time, the number of attacks on immigrants by far-right extremists has increased, fueled in part by a rise in anti-foreigner rhetoric by the Alternative for Germany party, the country’s strongest opposition force."
185,"The newly appointed chief of domestic security, Thomas Haldenwang, said last month he would double the number of agents focused on fighting the far-right extremists."
186,"Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said."
187,"A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said."
188,"The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”"
189,"A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said."
190,The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.
191,"“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”"
192,"“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”"
193,"Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years."
194,"Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49."
195,"HONG KONG — At least one person was killed and another was injured in a series of explosions Friday afternoon in the northeastern Chinese city of Changchun, the local authorities said."
196,"The police are tentatively treating the explosions as “a criminal case,” the propaganda office of the Changchun Municipal Communist Party Committee said in a statement posted online. The blasts began when a car burst into flames in an underground parking lot, followed by explosions from an apartment building at the Wanda Shopping Plaza, according to the statement."
197,2019-01-25【突发】16时左右长春万达广场写字楼发生连环爆炸，总计炸20余次，据传目前已有一人被炸身亡，并有多人受伤。 pic.twitter.com/VZcsPfJFAo
198,"The explosions sent pedestrians running from the shopping center. Cellphone videos posted on social media showed a series of blasts, some high in the apartment tower and others near the ground level of the building."
199,"Beijing Youth Daily, a state-owned newspaper, reported that some residents said they saw explosives being thrown from the building, but a local official would not confirm those accounts."
200,"In one video posted to social media, more than 15 blasts can be heard, and at least one was proceeded by an object falling through the air. Some explosions produced loud booms, while others were more modest, like fireworks."
201,"In July, a man set off an explosion outside the United States Embassy in Beijing, badly injuring his hand. The police said he suffered from hallucinations and had been diagnosed with a paranoid personality disorder. A lighter, firecracker fragments and three unexploded firecrackers were found at the scene."
202,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — A car bomb exploded on Thursday near a hotel and restaurant in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 15 people, rescue services said, in a strike on a busy area that has been targeted by Islamist militants in the past."
203,"The explosion sent a huge cloud of smoke into the sky and destroyed two restaurants and cars parked in the area, officials said."
204,"“So far, 15 people died, including five women. Seventeen others were injured in the blast,” Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Amin Ambulance service, told Reuters. Another witness at the scene said she had seen 18 bodies."
205,"The Islamist group the Shabab claimed responsibility for the bombing through its Radio al-Andalus website. The group, which is linked to Al Qaeda, previously targeted the same location, the Wehliye Hotel, which is along Maka al-Mukaram Road."
206,"A police spokesman, Maj. Mohamed Hussein, told The Associated Press that the explosives-laden vehicle had detonated outside the restaurant."
207,"“The blast destroyed a restaurant and killed many who were inside and outside the restaurant,” the same police captain told Reuters. “The death toll may rise.”"
208,"He said dozens of others had been injured in the blast, and that most of the casualties had been among diners at the crowded restaurant."
209,"A Mogadishu resident, Aamina Ali, said she went the scene of the attack to help the victims and that she had seen many bodies and blood everywhere."
210,"“This is unacceptable,” she said. “We are mothers; we lost beautiful souls.”"
211,The Shabab are fighting to topple the Western-backed government protected by African Union forces. The group was ejected from Mogadishu in 2011 and has since been driven from most of its other strongholds.
212,"On Saturday, Shabab gunmen stormed a government building in Mogadishu after a suicide car bombing, and the ensuing gunfight and blast killed at least 15 people, including the country’s deputy labor minister, the police said, Reuters reported."
213,"On Tuesday, a bomb planted in a private luxury car exploded in Mogadishu’s Hodan District, killing the driver and injuring a nearby pedestrian, Col. Ahmed Abdi, a police official, told The A.P."
214,"The United States military has increased the number of deadly airstrikes against the militants since Donald J. Trump took office as president. A number of multinational troops, including African Union force, Somali forces and Kenyan soldiers, are also fighting the Shabab."

216,"When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo abruptly called off the L train shutdown, he upended years of careful planning to ensure that 275,000 displaced riders were not left stranded in an L-pocalypse."
217,"Now, even as officials forge ahead with a widely debated alternate plan, many transit advocates are calling for those contingency measures — more bus and ferry service, new bike lanes, traffic restrictions — to be put in place even with no shutdown. The planned changes, they say, are still needed in a growing city facing critical transportation challenges from congestion to a broken subway system."
218,"Why turn back, they say, when so much of the groundwork is done. Bike routes have been expanded. Bus lanes have been painted, and the skeletons of bus fare machines have been installed on sidewalks. New bus and ferry services have been announced."
219,"“What we have in front of us is a city that has to expand our transportation system,” said Ydanis Rodriguez, the chairman of the City Council’s transportation committee. “We have an opportunity to become the most pedestrian- and cyclist-friendly city in the whole nation.”"
220,"But critics counter that some of the changes would turn their neighborhoods into testing grounds for transit experiments that focus largely on moving commuters, and that the plans should be re-evaluated and weighed against the safety, health and quality of life of residents."
221,"Across the country, cities are grappling with similar issues as they try to reimagine their aging and increasingly inefficient transportation networks for modern needs. Many cities have overhauled subways and buses to attract more riders, and redesigned streets to make more room for cyclists, pedestrians and green spaces. They have embraced a host of initiatives to raise money for public transportation and reduce congestion and pollution."
222,"San Francisco has transit-only lanes on 30 miles of streets and plans to add 20 more miles in the next decade. It has even highlighted some busy lanes with red paint to make them more visible to drivers, resulting in fewer cars blocking the lanes, transit officials said."
223,"Portland, Ore., is spending millions to promote walking and cycling in its downtown area, and working to make bus service faster and more reliable. It has also offered incentives to commuters to take alternative transportation, including a program that gives free transit passes to those who turn in their city-issued parking permits."
224,"“Major cities across the country face the same challenges, and they are likely to only get worse unless we take action now,” Chloe Eudaly, Portland’s transportation commissioner, said. “Investment in our active transportation infrastructure and increasing ridership on public transit is critical to preserving and maintaining the livability of our city and our planet.”"
225,"In New York, there are more alternatives than ever for subway riders who tire of delays and overcrowding. Ferry routes will serve all five boroughs next year. New bus lanes are being installed at an average of seven miles a year, for a total of 111 miles so far, with city officials planning to pick up the pace. The city’s network of bike lanes has grown to 1,240 miles, including 300 miles of bike lanes added to streets since 2014 alone."
226,"But the 15-month shutdown of the L train had been the catalyst for faster and more sweeping changes. It spurred the installation of more Manhattan crosstown bike lanes — cyclists complain that there are not enough — on 12th and 13th Streets, and a bike lane on Delancey Street to keep cyclists moving on and off the Williamsburg Bridge, the city’s busiest bicycle bridge crossing with 7,300 trips per day."
227,"The city’s first “busway,” or bus-only corridor, was designed to restrict car and truck traffic on 14th Street. Officials also planned to impose high-occupancy-vehicle requirements on the Williamsburg Bridge: Private vehicles with fewer than three passengers — including taxis and ride-hailing cars — would be barred from using the bridge between 5 a.m. and 10 p.m. to make room for a fleet of new temporary buses carrying displaced L riders."
228,"Under the alternate plan backed by Mr. Cuomo, weekday L train service — including during morning and evening rush hours — will remain unchanged, and repairs will be carried out at night and on weekends, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority."
229,"The agency plans to increase bus and subway service — including on the G, M and 7 lines — to accommodate L riders affected by the construction, but has not yet released specific details. Shams Tarek, an M.T.A. spokesman, said no final decisions had been made on other specific plans or services in the previous shutdown plan."
230,An M.T.A. draft memo obtained recently by Streetsblog NYC suggested that there would no longer be a need for the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge and the new ferry service. Mr. Tarek said the memo was outdated and that options were still being studied.
231,"Veronique Hakim, the M.T.A.’s managing director, said the agency was seeking public input and working with city officials to come up with a new plan “serving the needs of our customers while being sensitive to local communities.” The plan would be constantly monitored and adjusted as needed, she added."
232,"“New Yorkers can be certain that the alternate service plan for the new and improved L project will include additional transportation options designed to accommodate every affected L customer,” she said."
233,"[Can you name an M.T.A. board member? No, really. Name one.]"
234,"Still, Joseph P. Schwieterman, a professor of public service at DePaul University, said that without the pressure of a looming shutdown, “there is now a risk that momentum will be lost,” adding that “planning for bus lanes, better ferries and more bike options is hard enough without sudden shifts in policy.”"
235,City officials would not answer questions about whether specific contingency measures would go forward or the costs incurred in planning for the shutdown.
236,"Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a recent news conference that the city was evaluating the new L train plan to decide “if there’s anything that we were planning that is no longer needed because of the L train, but that we might want to do anyway.”"
237,"The mayor has made improving bus service a priority, and many transit advocates said he could start by keeping the new bus lanes that are already on the ground."
238,"“It would be lame to peel a bus lane off after pledging in his state of the city to get bus riders moving,” Jon Orcutt, a former city transportation official, said. “These are standing city policies and — L train shutdown or no L train shutdown — they should continue to be city policies and programs.”"
239,"Even without a shutdown, commuters will need backup options during “the great L train slowdown” on nights and weekends, said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders. He added, “We can’t just go back to the norm and pretend nothing’s happening.”"
240,"The uncertainty about the alternate plan has also raised concerns among New Yorkers. On the Lower East Side, residents had braced for more gridlock and air pollution from the temporary buses over the Williamsburg Bridge. Now they do not know what to expect. Susan Stetzer, the manager of a local community board, said she remained concerned “about all the unknowns.”"
241,"The 14th Street Coalition, which represents more than two dozen residential buildings, block associations and businesses in the West Village, Chelsea and Flatiron neighborhoods, has called for officials to abandon the plans for a busway and wider pedestrian areas on 14th Street — which in some places would narrow the street to two lanes from four lanes — and restrictions that would divert car and truck traffic to nearby streets. Some residents also want the crosstown bike lanes on 12th and 13th Streets removed."
242,"Judy Pesin, 66, a member of the coalition, said the 14th Street changes would restrict deliveries to homes and businesses, slow down emergency vehicles, and make it harder for older people, parents with young children and those with disabilities to access cars."
243,"“Clearly the change in plans means it’s time to listen to the community,’’ she said, “because the commuters are still going to have a moving L train.”"
244,"Tod Papageorge was relatively new to Manhattan and photography when he set out in the mid-1960s to make his mark. While street photographers with black-and-white film darted around pedestrians and traffic, he was attracted to storefronts with their harmonized symmetry and varying shades of gold between jelly jars and cider jugs. Traditionally, black and white was the choice of street photography, and color was for commercial work. His contemporaries, Joel Meyerowitz and Garry Winogrand, urged him to use color."
245,"“They said ‘Look, just put color film in your camera, put together a carousel tray of Kodachrome slides, and you’ll get work, and things will improve and you’ll be able to move,’” Mr. Papageorge, 78, recalled. “I was slowly convinced, but I started doing it.”"
246,"Often using slower shutter-speeds and waiting an extra beat or two for passers-by to settle in their strides, he composed clean-lined scenes loaded with symbolism and playfulness. In one shot, for example, the covers of F.B.I.-esque bystanders who seem to be watching for Vietnam War protesters are blown by the pointing finger of a bank advertisement."
247,"The flower power protests and Everyman marches weren’t out of place on New York’s streets at this time. And even though “there’s no literal mention of the war,” Mr. Papageorge recounted how nightly reports of the casualties in Vietnam lent a macabre context to a scene of a young woman wearing a crown of yellow chrysanthemums, as well as the still life in a grocery store window, filled with boxes of avocados and cherries above an electronic sign reading “FRESH KILLED TUR.”"
248,"Mr. Papageorge’s color photos from this period have never been published and only recently were compiled in the book, “Dr. Blankman’s New York,” put out by Steidl. They never landed him studio gigs. He did, however, make his mark at another studio — Studio 54 — where he photographed disco decadence. He has also won two Guggenheim Fellowships and was the longtime director of the graduate photography program at Yale."
249,"“I never showed them to a single art director,” he said of the Kodachromes. “In fact, I never really remember showing them to Garry, Joel or anyone else.”"

251,"LONDON — Three suspicious packages that appeared to contain homemade bombs capable of igniting a small fire were found Tuesday in and around transport hubs in London, the authorities said."
252,The three packages were described as similar: all midsize white envelopes with padded manila envelopes inside.
253,"The London Metropolitan Police said that a counterterrorism unit had been called in, and was treating the incidents as linked, but that it was “keeping an open mind regarding motives.”"
254,"No one was injured, but the police issued warnings for people to be vigilant around city transportation hubs."
255,"“These devices, at this early stage of the investigation, appear capable of igniting an initially small fire when opened,” a police statement read."
256,"Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said in a statement that he had been briefed on the incidents."
257,"“While transport services continue to operate as normal,” he said, “I urge all Londoners and visitors to our city to remain vigilant, and report any potential suspicious packages to the police.”"
258,"Just before 10 a.m., the police received a report of a suspicious package at the Compass Centre, an office building on the grounds of Heathrow Airport."
259,"Employees at the building opened the package, “causing the device to initiate,” and part of the envelope to burn, the police said."
260,"The building was evacuated and remains closed, but flights at Heathrow were not affected. The office building is outside the airport’s security perimeter."
261,"Less than two hours later, at approximately 11:40 a.m., the British Transport Police were called to investigate another suspicious package, this one in the mail room at Waterloo Station, a bustling rail terminal in central London."
262,"That package was not opened, and officers rendered the device safe. The station was not evacuated and train services continued to operate normally."
263,"Then, at 12:10 p.m., the police were called to a report of a suspicious package at the offices at City Aviation House, which is on the property of London City Airport. That package, too, was not opened, the building was temporarily evacuated."
264,Flights to and from that airport were not affected.
265,The authorities issued advisories to transport hubs across London to “be vigilant for and report suspicious packages to police.”
266,"The Irish police are also involved in the investigation into the incident. According to British and Irish news reports, at least one of the packages had an Irish stamp on it."
267,"A spokeswoman for An Garda Siochana, Ireland’s national police service, said it was assisting the Metropolitan Police but would not elaborate further."
268,"While the motive behind the transit center packages is still unknown, London has been target of terrorism many times over the last 15 years."
269,"On July 7, 2005, suicide bombers killed 52 subway and bus travelers in London. In 2017, there were various deadly attacks on pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, on London Bridge and near the Finsbury Park Mosque. And a bomb that partially exploded on a commuter train that year burned 23 people."
270,"Late last year, a parliamentary report detailed a “litany of errors” by the authorities surrounding those incidents."
271,"ISTANBUL — An eight-story apartment building collapsed in eastern Istanbul on Wednesday afternoon, killing at least three people, officials said."
272,"The governor of Istanbul, Ali Yerlikaya, initially said that two people had died and that six had been rescued, the Demiroren News Agency reported. On Thursday, officials announced that crews had rescued a total of 13 people, including a 5-year-old girl, and recovery efforts were still underway."
273,"There were 14 apartments in the building in the working-class district of Kartal, with a total of about 30 residents, Zeki Dag, an administrator in the Orhantepe neighborhood, told CNNTurk. Mr. Dag said relatives had told him that 15 people had been buried in the collapse, which happened at 4:42 p.m. local time."
274,"There was no indication of what caused the collapse. More than 50 emergency workers were sent to the scene, and the governor said the search for people in the rubble would continue into the night."
275,"Mr. Yerlikaya said he could not confirm the number of people thought to be caught under the debris. “There are various numbers,” he said in televised remarks, adding that he wanted confirmation before announcing anything. “The incident is very fresh right now, and there is only one thing we are focused on, which is saving lives,” he said."
276,"Security camera footage showed the building falling into a cloud of dust, as pedestrians fled in panic. Several cars were destroyed."
277,"The Istanbul prosecutor’s office has started an investigation into the cause of the collapse. Turkey has a history of low-quality construction, a factor that was blamed for the high death toll in the 1999 earthquake that struck near Izmit, about 55 miles southeast of Istanbul. More than 17,000 people were killed in the magnitude 7.4 earthquake, and tens of thousands of buildings were destroyed. In the aftermath, the government has pushed to modernize aging urban dwellings."
278,"Mr. Yerlikaya said that the building that collapsed on Wednesday had a permit for five stories when it was built in 1992, and that the top three floors were illegal. He said there was also an unlicensed textile workshop on the ground floor."
279,"A natural gas explosion and aging infrastructure were blamed for a building collapse last month in the Russian city of Magnitogorsk that killed 39 people. An explosion in Paris, also last month, that left three people dead was also blamed on a gas leak."

281,Scott Siegel plans to walk across a stage not far from Broadway on Monday night and introduce songs from musicals that lit up the nearby marquees — in 1928 and 1935.
282,"He will probably get some applause just for walking across the stage, one uneasy, uneven step after another, steadied by a cane, after a disastrous 2018, a year not celebrated in Monday’s show."
283,"Mr. Siegel is the impresario behind “Broadway by the Year,” a series at Town Hall that anthologizes Broadway shows by the year in which they had their premieres. It draws a nostalgic crowd, largely people like Mr. Siegel, a baby boomer uncomfortable about having his actual age published. But it also has some appeal among younger song-and-dance fans who want to hear Broadway tunes from before “Cats” or “A Chorus Line” that are rarely performed anymore."
284,"When he gets around to staging his show about 2018, his personal drama may eclipse “Mean Girls,” “King Kong” or “The Prom.”"
285,"Last October, he was riding a CitiBike to a rehearsal of a show to be staged later in St. Louis, a spinoff of another project. The rehearsal was in the West 50s in Manhattan. “Somebody’s apartment who has a piano,” he explained."
286,That meant pedaling across town from his apartment in the East 50s.
287,"“I was late and it had rained,” he said. “I was hurrying to get there.”"
288,"He knew the terrain: the descent on West 55th Street and the uphill section on 10th Avenue, where he planned to turn."
289,"“Anybody who’s ever ridden a bicycle knows that if you have to go up a steep hill, you want to get as much momentum behind you before you turn,” he said, “so I was going as fast as I could.”"
290,"Probably not as fast as the pack in the Tour de France, but fast enough that when he saw a pedestrian step off the curb, he had no more than a nanosecond to rethink the turn. He figured the options were to go wide, which would put him in front of the pedestrian, or short and sharp, which would leave him behind the man."
291,He chose short and sharp. It was the wrong call.
292,"“The bike hydroplaned out from under me,” he said, “and I slammed into 10th Avenue.”"
293,"To hear Mr. Siegel tell it, the unfolding drama was peopled by helpful extras, starting with a couple of bystanders. One asked, “Can you get up?”"
294,"He played the role of the indefatigable, ever-practical New Yorker. To one of them he said, “I’ll shake this off, give me a minute.”"
295,"To the other, he said: “Can you take the CitiBike that’s lying in the middle of the street and put it in the rack?” There was a dock less than a block away; he worried that CitiBike would assess a charge if the bicycle was not properly returned. (CitiBike waives late fees for riders involved in accidents, a spokeswoman said.)"
296,He still figured that he would be up and rehearsing again before long.
297,"After 19 days in three hospitals, a three-hour operation and four pins in his broken pelvis, he went home."
298,"So he missed the rehearsal, but the St. Louis show went on. “It was one of the rare times I was ahead of the game. It was cast, the songs were assigned, the script was pretty much written,” he said."
299,"He did miss a performance of another of his productions at Feinstein’s/54 Below two days after the accident. From his hospital bed, he wrote checks to pay the cast."
300,"Some of the performers tore them up. One of Mr. Siegel’s regulars, the pianist Ryan Shirar, started a GoFundMe campaign that has raised about $24,000 for Mr. Siegel’s bills, which included rent on a temporary apartment. His own place, in a building between First and Second Avenue, was off limits. “There are five steps down from the street to the lobby,” he said, “and I couldn’t take steps.”"
301,"He planned Monday’s show at Town Hall between physical therapy sessions. The “Broadway by the Year” series, which started in 2000, was a career change for Mr. Siegel, who with his wife had written more than 40 books, including “Jack Nicholson: The Unauthorized Biography,” “Richard Chamberlain: An Actor’s Life,” “The Encyclopedia of Hollywood” and “American Film Comedy.” They had also written as critics for a number of publications and websites; currently, they write “The Siegel Column” for theaterpizzazz.com."
302,"“Town Hall, even though it’s in the theater district, did not have any theater-centric programming,” he recalled. “They wanted a theater audience. I had the idea for ‘Broadway by the Year.’ I didn’t have the title but I had the idea. They said, ‘Would you produce it for us?’ I said, ‘Happy to do it, but I haven’t produced anything in my life, not even a puppet show in the backyard” when he was growing up in Fair Lawn, N.J."
303,"He started with 1943, “for the heavy anchor of ‘Oklahoma!’” — the Rodgers and Hammerstein hit — and got a taste of the performer’s life."
304,"“Five minutes before the first curtain, I peeked out from stage left and saw the audience was full,” he recalled, “and I started to quake, literally shaking. I said, ‘I can’t go out there. I have to find a way to calm down.’” He did so by telling himself the audience was not there to see him but the performers he had hired. He said he has not had a case of nerves since."
305,"Monday’s show will look at how music changed as Broadway went from the Roaring Twenties into the Great Depression. For 1928, he will highlight the shows that introduced “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love” and “Makin’ Whoopee;” an operetta called “The New Moon” because, he said, operettas were big on Broadway in the 1920s; and “Animal Crackers,” the Marx Brothers comedy that was later filmed."
306,"The other year on Monday’s bill, 1935, is remembered nowadays for Gershwin’s “Porgy and Bess.” But Mr. Siegel will also look at Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart’s “Jumbo” and Cole Porter’s “Jubilee,” among others."
307,"He will be driven to Town Hall for the performance. He longs to go biking again, but while pedaling on a stationary bicycle is part of his therapy routine, taking to the street is not."
308,"“My wife took my CitiBike key away,” he said."
309,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion, as the ride-hailing company prepares to go public, according to four people with knowledge of the matter."
310,"The talks are still underway and may not result in an investment, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apart from SoftBank, the investor consortium includes an automaker, they added."
311,"Under the terms of the proposed deal, investors would purchase from a pool of Uber stock specifically earmarked for the self-driving technologies unit. Uber would maintain majority control of the self-driving arm and would use the investment to fund its research and development. The deal would value the self-driving business at $5 billion to $10 billion, the people said."
312,"Uber filed confidentially to go public in December in what would be one of the largest tech initial public offerings of recent years. The company, based in San Francisco, could hit a valuation of $120 billion when it reaches the stock market."
313,But Uber is under scrutiny for its losses — its net loss was $842 million in the fourth quarter — and self-driving technologies are expensive. A $1 billion infusion could ease worries about how costly it is to develop autonomous cars.
314,The proposed investment was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
315,"Uber has for years invested heavily in self-driving cars, which it has said will eventually become a primary mode of transportation, replacing its human drivers. But its autonomous unit, formed in 2014, loses between $100 million and $200 million each quarter. Its fleet of vehicles was also grounded for nine months last year after one of the autonomous cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. In the past, Uber has considered spinning off the unit as a separate entity."
316,"Uber Freight, the company’s long-haul trucking business, also has a separate valuation based on pools of equity specifically earmarked for the unit. As part of an agreement with employees, the company rewarded them with equity in Uber Freight as a stand-alone business late last year."
317,"SoftBank is already a major investor in Uber after it acquired about 17.5 percent of the ride-hailing firm’s stock last year at a significant discount. In addition to Uber, SoftBank has poured money into ride-hailing companies such as Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia."
318,"SoftBank has also invested in businesses focused on autonomous vehicles. In mid-2018, the firm invested $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, a division of General Motors. Structuring Cruise as a separate entity made it possible for General Motors to isolate the losses from its autonomous division."
319,"In August, Toyota invested $500 million in Uber. The move was meant to let Uber put its self-driving technology in Toyota vehicles."
320,"“Toyota constantly reviews and considers various options for investment, but we do not have anything to announce about a further investment in Uber at this time,” a Toyota spokeswoman said on Wednesday."

348,"A 27-year-old Uber driver was fatally stabbed in the Bronx on Saturday night in a vivid reminder of the perils of the job, the police and driver groups said."
349,"The driver, Ganiou Gandonou, was found shortly after 9 p.m. seated inside a black Toyota Camry with stab wounds to his neck and torso, the police said. The police are looking for the attacker and investigating whether Mr. Gandonou’s death began as a robbery."
350,"On Sunday evening, the police released video of a “person of interest” wanted in the killing. The man fled the scene on foot and was last seen walking northbound on Co-op City Boulevard wearing dark clothing, the police said."
351,"The police did not say if the “person of interest” was a passenger. The driver was working at the time, but the police did not say whether he was completing a trip when he was stabbed."
352,"Mr. Gandonou drove for Uber and had received his for-hire vehicle license in January 2017, according to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission."
353,"He left home around 7 p.m. on Saturday to work a shift picking up passengers, but he never came home, his wife said in an interview with News 12. He had a 2-year-old son."
354,"“My husband doesn’t deserve this,” she said. “I don’t know how my life’s going to be without him.”"
355,"Driving a taxi or for-hire vehicle has long been a dangerous job. In the early 1990s, dozens of livery drivers were killed on the job in a single year and many more were assaulted or robbed."
356,"An Uber spokesman, Grant Klinzman, called Mr. Gandonou’s death “a horribly tragic incident,” adding, “our hearts go out to the grieving family.”"
357,"“We stand ready to work with law enforcement to assist their investigation in any way possible,” Mr. Klinzman said in a statement."
358,"On Sunday, a driver group offered a $3,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the killing."
359,"“We call on anyone who may have witnessed the attack to contact the police so that the culprit may be brought to justice,” the group, the Independent Drivers Guild, said in a statement."
360,"Violence and threats are part of being a professional driver, said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance."
361,"“Knowing how to protect yourself from crime is as critical to a driver as knowing the names of streets and avenues,” Ms. Desai said. “It’s a part of their day-to-day life behind the wheel.”"

367,"NEW YORK — Uber Technologies Inc expects it will be a long time before one of its biggest investments, self-driving cars, is ready for wide-scale deployment, a senior scientist said on Monday, as the ride-sharing firm gears up to go public. "
368,"Raquel Urtasun, who is chief scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and heads the group's unit in Toronto, spoke about the challenges for self-driving development at a Reuters Newsmaker https://www.reuters.com/newsmakers event in New York. "
369,"""Self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet,"" Urtasun said. ""To have it at scale is going to take a long time."""
370,"The more cautious tone marks a change from three years ago, when Uber embraced aggressive tactics to turbocharge its autonomous vehicle development in a bid to get more robot taxis on the street driving more miles. The company had been seen as an industry leader in the technology until one of its autonomous SUVs killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March last year."
371,"Urtasun's comments fall in line with the rest of the self-driving industry, which after much hype and bold promises has tempered expectations and pushed out timelines for deployment. The extreme technical challenges of building cars that can predict human behavior and respond appropriately proved greater than even some of the industry's brightest minds had anticipated."
372,"The progress of Uber's self-driving car unit is in the spotlight as the company prepares to kick off its initial public offering this year. Uber, whose losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion last year, has at times spent close to $200 million in a single quarter on its self-driving unit, sources told Reuters."
373,"Uber, last valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion in its IPO and may kick off its investor roadshow before the end of April, Reuters has reported."
374,"""It is true that when you go to an IPO, there is much more of a look into your finances,"" said Urtasun. ""That being said, again because Uber understands that self-driving cars at scale is not something that's going to happen tomorrow, they understand the need for the science."" "
375,"Urtasun declined to offer any guidance on what mix of human-driven cars and autonomous cars Uber will have in the next 10 years, citing too many uncertainties in the industry."
376,"""What is clear is that in a 10-year timeframe there will be a mix of both (self-driving and human-controlled cars),"" she said. "
377,UBER SEEKING PARTNERS
378,"The business of building self-driving cars is extraordinarily expensive and the timeframe to payoff is increasingly uncertain. However, some consider Uber's ability to successfully navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles as crucial to the company's long-term financial prospects. "
379,"By removing drivers and adding automation, Uber will be able to pocket the full fare that passengers pay and create more efficient routes to move around people and packages."
380,"Uber opened ATG in Toronto in 2017 and named Urtasun, who is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto, as head of the Toronto organization. Uber said last year it would invest more than $150 million in Toronto to grow its self-driving car operations, open an engineering hub and expand its work in artificial intelligence. "
381,"After the fatal Arizona crash, Uber removed its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its testing hub. Uber resumed very limited testing on public roads in Pittsburgh in December. "
382,"Uber has recently taken a more collaborative approach, inviting General Motor Co's self-driving car unit Cruise and Alphabet Inc's Waymo to put their cars on Uber's ride-hailing network. Urtasun said on Monday that Uber encouraged every self-driving company to add their cars to the Uber network. "

387,LONDON — Prince Philip was at the wheel?
388,"To the astonishment and alarm of some Britons, he was. At age 97. On a public road, alone. And, on Thursday afternoon, straight into the path of a minivan hurtling down a motorway with a 9-month-old boy inside."
389,The crash flipped the armor-plated Land Rover driven by Prince Philip. The minivan careened off the road.
390,"Prince Philip and the child were unhurt, though a minivan passenger broke her wrist and the driver suffered knee cuts. The prince told police officers he had been “dazzled by the sun,” a witness said."
391,"Still, some Britons were confused over why the prince, the wizened and gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh who is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was even driving."
392,"“You’d have to be a superhero for your mental acuity not to have slowed down,” said Inger Wallis, a Bloomsbury resident out walking her dog on Friday."
393,"She shook her head as she repeated his age, while acknowledging her “deep respect” for the supporting role he has played for so many decades beside Elizabeth. Ms. Wallis’s own father, she said, hung up the keys at 84, scared to drive."
394,"If nothing else, Britons could be thankful that, for one day at least, the agony of Britain’s tortured withdrawal from the European Union was not the leading topic of discussion."
395,"The crash, involving a famously headstrong and famously old royal, did provoke a lively discussion about whether Britain should stop older people from driving. The country will have a million drivers older than 85 by 2025, doubled from a few years ago. And those drivers are more vulnerable to crash injuries because of their frailty."
396,"That Prince Philip was unaccompanied in the Land Rover by his round-the-clock bodyguards or royal chauffeurs also drew attention to an inconvenient fact, for those who have ever tried to pry the keys from older relatives."
397,"Driving is a lifeline for some older people, especially in Britain, where smaller towns and rural areas have scant public transit. And older drivers are, by many measures, safer drivers, with people older than 70 half as likely as drivers 25 and younger to kill a pedestrian, the Older Drivers Task Force in Britain said in 2016."
398,"[When is it time to stop driving? For families everywhere, an all-too-familiar question.]"
399,"If the government is to take anyone’s keys, experts said, it should target young men."
400,"Arthur Currie, 70, a resident at the Royal Hospital Chelsea for veterans of the British Army, said his relatives sit more stiffly in the passenger seat when he gets behind the wheel. “Or they will say to me, ‘You see that car coming, Daddy?’” he said. But when they broach the topic of him giving up his keys altogether, Mr. Currie makes his view clear."
401,"“My first reaction is looking at them and giving them what they call a laser stare,” he said. “Being an ex-regimental sergeant major, I have perfected the laser stare.”"
402,"Mr. Currie said his only thought, upon hearing about the crash, was concern for Prince Philip and the others involved. As an honorary colonel of the Queen’s Royal Irish Hussars, where Mr. Currie was once a sergeant major, the prince made annual visits to the troops."
403,"“If he felt he was able enough to drive, who am I or who’s anybody else to say he shouldn’t be driving?” Mr. Currie said."
404,Not all Britons were so deferential.
405,"John Clegg, manning the register at the London Review Bookshop, wondered why the prince could not simply get his driving fix on the private roads of his vast royal estates."
406,"“What’s the point in going around in a Land Rover unless you’re going to go off road?” he asked. (Not the most pressing question, perhaps, regarding the solo driving by a 97-year-old royal.)"
407,Mr. Clegg said his grandmother finally persuaded his grandfather to stop driving after too many instances of having to shake him awake.
408,"“He never went off the road, but she could see when it could happen,” Mr. Clegg said."
409,"The prince is regarded a bit warily by the British public. He is known to be hardheaded and occasionally gruff, and to make racist and sexist comments, including ones about Chinese with “slitty” eyes and women who cannot cook."
410,"Ingrid Seward, a royals expert whose latest book is “My Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of the Royal Marriage,” suspected the prince would stubbornly resist the queen’s admonitions about his driving, but would see the logic and could be persuaded to give it up."
411,"“It is the lobotomy of his last vestige of independence,” Ms. Seward said."
412,"Like many others, Ms. Seward has her own experience trying, with some difficulty, to persuade a parent to relinquish the keys. At 86, her mother took a driving test in an attempt to defy Ms. Seward and prove she could still drive. She failed."
413,"Ms. Seward said Prince Philip may have been alone in the Land Rover because he was only driving from one side of his Sandringham Estate to another. A few years ago, the Obamas got into the car with Prince Philip on the same estate, and looked somewhat less than at ease."
414,"Prince Philip was known to prize fast sports cars, and the British news media quickly dug up  examples of his reckless driving, including one accident in 1996 in which he rear-ended a car at a pedestrian crossing, leaving the driver in a neck brace. As far back as the 1950s, a British tabloid questioned whether he should be trusted to drive the queen around."
415,"On Thursday afternoon, he was pulling off a private road and either onto or across a public motorway known for accidents, with its 60 mile-per-hour speed limit and scary bends. Local lawmakers, who coincidentally met on Friday to discuss the road’s safety, lowered the speed to 50 m.p.h."
416,"As the British tabloids chronicled in graphic cartoon mock-ups of the crash site, the prince’s car turned over, he was rescued through the sunroof, and had to submit to a breathalyzer test."
417,"Hugh Bladon, 77, a spokesman for the Alliance of British Drivers and a proud older driver, said another alliance member familiar with the road had told him he could understand how the sun may have blinded the prince."
418,"“Obviously, everyone’s going to jump on the age bandwagon,” he said. “But age actually is nothing to do with skill.”"
419,"British law requires drivers at age 70 to start self-reporting medical issues related to their fitness for the road every three years. The Older Drivers Task Force recommended the government raise the age to 75, but also start requiring an eyesight test, a more accurate barometer of any problems."
420,"Britain instituted driving tests only in 1935, but it is unclear if Prince Philip, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took one. The royal palace, though, confirmed on Friday that he had a license. The queen, on the other hand, as the person in whose name British licenses are issued, is the only Briton who can drive without one."
421,"British lawyers said there was a chance Prince Philip could be charged with driving without due care and attention, though he could also possibly avoid charges by voluntarily surrendering his license."
422,"There were hints on Friday, though, that the prince would not give up quite so easily. A replacement Land Rover was seen by British photographers being driven onto the grounds of his estate, under the watchful eye of the police."
423,A 9-year-old United States citizen was detained at a Southern California border checkpoint for more than 30 hours this week while the authorities said they worked to verify her identity.
424,"The girl, identified by NBC 7 San Diego as Julia Isabel Amparo Medina, had been making her daily commute from Tijuana, Mexico — where she and her 14-year-old brother, Oscar, live — to school in San Ysidro, Calif., on Monday, the news station said. Because traffic was moving slowly, Julia and Oscar opted to walk across the border rather than wait in the car and risk tardiness, according to NBC 7, which first reported the story."
425,"In an email on Friday, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman said two children arrived at one of the San Ysidro port of entry facilities for pedestrians at 10:15 a.m. on Monday. The children, whom the spokesman did not identify, presented a C.B.P. officer with United States passport cards, according to the spokesman, Ralph DeSio."
426,"[Read the latest edition of Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet. Sign up here to receive the next issue in your inbox.]"
427,"“The younger child provided inconsistent information during her inspection, and C.B.P. officers took the 9-year-old into custody to perform due diligence in confirming her identity and citizenship,” Mr. DeSio said."
428,"He did not elaborate on what information was inconsistent, saying only: “Some specifics of our techniques for determining the true identity of a person crossing the border are law enforcement sensitive information. In addition, some details of this case are restricted from release due to privacy concerns.”"
429,"A federal official with knowledge of the case who was not authorized to speak about it said the 9-year-old had provided inaccurate information to border agents, which prompted a series of protocols that agents were required to conduct. The need to go through that process and ensure that the girl was not a victim of human trafficking contributed to the length of her detainment, the official said."
430,"Eventually, border agents confirmed that the teenager was a United States citizen and he was permitted to enter the country, Mr. DeSio said. Then, around 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday, the 9-year-old girl was admitted to the United States and released to her mother after the authorities confirmed her identity and her citizenship, Mr. DeSio said."
431,"“C.B.P. prioritizes the safety of the minors we encounter,” he said. “It’s important that C.B.P. officials positively confirm the identity of a child traveling without a parent or legal guardian.”"
432,"The episode involving the children came as the agency is being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit last month on behalf of two American women who were stopped by a border agent who said he was asking for their identification because he had heard them speaking Spanish."
433,"The cases have highlighted concerns over the power of Customs and Border Protection, whose agents have come under increased scrutiny as the Trump administration has sought to keep immigrants from crossing the country’s southern border. Thousands of people travel through the Tijuana-San Ysidro crossing every day for school or work."
434,"Julia’s mother, Thelma Galaxia, told NBC 7 that while Julia was detained, agents accused her of lying about her identity, saying that her passport photo did not look like her. Julia told NBC 7 that the authorities accused her of being her cousin rather than herself, and said she was told that if she would admit that she had lied about her identity she would be released."
435,"“I was scared,” Julia told NBC 7. “I was sad because I didn’t have my mom or my brother. I was completely by myself.”"
436,The children also told the station that agents had accused Oscar of smuggling and other crimes.
437,"The federal official with knowledge of the case declined to comment on the specific allegations made by Ms. Galaxia and her children but said that, in general, a person who appears to be lying to Customs and Border Protection officers is subject to increased scrutiny."
438,Attempts to reach Ms. Galaxia on Friday were unsuccessful.
439,"In a statement, the Consulate General of Mexico in San Diego said that it “gave prompt assistance; in this regard, we supported the child’s mother within the framework of our consular protection programs, in observance to the protocols of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations.”"
440,"Soldiers from the Second Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Fourth Infantry Division, returned from a nine-month deployment to southern Afghanistan in November, only to deploy again three and a half months later. Now more than 100 troops from the unit are in the southern United States, tasked with securing the border with Mexico."
441,"The small contingent from Fort Carson, Colo., is part of the roughly 3,000 active-duty troops and 2,000 National Guard soldiers reinforcing portions of the wall along the southern border. The Pentagon has said little about the new troop surge that the Department of Homeland Security requested in January. A month later, President Trump declared a national emergency, prompting the Defense Department to transfer $1 billion in military personnel funding toward construction of a permanent wall."

443,"The engineers, support soldiers, military police and ad hoc infantry squads currently deployed are responsible for stringing up 167.4 miles of concertina wire “on top of the existing pedestrian wall barriers along strategic stretches along the U.S.-Mexico border between Arizona and California,” according to military documents obtained by The New York Times. Costing millions and disrupting planned training exercises for some units, the deployments have been decried by lawmakers and pundits as a political sideshow."
444,"After receiving its deployment order, certain units within the Fort Carson brigade had less than a week to deliver their first soldiers to Arizona by mid-February. The situation on the ground looks much like an overseas operation: long and tedious, and marked by near-constant logistics issues. Soldiers are being shuffled from one border station to the next. They’re contending with food reminiscent of an outpost in Afghanistan, broken-down vehicles and bouts of uncertainty around their mission. "
445,Below is a summary of a situation report that one of the units on the border sent to brigade headquarters in Colorado last month.
446,"As of the middle of March, the unit had completed work on more than 14 miles of wall. But some parts of it had already been breached, and a strange rivalry was brewing between the soldiers and a Marine unit working on an adjacent portion of the wall. “Welding capabilities of other units leave much to be desired,” the report says. A soldier “holds a picket that was tac welded just the day prior by the Marines that shared part of our sector; the welds were so poor that this fell off the next day,” one caption reads."
447,"Although the Fort Carson cohort has been deployed since February, the unit had yet to receive an assigned location to set up a permanent base when the report was written. The soldiers were still awaiting approval to leave the small makeshift post they had erected in the lot of a Customs and Border Protection station in Pine Valley, Calif. (where wind storms have blown down some tents), and move to a nearby station in the town of Boulevard. Because some of these units had not received orders to relocate, their mail — including care packages from home and from Amazon — was being held until they reached their next section of wall."
448,"Since the unit is away from large towns and almost entirely confined to its base, some of the brigade’s only hot meals are Meals, Ready to Eat, or MREs, and Unitized Group Rations-Express, or UGR-Es, a larger variant of the former that can serve 18 people from a preheated, prepackaged slab of food. As described in military documents, UGR-Es offer “an alternative to individual meals as the sole source of subsistence in austere, remote locations.”"
449,"The soldiers requested fresh fruit, milk and bread."
450,"As with most deployments, keeping vehicles in working order has been an issue. Out of the brigade’s current motor pool, two vehicles were repaired and six were being assessed for maintenance issues. Soldiers have had to scavenge items from nearby bases, which the report makes clear was “not a long-term solution.” Mechanics “have been able to conduct clever maintenance with what is on hand,” the documents say. On the border, trucks and Humvees are used to shuttle around troops and wire. Because of the wall’s height, the trucks are often used as welding platforms."
451,"The brigade’s mission should be complete in a matter of weeks, according to the documents, and the Pentagon currently has no plans to send any more troops to the border. "

453,They paved a parking lot and put up paradise.
454,"To shoot a scene on a vibrant avenue in the period drama “Roma,” the filmmakers constructed from scratch an immense replica of part of a Mexico City street (and the shops that line it) in an empty lot amid warehouses. They brought in period vehicles, including a streetcar, and built working storefronts, transforming a cracked concrete slab overrun with weeds into a vibrant intersection. "
455,That’s one way to recapture your childhood.
456,"“Roma,” up for 10 Academy Awards at the Feb. 24 ceremony, is the writer-director Alfonso Cuarón’s semi-autobiographical recollection of his early-1970s life in the Mexico City neighborhood of the title. To say that Cuarón cared about details when capturing that world  is an understatement. With a reported budget of $15 million, the film also includes an elaborate restaging of a student protest, the communal dousing of a large forest fire and a challenging ocean rescue."
457,"In the street scene, the nanny, Cleo (Yalitza Aparicio), chases after one of her charges on the way to the movies and comes upon the intersection of Baja California and Insurgentes avenues. Cuarón wanted to shoot at the actual crossing, but when he returned to the neighborhood all these years later, he saw it had changed significantly."
458,"For one, there’s a major bus stop in the middle of Insurgentes where streetcars once ran. For another, the movie theater that plays a key role in the film had been demolished, replaced by a shopping center. And many of the businesses were no longer the same."
459,"Cuarón explored the option of substituting a similar-looking street in a smaller city for Insurgentes. But while there were locations with more period buildings, none carried the same big-city heft."
460,"“It had a certain cosmopolitanism that I couldn’t find in any other place,” he said in a phone interview."
461,"And the idea of using computer-generated images to turn that shopping center back into a movie theater was not a popular one. The director said that his film needed a certain level of physicality that came from characters operating in real, not digitally constructed, environments. “Gravity,” this is not."
462,"“I didn’t want to just illustrate the location, I wanted it to permeate the whole essence of time and space,” Cuarón said."
463,"In other words, grab a hammer and a nail."
464,"Cuarón worked with his production designer, Eugenio Caballero, to research the look of the avenue in the early ’70s, viewing old photographs and matching them with the director’s memories. After they decided how much ground to cover in the shots, Caballero drew up a plan based on the actual measurements of the intersection. Then the goal was to find a space to match those requirements."
465,"The area they needed was larger than most studio backlots could provide, so they had to get creative. They considered the parking lot of Aztec Stadium, but it was too small."
466,"“The location crew stopped looking from the ground and instead started looking at satellite photographs of the city,” Cuarón said."
467,"They found a spot in a collection of warehouses used by the Secretariat of Public Education. It included a giant empty lot covered in cracked concrete overgrown with weeds. Caballero and his team transformed it by building rails and cables for a streetcar, and adding sidewalks and shops alongside them. "
468,"But Cuarón didn’t just want facades. He wanted to be able to enter and populate these spaces with extras. So a shop like a travel agency would serve to show the class divide in this part of the city as well. (It should be noted that in the finished film, computer imagery filled out the far end of the street and the building tops.)"
469,"As Cleo approaches the intersection, the screen fills with the energy of pedestrians and traffic, the evening city lights shimmer and the entire frame projects a tone of heightened wonder. Cuarón wanted to capture his recollections as a child crossing at this spot."
470,"“I had a very good sense of the feel of this,” he said, “the excitement I felt arriving at that big avenue on the way to the movies, coming from the more sheltered streets of my neighborhood.”"
471,"After the shoot, the entire set was demolished. Now, that warehouse parking has never looked nicer."

473,"ALBANY — The speed cameras that were installed around many New York City public schools several years ago seemed like an unqualified success: Traffic deaths near the cameras fell by more than half, and speeding was reduced by more than 60 percent."
474,"And yet, last summer, the cameras went dark, a casualty of partisan politicking in Albany and a potent reminder of the capital’s reputation for dysfunction."
475,"Now they are being revived, and then some: The newly Democratic-led State Legislature on Tuesday voted to renew and vastly expand the speed camera program, in a nearly fivefold increase that city officials say will cover every elementary, middle and high school in the city."
476,City officials said the authorization to place cameras in 750 school zones would make New York’s school speed camera program the most robust in the nation.
477,"“We are depoliticizing the issue of pedestrian safety,” said Senator Andrew Gounardes of Brooklyn, the bill’s sponsor in his chamber."
478,"Cameras have monitored dangerous driving in the city’s school zones since 2014, after the Legislature approved a pilot program to install cameras at 20 zones in every borough. The number has since expanded to 160."
479,"Since then, the city has reported a 63 percent reduction in speeding in those school zones, and a 17 percent reduction in traffic injuries. The average number of deaths each year in school zones with a camera fell from 18 to 8."
480,"But the program expired last summer, after the then Republican-led State Senate refused to renew it unless it was tied to other measures the Democratic Assembly opposed. Advocates and elected officials — who had been pushing to double the program — watched as the cameras effectively went dark in July."
481,"The subsequent outrage prompted Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to issue an executive order in August reactivating the cameras, bypassing the Legislature. The City Council also passed legislation that it said gave them authority to restart the cameras, even though lawyers have long said that state law technically requires approval from Albany."
482,"Now, the Legislature is joining that push. The expansion will be phased in over three years."
483,The location of each camera will be determined by the city’s Department of Transportation. City officials said they expected every school to be covered by the expansion. The bill also widens the radius of a school zone and allows the cameras to be active for longer hours each day.
484,"Currently, the cameras can operate from an hour before school until an hour after; under the new law, they could operate from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m."
485,The previous program covered only 7 percent of New York City schoolchildren.
486,"“As someone whose own family has suffered a loss to traffic violence, this is incredibly personal,” said Mr. Gounardes, a first-term Democratic legislator who unseated a Republican who had a well-documented record of speeding."
487,"Deborah Glick, a Manhattan assemblywoman who sponsored the bill in her chamber, called opposition to expansion “inexplicable” and “indefensible.”"
488,Mr. Cuomo said on Tuesday that he would sign the bill. A companion bill passed on Tuesday would also create a pilot program in Buffalo.
489,"Thirteen states currently have some form of speed camera program, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Some, like New York’s, are limited to certain localities, while others are statewide. Nationwide, 139 communities have adopted speed cameras."
490,"Between 2014 and 2017, New York City’s speed camera program brought in $83 million in net revenue. Proponents have always emphasized that the cameras were intended to improve public safety, not generate money."
491,"Polly Trottenberg, New York City’s transportation commissioner, said she believed the city’s pilot program had already made it a standout nationally for school traffic safety, and that the expansion would cement that status."
492,"“I don’t know of any state or jurisdiction that has a program as robust even as the one we have now,” she said. “We want to make this the gold standard.”"
493,"Other cities in New York could follow suit by petitioning the Legislature for approval for programs of their own. The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, said he would “absolutely” consider further expansion."
494,"The bill’s passage was bittersweet for advocates, many of whom arrived at the Capitol on Tuesday bearing photos of loved ones lost to traffic accidents. Ten-year-old Preston Liao, whose 3-year-old sister was killed by a driver, lent Mr. Gounardes his toy chain saw — what he called a “change saw.”"
495,"Amy Cohen, a co-founder of the group Families for Safe Streets, whose son died when he was hit by a van, called such incidents a “preventable epidemic.”"
496,"“I also want us to remember those for whom this change today is too late,” she said."
497,LONDON — Don’t pester the wombats.
498,"That is the plea from Australian tourism officials dealing with hordes of visitors to an island and nature preserve who cannot resist the urge to follow the marsupials around, approach them for selfies or even cuddle them."
499,"Wombats roam free on Maria Island, where there are no natural predators and no permanent human inhabitants. Along with other wildlife, they have taken over the island, a former prison colony with a small ghost town and vast green expanses, just off the coast of Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland."
500,"Looking like big teddy bears, the stocky, furry animals — each about three feet long and weighing 50 to 70 pounds — have no fear of people, and amble up to visitors as soon as they get off the ferry. But officials this month have called on people to fight the urge to get too close and to respect the habitat they are visiting."
501,"“The tourists are in love with the wombats; so in love that we need to give them some education about how to interact with them,” Ruth Dowdy, the head of the tourism board on Tasmania’s East Coast, told ABC Radio Hobart."
502,"The wombats do not react much when visitors pose right beside them for memorable selfies, push cameras right up to their noses, take up-close video as they eat or just follow them around."
503,"“They pretty much ignore people, but people run up to them and they don’t run away,” Ms. Dowdy said."
504,"Though the animals are usually calm about the attention, they can be bothered by it. Wombats are herbivores, but they have powerful jaws and big claws for burrowing, and have been known to bite and scratch people who startle them or approach their young."
505,"Local businesses and Tasmania’s Parks and Wildlife service have come up with a pledge, posted at the ferry to the island and online."
506,One part of the pledge reads:
507,"Wombats, when you trundle past me I pledge I will not chase you with my selfie stick, or get too close to your babies. I will not surround you, or try and pick you up. I will make sure I don’t leave rubbish or food from my morning tea. I pledge to let you stay wild."
508,"Maria Island is just one example of a phenomenon known as overtourism, accelerated by technology. It clogs celebrated towns with pedestrian traffic and prompts questions about whether the love of art has been overtaken by the love of documenting the experience of viewing art."
509,Humans seeking the perfect selfie have even been known to imperil their own lives — a phenomenon named the “killfie.”
510,"But people interfering with animals, failing to understand that wild creatures really are wild, is a growing problem, too."
511,"Sometimes it stems from misplaced compassion, like in the spring of 2016, when visitors at Yellowstone National Park, who thought a baby bison was cold, took the calf into their car and drove it to a ranger station. Later, rejected by its own herd, the calf was euthanized."
512,"Often, recklessness is to blame. Last year a woman in Transylvania was injured when she tried to take a selfie with a bear."
513,"The trend has prompted officials around the world to look for ways to keep wildlife and visitors safe from each other. In the United States, the National Park Service, for example, invites visitors to take the “Yellowstone Pledge,” available in 10 languages."
514,"“Practice safe selfies by never approaching animals to take a picture,” is the top point in the pledge."
515,"And animal protection organizations have called on Instagram to crack down on “bad selfies,” those that involve hugging and holding wildlife. The social network has posted warnings on popular hashtags, like those used by people taking selfies with quokkas, another kind of marsupial, in Australia last year."
516,"But as some selfies themselves show, Australia also abounds with opportunities to interact with wombats and others in zoos and parks, where professionals can keep an eye on their welfare."
517,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together."
518,"It is hard for me to imagine my father, a career litigator, boasting to his colleagues in Toronto that his son writes about pants. “I’m not sure what my father tells people I do,” I’ll joke. “Maybe he says ‘engineer.’ I hope he says ‘spy.’”"
519,"So what is it that I do? I write the Life as a Runway column for The Times’s Styles section. Since April 2015, I regularly go to a location — an event or workplace — and discuss with people the clothes they’ve decided to wear. I write about pants."
520,"Naturally, I like to think there’s more to it. To quote one of my favorite writers on the subject of style, Judith Thurman, “Everyone gets dressed.” That’s universal, but there’s also a city and its people to be explored; and I can think of few less interesting ways to do that than by asking about the literal layers that separate them."
521,"It’s not always easy. One trick to approaching strangers and inquiring about what they’re wearing, I’ve found, is to be Canadian. It helps to be polite, a little embarrassed, a little (and I really stress “little”) funny, a little unassuming. That’s half the ballgame. The other half is editing, which is kissing cousins — let’s be honest: it’s a whole Greek tragedy — with a troublesome thing called taste."
522,"It begins with my editor, Denny Lee, and I, figuring out a place to feature. This week, we looked at a large construction site, which is something we’ve been trying to do for years. After failing to get access to Hudson Yards and 1 Vanderbilt, I reached out to Berlin Rosen, a PR firm that represents developers, and they finessed it with the construction folks at 1 Wall Street."
523,"Once the photographer and I arrive, we need to make some quick decisions: Whom do we feature? I look for looks. But not just beauty, at least as traditionally defined: interesting looks are at least as important as “good” ones. We strive for diversity — age, gender, race, size — but at the same time, I want to be representative of the actual crowd at the Sundance Film Festival, Frieze art fair or Fulton Fish Market. We’re choosing a few of many, always."
524,"“This is not the Fashion Police,” I once told a reporter from Fast Company, when the tech-biz magazine was following the rest of the internet in mocking Tumblr employees we featured in a 2015 column (they took issue with the “pedestrian quality of some choices”).  I really believe that. At the same time, I’m clearly making aesthetic decisions. So there’s a tension."
525,"That push and pull exists throughout the entire process: in the people I choose to include and leave out, in what clothes I interrogate and ignore, in the questions I ask. I have all of three minutes to get the information, to get them to say something interesting, or perhaps funny, but at the same time feel comfortable and to be themselves while I’m standing here with a microphone in their face. The real challenge is to lead them to a place where they’re imparting the essential info on their own, without my drawing it out too much. "
526,"All the while, I need to know to clamp down on my own tongue. It can be uncomfortable to wait out the extra beat of silence that gives the subject room to give that the golden nugget of information, but holding back allows the best moments. Also, there’s a danger in overexposing. Our readers are smart; they know what they’re seeing. They have taste."
527,"Finally, there’s the most important step: the editing, once everything’s transcribed. When we featured the old Four Seasons restaurant at Christmas time, Martha Stewart told me that she had always found the room “sexy,” which never made it into the final version. That killed me, but cutting it made room for her anecdote about always getting cookies for her driver, which made the piece. Between Denny’s cuts and mine, I’d wager we lose about three-quarters of the quotes in a given interview."
528,"Working through it recalls the title of one of my favorite collections of poetry: “There’s A Trick With A Knife I’m Learning To Do,” by Michael Ondaatje. Writing is editing. Talking is editing. Seeing too. "
529,"A few weeks after I interviewed Martha, I was home in Canada for holidays. After dinner every night, my father retreats to the living room, where he reads The Times. Out of earshot, my stepmother confessed to me that he not only reads my Styles pieces, he cuts them out and saves them."
530,"Later that week, I noticed his dad jeans were a tad baggy and asked if he’d like me to have them tailored. “Get out of here,” he said. But I’m leaving out a couple of words. As in my column, some things are better left unsaid."

532,"SAN FRANCISCO — Technology companies rarely make money before they go public. Twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market. So were Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey."
533,"For Uber, the question as the ride-hailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money. That’s because the company, the most prominent tech start-up of its generation, will set the bar for other well-known tech companies like Slack and Lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this year."
534,"So far, Uber is not doing itself any favors on profits."
535,"The company reported on Friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier. But excluding certain one-time items, including the sale of some of its businesses, Uber’s losses for the quarter rose 88 percent from the previous year, to $842 million."
536,"The losses were a result of Uber’s increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors, many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers. Uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like DoorDash, Lyft and other ride-hailing and food-delivery services."
537,"Uber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company. A transportation colossus, Uber was privately valued at more than $70 billion last year, and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as $120 billion after going public. The share sale will create enormous windfalls for Uber’s many investors, and for its founders and early employees."
538,"As a private company, Uber is not required to disclose financial results. But it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business, and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as a surprise later."
539,"The latest set of figures, probably Uber’s last as a private company, will be closely scrutinized. Many investors initially give young and fast-growing tech start-ups a pass for losing money, but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them. Investors criticized Twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year, and they have pushed down Snap’s share price since its public offering, partly because the company is still deeply unprofitable."
540,"In a statement, Uber’s chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, did not address the company’s losses. He said Uber had “maintained category leadership” in its ride-hailing business, and he noted other bright spots, including the company’s freight-management business and nascent e-bike and scooter program."
541,"Uber has a long history of spending large sums of money. Ride-hailing is inherently an expensive business that requires companies to expand into new markets for growth, pay to recruit drivers and lower prices to grab business away from competitors."
542,"Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has been under pressure to pare its losses, and the company has pulled out of money-losing markets like Russia and Southeast Asia."
543,"Some of the company’s losses have been overshadowed by its explosive growth. In 2018, Uber increased its total bookings — what it charges customers for rides and food delivery — to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017. Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a 43 percent increase."
544,"The company’s net revenue for last year’s fourth quarter was $3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, and its gross bookings jumped 37 percent, to $14.2 billion. The company has $6.4 billion in cash, and its net loss was $865 million."
545,"But Uber’s profit margins have declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its food-delivery business, Uber Eats. The margins are also smaller on Uber Eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery drivers."
546,"Uber’s self-driving car program, which will probably not yield revenue for years, continues to burn cash. The company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads in December after a 10-month hiatus, which was prompted when one of its vehicles  fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona."

548,"In a metropolis replete with bright lights, innumerable signs and an overwhelming blitz of advertising, the views along the Hudson and East Rivers have offered a slice of aquatic Zen for New Yorkers."
549,"So unsurprisingly, the sight of a 1,200-square-foot electronic billboard sailing along Manhattan in October produced countless eye rolls and gripes, numerous tweets and considerable frustration."
550,"Now months later, New York City has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the company that operates the billboards from sailing its ad-bearing barges. But the company, Ballyhoo Media, says it plans to keep its boats afloat."
551,"“We think this is a clear overreach of government,” said Adam Shapiro, the company’s chief executive, in an interview on Thursday, a day after the city had filed the lawsuit. "
552,"On Friday, Ballyhoo’s billboard was indeed still sailing along the rivers, bearing a new, pointed 30-second message: “Freedom is the foundation of our country.”"
553,"The city’s lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York in Manhattan, accused Ballyhoo of violating local laws with its “Times Square-style billboards” and of creating a public nuisance."
554,"“Our waterways aren’t Times Square,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “These floating eyesores have no place on them.”"
555,"In addition to seeking an injunction that would stop Ballyhoo from operating the billboards, the city also said it wanted to collect penalties of up to $25,000 because of its claim that the company has violated zoning laws."
556,"The lawsuit also said the billboards distract drivers along waterfront highways, boat operators in waterways, and pedestrians and bicyclists on riverside paths. "
557,"Mr. Shapiro said he did not believe that Ballyhoo was breaking the law. Before sailing its billboards in New York, he said, the company had gotten advice from law firms, and zoning and maritime experts. "
558,"“They all said we did not infringe upon any zoning laws,” Mr. Shapiro said."
559,"Ballyhoo’s boat in New York, which carries a 60-foot-long and 20-foot-high LED screen, travels from the West Side of Midtown, down the Hudson River and around Battery Park, before heading up the East River toward Roosevelt Island. "
560,"The journey takes two hours before the boat reverses course, Mr. Shapiro said. "
561,"“I want to be sympathetic to people and understand their point of view,” he said. “I just can’t see how something passing by in a couple of seconds impacts someone’s day.”"
562,Mr. Shapiro confirmed that the freedom-affirming messaging on the billboard seen Friday was meant to push back against the lawsuit.
563,"The screen sported an image of the Statue of Liberty, along with text celebrating the “freedom of speech, commerce and innovation.” It went on to thank the Coast Guard and New York’s police and fire departments, then ended with a riff on the “I Heart N.Y.” campaign. "
564,"“We are simply one boat cruising the harbor causing no harm to anyone or anything,” he said, adding: “Just because some don’t like it, or the thought of it, doesn’t mean it should be illegal.”"
565,"Marcy Benstock, the executive director of the Clean Air Campaign and the Open Rivers Project in New York, said her organization had received complaints from people who live along the water that the light from the billboard had woken them."
566,"“People go by the river in order to get a sense of serenity, peace and quiet, and release from stress,” she said. “And suddenly, one of these things comes by that does the opposite. It makes them furious.”"
567,"In January, the city’s Law Department sent a letter to Ballyhoo informing it that the city believed the company was flouting the law."
568,Mr. Shapiro said the company responded with “a very detailed letter” explaining why it did not think the billboards violated zoning regulations. He said the city never responded.
569,He also said he thought recent reports have exaggerated New Yorkers’ dissatisfaction. 
570,"“We’re reaching about 500,000 people daily,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Even if a small number of people are unhappy — which could be thousands in New York City — that doesn’t represent the majority.”"
571,Mr. Shapiro said businesses that had paid for the billboards had contacted him with concerns over the lawsuit. He would not say whether he had lost business because of it. 
572,"He added that he was hopeful his company, which started out of Miami in 2016, and New York City could work together in the future. In Miami, Ballyhoo was crafting a deal with the city’s tourism board to play movies on the beach, he said. He hoped to do something similar in New York."
573,"“We’re trying to be an asset to the community,” he said. “By no means are we trying to be a distraction.”"
574,"Earlier this week, two City Council members, Mark D. Levine and Justin L. Brannan, introduced a bill that would increase the fine for companies advertising in the city’s waterways to $100,000, from $25,000."
575,Both men said they welcomed the city’s lawsuit.
576,"“These monstrosities are ugly and illegal and soon they will be a thing of the past,” Mr. Brannan said in a statement. “At a time when every square inch of our world feels like it’s covered in advertisements, visual pollution is a real thing and our waterways should be off limits.”"
577,"The furniture and object designer F. Taylor Colantonio, dressed in a red-trimmed poet’s blouse, gives a gentle shove to a fluted Doric column in his small, theatrically furnished loft in the Campo de’ Fiori neighborhood of Rome. The column wobbles loose from the wall, revealing itself suddenly to be light as Styrofoam, phony as a stage set. “Everything in my house is fake,” says Colantonio. “I’m a punk collector. It’s all fake.”"
578,"In addition to working on interior design projects for private clients, Colantonio, 30, creates surrealist objects, which range from coiled-rope vases to snakelike rebar candlesticks to transparent rugs. Championed by Alex Eagle, the owner of the Store, and the design dealer Jermaine Gallacher (who both sell his work in their London boutiques), his pieces are often offbeat interpretations of chintzy suburban décor and imitations of antiquity."
579,"At his apartment’s towering picture window, a ceramic tiger — a flea market find as big as a real cub — stands guard, across from a daybed upholstered with hand-painted violet-striped linen. Colantonio composed an intricate savanna mural for the wall above — tropical creatures amid palms and yellow roses — rendered in the chalky children’s tempera paints he prefers. In the dining alcove, in front of a collection of modern ceramic vases inspired by ancient urns, is a black-and-cream vase of his own creation. It occupies a 19th-century walnut table and recalls a Greek kylix, but it flops, uncannily, to one side, its body made not of rigid and impermeable pottery, but of softly coiled machine-braided rope. “The wonkiness gives it personality and gesture,” Colantonio explains, lifting it by its squishy lollipop-like handles. The vase is a vase in idea only. A fake."

583,"The great-grandson of an Italian immigrant, Colantonio was raised in the suburbs of Massachusetts, studied furniture design at RISD and moved to this loft in Rome two years ago, just after completing an artist’s residency in Puglia with a maestro of traditional papier-mâché. Though his works are still fabricated in factories in Rhode Island, rather than in local artisan workshops, Colantonio prefers to live in this ancient Italian city, where he can look to its Classical and Baroque architecture and the Surrealism of Giorgio De Chirico — whose own fake-filled home is nearby — rather than follow the currents of the contemporary design world. “As someone making things, it’s really nice to live in a cosmopolitan setting like Rome, but to be free of the present, to avoid all those trends and influences,” he says."
584,"Colantonio crosses the Tiber River each day to his studio in the vibrant Trastevere neighborhood. The space once belonged to another lover of fakery — the impish artist Gino De Dominicis, who faked his own death in 1969 — but today it is strewn with Colantonio’s current projects. Among these are sheets of wallpaper inked to mimic the striped walls of a circus tent and a series of woven PVC lamps, their clear vinyl surfaces painted with swirls of colors in a homage to Carla Accardi, the Roman artist who helped pioneer the Arte Povera movement."
585,"In the intimate glass-roofed space, Colantonio stands attaching cloth-covered electrical cables to the rainbow-colored cluster of lights at his tall wooden work table. To his back, a pair of six-foot-tall rope vases stand, slouching like sleepy sentinels; on a vintage armoire hang two blazers, hand-painted by Colantonio with the ancient columns and architecture that decorated De Chirico’s Ballets Russes costumes; on the floor lie a few of what he calls his “magic carpets” — seemingly pedestrian Persian throw rugs that are, in fact, made of transparent plastic and expose rather than cover the floor underneath. It’s a “material shift,” he says, “that removes the rugness of the object.”"
586,"“I’m interested in giving people a connection to an archetype, to something familiar,” says Colantonio. But there must always be a surprise, a shift that blurs the line between the suburban and the exotic, the mass-produced and the handmade, the authentic and the fake. “Familiarity is essentially trash, but it offers people the possibility to understand,” he says, as he flaps a stiff crystalline rug down on the floor, handling the unbending sheet as if it were actually supple textile. “I’m genuinely interested in the trash, but I’m looking for the sweet spot between familiarity and the avant-garde.”"
587,"The Mueller investigation is over, and the only people close to Donald Trump who have been criminally charged are his former campaign chairman, former deputy campaign chairman, former personal lawyer, former national security adviser, former campaign foreign policy adviser and Roger Stone, the president’s longtime friend and strategist. The report written by the special counsel Robert Mueller, according to a quotation in a brief summary issued by Attorney General William Barr, says that “while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.” Naturally, the president and his allies are claiming, as one of Trump’s tweets said, “Complete and Total EXONERATION.”"
588,"I won’t pretend that the weekend’s news was not very good for Trump and dispiriting for those of us who despise him. Whatever else is in the Mueller report, it says, according to Barr, that the investigation “did not establish” that anyone from the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its 2016 election interference. The overtures we all know about — the Trump Tower meeting, Trump’s public call for Russia to obtain Hillary Clinton’s emails, which Russian hackers tried to do that very day — were not part of a crime, or at least not part of a crime that the special counsel could prove. There will be no deus ex Mueller bringing this wretched presidency to an early end. On the contrary, Trump is emboldened, and his foes momentarily defensive."
589,"Until the Mueller report is publicly released, however, it’s impossible to tell how much of Trump’s victory is substantive and how much is spin. The report, evidently, leaves open the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. In his letter to Congress about the report, Barr said that he and his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, made the determination that no obstruction of justice occurred. Of course, last year Barr wrote a memo calling Mueller’s obstruction investigation “grossly irresponsible” and “fatally misconceived,” which is surely why Trump appointed him in the first place. There is no reason for anyone to take his finding seriously."
590,"[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]"
591,"Even some of the underlying questions about Trump’s relationship with Russia remain open. Here, those of us who’d hoped for more from Mueller should be mindful of the temptation to grasp at straws. On Friday, when the news broke that Mueller wasn’t recommending any more indictments, many of us immediately asked whether there were sealed indictments. There weren’t. As we parse Barr’s letter, we should be aware of the human tendency toward motivated reasoning."
592,"But we should be equally aware of the media tendency to capitulate in the face of Trumpian triumphalism. (Recall the pressure to give Trump credit after his first meeting with Kim Jong-un, despite the emptiness of the resulting agreement.) So we shouldn’t overlook the fact that when it comes to Trump’s relationship with Russia, Barr’s letter speaks only to very narrow questions about Trump campaign involvement in Russian information warfare operations in 2016."
593,"Barr wrote that no Trump associate conspired or “knowingly” coordinated with the Internet Research Agency, the Russian troll farm that spread pro-Trump and anti-Clinton propaganda. Did any do so unknowingly? Barr also wrote that the special counsel didn’t find that Trump associates “conspired or coordinated with the Russian government” in hacking into the Democratic National Committee’s computers, but few thought the campaign had a role in the actual digital break-in."
594,"Still, assuming Barr’s summary is accurate, it means that while Trump was installed with Russia’s help, neither he nor his campaign assisted Russia in committing the crimes that aided his ascent. (If he cheated his way to victory, it was through more pedestrian alleged violations of campaign finance law.) We’re still in the dark, however, about all the steps Trump took to thwart the investigation and about the extent of his vulnerability to compromise."
595,"On Saturday, the left-wing writer Matt Taibbi published a widely shared essay calling Russiagate “this generation’s W.M.D.,” a national security hoax, abetted by a credulous media, akin to the one that justified the Iraq War. “The biggest thing this affair has uncovered so far is Donald Trump paying off a porn star,” he wrote."
596,"That’s silly. The biggest thing this affair has uncovered is that throughout much of the presidential campaign, Trump was seeking to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. The deal had the potential to make hundreds of millions of dollars for the Trump Organization, and Trump’s lawyer solicited the Russian government’s help to get it done. After the election, Trump lied about the deal to the American people. Vladimir Putin knew the truth, giving him leverage over Trump. Is that the only leverage he had?"
597,"It now falls to Congress to find out, and it’s important that Democrats not allow themselves to be intimidated by right-wing chest-beating, particularly if Republicans try to quash the report’s release. Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Representative Devin Nunes, a devoted Trump lackey, called for the report to be burned. Jay Sekulow, one of Trump’s lawyers, has said he would “fight very aggressively” to stop the president’s written answers to Mueller from being made public. Republicans may be gloating, but it’s Democrats who should be on the offensive. If Trump thinks he has been vindicated, then what is he hiding?"

600,"ATLANTA — “It’s getting exciting now,” Jim Nantz of CBS said in mock excitement in the second half of the Super Bowl on Sunday night."
601,He was talking about a punt.
602,"Los Angeles Rams punter Johnny Hekker’s 65-yard roller set the record for longest Super Bowl punt, and through three quarters, with a score of a 3-3, it truly was the most exciting play."
603,"Nantz’s CBS broadcast partner, Tony Romo, the former Dallas Cowboys quarterback, had been the subject of much news coverage leading up to Sunday, mostly for his ability to predict plays and for the infectious enthusiasm he brings to his work."
604,"But by the time of Hekker’s punt almost halfway through the third quarter, the game’s dullness seemed to have broken even him."
605,"“This is hard to watch,” Romo said. “I mean, this is how many punts in a row?”"
606,"For the Rams, it was the eighth consecutive possession ending in a punt. As Hekker’s kick from the end zone tumbled to the Patriots’ 29-yard line, Nantz mused that it could set the record."
607,"“Oh, you’ve been waiting for a stat like that,” Romo teased him."
608,“That’s it!” Nantz yelled. “That’s the highlight of the game.”
609,"Hekker turned out to be the closest thing to a star the Rams could muster. A squad that finished the regular season as the second-highest-scoring team in football finished the Super Bowl without a touchdown, in a 13-3 loss to the New England Patriots."
610,The collapse of the offense was not missed by the players who participated in the losing effort.
611,"“Last time I checked, defense wins championships,” C. J. Anderson, the Rams’ backup running back, said after a game in which his team managed just 57 total yards in the first half. “That saying has been in football for a long time.”"
612,"The game, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in N.F.L. history, was hardly one to remember for the Patriots offense, which plodded along to 407 yards and just one touchdown, but it offered no shortage of ways to sum up the Rams’ offensive ineptitude."
613,"■ The Rams ended all of their drives with punts until Greg Zuerlein kicked a field goal with 2 minutes 11 seconds left in the third quarter. Even that one could hardly be described as an offensive triumph, as Zuerlein, nursing a heel injury, had to connect from 53 yards out. In all, the Rams’ drive chart looked brutal: punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, field goal, punt, interception, missed field goal."
614,"■ Todd Gurley, who led the N.F.L. with 21 total touchdowns this season, ran for just 35 yards on 10 carries and caught one pass for minus-1 yard. His plus-size backup, Anderson, ran for 22 yards on seven carries. Anderson credited the Patriots’ gap control with stopping both him and Gurley. “Obviously neither of us got going,” Anderson said, “so you’ve got to give it to New England on that.”"
615,"■ Partly as a result of that stymied running game, Jared Goff, the team’s superstar third-year quarterback, spent the entire game running for his life. He may have been sacked just four times, but he was hit by a Patriots defender on 12 other plays. The constant pressure resulted in nearly all of his throws being rushed."
616,"■ It was the first time since Coach Sean McVay took over the team that the Rams were shut out in a first half, and it was just the second time in 36 games (including the playoffs) that they were held without a touchdown."
617,■ Los Angeles never ran a play in the red zone. The team’s best effort got it to New England’s 27-yard line before Goff threw an interception that essentially handed the win to the Patriots.
618,■ The Rams converted just 3 of 13 third-down plays.
619,■ They were held below 300 total yards for just the second time this season.
620,■ They were penalized for 65 yards and rushed for just 62.
621,"In all, that collection of offensive atrocities led to Hekker’s punting the ball nine times for 417 yards, only the third most in Super Bowl history, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. Baltimore’s Kyle Richardson set the record with 430 in the Baltimore Ravens’ win over the Giants in Super Bowl XXXV. That game resulted in a whopping 852 combined punting yards, making this game’s 632 combined yards seem pedestrian."
622,"Hekker’s effort gave Nantz a record to tout, and it gave the punter’s family something to watch. But for the Rams, who came into the week as the leaders of the N.F.L.’s offensive revolution, the game offered little beyond disappointment."
623,PARIS — The first Yellow Vest demonstration of the new year reached a new level of violence on Saturday as a government ministry building was attacked and the minister evacuated out the back door. What started two months ago as a protest over gas taxes has turned into a more general attack on the French government.
624,"The minister, the chief government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux, told French television that Yellow Vest protesters and “men dressed in black” — the so-called casseurs, or “breakers,” who have latched onto the movement — commandeered a construction vehicle and broke down the door of the Left Bank building. They then entered a courtyard and broke several windows, he said."
625,"The rare intrusion — the last such attack on a government building by protesters was in 1999 — took place on a day of protests throughout France that started peacefully but degenerated into violence. Some 50,000 took part in Yellow Vest demonstrations all over France, officials said Saturday, up from last weekend’s 29,000. Over 3,000 turned out in Paris."
626,"The numbers were down sharply from the protest’s first weeks, but still represent a significant national turnout, especially as a majority of French continue to support the movement, despite repeated outbreaks of violence."
627,"The Yellow Vest movement, which takes its name from the fluorescent hazard vests adopted by the protesters as a sign of economic distress, began as an outcry over rising fuel taxes and expanded into a broad campaign over money woes."
628,"Near the Musée d’Orsay in Paris, the police used tear gas and flash balls to block hundreds of protesters. Video posted to social media showed protesters fighting hand to hand with club-wielding police officers. Protesters dragged two officers to the ground and kicked them repeatedly, the video showed."
629,"On the Champs-Élysées, which was closed to traffic for hours, protesters threw rocks at the police and officers used a water cannon to disperse the crowd."
630,"Scooters and a car were burned along one of the capital’s symbols of wealth and prestige, the Boulevard Saint-Germain. Protesters and the police clashed on a pedestrian bridge linking the two banks of the Seine, a span heavily visited by tourists."
631,"Underscoring the seriousness of Saturday’s protests, President Emmanuel Macron reacted sharply and quickly on Twitter. “Once again, the republic was attacked with extreme violence — its guardians, its representatives, its symbols,” Mr. Macron wrote."
632,"Skirmishes also broke out between the police and protesters in major cities in western France, including Nantes, Bordeaux and Caen. In Rennes, the capital of Brittany, protesters broke a door to city hall. In Toulouse, 2,000 people took to the streets. Paving stones were thrown at the police, and highways were blocked."
633,"But it was in Paris that the protests broke new ground with the attack on the ministry building along Rue de Grenelle, the heart of official France, where a number of important government offices are located."
634,A shaken-looking Mr. Griveaux was interviewed on French television after he was evacuated from his offices.
635,"“It wasn’t me who was attacked, it was the republic” and “the house of France,” he said."
636,"Mr. Griveaux, the government’s most familiar face on television, has also been the most aggressive in adopting Mr. Macron’s harsh new line against the protest movement. In a New Year’s address, Mr. Macron vowed to restore order “without compromise.”"
637,"On Friday, Mr. Griveaux declared that the Yellow Vest movement had become “the province of agitators who want upheaval, and, at bottom, to overthrow the government.” A watchword of the protest movement has been a demand that Mr. Macron resign."
638,"A Yellow Vest leader, Eric Drouet, was arrested this past week on charges of organizing an undeclared demonstration, setting off concerns of a backlash that would re-energize the demonstrations."
639,"The weeks of unrest have pressured Mr. Macron to act. In mid-December, he scrapped a contentious fuel tax increase and promised extra cash for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners."

641,STILL IN LOVE By Michael Downing
642,SUCH GOOD WORK By Johannes Lichtman
643,"Michael Downing’s “Still in Love,” the belated sequel to his 1997 novel “Perfect Agreement,” describes a semester inside the classroom. After 20 years teaching composition at McClintock College, the protagonist, Mark Sternum, has been fired for failing a black single mother and found new work as a creative writing professor at Hellman College. Mark champions limitation as the focus of his class: “to have limits, to need limits, to choose our limits, to be defined by those limits, and to learn to love them.”"
644,"But the novel itself seems less in love with its limits than relieved of the obligation to transcend them. A meticulous realism transcribes in numbing detail every syllable of classroom conversation, alongside a great daily fuss about printing and stapling — the literal pushing of papers. Downing’s prose is as clean as you’d expect from a creative writing teacher at Tufts, but it never ventures out of the everyday and into the curious."
645,"The narrative is supplemented by Sternum’s weekly writing assignments and blackboard exercises and Word documents with “track changes” on, presenting itself as more a seminar than a novel. While Mark’s students are required to fulfill intricate plot and form requirements in their stories, the novel’s own concerns are comparatively minor and unstructured: Mark’s tepid relationship with his distant lover, house repairs and the state of the Saab brand today."
646,"Mark’s catalog of his students strains to register their identities beyond mere formality: Rashid, his one Muslim student, is noted each time she raises her hand by the changing color of her head scarf. These descriptions are always hyphenated (“sage-green,” “ice-blue”) in a failed effort to suggest he is seeing her clearly. The word “trans” is spoken, whether by Rashid or another student Mark isn’t sure, and the subject drops. A central drama arrives at its anticlimax when Mark’s sympathy for a cancer-ridden student devolves into banal administrative frustration."
647,"“Still in Love” presents the classroom as a sacred ground — “that fragile home for possibility, that singular space devoted solely to potential” — and admirably outlines the ways in which writing can be improved on a technical level. But the story keeps its reach curbed and its eyes down until it culminates in a tired plot twist that only makes the narrow world of this novel even smaller."
648,"Johannes Lichtman’s debut novel, “Such Good Work,” begins in a similar mode: An anxious male creative writing teacher has trouble navigating the politics and processes of a college campus. Again, oddly, a black single mother is the catalyst for institutional reprimand — although in this case for the protagonist’s failure to be harsh enough with her. Jonas, the teacher, is addicted to opiates as a remedy for social anxiety. Lichtman, a remarkable thinker and social satirist, fills his first 50 pages with a misleadingly pedestrian cycle of basic cowardice, random aggression, flagrant self-congratulation and garden-variety self-loathing, until a Suboxone strip chops up the rhythm of his prose and the book begins in earnest."
649,"Relocating to Lund, Sweden, to get clean, Jonas enrolls in a graduate program and lives in a dorm for exchange students. His Swedish mother has gifted him citizenship and language, but the difference between the mother tongue and his mother’s tongue trips Jonas up on his quest to be chatty, idiomatic and cool. From his perch deep within his own self-consciousness, Jonas witnesses the foreign dynamics around him with astonishing lucidity. He can identify the difference between a would-be Swedish Detroit and a Swedish Oakland. Accounts of nine-party political systems lead him to realize that outside the “either/or-ness of Democrat/Republican,” he can’t articulate his own beliefs. America’s measure of “how well you did what you were doing” is timid compared to Sweden’s “Is what you’re doing worthwhile?”"
650,"Jonas finds a companion in his neighbor Anja, one of the more autonomous, intelligent and unpredictable female characters to grace a male novelist’s debut. Lichtman has a terrific ear for the tiny linguistic cues that reveal completely correct English to be nonetheless foreign, and Anja’s dialogue is delivered in sometimes heartbreakingly poignant German-English. When she concludes a pivotal argument with the simple phrase “that’s what we’ll do,” the reader feels the potency of a kind of communication between lovers that is non-national, non-hierarchical and pronounced in peace."
651,"Following that argument, Jonas moves to Malmo, the third-largest city in Sweden and the center of a growing immigration crisis. It’s the spring of 2015, six months before Alan Kurdi’s body washes up on the shore of Turkey. Jonas’s desire to fit in is complicated by the ensuing emergency. His own semi-foreignness looks meager next to the profound alienation of the arriving refugees. Addiction and xenophobia begin to operate as parallel social epidemics, and it’s here that the novel outgrows its own boundaries, becoming stranger and more robust. As Jonas moves away from his lukewarm academic work and toward a volunteer organization teaching Swedish to Afghan unaccompanied minors, he enters a frame of mind in which every instinct is clobbered by an opposing one. Charity becomes danger, connection becomes insult, and aid becomes restriction in a dizzying but sincere engagement with two of our most unsolvable global problems."
652,"“Such Good Work” introduces a writer who is willing to openly contradict himself, to stand corrected, to honor both men and women, to ask sincere questions and let them ring unanswered. His classroom is a more viable sanctuary because the difficult world lights its windows."

654,"Just as you see women of a certain age who look so good that you are not sure whether it was Botox, Restylane or the plain old knife — but you deeply suspect they have had, as they say, “work done” — the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, Calif., has quietly undergone a face lift of its own. One can’t quite put one’s finger on the changes: nothing radical or vulgar you understand, just aggressive tweaking: new carpeting, upholstery, lighting and fabrics. (Parts of the 195-room hotel were serially closed for the work.) Since the Peninsula is only 27 years old, it proves that in Hollywood, it is never too soon for a makeover. The result: the elegant epicenter of Beverly Hills feels like a French chateau just bought by a rich Russian oligarch with good taste (imagine that) and an endless supply of cash to leave you reveling in luxury. As befits a hotel were room prices start at just under $600 and then quickly escalate, the staff strives to accommodate every guest’s whim, even those who show up before check-in time. In our case, we were offered cappuccinos or drinks while our room was being prepared. "
655,"Set at the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and Wilshire near Canon Drive, the Peninsula is an easy walk to all the best shopping in Beverly Hills, from Neiman Marcus to the designer shops on Rodeo Drive, that holy grail of spending. And if you prefer not to soil your Louboutins, a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce, Mercedes or BMW stands at the ready to drop off and pick up guests within Beverly Hills."
656,"Some rooms are done in fabrics from the French house of Brunschwig and others in Manuel Canovas. Our 480-square-foot room, painted a pale blue, had Canovas’s pink and blue tree of life-patterned bedspread coupled with a bright blue and white plaid bed skirt and had a light airy feel. Matching Canovas curtains framed the Juliette balcony and a marble-topped wood desk was ample enough for a computer. A useful — if somewhat outdated — perk: a fax machine with a printer and copier. One tiny drawback: the closet was a tad small. One wonders how it might accommodate guests in Los Angeles for the red carpet and the need to change several outfits over the course of the day. And the mini bar was pedestrian, with an unimaginative selection of Champagne, nuts and candy."
657,"A bit retro, with white marble floors bordered with a pale peach marble pattern. It was compact but had everything we needed including good water pressure. This is Hollywood after all and the bathroom boasted a magnifying mirror so strong that one might not find it a blessing, but the array of Peninsula bath products was lovely."
658,"Tell a friend to meet you for afternoon tea at the Peninsula and they will assume you know your way around town. Yes, there were scones with lemon curd and marmalade and jam, but Tea, in the “Living Room,” is an elaborate affair — at $75 a person — served on Bernadotte porcelains that were hand-painted for the hotel. The day we were there, the Peninsula was celebrating “National Ice Cream Month” with a panoply of offerings served on a three tiered stand that held rocky road tartlets, minute chocolate chip cones, cookies and a Neapolitan macaroon. Champagne was extra. "
659,"The bedroom’s nightstand offered a tablet that lets a guest control the temperature, radio, TV, curtains and lighting (in 11 languages) without budging from bed. One can read the menus, though you have to order by phone. Personally I find the technology daunting, so I was particularly grateful for the hotel spa and its Serenity Lounge. Millennials will surely balk at the prohibition on cellphones, but perhaps they might be assuaged by the offer of coloring books to help pass the time in all that silence. "
660,As the writer Beatrice Kaufman (the wife of George S. Kaufman) once said: “I’ve been rich and I’ve been poor. And rich is better.” The Peninsula is certainly the place to indulge in the lifestyle of the latter.

664,"SEATTLE — As cars and pedestrians passed by during the evening rush on Thursday, Paula Harper-Christensen, a retired teacher, smiled and waved her sign with an upside-down Starbucks mermaid. “Don’t spill our chance,” the text said under the logo. Susan Glicksberg’s protest placard was more blunt: “Do Not Run!”"
665,"Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, has returned to his hometown, Seattle, and it has not been a uniformly warm welcome."
666,"Mr. Schultz, 65, has come under fierce criticism from many fellow Democrats for being a possible 2020 spoiler after he disclosed his interest in running as an independent candidate for president. He says he will weigh whether to run over the few next months as he undertakes a national book tour describing his vision for fixing America’s ills."
667,[Check out the Democratic field with our new candidate tracker.]
668,"Thursday night was his first major appearance in Seattle since his political announcement. Roughly 40 protesters gathered to greet him before his planned event to promote the book and his possible candidacy. Some, like Mary Hanke, were overtly hostile to Mr. Schultz and his record as a businessman."
669,"“He’s just like Trump, and the last thing we need is another spoiled, self-absorbed billionaire,” said Ms. Hanke, 69, a retired tech manager."
670,"But many others, like Ms. Harper-Christensen, said they were more concerned about the impact of a Schultz independent candidacy in 2020: that a third-party run could split the vote and help re-elect President Trump, who is far more unpopular in Seattle than Mr. Schultz is."
671,"“I don’t even like to say his name,” Ms. Harper-Christensen said, referring to the president."
672,"Seattle is where Mr. Schultz made his fortune as a businessman. He organized an investor group to buy in 1987 what was at the time a modest coffee-bean retailer called Starbucks, with all of 17 locations, and building it into a frappaccino behemoth with nearly 30,000 stores around the world."
673,"Mr. Schultz left the company as a billionaire last year, and yet remains relatively little known to many Seattle residents, compared to other Seattle business leaders who have become household names — notably Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Bill Gates of Microsoft."
674,"But the Starbucks brand, with which many Seattle residents have a complex love/hate relationship, is everywhere you look. The historic nonprofit theater that Mr. Schultz hired out for Thursday evening is only a few blocks from the early 1970s-vintage Starbucks store at Pike Place Market — preserved like a museum, or shrine, and drawing tens of thousands of tourists a year. The corporate headquarters, with its blue-and-green mermaid logo rising from the rooftop, is a few miles to the south."
675,"In the riots that gripped the city during a gathering of the World Trade Organization in 1999, the shattered glass windows of Starbucks stores became one of the symbols of destruction by anarchists and other groups that roved the city denouncing corporate power."
676,"At least one other billionaire with the means to self-finance a bid for the White House, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is considering a run for president — in Mr. Bloomberg’s case, as a Democrat."
677,But it is Mr. Schultz’s possible path as a moderate independent outside the two-party system that has drawn the most attention — and criticism by some Democrats who said they feared that a Schultz candidacy could siphon off more Democratic voters than Republicans.
678,"Washington’s governor, Jay Inslee, a Democrat who is also considering a presidential bid, said this week that he feared a Schultz candidacy could help re-elect President Trump."
679,"“Anyone who would run as an independent, and clearly split the Democratic vote, and clearly help Donald Trump — that would be a terrible decision,” Mr. Inslee said."
680,"But Mr. Schultz, in an interview with The Times and an appearance on “60 Minutes,” said he believed that the two-party system, locked in a war of revenge and spite, was broken, and that Democratic Party leaders had moved too far to the left on some policy issues."
681,"“Both parties are consistently not doing what’s necessary on behalf of the American people,” he said."
682,"A few people who came to greet Mr. Schultz at his speech said they agreed with him on at least that point. Jeff Jared, 55, a lawyer and self-described libertarian, carried a sign that said, “Run, Howard, Run.”"
683,"“People are starving for a third party,” Mr. Jared said."
684,"Kellyanne Conway, White House adviser, recently dismissed as a “silly semantic argument” questions about President Trump’s use of the word “wall” — is it concrete, steel, see-through, a “smart wall,” slatted, piked, solar-powered, a chain-link fence or just a metaphor?"
685,"The semantics, however, are anything but trivial. If the White House and House Democrats are to reach a deal to avert another government shutdown by the Feb. 15 deadline, they must first reach a rough détente over what they are talking about — in particular, the definition of Mr. Trump’s “wall,” and of “border security,” the Democrats’ catchall description of their own approach."
686,"“There’s no magic glossary telling you the difference between a fence and wall or a barrier, they are kind of interchangeable,” said Jeh Johnson, who served as President Barack Obama’s homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2017. "
687,"“There is a distinction between governing and political rhetoric, and people should not get trapped in the binary,’” Mr. Johnson said. “The moment when we reach a compromise on the vocabulary is the moment we reach a compromise on the policy.”"
688,Here is a glossary that could determine the fate of the debate.
689,"In the beginning, there was a tweet. "
690,"At 4:34 p.m. Aug. 5, 2014, Mr. Trump sent a message: “SECURE THE BORDER! BUILD THE WALL!”"
691,Mr. Trump’s definition of “wall” has been a moving target since.
692,"In the early days of the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump said the wall should be built of “precast concrete” with “no windows, no nothing.” He now says that he always meant that steel and “see-through” materials could work, too, and has, from time to time, mused about festooning the wall with solar panels. In December, he tweeted an image showing a puzzling rendering of a picketed “Steel Slat Barrier.”"
693,"Soon after taking office, the president commissioned eight prototypes of wall designs, four made of concrete and the remainder fabricated from steel and other materials. They ranged in height from 18 to 30 feet. "
694,"The models were tested last year, and the results were inconclusive, according to leaked documents showing that all of them could be breached with a determined effort and the right tools. But Trump administration officials say that the testing provided them with valuable information, and lessons learned were incorporated into an already built section of slatted 30-foot-high “bollard” fence near Calexico, Calif."
695,"As Mr. Trump’s image of the wall changed, so did its price tag. He now wants $5.7 billion for the wall — but that number has bounced between $4 billion and $20 billion over the past three years. During the shutdown fight, he even suggested that he would accept an unspecified “down payment.” "
696,"Ms. Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, was roundly mocked for dropping the “the” before “wall” — with critics likening it to the “I love lamp” scene from “Anchorman.” "
697,"In reality, Ms. Nielsen was trying to keep her request as vague as possible to facilitate a compromise, while staying nominally true to Mr. Trump’s campaign promise."
698,"“She was lampooned,” Mr. Johnson said. “But she was really just trying to introduce the concept that a wall could be almost any kind of a barrier.”"
699,"The fact that Ms. Nielsen felt compelled to use the “W” word indicated her concern about alienating members of Mr. Trump’s base, who roar “build the wall” at his rallies. To that end, members of the president’s team have been quietly removing the word “replacement” from public statements about upgrades to existing border barriers. "
700,"They instead insert the word “new,” according to an official familiar with the practice."
701,"As part of the failed 2014 “Gang of Eight” effort to overhaul the nation’s immigration system, a coalition of Senate Democrats supported a $46 billion bill to expand the Border Patrol, with improvements to existing fencing. The bill was shot down by House Republicans because it included a process that would have allowed many immigrants who entered the country illegally to remain in the country."
702,"But the bill now stands as evidence to Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans of how Democrats in previous years voted to increase funding for barriers under the broad rubric of border security, when packaged with a path to citizenship. "
703,"But Mr. Trump’s political weaponization of the wall is now making such a compromise increasingly untenable for Democrats. “We’re not doing a wall,” Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters this month. “Does anyone have any doubt that we’re not doing a wall?” "
704,"The 2020 presidential campaign is making compromise even more difficult. Senator Kamala Harris, Democrat of California, who announced this week that she is running for president, declared the wall “a medieval vanity project,” then vowed to make opposition to it a centerpiece of her campaign."
705,"“The wall concept is an anathema to most Democrats,” said Geoff Garin, a veteran Democratic pollster who works for Priorities USA, a political action committee. “They are more than willing to have a granular conversation about what is common sense and effective border security, but it’s not going to be a conversation about a wall in any sense that Trump has used the word.”"
706,"The word “fence” is, for the moment at least, less politically charged than “wall.” "
707,"In 2006, a coalition of Republicans and 90 Democrats in the House and the Senate — including Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, then senators — passed President George W. Bush’s plan to add more than 700 new miles of double-layered “reinforced” fencing. "
708,"“I am comfortable with barriers that involve vehicles, fences,” Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, told CNN this week."
709,"But what exactly is meant by “fence”? The southern border is already a crazy-quilt of different border barriers of different sizes, different materials, installed in different eras — known, by and large, as fencing."
710,"And they have different uses. Urban chain-link is meant to deter migrants on foot; an array of metal and concrete “vehicle barriers” have been strung in remote areas; and stretches of concertina wire are used to fill in gaps where there are no permanent structures and on top of structures where there are some. There are also dozens of variants — pickets, corrugated panels, berms, X-shaped steel barriers, even planked walls placed along Gulf Coast beaches. "
711,"In recent budget bills, Democrats have insisted on a provision limiting the expansion of barriers to “existing” technologies, a move intended to frame any new construction as an old “fence” rather than a new “wall,” according to a senior Democratic congressional aide."
712,"Back in 2006, Ms. Pelosi and other congressional liberals voted against the reinforced fencing bill. It is not clear they would support a similar measure even if it were part of a more extensive deal that included a reprieve for the young undocumented immigrants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA."
713,"Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, was one of those who supported the 2006 bill, and late last year offered Mr. Trump a $25 billion deal that included protections for DACA recipients — and left open the possibility of more fencing. Ms. Pelosi did not agree to the proposal."
714,"Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion request would pay for the installation of barriers on another 215 miles of border — in addition to an estimated 654 miles of fencing, much of it in the form of vehicle barriers, currently in place along the 1,900-mile border. "
715,"That number would include installation of about 100 miles of barriers to keep out migrants, many from Central America, seeking to enter the country on foot in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. Before the shutdown, Republican senators, led by John Cornyn of Texas, proposed passing $1.6 billion in funding for 65 miles of that project."
716,"The idea went nowhere at the time. But a handful of congressional Democrats, including Senator Jon Tester of Montana, did not rule out supporting the plan in the future."
717,"“The walls we are building are not medieval walls,” Mr. Trump said on Jan. 25 during his rambling Rose Garden announcement of the three-week funding deal that ended the 35-day government shutdown. "
718,"“These barriers are made of steel, have see-through visibility, which is very important, and are equipped with sensors, monitors and cutting-edge technology, including state-of-the-art drones,” he told reporters."
719,"It seems like an unlikely gateway to compromise, but some Democrats believe the president was signaling his willingness to accept funding for new technologies, beyond steel and concrete."
720,"Two days earlier, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, told reporters that he would be open to fulfilling Mr. Trump’s $5.7 billion request if it were spent on a smart wall, targeted at improving border surveillance, the expanded use of drones and X-ray technology to screen for weapons and drugs, as well as on the hiring of more Border Patrol agents."
721,"Mr. Trump, aides said, is open to spending some of the money on similar improvements. His idea of a smart wall was inspired by the one built by Israel on its border with Gaza, which uses high-tech surveillance equipment, including closed-circuit cameras."
722,"Mr. Trump’s language has softened as the funding fight has intensified, and “barrier” now enjoys pride of place next to “wall.”"
723,"“If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier, they are Wasting their time!” he tweeted on Wednesday."
724,"A day later, he was back to wall-only: “Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!” he tweeted on Thursday."
725,Whether Mr. Trump was providing semantic cover for a compromise deal may depend on whether he is disciplined enough to tone down his messaging. 
726,His allies seem eager for him to do so.
727,"“It doesn’t have to be a wall,” Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, told reporters on Tuesday. “Physical barriers would be fine.”"
728,[Update: How a hazardous rail crossing became a deadly crash site.]
729,"A railroad crossing in Nassau County turned into a chaotic disaster scene on Tuesday night when two Long Island Rail Road trains traveling in opposite directions struck a car that had swerved around lowered gates and onto the tracks, killing three people."
730,"The rush-hour collision occurred near the Westbury station, about 30 miles east of Manhattan, setting off fires that terrified passengers before they could escape. The authorities said that at least seven people on the trains were injured; the three people who were killed were in the car."
731,"After the driver of the vehicle went around the gates, an eastbound train pulling out of the station struck the car, according to Phillip Eng, the president of the railroad."
732,"Another train, traveling westbound, then crashed into the vehicle and pushed it down the tracks before the front two cars of the train derailed and collided with the concrete platform."
733,"By late into the night, the westbound train still lay against the Westbury station’s platform, part of which had been knocked over."
734,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
735,"On Wednesday, the L.I.R.R. continued to have extensive delays because of the crash. In an early-morning report, officials said the impact caused “significant damage” to 200 feet of third rail."
736,"The two trains were together carrying about 900 passengers, and some offered a harrowing account of what happened."

801,"“It was like a bad movie,” said Michelle Asprer of Hicksville, N.Y., a passenger in the second-to-last car on the eastbound train. “It was so scary.”"
802,"She said her train stopped after Westbury without explanation. “There was a whole line of cars” at the grade-level crossing where the train stopped, she said."
803,She said she heard a westbound train approaching and “making a funny noise.”
804,"“It hit us,” she said. “It hit the last car” of the eastbound train, she said. “The people from the last car were running up, saying ‘Move up, move up because the last car is on fire.’”"
805,"A passenger on the westbound train, Mike Picarella, 36, was in the back of the train when, around 7:20 p.m., he heard “a little thump.” He said he didn’t think much of it, but seconds later, there was a second, bigger thump, he said."
806,"“You knew something happened,” Mr. Picarella said. “The train stopped.”"
807,"Realizing their train had hit something, the passengers stood up and then looked out the window, where they saw another train. At first many wondered if they had hit it."
808,"But there was a fire raging, too, flames knifing up from underneath the train, halfway up the windows. On the ground below was half of a crumpled vehicle."
809,"Within a minute of stopping, the train started filling up with smoke, Mr. Picarella said, and passengers were quickly moved to the front. Eventually, the doors were opened to let the smoke out, he said, and passengers could then see that a train car had peeled off the tracks."
810,"Mr. Picarella, who is a maintenance manager for New York City Transit, praised the response of local emergency responders and the police, who he said arrived within minutes of the crash, and got people off the train quickly."
811,"Rescuers could not immediately identify the vehicle or its passengers because the car was damaged so severely, said Commissioner Patrick Ryder of the Nassau County Police."

855,By The New York Times
856,Mr. Eng said that the authorities often warned drivers about the dangers of trying to cross ahead of trains.
857,"“You’re not only taking your own life into your hands, but you’re taking the lives of others into your own hands: our engineers, our conductors, our customers and anyone else along the local road. It’s unfortunate,” Mr. Eng said."
858,Mr. Eng added that Wednesday morning service would undoubtedly be affected.
859,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued a statement calling for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the State Police, local law enforcement and the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the crash."
860,"“As we continue to gather information surrounding the incident, my heart goes out to the victims and their loved ones,” Mr. Cuomo said."
861,"Crashes at railroad crossings have occurred with surprising regularity in the New York region over the last decade, federal data show."
862,"At the same time, the number of accidents and fatalities at these crossings has fallen nationally, as grade crossings have been eliminated and safety improvements made, according to safety groups."
863,"In 2015, a crowded Metro-North train passing through Westchester County at the height of the evening rush slammed into a sport utility vehicle on the tracks at a crossing, killing seven people."
864,"The crash in Westbury was the second fatal encounter on the railroad on Tuesday. At about 3:45 p.m., a westbound train struck and killed a pedestrian between the stations in Baldwin and Freeport, said Chris McKniff, a spokesman for the L.I.R.R. That accident caused long delays for commuters who were trying to get home from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan."
865,"Mr. McKniff said service had been restored around 5:45 p.m., about an hour before the crash in Westbury."
866,"I was backing my wife’s car out of our driveway when I realized I wasn’t watching the backup camera, nor was I looking out of the rear window. I was only listening for those “audible proximity alerts” — the high-pitched beeps that my car emits as I approach an object while in reverse. The problem was that my wife’s car, an older model, doesn’t offer such beeps. "
867,"I had become so reliant on this technology that I had stopped paying attention, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences. "
868,"Backup cameras, mandatory on all new cars as of last year, are intended to prevent accidents. Between 2008 and 2011, the percentage of new cars sold with backup cameras doubled, but the backup fatality rate declined by less than a third while backup injuries dropped only 8 percent. "
869,"Perhaps one reason is, as a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put it, “Many drivers are not aware of the limitations” of the technology. The report also found that one in five drivers were just like me — they had become so reliant on the backup aids that they had experienced a collision or near miss while driving other vehicles. "
870,The fact that our brains so easily overdelegate this task to technology makes me worry about the tech industry’s aspirations — the fully autonomous everything. Could technology designed to save us from our lapses in attention actually make us even less attentive?
871,"Uber’s march toward a self-driving car hit a major speed bump last year in Tempe, Ariz., when one of its self-driving Volvos struck and killed a pedestrian. While a lot of focus was on how a vehicle with cameras and radar sensors could completely miss a human being on the road, less has been said about the failure of the most intricately programmed system in the vehicle — the brain of the human in the driver’s seat. "
872,"An investigation revealed that the driver was watching Hulu until the moment of the crash. Because the human brain is impeccable in its ability to filter out extraneous information, this type of behavior should have been predicted. During normal driving, our brains are in a near-constant state of vigilance. But let someone or something do the driving for us and this vigilance easily fades."
873,Something similar seems to have happened with a handful of fatalities involving Tesla’s Autopilot mode. It seems that the drivers made little to no effort to intervene.
874,"The introduction of safety technology has resulted in unintended accidents in other contexts as well. In December 2017, a patient died at a major medical center when a nurse searched for an anti-anxiety medication in an automated dispensing cabinet by typing only its first two letters. She chose the first drug that appeared in the results — Vecuronium, instead of Versed. Vecuronium is a paralytic drug that is sometimes used in executions. When it was administered, the patient’s vitals crashed and she died within days."
875,"Technology seems to have turned against us once again in the deadly crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts. In October, pilots on Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia seem to have struggled against the plane’s supposedly lifesaving technology. Investigators suspect that sensors incorrectly interpreted the plane’s ascent as too steep, causing the plane’s “maneuvering characteristics augmentation system” to kick in. It brought the plane’s nose down, ultimately into the Java Sea at 450 miles per hour. "
876,"Boeing had begun to develop a software fix, but it wasn’t ready in time for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which just this month crashed, possibly because of the same bug, killing all 157 people on board. In these cases, no one can criticize the pilots for failing to pay attention. Still, the crashes were a wake-up call, especially because pilots weren’t required to be trained on the new technology."
877,"Though a supercomputer will always surpass the human brain in terms of pure speed, the brain is beyond complex in its ability to reprioritize salient data inputs from multiple sources. If one input becomes less relevant, our cognitive systems shift their attention to the next most relevant one (which these days is usually our mobile devices)."
878,But there’s one feature available on some cars today that can increase a driver’s vigilance instead of diminishing it — the manual transmission.
879,"A car with a stick shift and clutch pedal requires the use of all four limbs, making it difficult to use a cellphone or eat while driving. Lapses in attention are therefore rare, especially in city driving where a driver might shift gears a hundred times during a trip to the grocery store. "
880,"I’ve owned a stick-shift vehicle for the last 20 years. I bought my first upon graduating from med school — a used 1994 BMW 325i. Years later, my best man wrote “just married” on the back windshield, and the next year my wife and I drove our newborn son home from the hospital in it."
881,"Sadly, sales of manual transmissions are falling, and many automakers, including Audi, are discontinuing the option in the United States. It appears that I’ll have to keep my 2013 S4 model until 2026 if I want to teach my kids to drive a stick."
882,"When I bought that first five-speed BMW, my dad cautioned me about safety, thinking that driving a stick would be more distracting and less safe. He was wrong. Though research on the safety of manual transmissions is scant, one study on the driving performance of teenage boys with A.D.H.D. revealed that cars with manual transmissions resulted in safer, more attentive driving than automatics. This suggests that the cure for our attentional voids might be less technology, not more."

885,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — Shortly before he was fired by the Miami Dolphins, Adam Gase requested a favor from one of his former pupils. He knew he would need some help convincing another team to take a chance on him so quickly after a disappointing three years as head coach of the Dolphins. Fortunately, a powerful voice was willing to intercede: Peyton Manning."
886,"It has been five years since Manning and Gase first joined forces in Denver, setting records and bringing the Broncos to a Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium. But a phone call last week from Manning to the Jets’ chairman and chief executive, Christopher Johnson, went a long way for Gase, who will find himself back at MetLife in a different capacity this fall."
887,"On Monday, at Gase’s introductory news conference as the Jets’ new head coach, Johnson signaled a shift in the organization’s philosophy, which has centered on defense for the past two decades. With Gase, the Jets have finally stepped in line with the league’s curve."
888,"“To paraphrase Wayne Gretzky,” Johnson said, “he’s coaching to where football is going.”"
889,"There was some inherent awkwardness as Gase arrived in front of a packed auditorium filled with team executives, former players, and fans. As coach of the Dolphins, he went 5-1 against the Jets, including two wins this season. And since the deal was announced last week, reports have surfaced indicating that talks had broken down between the Jets and another top candidate, Matt Rhule, over staffing issues, although Johnson denied on Monday that the team intended to dictate any staff hires."
890,"But Gase, 40, underscored his reputation for fieriness and an inimitable work ethic by expressing how eager he was to get back to coaching despite only having been out of a job for a little more than a week."
891,"“I was home for nine days, and I was good,” Gase joked."
892,"He had a pedestrian 23-25 record with Miami, his first head coaching stint, and some players were critical of his style in exit interviews after the season. But the Jets were willing to look at his new situation as a fresh start in several ways."
893,"“We have a young team,” General Manager Mike Maccagnan said. “We have a lot of cap space. We have a lot of roster flexibility — we’re not burdened by a lot of big contracts and older players.”"
894,"These factors, Maccagnan continued, provide “an ability to shift and change a little bit.”"
895,"He added, “We can change the makeup of our team pretty quickly.”"
896,"The Jets have more than $100 million cap space, which Gase acknowledged made them an especially intriguing landing spot. He also said he liked the ability to stay in the A.F.C. East and get another crack at dethroning the New England Patriots."
897,"But Gase said the primary factor in his decision to sign with the team was Sam Darnold, the 21-year-old quarterback who will be entering his second season after showing plenty of promise as a rookie. Gase took Manning to new heights at the end of his career, and he guided Tim Tebow and Jay Cutler as well (he was a bit less successful developing Ryan Tannehill, his quarterback in Miami, though Tannehill missed the entire 2017 season and some of 2018 as well)."
898,But he said he has never worked with a talent like Darnold.
899,"“This is the first time I’ve been able to get with a guy this young, this early in his career,” Gase said. “He’s hungry for knowledge, he wants to be coached. And with a player that does have the physical traits, this is an exciting thing for me to go through.”"
900,"The Jets interviewed Gase early on, but then followed up with a second interview that included Darnold, who chimed in via FaceTime. Johnson had said he would look for a coach that had success grooming young quarterbacks; Gase’s résumé checked out."
901,"Though he was hesitant to reveal many details about who he wants to fill his coaching staff, Gase said that he was considering forgoing hiring a quarterback coach, so as not to fill Darnold’s head with too many voices besides that of his offensive coordinator and Gase himself. (Gase also called the plays in Miami.)"
902,"With Manning, Gase said, it took almost no time to develop a kinship."
903,"“When we met each other, it was really, ‘Who’s going to be the first one to break, who will outwork who?’” Gase said. “He appreciates hard work, and who’s going to go nose-to-nose with him and mentally try to challenge each other. That was something I really enjoyed.”"
904,The Jets are betting that their matchmaker game between Darnold and Gase produces something similar.
905,"“You always want to be forward-looking,” Johnson said. “The game is changing. Adam has shown us that he is part of that change.”"

907,Late-night hosts spent plenty of time on Wednesday attacking President Trump’s nationally televised speech the previous night.
908,"But they also poked fun at Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, who had delivered the Democrats’ rebuttal from behind a single podium, standing joylessly and speaking in a subdued tone. Stephen Colbert called them “Congressional Democratic leaders and direct-to-DVD Addams Family Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi.”"
909,And Trevor Noah slammed their presentation.
910,"“Why are you sharing one podium? Goddamn it, you guys really are socialists. What are you doing? Also why do you look so grouchy? What is this? It looks like the hostess at IHOP just told them there’s no senior discount.” — TREVOR NOAH"
911,"Colbert also discussed the meeting that took place between Trump, Schumer and Pelosi on Wednesday, when they convened to negotiate an end to the government shutdown. Schumer told reporters immediately after the meeting that it had ended abruptly, with Trump storming out soon after it started because Pelosi said she would not support building a border wall."
912,“He slammed the table and walked out! He was so angry he did exercise. That’s not a good sign.” — STEPHEN COLBERT
913,"Kevin Hart dropped by “The Late Show” on Wednesday, and Colbert wasted no time addressing the elephant in the room: Hart’s ouster as the host of this year’s Oscars, over homophobic Twitter posts and jokes he had made."
914,"Ellen DeGeneres went to bat for Hart last week, saying she spoke on his behalf with a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and encouraging Hart to consider re-enlisting as host. But Hart put an end to the speculation on Wednesday morning when he appeared on “Good Morning America” and ruled out changing his mind. (Variety reported on Wednesday that the Oscars would go without a host this year for the first time in almost three decades.)"
915,"When Colbert pressed Hart on the issue, Hart insisted he was “over it” and said he didn’t want to continue addressing the story. “I don’t have anything else left to say,” he said. But he did lament that he would not be able to do the show. “I had some heat,” he said. “I had some real good jokes.” Then he previewed some of the quips, mostly about how uptight the stars in the audience are on Oscars night."
916,Most of the shows had taped too late on Tuesday to analyze Trump’s national address that night. So they got caught up on Wednesday.
917,"“Trump spoke last night about the border, and in his speech Trump criticized Democrats, insulted immigrants and said we need a wall. By the end, anyone playing a Trump drinking game was like, ‘Call an ambulance.’” — JIMMY FALLON"
918,"“The president, as you know, has been very anti-immigrant since the one he’s married to stopped having sex with him.” — JIMMY KIMMEL"
919,"“A team of scientists in Brazil and Ireland have published a paper suggesting ways to genetically modify tomatoes to be spicy. Though, to be fair, people in Ireland already think tomatoes are spicy.” — SETH MEYERS"
920,"“It’s Day 19 of the government shutdown, which means it’s now officially lasted longer than my New Year’s resolution. I got winded and gave up halfway through the Planet Fitness application.” — STEPHEN COLBERT"
921,Jimmy Kimmel invited a T.S.A. agent who’s been working for no pay during the government shutdown onto his show. Then he asked her to help him figure out which of three random pedestrians was high on pot.
922,"Gwenyth Paltrow, virtuoso singer."
923,"Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is high on the list of Democrats thought to be considering a run for president in 2020, will talk to Stephen Colbert on Thursday."

929,"DENVER — The call went up across America: Mother Nature, please have mercy."
930,"A punishing winter that has already produced record snowfalls and crippling temperatures in many areas sent another wave of severe weather blasting across the country over the weekend. Fresh snow buried cars and snarled travel from Denver to St. Louis, and behind the snow came a mass of air so frigid that the National Weather Service declared a wide area of the north central United States to be entering another deep freeze."
931,"The intense cold was expected to spread into the Mid-Atlantic states and the Northeast through Monday, and to stretch into parts of the Deep South by midweek."
932,"Ryan Maue, a meteorologist with weathermodels.com, said much of the country should prepare for an “all-week cold snap.”"
933,"On Sunday, the National Weather Service also warned of severe thunderstorms moving across the South and Southeast. Tornadoes were reported in at least three states, with severe damage and at least 23 fatalities reported in Alabama."
934,"The nation may not be unified about much at the moment, but there seemed to be general agreement about the start that March is getting off to."
935,"“I hate this,” said Abie Olivos, 78, a retired Navy barber in Denver, who spent Sunday morning shoveling his neighbor’s walkway for the fourth or fifth time this season."
936,"“I’m ready for spring, let’s put it that way,” he said as snow fell on his silver pompadour and leather jacket. “I’m ready to go fishing.”"
937,"The snow fell mainly in a broad stripe through the middle of the country, with plunging temperatures in at least a dozen states — more than 30 degrees Fahrenheit below normal in some areas. As much as two feet of fresh snow fell in the Rocky Mountains, and the deep cold stretched as far south as Texas."
938,[The New York metropolitan area braced on Sunday for its own encounter with the winter storm.]
939,"Mr. Maue said the frigid air had come from Western Canada, where pools of Arctic air had been stuck for weeks. The cold air mass made its way down the West Coast and then eastward over the spine of the Rocky Mountains to the nation’s midsection."
940,"Mr. Maue said he understood that many people were experiencing “spring fever angst,” but that they should remember, “it’s still winter.”"
941,"The March mess follows a February full of record-breaking cold and snow in Idaho, Montana, South Dakota and other states. Rapid City, S.D., recorded  subzero temperatures on 20 of the month’s 28 days. The Twin Cities in Minnesota received 39 inches of snow, beating a normal February by more than two feet. As much as 26 feet fell in parts of the Sierra Nevada range in California, and people there started calling the month “Februburied.”"
942,"On Sunday, Joe Skifter, 59, of Minneapolis, said that in some parts of the city, snow was piled so high that pedestrians were practically mountain-climbing to reach the sidewalk, while lethal-looking icicles hung precariously from the eaves of buildings."
943,"“It’s getting difficult to find any place to put the snow,” said Mr. Skifter, the general manager at Open Book, a nonprofit space for people interested in bookmaking and literature."
944,"Patti Tritschler, 57, who leads a commercial interior design firm, was among the air passengers arriving back in Chicago from warmer climes on Sunday, only to find the temperature there dropping again. “Honestly, we haven’t recovered since the polar vortex,” Ms. Tritschler said. “It’s just gone on and on and on.”"
945,Even skiers who were thrilled to see fresh powder struggled with the weather on Sunday.
946,"The storm dropped more than a foot of snow on Colorado’s ski resorts, setting off a stampede of skiers heading into the mountains from Denver. But avalanche dangers, snowy roads and the sheer volume of traffic stretched what is ordinarily a 90-minute drive to three hours or more."
947,"Michal Rosenoer, who on nonpowder days is the executive director of Emerge Colorado, a group that works to elect more Democratic women to public office, said the roads were already jammed when she left home at 5:30 a.m. to drive to the Copper Mountain ski resort. “It’s insane,” she said. “I’ve never seen it like this before.”"
948,"An annual rite of springtime’s approach in Franklin County, Kan., is the local home and garden show. But when Susan Rader, 53, was driving to the show on Sunday, she said, she was nearly blinded by heaps of cascading snow when she happened to emerge from under a highway bridge just as a truck was passing overhead."
949,"The crowd at the garden show was much sparser than usual, Ms. Rader said, with area merchants shut down by the storm and no sign of the food trucks that would usually be on hand."
950,"The day before, she said, the skies over her corner of eastern Kansas were clear, and the mounds of earlier snow had mostly melted."
951,"“We got all this snow, and we’re right back where we started,” she said. “Digging out, putting ice melt down. Wet, muddy, cold. It’s coming in waves. We’re just tired of all the waves of cold. They just don’t stop.”"
952,"Faced with having to slog through yet more of an already exhausting winter, some tried to wring a wry smile from the weather on social media."
953,"“Yay, more snow! Said no one EVER!” the Missouri State Highway Patrol posted on Twitter."
954,"In Wyoming, Minn., where it takes a lot of snow to faze people, the Police Department shared a “Wanted” poster for Mother Nature, faulting her “for a season of general nastiness.”"
955,"The Nebraska State Patrol tried to take it as a test of character. “It’s snowing … Good,” the department wrote on Twitter. “Another chance to get stronger scooping it. Bitter cold? Good. It will make us tougher.”"
956,"And in Dodge City, Kan., where heavy snow and subzero wind chills were forecast, the local National Weather Service office started an informal Twitter poll, asking whether the lengthy winter was welcome or annoying."
957,The early responses weighed heavily against the snow.
958,"As the largest of the four ski areas owned by Aspen Skiing Company, Snowmass has always been the crowd-pleaser in terms of terrain among the portfolio, which includes Aspen Mountain in the town of Aspen, 9 miles away, and, between them, Aspen Highlands and Buttermilk. But Snowmass lacked a central base village that was diverting enough to keep travelers entertained in the area during post-ski-lift hours."
959,"This winter, that has changed with the opening of a $600 million development, the newly expanded Snowmass Base Village, which its developers hope will make Snowmass a destination to rival nearby Aspen."
960,"At over 3,300 acres, Snowmass offers diverse runs, from easy to expert. Slopeside hotels and condominiums tout hassle-free ski-in, ski-out access, which appeals to families. A shop-lined pedestrian street about 500 feet uphill from the express ski lifts has long served as an access point, but often empties out after a few après-ski hours."
961,"“On any given day, about 60 percent of Aspen Skiing Company skiers are at Snowmass,” said Rose Abello, the tourism director for Snowmass Tourism. Because Aspen has more lodgings, she added, “A lot of people head right back. The idea is to get people to stay.”"
962,"The new base village, at the mountain’s ski-lift nexus, is designed to stanch that outbound traffic flow by building a more well-rounded hub for visitors to recreate and socialize. It includes a new hotel, the relatively affordable Limelight Hotel Snowmass with 99 rooms, two large outdoor hot pools and live music in the lounge five nights a week (rooms from $159). A new community center called the Collective Snowmass offers a mix of storytelling sessions, art exhibits and yoga classes. The centerpiece public plaza adds an ice rink, firepits, an indoor climbing wall just inside the Limelight building and a smattering of ski shops and restaurants."
963,"The new village doesn’t stray from Snowmass’s strength as the family-friendlier of the Aspen ski area options. The Limelight lounge off the lobby, for example, has a children’s area with foosball, floor pillows, board books and old-school video games like Pacman, allowing parents to keep an eye on the kids while also listening to live music in the lounge. The free skating rink offers skate rentals from a vintage 1958 Airstream trailer. The five-story climbing wall was designed to mimic some of the climbing routes on Independence Pass in the area."
964,"“It’s realistic to outdoor climbing,” said Sammy Podhurst, a guide at the unaffiliated adventure outfitter Aspen Expeditions Worldwide who tested out the wall a few days after it opened. “It feels like a real crack climbing route,” she added, referring to a difficult route in which climbers jam their hands and feet into rock cracks as they ascend (beginners’ routes are also available)."
965,"The additions expand other on-mountain adventures that were recently added to diversify Snowmass’ non-ski offerings. They include the year-old Breathtaker Alpine Coaster, an elevated roller coaster where sleds whiz up to 28 miles per hour through the pine forest."
966,"Dining options are still limited at Snowmass, though improving. The Crepe Shack by Mawa’s Kitchen, the third of a mini-chain of restaurants run by Mawa and Daniel McQueen, recently opened next to the base village ice rink, offering hearty crepes that are more like sandwich substitutes than knife-and-fork desserts with fillings like chicken and pesto ($12.95) and a few luxe options including smoked salmon and caviar ($120)."
967,"“That’s my American heritage,” said Mawa McQueen, an ebullient native of the Ivory Coast who grew up in France. “I think a crepe is like a taco.”"
968,"The new base village also draws attention to one of its earliest entries, the Viceroy Snowmass resort, home to a full-service spa, the Latin restaurant Toro Kitchen & Lounge from the chef Richard Sandoval and a new ski-up bar adjacent to the Assay Hill run."
969,"Opened in 2009, the luxury hotel remained isolated when the deal to build out the rest of the base village fell victim to the recession. The project changed hands before East West Partners, which had previously built ski villages at Beaver Creek in Colorado and Northstar California Resort at Lake Tahoe, joined KSL Capital and Aspen Skiing Company in taking up the project in December 2016. A few condo buildings remain under construction and the entire project has a more modernist feel — with slanting rooflines and lots of glass — than many Alpine-style villages in the Rockies that tend to copy European chalets."
970,"For those seeking any non-resort-related life in Snowmass, the nonprofit Anderson Ranch Arts Center is just a few minutes’ drive from the base area. Opened in 1966, the 4.5-acre compound offers artist residency programs, self-guided tours and, in summer, over 150 arts classes in mediums including photography, ceramics and wood working. Recent residents have included the filmmaker Steve McQueen and its lecture series last summer featured the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei."
971,"More restaurants yet to come may help keep Snowmass visitors in place. But for now, Aspen is still a compelling neighbor for shopping and night life. Fortunately, free shuttle buses run between the two destinations about every 15 minutes from early morning until after midnight."

973,"MEXICO CITY — There is a minor but crucial character in the film “Roma” who isn’t listed in the credits and appears onscreen only for a fleeting moment. He’s mostly heard, not seen. Yet he makes a deep emotional mark on the movie."
974,"He’s a sweet-potato vendor, a longstanding figure in Mexico City’s populous community of itinerant street salesmen. And all we can hear of him is his signature call, several times throughout the film: a steam whistle that soars to a high-pitched scream and then tapers off, in pitch and volume, until it fades into some kind of mournful death. It may be one of the most doleful sounds I’ve ever heard, evoking longing and sorrow, opportunities squandered, love lost."
975,"“So damn melancholy,” said Alfonso Cuarón, who wrote and directed the critically beloved film. “There’s always a sense of loneliness that goes with that whistle.”"
976,"Cuarón, 57, and I were in an S.U.V. stuck in traffic in Mexico City on a recent morning. Now a resident of London, he was back in the capital for a brief trip to promote his film — an Oscar hopeful that’s up for Golden Globes on Sunday — and he set aside an hour to talk about “Roma” and show me the neighborhood where he grew up, also called Roma."
977,"In the film, the sweet-potato vendor has company: the garbage collector swinging a hand bell; the knife sharpener tooting a pan flute; the honey seller hollering as if calling for a lost dog. These calls are all part of the tumultuous aural landscape of Mexico City, as familiar to the city’s residents today as they were in the 1970s, when the action in “Roma” unfolds."
978,"“Roma,” based on events in Cuarón’s life, is about the relationship between a domestic worker and her employer, a middle-class Mexican family that is coming apart."
979,"But the film is also about a place — Mexico City — at a particular moment in its modern history, and raises important questions about class, race and the aspirations of a developing nation."
980,"Much of the film is shot indoors, especially inside a house that was made to resemble Cuarón’s childhood home in Roma."
981,"But even when the camera moves inside, the sounds of the city follow it. During some of the quietest scenes, the distant roar of traffic and car horns, the barks of dogs and the chorus of street vendors find their way in, as if to remind us that this big burgeoning monster of a city lurks right outside the door, a character in its own right and one demanding respect."
982,I bounce this notion off Cuarón to see if I’m on the right track.
983,"“That was the intention,” he said. “Every city has its own soundscape.”"
984,"The film, he said, was as much about the broader social context as it was about the family at the center of the story."
985,"“The point of departure was to explore personal wounds, family wounds, but also wounds that I shared collectively with the whole country and maybe with humanity,” he said. “The presence of the city, in that sense, is fundamental.”"
986,"The driver turned into Roma. From the cocoon of the S.U.V., the city’s roar had been reduced to a muffled purr."
987,"‘It’s a beautiful neighborhood,” Cuarón said, gesturing to a block of buildings with Art Nouveau and Art Deco touches. “Look at the architecture, man. You have areas where you actually have trees — here in Mexico City!”"
988,"The neighborhood was largely developed in the early 20th century for the city’s elite. Grand villas fronted onto tree-lined boulevards, and the verdant plazas and parks called to mind elegant green spaces in the capitals of Western Europe."
989,"The area’s popularity among the wealthy began to fade around the middle of the 20th century, as many residents moved to increasingly fashionable areas further from the city center or to newly developed suburbs. They were replaced by a middle class — professionals, government bureaucrats, business owners, said Enrique Krauze, a prominent Mexican historian and writer. Crime and other complexities of urban life also became more prevalent."
990,"“In 1970 and 1971, the years that Cuarón recreates in ‘Roma,’ the neighborhood was a laboratory of real, not idealized, coexistence, with its prestigious schools and its cabarets and brothels,” Mr. Krauze wrote in a recent essay about the social and cultural significance of “Roma.”"
991,"Cuarón lived on a quiet side street in the area known as Roma Sur, or South Roma. When he was young, Roma Sur was less affluent and more run-down than the northern half of the neighborhood, Roma Norte."
992,People would disparage his area by calling it “Roña” — meaning “scab.”
993,"I told him I lived in Roma Norte. “The right side of the tracks,” he said with perhaps a tinge of sarcasm."
994,"Roma was hit hard by the devastating earthquake in 1985, which accelerated the flight of the affluent and the disintegration of the neighborhood. In the past decade, however, Roma has rebounded and has become a vortex of the bourgeois and hip once again, supporting a thriving cafe society, art galleries, boutiques, restaurants and bars. In this renaissance, the lines of distinction between Roma Norte and Roma Sur have blurred, though not completely."
995,"“I think Roma Sur is still edgier,” Cuarón said, adding that he appreciated how Roma Sur still supported many mom-and-pop businesses and tradesmen’s workshops — some of the same textures he remembered from his childhood."
996,"We parked just off Insurgentes Avenue, a major thoroughfare that separates Roma Sur from the adjoining neighborhood of Condesa. The S.U.V.’s doors swung open to a chaotic soundscape: vendors and traffic. We made our way down the sidewalk, cluttered with merchants hawking cellphone cases and cheap jewelry, candy and glasses, manicures and shoeshines."
997,"Cuarón stopped at the intersection of Insurgentes Avenue and Baja California Avenue, a free-for-all of pedestrians and vehicles, public transportation and vendors."
998,"A replica of the intersection — made to look as it did in the early 1970s — appears in the film when the lead character, the housekeeper, Cleo, runs after the children. But the intersection is quieter and more orderly onscreen, which is how Cuarón remembers it."
999,"In his youth, he said, it was a place resonating with aspiration; he reflects that spirit in his choice of businesses to include in the movie, like a travel agency and a veterinarian’s office."
1000,"“It was probably more expensive to take your dog there than taking your children to the hospital,” Cuarón said, his voice rising to nearly a shout amid the din. “When you came here, it was the dream of cosmopolitanism and modernity that Mexico started living in that period.”"
1001,"Now, however, it was urban tumult with no guiding principle. There were convenience stores and nail salons, nondescript office buildings and clothing shops."
1002,"“Commotion and stuff,” the director said, looking around. His mind turned toward the past again: “There was almost this excitement of arriving to a place of sophistication, of modernity, you know?”"
1003,"We make our way back to the car, once again slaloming through the dense crowds of pedestrians and vendors on the sidewalk of Insurgentes."
1004,"We pass advertisements for “Roma” posted on a nearby bus stop. The film has been extremely well-received in Mexico by critics and the public alike. At a newsstand, Cuarón spots a photo of Yalitza Aparicio, who plays Cleo, on the cover of a Mexican magazine."
1005,"“I’m so happy about that,” he said, gesturing toward the photo. Aparicio’s magazine images  here have spurred debates about the underrepresentation of indigenous Mexicans in popular culture and advertising and about, more broadly, deep-seated racism and classism in Mexico."
1006,"“I’m happy that it’s now coming up and being discussed,” he said."
1007,"Back in the car, he pointed his driver toward Tepeji Street, where he grew up, a few blocks away. It’s a narrow, residential side street of mostly modest two-story homes."
1008,"Cuarón bemoaned the kinds of changes that homeowners in the 1960s and 1970s started making, covering up some of the very details that gave the neighborhood’s architecture its charm."
1009,"“When they had a little bit of money, people would start modernizing their houses because they wanted to belong” to the new era, he recalled."
1010,"“You see those windows with aluminum?” he continued, pointing to one house. “They were supposed to be modern. Look at those doors” — he pointed to another house — “horrible doors. Or putting in all those tiles over there, covering what had been beautiful.”"
1011,"Cuarón and his production team were meticulous in their re-creation of how things were — and how he remembered them to be. They had hoped to shoot in as many original locations as possible and were able to do that in some cases — including the re-creation of the Corpus Christi massacre, when security forces attacked students during a march in 1971."
1012,"But in other cases, the original locations had been so radically changed, sometimes as a result of rebuilding after the 1985 earthquake, that they were forced to create locations from scratch."
1013,"This process began with long conversations between Cuarón and the film’s production designer, Eugenio Caballero, who also grew up in Roma. They supplemented these talks with extensive archival research."
1014,They built from scratch a replica of two blocks of Insurgentes Avenue and also adapted it for a scene meant to recall Baja California Avenue. And they recreated parts of a hospital.
1015,But their most exacting attention to detail was brought to bear on the re-creation of Cuarón’s childhood house. The original house — 21 Tepeji Street — had undergone so many changes that it was unusable for the production.
1016,"Instead, they adapted the facade of a house across the street for the exterior scenes on Tepeji Street. They adapted a second location for the rooftop shots. And for the patio and interior views, they took another house, which was slated for demolition, and essentially remodeled it to replicate Cuarón’s family home, with attention paid to the smallest details: They hired an artisan to make reproductions of the original tiles, using techniques from the early 20th century."
1017,"I asked Cuarón why he had been so obsessive in recreating every last detail of even his house, when very few people would have known the difference. He replied flatly: “I would know.”"
1018,"Mexico City, he said, is a place in constant tension between what it is and what it was."
1019,"“For me, it’s a place filled with past,” he said wistfully."
1020,"A cleaning woman was sweeping the street and sidewalk in front of the house next to his childhood home, the bristles of her broom scraping the concrete. “That’s another sound,” Cuarón said excitedly. “We have it in the film.”"
1021,Then the woman took a pail of water and started splashing the sidewalk and the facade of the house.
1022,"“That sound!” he exclaimed, his eyes lighting up. The film opens with Cleo scrubbing the family’s driveway using water and a broom, and Cuarón seemed pleased — perhaps even reassured — by this intersection of life imitating art imitating life."
1023,"For all that had changed, there were at least some things that remained as he remembered them."
1024,"Roger J. Stone Jr. set foot on the stage — sorry, the floor of the federal court in Washington — on Friday for his scheduling hearing in a somber pinstriped ocean-dark suit, matching dark tie, pristine white shirt and muted pocket handkerchief, bringing to a temporary close the latest installment of what may become one of the most-watched spinoffs of the reality show known as “The Trump Administration.”"
1025,"It was a veritable replay of what Mr. Stone, the political operative and former Trump adviser, chose to wear for his earlier court appearance, on Tuesday (a single-breasted three-button navy suit, pure white shirt with a Windsor collar, white pocket handkerchief and marine blue knit tie). "
1026,"That itself was a more formal version of the navy polo shirt with white polo pony and dark jeans Mr. Stone had worn last Friday, when he was arrested on seven counts of obstruction, witness tampering and making false statements. He appeared after the indictment with both arms raised in a Nixonian victory sign."
1027,Why do such costumes matter?
1028,Because Mr. Stone has long treated — and referred to — his wardrobe as exactly that: a key part of the theater of his life in politics. 
1029,"This is, after all, a man who wore full morning dress to the 2017 inauguration; who is famous for his penchant for bespoke double-breasted suits from Savile Row or Alan Flusser (a tailor known for his master-of-the-universe clients); who once joked that he had more shoes than Imelda Marcos; and who called himself a “showman” in his 2018 book, “Stone’s Rules: How to Win at Politics, Business, and Style.” Someone who believes fully in the power of clothing as communications tool, and is comfortable admitting it. Crowing about it, even."
1030,"And because in court, defendants generally don’t talk. Their lawyers, their demeanor and their clothes talk for them. Given that Judge Amy Berman Jackson is still considering a gag order preventing Mr. Stone (who spent his time between hearings giving news conferences and making appearances) from discussing his case publicly, it’s possible that at some point he won’t be able to speak out of court either. Which puts an even greater burden on what he wears to start emoting in his place."
1031,"So what does it mean that Mr. Stone, who runs a best- and worst-dressed list of his own, has suddenly adopted a sartorial stance of relative (on the Stone spectrum) understatement?"
1032,"First, that nothing he is wearing was chosen by accident, not even the polo and jeans. After all, he well understands that, as he wrote in “Stone’s Rules”: “An impression is made based on how you are dressed. It’s how you present yourself, how the world sees you.” (Of the 140 rules in the book, 54 are overtly about clothes.)"
1033,"Just as he presumably understands that if ever a president cared about how costumes play, it is Mr. Trump (generals! straight from central casting!). Who in a recent interview with The New York Times happened to refer to Mr. Stone as a “character.” "
1034,"And that Mr. Stone well understands that the president — someone who does not like his deputies to steal his spotlight, holds the power of the small screen dear and has the power of the pardon — will be watching."
1035,"In which case, No. 30 of “Stone’s Rules” comes into play: “A well-cut dark blue suit is required for any public performance where credibility and authority are key.” Probably the current situation qualifies."
1036,"Indeed, not long after his Tuesday court visit, Mr. Stone appeared in a somewhat surprising video posted on the YouTube channel of the Daily Caller, the conservative website co-founded by Tucker Carlson where he also has a fashion column (Stone on Style), in which he announced, “You have to think long and hard about what you’re going to wear before your arraignment.” He talked everyone through the choices he made, including cuff links, pocket square and underwear (the latter perhaps falling into the category of too much information)."
1037,"He went so far as to reveal in that video that he chose not to wear one of his many made-to-measure double-breasted suits (he is partial to pinstripes and plaid) because they were “a little too wealthy looking and I am dirt poor at this point, having been destroyed financially by a two-year inquisition by Robert Mueller.” "
1038,"Then he told everyone that the three-button suit he did go for was 30 years old. And while he acknowledged the potential foppish touch of the pocket hankie, he called the one he picked “pedestrian,” perhaps to lessen the effect."
1039,"The theory has some merit. If one is trying to communicate truthfulness and transparency, as Mr. Stone’s previous statements would suggest is his aim, then he is correct in saying that dressing in the clothes of the skyscraper set — the kind that suggest bourbon in cut crystal glasses on the way to a private plane with butter-soft leather seats — is probably not the way to start. "
1040,"On the other hand, the navy-and-white combo he has adopted as a quasi uniform, which in color theory has associations with true blue loyalty and innocence, tells a different story. And, in wearing what he has written about, arguably, he is demonstrating the courage of his convictions. "
1041,"Still, by Friday Mr. Stone seemed to have changed his mind about the single- versus double-breasted idea. Perhaps because he has also admitted that his double-breasted suits are his “armor,” and right now he needs as much of that as he can get."
1042,"Last week, a large group of striking factory workers, United Electrical Workers union officials and community members gathered in the freezing temperatures in Wilmerding, Pa., across the railroad tracks from the Wabtec Corporation, holding signs denouncing corporate greed and announcing support for the union. As a train passed by, it blew its whistle repeatedly in support of the protest. "
1043,"Strikes have made a resurgence in the past year, with more workers striking in 2018 than at any time in over 30 years. But most of these workers were teachers and health care professionals. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects data on all work stoppages involving 1,000 or more workers, the strike in Wilmerding, near Pittsburgh, was the largest manufacturing strike of the Trump presidency. It was in support of 1,700 union workers at a 100-year-old locomotive factory in Erie who went on strike a week earlier, when Wabtec acquired the factory from General Electric and immediately demanded severe concessions from the workers. Bringing back “good paying” manufacturing jobs in the Midwest was a linchpin of President Trump’s 2016 campaign and is already a talking point of the 2020 election."
1044,"The fight between the Erie workers and Wabtec shows that despite our collective popular imagination about American manufacturing jobs, the current reality and the future of a promise of “good-paying work” are quite different."
1045,"The strike is making the argument that if wages are drastically cut, the blow will be not only to Erie but to the future of manufacturing in America. Without strong unions and the decent wages they fight for, factories will not be able to find the millions of skilled workers they need to maintain the momentum of the American manufacturing resurgence."
1046,"Wabtec is willing to keep the existing workers at the current average of $35 per hour — a modest income that would allow someone to support a family — but wants to create a second pay tier for new workers, with wages of $16.75 to $25 per hour. That two-tier trend has led the average production worker to now earn less than the average American worker (right where Wabtec hopes to put its future Erie work force). Manufacturing wages have grown at just 1.4 percent per year, nearly half the rate of an average American worker, and less than the cost of living. While manufacturing workers, many of whom don’t have four-year college degrees, still earn 13 percent more than they would at a job in, for example, the retail sector, that wage premium has eroded since the 1980s by one-fourth."
1047,"These wage cuts and two-tier contracts were common after the Great Recession in 2007, but we are in the midst of strong economic growth. Wabtec made $256 million profit through the third quarter of 2018, and its chief executive and a handful of top executives are receiving almost $60 million in salary. The company’s position is that it is demanding lower wages because it can, a fact that was evident in a Wabtec spokeswoman’s explanation that the company’s current pay scale “is exceptional for that region.” It is perhaps no coincidence that when the merger is complete, the C.E.O. will get a roughly $16 million bonus — almost the exact amount of the likely impact of the proposed wage reductions for the workers."
1048,"By proposing to lower future workers’ pay, companies like Wabtec may halt a broader manufacturing resurgence. Deloitte just predicted that manufacturing companies may be short 2.4 million skilled workers over the next 10 years, in large part because nearly 2.7 million retirements are expected in one of the nation’s oldest work forces. "
1049,"When it comes to young people, manufacturers already have to overcome an outdated idea that today’s factories, which are actually high-tech, remain dirty and dangerous. It’s hard to imagine industrial companies recruiting a new generation into manufacturing at the pedestrian and downward-trending pay sought by Wabtec. Unable to consistently recruit workers to the industry because of low pay, factories now rely on temporary staffing agencies to recruit workers for less-skilled front-line jobs and hold on to their most skilled workers well into their 60s."
1050,It’s a formula that won’t work much longer. The unions are offering Wabtec and the rest of manufacturing a different and more promising path: Rebuild the wage premium in manufacturing as a way to retain and attract the next generation of skilled manufacturing workers.
1051,"In fact, after threatening multiple times to close the Erie facility and move remaining work to Texas, the growing freight train business has spurred enough orders at Wabtec that executives are demanding mandatory overtime from the union. What Wabtec and similar companies need to realize is that, in the past decade, the economics of manufacturing have changed. Workers are in a position to demand a greater share of a company’s success. Employment in the industry has surged, adding more jobs in 2018 than in any year in the previous three decades. Major manufacturers like Caterpillar have earned record profits, and companies have brought back to the United States a record 300,000 manufacturing jobs from overseas in the past two years, after realizing hidden costs of transportation and poor quality. "
1052,"America’s competitive advantage in manufacturing — compared with low-wage nations like Mexico and in Asia — lies in highly value added and increasingly high-tech manufacturing like transportation equipment (i.e., planes, trains and automobiles). These jobs pay among the best ($62,400) in the sector and have grown by 32 percent since 2010. In contrast, nondurable manufacturing, like food, textile and paper manufacturing, is growing the slowest (just 7 percent since 2010) and pays far less ($43,500 per year)."
1053,"Soon after the Wilmerding rally, the union announced that it had reached a short-term agreement with the company, where the workers would return to work under the old contract for 90 days. This was a win for workers, but it may be just a short-term reprieve."
1054,"The test will be whether the workers can preserve good-paying jobs for the next generation. Antwon Gibson, the president of the U.E. Local 610 in Wilmerding and a Wabtec maintenance technician, said that the last time the union had a wage strike at G.E. was almost 50 years ago. That strike, and similar ones in the 1930s, were the foundation for decades of well-paid jobs and highly productive manufacturing — the kind that we hope for in 21st-century manufacturing."

1058,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1059,Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.
1060,"It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery."
1061,"The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning."
1062,"New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic."
1063,The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.
1064,"Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees."
1065,"Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks."
1066,"His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit."
1067,Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.
1068,"State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely."
1069,"Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond."
1070,"Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere."
1071,"Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone."
1072,But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.
1073,"After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing."
1074,"Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”"
1075,"Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing."
1076,"The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels."
1077,"Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later."
1078,"“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”"
1079,"One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates."
1080,"London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution."
1081,"Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h."
1082,"Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone."
1083,"In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home."
1084,"But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted."
1085,"And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars."
1086,Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.
1087,"Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians."
1088,"Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic."
1089,"“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”"
1090,"It’s Women’s History Month! You’re reading In Her Words, where women rule the headlines. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com."
1091,“History isn’t what happened. It’s who tells the story.” 
1092,"— Sally Roesch Wagner, a women's studies scholar and author"
1093,"In her new book, “The Women’s Suffrage Movement,” the historian Sally Roesch Wagner aims to finally give a voice to the women history forgot. “History isn’t what happened,” she told me this week. “It’s who tells the story.”"
1094,"Dr. Wagner, one of the first Americans to receive a doctorate in women’s studies, has spent decades studying these untold stories across cultures. On the first day of Women’s History Month, I asked her to help me debunk some of the persistent myths. Here’s what I learned."
1095,______
1096,"MYTH: American women’s rights began with the right to vote, granted in 1920."
1097,"REALITY: Native American women have had political power for 1,000 years."
1098,"It’s easy to view American women’s history through the lens of the suffragists, who fought for the right to vote. But the truth is, Native American women had their own political systems long before — systems that still exist. "
1099,"“The idea that we’re so progressive because we got the vote 100 years ago — Native women look at that like, ‘Hm, well,’” said Wagner, who wrote the book “Sisters in Spirit,” about Iroquois women’s influence on early American feminists. "
1100,"In fact, in some Native American nations, like the six Iroquois, the elder matriarch is responsible for appointing the chief, holding him to certain standards and removing him if he fails to measure up, Wagner said."
1101,______
1102,MYTH: Contraception is a modern convention.
1103,"REALITY: Condoms, diaphragms and the sponge have been around since the 1800s."
1104,"The birth control pill may have not come on the market until 1960, but a variety of effective contraception methods were available to both women and men in the United States well before 1850, Wagner said."
1105,"It was the Comstock Act, passed in 1873, that changed everything — allowing Anthony Comstock, a conservative Christian who proposed the legislation, to determine what was considered “obscene” in the country. “He decided that anything to do with sex or reproduction was obscene,” Wagner said. "
1106,"As a result, hundreds of people were arrested and imprisoned under the Comstock Act for distributing or possessing contraception, or publishing information about it. The activist Ida Craddock was among them, arrested for distributing such information. She took her own life shortly before her sentencing, which she believed would be life imprisonment. "
1107,"In her suicide note, she wrote: “I earnestly hope that the American public will awaken to a sense of the danger which threatens it from Comstockism.”"
1108,______
1109,MYTH: Feminists burned bras.
1110,REALITY: No bras were burned! Seriously.
1111,"The myth emerged on a hot summer day in 1969, when feminists gathered on the boardwalk of the Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, N.J., to protest the competition. "
1112,"They had planned to burn their bras, but they couldn’t get the permits — so instead they threw their bras, girdles, curling irons and other “instruments of female torture,” into a giant trash can labeled “freedom.” Ahead of the protest, The New York Post reported that bras were to be burned. (Read more about that protest here.) "
1113,"Ultimately, the myth has been used to vilify and pigeonhole feminists ever since, Wagner said."
1114,"Want to hear more from Dr. Wagner? She’ll be in conversation with Gloria Steinem, the Mohawk Bear clan mother Louise Herne and the New York Times gender editor Jessica Bennett in New York on International Women’s Day, March 8. Tickets are still available."

1127,"For women’s history month, we’re highlighting stories of trailblazing women you may not know, but should. For daily posts, see our Instagram."
1128,"Known by some newspapers as “America’s most celebrated pedestrian,” Emma Gatewood was the first woman to hike the Appalachian Trail by herself in one season — as a great-grandmother, at the age of 67. "
1129,"By the time Gatewood died at the age of 85, in 1973, she had hiked the length of the trail three times — the third time in sections — and was the first person, man or woman, to conquer it more than once. "
1130,"What the public did not know was equally remarkable. Grandma Gatewood, as she was called, had survived 30 years of severe beatings and sexual abuse by her husband. She often escaped from him by running into the woods, and she came to view the wilderness as protective and restorative. Read more about her here."

1134,"For as long as I can remember growing up in Puerto Rico, El Morro, the indestructible fort with the endless lawns at the entrance to San Juan harbor, was where you went to fly a kite. And on a recent sunny afternoon, just as expected, a couple and their young son were there trying to catch an updraft to loft a plastic butterfly with a long blue tail into the sky. "
1135,"On Fortaleza Street, an art installation of colorful umbrellas hovered above pedestrians, triggering countless selfies. A short ferry ride away from the old city, at the Bacardí rum distillery in the town of Cataño, visitors sipped cocktails in an open-air pavilion with a roof shaped like a bat in flight."
1136,"But as Puerto Rico tries to come back as a premier Caribbean destination after the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria in Sept. 2017, just a short drive from the pricey beachfront hotels, hundreds of residents are still living under leaky tarps, their poverty on display in glaring bright blue. "
1137,"The tourists celebrating birthdays would not know that the coffee farms will take years to recover — and the red mangrove forests decades — or that commercial fishermen in the town of Luquillo still can’t get their usual haul of lobster, octopus and conch. After the Juan Martín River jumped its banks during the hurricane and took over the dirt road to the beach, the fishermen said, access is so difficult that they need to car pool on four-wheel drive vehicles or they can’t fish as much."
1138,Why should tourists worry about any of this? Isn’t a Caribbean vacation by definition an escape from life’s troubles?
1139,"But in the juxtaposition of its two worlds, the tropical paradise versus the struggling island, Puerto Rico is representative of the many fragile places around the globe right now: The islands facing a future of sea level rise and extreme weather. The arctic spots where winter itself is under threat. The cities where a combination of climate change and bad planning has resulted in devastation."
1140,"That is why Puerto Rico earned the No. 1 spot on our annual list of 52 Places to visit in the coming year. The island, and the other beautiful destinations now at risk raise an urgent question: Do we owe something to the places that make us happy?"
1141,"“This is the new normal and people have to look at this new normal and embrace it,” said Martha Honey, executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel in Washington, D.C."
1142,"The trend in travel has skewed in recent years toward more awareness and sensitivity — eco-tourism, voluntourism, agritourism, the idea that as visitors we should not cause harm and should seek out authentic experiences that get us deep into the local culture. Perhaps it would not be such a stretch to redefine the relationship between leisure travelers and their dream destinations."
1143,"Traveling more consciously is not such a heavy lift, experts like Ms. Honey said. A baby step would be to take account of the realities of the place and then incorporate them into itineraries and more targeted spending — get out of the resort, patronize local businesses, reward hotels set back from the ocean with a stay."
1144,"If tourists did what Puerto Ricans like me do when they sightsee, they would eat roasted whole pig (“lechón asado”) in Guavate south of San Juan or seafood in the southern town of Salinas or bar-hop in the mountains among roadside restaurants and food shacks (“chinchorreo”). "
1145,"Many will find that this new way of travel can lead to better vacations because it helps build a connection to the place, Ms. Honey said."
1146,"Tour operators say that those traveling this winter to Puerto Rico and other islands damaged by Hurricane Maria tend to be “repeats and loyalists” going back to what they already love. After a temporary drop, said Jack Richards, president and CEO of Pleasant Holidays in Los Angeles, which handles travel to 23 islands in the Caribbean, bookings started picking up last June and “Caribbean tourism is back with a vengeance now.”"
1147,"“Everybody understands that the best way to help Puerto Rico is to book there and help the local economy,” he said."
1148,"Organizations that help tourists combine sightseeing with volunteer work, such as Para La Naturaleza, a nonprofit that works on reforestation, are reporting higher demand. There are now more opportunities to help. Having survived the worst of the hurricane largely on their own as the government’s response faltered, residents’ self-reliance or “auto-gestión” efforts have kicked into high gear, with many communities organizing and welcoming help to install solar lights, plant native trees, clear trails and launch rebuilding projects."
1149,"But just venturing out of San Juan to spread tourism revenue around can be enough. Puerto Rico’s recently formed destination marketing organization, Discover Puerto Rico, is steering attention to more far-flung attractions because, officials said, about 77,000 tourism jobs depend on it."
1150,"Another group, the Coalition for the Northeast Ecological Corridor, is working on plans for a new trail that would link “El Yunque,” the inland tropical rain forest, to the coast between the towns of Luquillo and Fajardo. Cristóbal Jiménez, the group’s president, said the corridor was poised to become a major eco-tourism draw — it is home to prime nesting grounds for the endangered leatherback sea turtle and to more than 800 plant and animal species."

1153,"ISTANBUL — The skeleton of a large new mosque has risen up on the west side of Istanbul’s Taksim Square in the last year, dwarfing the monument to the secular Turkish republic’s founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, and commanding the public space."
1154,"And as the mosque was going up, a beloved symbol of the Ataturk era, Istanbul’s opera house, was demolished."
1155,Few Turks oppose the mosque — although some question its size and derivative Ottoman design — but the symbolism of a house of worship dominating the monuments of Ataturk’s secular republic is not lost on Istanbul residents.
1156,"“It is completely changing the topography and design of the square,” said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “It is highly symbolic of Erdogan’s reign taking over Turkey’s republic.”"
1157,Erecting a mosque in the square has been a goal of several governments since the 1950s. But the latest effort is part of a government push being steered by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to develop the square in a way that proclaims the city’s Islamic faith and glorifies its Ottoman past.
1158,An earlier plan backed by Mr. Erdogan when he was mayor of Istanbul was thwarted by a military intervention in 1997 that removed the country’s Islamist government in Ankara.
1159,"Now, with few checks on his power as president, Mr. Erdogan’s plan to remake the square according to his vision is becoming reality."
1160,"“He wants to shape Taksim in his own image,” Mr. Cagaptay said."
1161,"In addition to fulfilling a promise to his pious base, Mr. Erdogan has other incentives to alter the fabric of this essential patch of Istanbul."
1162,"While Istanbul’s fabled skyline of domes and minarets may be its global signature, Taksim Square is the popular center of city life and a symbol of the modern republic founded nearly 100 years ago."
1163,"Throngs of shoppers, commuters, tourists and partygoers pour through the square, day and night, and into the adjacent Independence Avenue, Istanbul’s main shopping street."
1164,"The primary gathering point in the square to meet up with friends is the monument to Ataturk, who is depicted leading supporters to victory in the fight to establish modern Turkey after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire."
1165,"The defining moment in Taksim Square’s recent history came in 2013, when it was the site of large and violent protests against Mr. Erdogan, who was then prime minister."

1180,"Environmentalists, students, artists and democracy activists staged a weekslong sit-in in Gezi Park, the raised gardens that cover the square’s north side. Their aim was to block Mr. Erdogan’s plan to build a shopping mall designed like the Ottoman-era barracks that once occupied the park."
1181,"Furious and threatened by the popular challenge, Mr. Erdogan dispersed the protest with police forces and tear gas. Dozens were arrested and two people died in Istanbul, and another six, including a policeman, were killed in simultaneous protests around the country."
1182,"The park was left to decline. Police occupied one corner, breaking the marble flagstones with their anti-riot vehicles and setting up barricades to prevent further gatherings."
1183,"Mr. Erdogan had crushed his opponents but development of the square was put on hold, at least for a time."
1184,"Taksim Square, named after a Byzantine cistern wall, has had many lives. It once marked the edge of the city, and its surrounding districts were populated by non-Muslim communities of Greeks, Armenians and Jews. An Orthodox church still stands on the southern corner, and Gezi Park was once an Armenian cemetery."
1185,"Under Mr. Ataturk’s republic, the square became the center of modern Istanbul."
1186,"“Taksim is a symbol of progress, labor and modernism,” said Mucella Yapici, secretary of Taksim Solidarity, a group that campaigns to guard the square’s protected status."
1187,"Older denizens of the square complain of the gentrification and commercialization that have come with its popularity. Cafes and tourist hotels have taken over, pushing out the neighborhood artisans, and their carpentry and leather workshops."
1188,"People dressed smartly to come to the square in the old days, said Sevim Isbilir, 70, sitting on a bench in the square as she waited for a friend."
1189,"“We would wear suits,” she said. “We would see famous artists and beautiful shops.”"
1190,"Making the square pedestrian in 2012 helped expand its appeal, but it lost something of its soul under the wide expanse of concrete, longtime vendors complained."
1191,"“There was a tram and electric buses and booths selling food,” said Gulzade Yorgun, who said she has been selling flowers on the square for 43 years. “The old version was more beautiful.”"
1192,"While the 2013 protests paused his plans, Mr. Erdogan — whose legacy has been one of ambitious construction projects — did not give up on his ideas for Taksim."
1193,"In February 2017, he pushed ahead with building the mosque, calculating that no one would protest a site for worship."
1194,"Then in May of last year, as the mosque took shape, Mr. Erdogan ordered the razing of the Ataturk Cultural Center, an acclaimed Modernist building and one of the city’s favorite institutions, where generations of Turks attended concerts, operas and theater productions."
1195,"A symbol of the republic’s openness to Western values, the cultural center had been closed since 2008, for refurbishment, according to the government, but it never reopened."
1196,"Mr. Erdogan, who comes from a working class, religiously conservative background, has never hidden that he has little appreciation for the arts. It did not help the building’s fate that the Gezi protesters had adopted the place as their own and hung banners across the facade of the building."
1197,"After the Gezi protests, it became a temporary police station. Stripped bare by construction firms that had been contracted to strengthen it, the building was eventually declared derelict."
1198,"“It was a fabulous building,” Ms. Yapici, of Taksim Solidarity, said sadly. “When the lights were on when an opera was playing, it came alive with the square.”"
1199,"Even as he oversaw the destruction of the original building, Mr. Erdogan, in an apparent nod to secular society, announced plans to rebuild the center, promising a grander multipurpose complex and assigning Murat Tabanlioglu, the son of the original architect, to design the new building."
1200,Some saw his actions as an effort to woo liberal voters in both last year’s presidential content and critical municipal elections later this month.
1201,"Perhaps most controversially, Mr. Erdogan has said he would go ahead with his plan to rebuild the Ottoman-era barracks in the park, the very project that had set off the unrest in 2013."
1202,"Opponents of Mr. Erdogan’s urban transformation see him as determined to push through his original commercial project. “They want to privatize that square,” Ms. Yapici said."
1203,"She is among 16 trade unionists, artists and activists who have been charged recently for participation in the protests six years ago. Accused of trying to overthrow the government and destroying property, they face life sentences if convicted."
1204,The trial will open in June.
1205,"In a recent statement, Taksim Solidarity denounced the indictment of the 16 as a smear campaign against the protests."
1206,"“If democracy is to come to this country one day, it will draw power from Gezi’s egalitarian, libertarian and peaceful togetherness,” the statement said. “You may put millions of people on trial, but you will never destroy the truth.”"
1207,"David Forden, an American intelligence officer who helped a highly placed Polish colonel deliver vital secrets for eight years during the Cold War, including advance warnings that may have helped prevent a Soviet invasion of Poland, died on Feb. 12 in Alexandria, Va. He was 88."
1208,"The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, his daughter Sara Gay Forden said."
1209,"Mr. Forden was a Polish-speaking former Warsaw station chief for the C.I.A. who had returned to the agency’s headquarters in Langley, Va., when, from 1973 to 1981, he oversaw the flow of Warsaw Pact military secrets conveyed by Ryszard Kuklinski, a colonel on the Polish Army’s general staff and a liaison with Moscow."
1210,"Colonel Kuklinski gave Washington a heads-up that the Soviets were poised to invade Poland, as they had invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968, if the Poles failed to squelch growing dissent. President Jimmy Carter publicly warned them not to and mustered diplomatic pressure."
1211,"In December 1981, Colonel Kuklinski warned the United States that the Polish government was about to impose martial law to crush Solidarity, the grass-roots dissident movement. The warning enabled Washington to better assess the implications of military maneuvers in and around Poland."
1212,"“Thanks to Kuklinski, we had the information and insight to know the difference between military exercises and warfaring escalation,” Mr. Forden said last year in a statement prepared for a memorial in Poland for Colonel Kuklinski, who died in 2004."
1213,"American officials did not tell Solidarity about the forthcoming crackdown, fearing that doing so would expose the leak. That happened anyway."
1214,"Mr. Forden, who was chief of the Soviet-Eastern European division at Langley, met Colonel Kuklinski when the officer left Poland for summer sailing missions that were disguised as vacations (his code name was Gull) in Northern Europe."
1215,"Along with 40,000 pages of what the agency called “highly classified Soviet documentary intelligence” that the colonel dispatched, Mr. Forden and Colonel Kuklinski also conducted a personal correspondence to maintain the colonel’s morale during his solo mission behind the Iron Curtain."
1216,"“Perhaps one day, God willing,” he wrote in 1974 under his code name, Daniel, “we and our families can all know each other.”"
1217,"“You should know,” Colonel Kuklinski replied, “that in my personal thoughts, you are often my conversation partner.”"
1218,"Mr. Forden said later, “I wanted to be sure that Kuklinski knew we saw him as a courageous human being.”"
1219,"Once the Poles suspected a leak, the colonel was smuggled out of Warsaw in late 1981 with his family and given a new identity in the United States. He later retired to Florida, where he and Mr. Forden became neighbors, and died in Tampa at 73."
1220,"Colonel Kuklinski always viewed himself as a peacekeeper and not as a spy, and saw his mission as a patriotic payback to the Soviets for subjugating Poland."
1221,"“Long before I met him, Kuklinski had already decided that Poland deserved to be a free state and that there was only one country that could help achieve that goal: the United States,” Mr. Forden said in his statement last year. “We didn’t recruit him — he recruited us.”"
1222,"After the colonel escaped in 1981, he was sentenced to death in absentia by a military court. That judgment was lifted only in the mid-1990s, when Poland sought admission to NATO."
1223,"David Warner Forden was born on Sept. 11, 1930, in Buffalo to William and Amy (Adams) Forden. His mother was a homemaker; his father, who was known as Ted, was an office clerk in a boiler factory who was laid off during the Depression and survived on New Deal government jobs."
1224,David won a scholarship to Wesleyan University in Connecticut and graduated in 1952 with a bachelor’s degree in government. He earned a master’s in public administration from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University.
1225,"Mr. Forden “was an improbable spy,” Benjamin Weiser, a New York Times reporter, wrote in a book about the Kuklinski case, “A Secret Life: The Polish Officer, His Covert Mission, and The Price He Paid to Save His Country” (2004). “He often wondered how he had ended up working for the C.I.A.”"
1226,"In retrospect, the answer was easy."
1227,"He wanted to work for the government because government jobs had bailed out his family during the Depression. In 1953, Mr. Forden and several fellow students went to Washington for job interviews, only to find that the Central Intelligence Agency, to their knowledge, was the only government arm seeking recruits."
1228,"Mr. Forden was interviewed and invited back for a follow-up. One of his roommates, Peter Falk, was not. He became an actor instead."
1229,"In 1955, Mr. Forden married Sally Carson; they divorced in 1983. In addition to his daughter Sara, he is survived by another daughter, Katherine Carson Forden; a son, Daniel; his sister, Mary Elizabeth Whitman; and four grandchildren. His second wife, Aurelia Bachmeyer, died in 2003."
1230,"Mr. Forden went to Infantry Officer Candidate School, worked in Germany as a junior case officer and was assigned to undercover work in Buenos Aires. He accepted the post of station chief in Warsaw in 1964. There he became famous within the agency for perfecting an automobile version of the pedestrian brush pass — the clandestine method of slipping secrets from one person to another on foot as they go around a corner to evade surveillance."
1231,"Mr. Forden was on assignment in Mexico City in June 1973 when he was dispatched to Hamburg, Germany, to meet Colonel Kuklinski. The colonel had made contact with the Americans the previous August through a handwritten letter in broken English to the United States Embassy in Bonn; convinced of his bona fides, the agency had reached for a trusted Polish-speaking officer, Mr. Forden."
1232,"Mr. Forden and Colonel Kuklinski, who were the same age, met during the colonel’s summer missions and exchanged messages when Mr. Forden was in Washington. (During Mr. Forden’s three years as Vienna station chief, a ghostwriter filled in from Washington, maintaining a personal link to the colonel.)"
1233,Mr. Forden was the Athens station chief in the mid-1980s. He retired in 1988 after 35 years with the C.I.A. and was awarded its Distinguished Intelligence Medal.
1234,"Jerzy Kozminski, who was the Polish ambassador to the United States in the 1990s, said in an email on Wednesday, “All those endeavors undertaken by Colonel Kuklinski in the ′70s and at the beginning of the ′80s, aimed at strengthening the West in its confrontation with the Soviet Union, were immensely facilitated by David Forden.”"
1235,"Each week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here."
1236,Hi. I’m Jamie Condliffe; greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news.
1237,"You can’t have missed it: Facebook plans to shift people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built. Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people, and ephemeral messages that can be deleted. In theory, that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has faced."
1238,But Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared — something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on Thursday.
1239,"“I understand that many people don’t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, wrote in a 3,200-word manifesto describing the shift."
1240,"If we are to assume he means it, there’s still a huge problem: He lacks a business model."
1241,"A shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams. Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content. In the encrypted future that Mr. Zuckerberg imagines, that will be hard. The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China, because it won’t run servers in countries with authoritarian governments."
1242,"So how can it make money? Mr. Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments, which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency. But that’s all he says, really."
1243,"Mr. Zuckerberg seems O.K. with the lack of a plan. “The basic way that we’ve approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want,” he said to Wired. “That will be the foundation. If we do that well, the business will be fine.”"
1244,"Of course, a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket. If it isn’t, his critics’ skepticism may be proved right."
1245,"Earlier in the week, Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee, proposed an idea to curb Big Tech’s dominance."
1246,"During the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations. Mr. Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to tech."
1247,"“It’s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information,” he said."
1248,"Sadly, this feels like a nonstarter. Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward; the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are (whatever Mr. Zuckerberg says) deeply intertwined."
1249,"Still, it’s probably one of many options. “There aren’t easy answers” to Big Tech antitrust questions, Mr. Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January. “We’re not going to approach this, like, ‘Here’s my solution.’”"
1250,"He has the wind at his back. Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies. And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of 17 lawyers dedicated to “monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets.” The commission’s director of competition, Bruce Hoffman, said some companies could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions."
1251,"How far these efforts will go — and how quickly — remains unclear. It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies. And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly, lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk at."
1252,"Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn’t charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year. Instead, they said investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night.”"
1253,"One interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma, a researcher at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies:"
1254,“It’s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making.”
1255,"The “handoff problem” — that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency — is well documented. The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue. It suggests that, for now, the onus remains on the “driver.”"
1256,"The Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the company’s products because they may violate national security. Days earlier, Meng Wanzhou, the company’s chief financial officer, sued the Canadian authorities for arresting her."
1257,Huawei is aggrieved by the Trump administration’s hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the company’s products when building 5G wireless data networks. The lawsuits are just one response: A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in play.
1258,"Those more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working: Countries like Britain and Germany, which have considered the White House’s pleas, have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardware."
1259,But the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive. Is that the kind of company a government wants to help build critical infrastructure?
1260,"The National Security Agency stopped its controversial phone spying. The system, which analyzed logs of Americans’ domestic calls and texts and was introduced to surveil conspirators in Al Qaeda, has been scrapped."
1261,"Google said it was paying male workers too little. It gave $9.7 million in additional compensation to level things up for 10,677 employees, about 69 percent of them men. But the survey that led to the raises did not address a critical question: Are women hired at a pay grade below their qualifications?"
1262,Net neutrality is back in Washington. Congressional Democrats announced bills that seek to reinstate net neutrality rules. Whether the bills can pass is another matter.
1263,Chinese hackers hit universities. An elaborate set of attacks sought to steal research about military maritime technology.
1264,"Artificial intelligence cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal. Software can identify “restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language,” according to Bloomberg."

1267,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1268,"Several years ago, before Confederate monuments came toppling down amid collective recognition that American public space needed a politicized renovation, a group of women in New York City started a fund to build a statue in Central Park honoring women’s suffrage."
1269,"Memorializing any woman at all was going to be novel, because once you got past Alice in Wonderland, who was there really? As it happens, there is not a single statue of a nonfictional woman in the entire park — one of the most heavily visited tourist sites in the world, with more than 25 million people passing through each year — and yet the list of the commemorated is copious enough to include King Wladyslaw Jagiello, the 14th-century grand duke of Lithuania. At which point you might ask yourself: Where is Barney Greengrass?"
1270,"Given this myopia and absence of logic, it is easy to see how the decision to erect a statue of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton on the Mall, the widest pedestrian path in the park, might be considered an innovation. Last summer the city, in partnership with the Statue Fund, as it came to be called, announced that a design for such a sculpture had been selected, following a competition that had received 91 submissions."
1271,"The monument, to be unveiled in 2020 in conjunction with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote, would feature renditions of the two women best known for helping to secure that right. That the suffrage movement was big, broad and diverse is meant to be reflected in the image of a scroll unfolding between Anthony and Stanton like a very long to-do list (procure more rolled oats, seek equality) naming and quoting 22 other women whose contributions were greatly significant."
1272,"Of the 22 women selected, seven are African-American. Some of them — Sojourner Truth, Ida B. Wells, Mary Church Terrell — stand as towering figures in the history of American social activism, and yet none is set to receive a statue of her own, in this configuration. In effect, the monument, a maquette of which is on display in Albany, manages to recapitulate the marginalization black women experienced during the suffrage movement to begin with, when, to cite but one example, they were forced by white organizers to congregate in the back during a famous women’s march, in Washington, in 1913, coinciding with Woodrow Wilson’s inauguration."
1273,"While you might think that Gloria Steinem, who has been appalled by the invisibility of women in New York City’s public art for decades, might be delighted by the arrival of a suffrage monument, her grievance has outweighed any enthusiasm. “It is not only that it is not enough,” she told me recently, it’s that it looks as if Anthony and Stanton “are standing on the names of these other women.” Other prominent women have raised the same issue."
1274,"More literally, the inclusion of the scroll and the way that the women are positioned toward it suggests they are writing the history of suffrage, which is in itself problematic because Anthony and Stanton were two of the coeditors on a six volume compendium — “The History of Women’s Suffrage’’ — that gave them ownership of a narrative that erased the participation of black women in the movement. Though many suffragists came to social justice through abolitionism, they maintained explicit prejudices. Arguing against the notion of black men receiving suffrage at the expense of white women, Stanton once said that it was “better to be the slave of an educated white man than of a degraded black one.”"
1275,"Ms. Steinem made her feelings known to those involved with the Statue Fund, she said, but was told essentially that things were too far along to change course. “I do think we cannot have a statue of two white women representing the vote for all women,” she told me."
1276,"For its part, the Parks Department seems disinclined to mandate any major revisions. When I spoke with Jonathan Kuhn, the department’s director of art and antiquities, he said that the statue, though still under review by a public design commission, could be altered only in terms of small detail. Adding another figure “would be a different project,’’ he said; changing things substantially “would compromise the artist’s vision.”"
1277,"But that vision was narrowly circumscribed by the monument’s benefactors to begin with. They had asked for statues of Anthony and Stanton that would allude to the work of others. A conceptual piece might have made clearer how large and diverse the suffrage movement was, but the department would not allow an overtly modern or conceptual artwork."
1278,"“It is a very conservative place,’’ said Meredith Bergmann, the sculptor ultimately chosen. Her original design featured a digital kiosk that would have provided more context and information about the movement, but that was nixed, she told me. (Instead, an online educational campaign will accompany the unveiling of the statue.)"
1279,"Although the city has recently moved to add more women and people of color to its supply of civic art — a statue of Shirley Chisholm is now planned for Prospect Park — just two years ago the Parks Department asked a sculptor to remove a noose from a piece about racial hatred, that was set to go up in Riverside Park, because it might offend people doing yoga and Pilates nearby. After much public criticism, the department allowed the noose in the end."
1280,"The women behind the Statue Fund are white, well-intentioned feminists of a certain vintage. They will remind you that they have worked hard for years, without pay, to make this statue a reality, that the controversy saddens them because weren’t they doing a good thing? When I called Pam Elam, the president of the fund, one of the first things she told me was that she gave her first speech on women’s rights when she was 13. “The bottom line is we are committed to inclusion,” she said, “but you can’t ask one statue to meet all the desires of the people who have waited so long for recognition.”"
1281,"So much has changed, though, in just the past six or seven years since the idea for the monument was conceived, that insisting on old ways of doing and seeing things feels like a new betrayal. Those involved might begin by understanding “inclusion” as more than a buzzword and commit to evolving their views as the truths of history reveal themselves."
1282,What is forward-moving about reiterating an error in an effort to correct for it?
1283,"DAKAR, Senegal — They sprint. They sweat. They squat to the ground and bounce backward. They sit side-by-side and lock arms for group situps. They dig trenches in the sand for stability, to get more out of each push up."
1284,"And, then, when the rush-hour traffic really backs up and exhaust fumes pour across this little, sandy triangle of an outdoor gym bordered by a highway and two exit ramps, sometimes the athletes vomit."
1285,"“Sports and pollution,” said Joseph Faye, a wrestling coach who was grappling with other young men there on a recent evening, “they don’t go together.”"
1286,"Increasingly in Dakar, where outdoor exercise is a way of life, the two are colliding."
1287,"On any given evening, thousands of runners, wrestlers, soccer players and fitness fanatics take to the beaches and streets for a strenuous workout."
1288,Practically the whole city transforms into a California-like muscle beach with bodies grunting and panting and pushing themselves to extremes on any empty patch of land.
1289,Sprinters mount a lighthouse-topped hill or fly down the steps leading from a grand mosque. Body builders lift chunks of broken concrete and heave themselves up on a rusty metal rod stretched across two wooden poles.
1290,"Backward exercising is a thing, with throngs of people squatting and sprinting in reverse."
1291,"But with every breath, these exercisers are inhaling air that the World Health Organization considers dangerous. Dakar’s air exceeds by more than five times the limits set by the World Health Organization of the amount of small particles that when inhaled can damage health."
1292,"The air in Dakar, with its windswept coastal roadway and waves lapping against craggy bluffs, sometimes can appear deceptively clear."
1293,"Other times, especially this time of year when a dust storm rolls in and traffic backs up, it can feel like walking through a cloud of chalk dust after someone bangs two erasers together, inside an oven."
1294,"“It’s a real problem for respiratory diseases,” said Nafissatou Oumar Toure Badiane, the chief of pulmonology at Fann University Hospital in Dakar, who noted that the number of childhood asthma cases at one of the city’s biggest hospitals had recently jumped."
1295,She estimated that a third of the population has some kind of lung ailment.
1296,And there are signs that air quality here is getting worse.
1297,"Dakar is growing, having almost doubled in size in the past decade as people pour in from the countryside and nearby nations in search of jobs. Some of its five million inhabitants are farmers who have given up in the wake of chronic drought dating to the 70s."
1298,The city’s reputation for peace in a restive region has lured more corporations. Oil and gas companies are laying claim to recent offshore discoveries. An entire new city north of Dakar is rising from the sandy dirt. Construction cranes dot the skyline.
1299,Constant smoke billows from a cement factory trying to keep up.
1300,Seventy percent of the nation’s vehicles are on the roadways in Dakar. New highways are being inaugurated to accommodate them.
1301,"Many of the cars are old and spew fumes in a range of colors that produce a particular taste on the palate. The black smoke is bold and mealy across the tongue; blue offers suffocating sourness, while white has subtle notes of the bus boarding area at New York’s Port Authority."
1302,"Trash is piling up outside the city at a monstrous dump where it is often burned, sending thick clouds of small, dangerous particles wafting straight into the city center."
1303,"Smelly black smoke pours over the walls from a French military base that regularly sets fire to some of its waste, choking morning runners who pass by."
1304,Then there are the dust storms.
1305,"Winds sweep down from the Sahara to the north during “harmattan” season between December and April, hurtling dust into the air that coats Dakar’s landscape with a powder so fine it slips under doorways and inside closed windows."
1306,Researchers fear the storms will get worse as rainfall levels decrease along the desert’s southern edge and the Sahara expands.
1307,"Senegalese officials say they are trying to improve conditions. The president’s new city was created to relieve congestion in Dakar. And the government banned some of the most polluting, rickety buses. But many are still on the roadways."
1308,"A decade ago, the government set up air quality monitoring stations across Dakar, and alerts go out to the public when air pollution reaches dangerous levels, most often during dust storm season."
1309,"Government data collected from the stations between 2013 and 2017 show that while the yearly percentage of days of “very bad” air quality declined, the number of “bad” days increased over the same period."
1310,"On the streets of Dakar, pedestrians and bikers are starting to wear masks, evoking images of cities like New Delhi or Beijing with far worse pollution issues."
1311,"Runners are cutting back their routines, scared off by clumps of black dust they blow out of their nostrils in the shower. Weight lifters on the roadways say they suffer more colds than in years’ past."
1312,"People who gather for free workout classes on a small beach along the wind-swept corniche, where cars line a clogged roadway and raw sewage pours into the ocean, say they cough as they walk home."
1313,So much dust coated the National Olympic Pool recently it turned a funny shade of green and needed to be drained.
1314,"“Sometimes it feels like I’m about to get choked,” said Elhadji Adama Niane, a champion swimmer who was panting after a recent workout there."
1315,"Mame Aly Dyigo, a soccer coach and retired professional player, said he has moved his team’s practices to the beach after exhaust fumes from nearby traffic were bothering players. He thought the sea breeze would help."
1316,"But then construction began on a major new highway along the sand, churning clouds of red dust overhead. He doesn’t know where to go now."
1317,"On a recent night runners from the Star Athletic Club, a prominent track club, were practicing in one of the city’s biggest outdoor stadiums, situated near one of the busiest highways. It smelled like a bus garage."
1318,"Sangoné Kandji, a champion long jumper and triple jumper, stopped and sniffed the air when this was pointed out."
1319,"“At least the wind blows over here a little,” she shrugged. “I think I’m just used to it.”"
1320,The bad air is too much sometimes even for wrestlers who face-plant into the sand regularly.
1321,Wrestling is the Senegalese national pastime but space to practice is squeezed in the booming neighborhood of Yoff where athletes were gathered recently on the little patch of sand bordered by the freeway ramps.
1322,"“It’s not easy to find a training field like this around here,” said Matarr Ndow, a wrestler practicing with his team."
1323,"Just across the freeway, new apartment buildings sprouted from a huge construction site. A bulldozer rumbled up an on-ramp. Rubberneckers slowed to watch the grown men in what looks like cloth diapers tug each other to the ground. Smoke belched from some of the idling cars."
1324,"“Every time I come here,” Mr. Ndow said, “I leave with a headache.”"
1325,"The automobile, in American life, has long been a hallmark of freedom. A teenager’s first driver’s license offers freedom from Mom and Dad. A new car and the open road bring the freedom to chase the American dream. But as more technology creeps in to help drivers, so, too, will systems that eavesdrop on and monitor them, necessitated not by convenience but by new safety concerns."
1326,"Cameras that recognize facial expressions, sensors that detect heart rates and software that assesses a driver’s state of awareness may seem like superfluous flights of fancy, but they are increasingly viewed as part of an inevitable driving future."
1327,"At upstarts like the electric car company Byton and mainstream mainstays like Volvo, car designers are working on facial recognition, drowsy-driver alert systems and other features for keeping track of the people behind the wheel."
1328,"The most immediate impetus: concerns about the safe use of driver-assistance options like automatic lane-keeping that still require drivers to pay attention. And when truly autonomous vehicles finally arrive, the consensus among automakers and their suppliers is that new ways will be needed to check on drivers and passengers to make sure they are safe inside."
1329,"“It’s really taken off from no monitoring to tactile monitoring to taking a look at your eyes,” said Grant Courville, a vice president at BlackBerry QNX, which creates in-dash software systems. “I definitely see more of that coming as you get to Level 3 cars,” he added, referring to vehicles that can perform some self-driving functions in limited situations."
1330,"With its 2018 Cadillac CT6, for example, General Motors introduced an infrared camera that looks up from the steering column at drivers."
1331,"The feature is part of the car’s Super Cruise system, the first hands-free driving tool to operate on select United States highways. The camera tracks a driver’s head position and eye movements to ensure that the person is attentive and able to retake control of the car when needed."
1332,"Similar concerns about BMW’s semi-autonomous systems prompted the German carmaker to add a driver monitoring camera in its 2019 X5 sport utility vehicle. The video camera is mounted in the instrument cluster as part of BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant system, part of a $1,700 package, that allows the car to go autonomous — with driver monitoring — in stop-and-go traffic under 37 miles per hour."
1333,"“It looks at the head pose and the eyes of the driver,” said Dirk Wisselmann of BMW’s automated driving program. “We have to, because by doing so it empowers us to add more functionality.”"
1334,"Automakers understand that tracking technology raises privacy issues, so BMW does not record or store the driver monitoring information, Mr. Wisselmann said."
1335,"Perhaps still smarting from lessons learned in the past, G.M. also does not record what transpires inside the car’s cabin, the company said. In 2011, G.M. tried to change the user agreement in its OnStar service to allow it to share driver information with third-party companies.  The backlash from owners was so swift and severe that the Supreme Court cited the episode as proof that people had an expectation of privacy in their cars."
1336,"G.M. later introduced the first built-in video cameras and microphones meant to record the drive in 2014 Chevrolet Corvettes. A valet mode (“Think of it as a baby monitor for your car,” an official said in a Chevrolet news release at the time) that surreptitiously recorded Ferris Bueller-like joy rides made the company so nervous that it sent letters to owners warning about possible legal issues and asking them to refrain from using the setting."
1337,"Now that driver-assistance programs that can steer a vehicle down the highway are becoming more widespread, automakers fear that without such monitoring efforts, some drivers will abuse or misuse the semi-autonomous systems."
1338,There are multiple cases of Tesla owners circumventing the requirement that drivers keep their hands on the wheel when the car’s lane-keeping Autopilot feature is engaged. The consequences have sometimes been fatal.
1339,"“But it’s not just about distraction management,” said Jada Smith, a vice president in the advanced engineering department at the auto supplier Aptiv. During an autonomous driving demonstration, she pointed out that such driver monitoring systems can assess a driver’s cognitive load levels — how many tasks the person is trying to juggle — and then adjust other car functions."
1340,"“If the driver is not fully aware,” Ms. Smith said, “we might brake faster.” Other ideas include putting radar inside the car for interior sensing like detecting that a child has been left behind. (Every nine days a child left in a car dies from vehicular heatstroke in the United States, according to KidsAndCars.org, an advocacy group.)"
1341,"It was infants’ being left in cars that first prompted Guardian Optical Technologies, based in Tel Aviv, to develop in-cabin monitoring technology, said Tal Recanati, the company’s chief business officer. The company has now expanded its 3-D vision and “micro vibration” sensing system to recognize faces, check seatbelt use, even adjust elements like airbag deployment velocity based on a passenger’s approximate weight. Eventually Guardian’s technology could be able to judge the emotional state of people in the car."
1342,"Affectiva, a Boston company developing technology for measuring emotions, has been conducting such research for several years to assess driver behavior. On a closed test track peppered with distractions — people dressed as construction workers, a security vehicle with flashing lights, pedestrians, fake storefronts — Affectiva demonstrated how the company’s program works in tandem with a “collaborative driving” system made by the Swedish auto supplier Veoneer. Veoneer’s technology can control steering and braking on its own, with the occasional intervention of a human driver."
1343,"Affectiva collected a variety of driver information during the test, measuring elements like the amount of grip on the wheel, throttle action, vehicle speed and the driver’s eyes, facial and head movements. It then compared that information with what was happening around the car to determine how much trust the driver had in the semi-autonomous system and the perceived level of cognitive load."
1344,"“We want them to trust the car — but not too much,” said Ola Bostrom, a vice president of research at Veoneer. “The driver still has to be engaged” in order to take over the controls when a car encounters a situation it can’t handle."
1345,"To deliver other advanced services, like augmented reality information about nearby businesses and locations, it will also be necessary to monitor what drivers are paying attention to, said Andrew Poliak, a vice president at Panasonic Automotive Systems. And companies as diverse as Mercedes-Benz and the voice-recognition company Nuance want to add Alexa-like services, meaning that your sedan or S.U.V. may always be listening."
1346,"“So these systems are going to become standard in all cars,” said Nakul Duggal, who leads the automotive products group at Qualcomm."
1347,Will privacy concerns then recede in the rearview mirror of advancing technologies?
1348,"When fully autonomous vehicles begin circulating on public roads, designers note, they will have to be able to detect when people enter or exit a vehicle, who the person is, whether they have left anything behind in the car, and especially if a person has become disabled (because of intoxication or a medical emergency). And that information will inevitably be shared online, although there may be ways that some people can still preserve their sense of independence in the car."
1349,"“In the future, it may be different for people who own their own cars, where there’s more privacy,” said Mr. Wisselmann at BMW, “and for people who use robo taxis, where there will be less.”"
1350,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1351,"ALBANY — After years of hesitation, New York is poised to become the first city in the United States to introduce congestion pricing, which would put new electronic tolls in place for drivers entering the busiest stretches of Manhattan."
1352,"Though state leaders have not ironed out details, they had reached consensus on Monday that the plan was necessary to help pay for much-needed repairs to the city’s beleaguered subway system."
1353,"The proceeds from congestion pricing are expected to enable the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the city’s public transit network, to raise billions of dollars in bonds to modernize the antiquated subway. Such a windfall overwhelmed lingering concerns about various aspects of the plan, including the cost to commuters in the boroughs and suburbs outside Manhattan who rely on cars."
1354,"Other American cities are exploring variations of congestion pricing, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. The idea dates back decades, with supporters often pointing to an array of health, safety and environmental benefits, including reducing air pollution and pedestrian injuries, and alleviating the stranglehold on gridlocked city streets."
1355,"Those arguments have been bolstered by the success of plans in places like London, Stockholm and Singapore, where congestion pricing helped unclog streets. Still, such plans have also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that especially hurts poor people who do not have access to public transit."
1356,"In New York, for example, a 2008 proposal from Michael R. Bloomberg, then the mayor, died in the face of legislative apathy. But with the state currently facing shortfalls in income tax revenue and a subway crisis looming, Albany’s lawmakers on Monday finally agreed that it was an idea whose time had come."
1357,"“Safe to say that the Assembly is ready to go forward on congestion pricing,” Carl E. Heastie, the chamber’s speaker, said on Monday; the Democratic-controlled Assembly had been the holdout in endorsing the plan. “We’re at the point where the Assembly members understand the need to fund the M.T.A.”"
1358,"The State Senate, which is also controlled by Democrats, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, have already expressed support for congestion pricing, with the governor suggesting that without it, subway and bus fares could rise by 30 percent."
1359,"Mr. Cuomo, a third-term Democrat, has pushed for it as a funding mechanism for the subway system; in late February, Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has had an uneasy relationship with Mr. Cuomo, also warmed to the idea, saying there was no way to address the problems in the subway “without congestion pricing.”"
1360,"Mr. Heastie and other legislative officials stressed that specifics about the plan, including the exact price for entering Manhattan’s main business district, were still being considered, though he seemed confident that a deal could be brokered, likely before the state’s budget deadline on April 1."
1361,"Assembly members and Mr. Heastie have been hunkered behind closed doors in recent days, discussing a broad array of exemptions that would make congestion pricing more palatable, according to several members and aides. These include exemptions from the congestion fees for drivers who are poor, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments, among other things."
1362,"Calls for a congestion pricing plan had also increased. On Monday, prominent congestion pricing supporters, including Patrick Foye, the M.T.A. president, and Polly Trottenberg, the New York City transportation commissioner, came to Albany to meet with legislative leaders."
1363,"Kathryn S. Wylde, the head of the influential Partnership for New York City, a business group, was also pushing for such a plan, and praised Mr. Heastie shortly after he announced the deal for his “real skill” in “pulling together his diverse membership.”"
1364,"In a sign of widening support this year, two separate grass-roots campaigns had emerged, as advocates lobbied legislators to gain their support, flooded local subway stops and urged frustrated subway riders to call and text their legislators."
1365,"“Transit riders were up in arms about the state of our subway system and it seems that our representatives in Albany really listened,” said John Raskin, the executive director of the Riders Alliance, which helped organize the #FixtheSubway coalition. “I think the visceral anger of subway riders stuck on yet another unreliable train played a pivotal role in legislators feeling the urgency of the problem.”"
1366,"One congestion pricing plan backed by the governor and mayor is projected to raise about $1 billion annually from fees for driving into a congestion zone spanning Manhattan’s central business district, from 60th Street south to the Battery. That money would, in turn, be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for M.T.A. capital projects through 2024."
1367,Drivers entering the congestion zone through tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge on Manhattan’s West Side would receive a credit toward the fees. Those taking the Brooklyn Bridge directly to the F.D.R. Drive to go north past the congestion zone would be exempted from the fees.
1368,"The potential passage of congestion pricing would be a win for Mr. Cuomo, who was heavily criticized for his handling of the subways last year during his successful bid for re-election. He has pushed this year to overhaul the M.T.A., saying he will not sign a budget without reforms to the authority, and touting congestion pricing as a valuable source of funding for badly needed repairs."
1369,"“Congestion pricing is the greatest opportunity we have had,” Mr. Cuomo said last week, in an interview on WNYC. “We have talked about it for 20 years. It is the smartest idea I think for urban development.”"
1370,Suburban lawmakers have raised objections about the financial impact on those driving into the city and also have sought to ensure that some of the money from congestion pricing go to commuter railroads. But they seemed ready to make a deal.
1371,"“Long Island senators have stated clearly that a fair and equitable congestion pricing plan must include a dedicated revenue stream for infrastructure upgrades to the beleaguered L.I.R.R.,” said Senator Todd Kaminsky, who represents Nassau County. “I am optimistic that an agreement can be reached that benefits both the region and the suburban commuter.”"
1372,"With the budget deadline still a week away, and Albany known for its fractious and fragile deal making, there could still be snags before such a plan becomes law."
1373,"Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Queens Democrat and leading critic of congestion pricing, said on Monday that he remained opposed to it unless his request for an exemption for all city residents was included in the plan. He represents parts of Queens where he said many residents have to drive because they do not have ready or affordable access to public transit. “I know there are a lot of exemptions on the table,” he said. “They could exempt residents of the five boroughs.”"
1374,"Mr. Heastie said that such details were still being discussed, though he seemed reluctant to allow too many exemptions."
1375,"“The more you carve out, the less you have in revenue,” Mr. Heastie said."
1376,"The speaker said several issues still remained to be addressed, including help for so-called “transit deserts,” tolling on bridges and possible discounts for commuter rail users. Still, he seemed confident that such tolling would soon be the norm in Lower Manhattan."
1377,"“I think we’re in a very good place,” he said."

1379,"New Yorkers who rely on the L train are bracing for months of upheaval when their line is partially closed for repairs. Subway leaders have warned of fewer trains on nights and weekends, crowded platforms and the need to divert riders to buses."
1380,"In other parts of the city, subway riders have felt a sense of relief — and even schadenfreude — to be spared from the transit nightmare."
1381,But their line could be next.
1382,"With New York City’s subway in crisis, the only way to improve service is to shut down large swaths of the system to overhaul its ancient equipment. The subway’s leader, Andy Byford, wants to greatly expand night and weekend closings in the coming years."
1383,"“We need to start getting used to the idea that we’re entering a period of shared sacrifice,” said Nick Sifuentes, executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group."
1384,The disruption planned for the L line is in many ways a preview of what lies ahead for the rest of the system. In a city that takes pride in its round-the-clock subway — it’s one of the only systems in the world that never closes — the L train repairs will be painful: fewer trains starting at 8 p.m. on weeknights and a 20-minute wait between trains on the weekend.
1385,Mr. Byford’s sweeping $40 billion plan to save the subway calls for installing modern subway signals on several lines at the same time. Some could be closed on most nights and weekends for two and a half years.
1386,The service cuts will fall the hardest on New Yorkers who work nights and weekends like Amy Malale who lives in Queens and works on Sundays at a bookstore in Manhattan.
1387,"“I question whether it is going to make the subways better,” Ms. Malale said as she rode an F train on a recent afternoon. “Two and a half years? That’s a scary thought.”"
1388,"Transit workers have started to upgrade signals on the Queens Boulevard line, from Rockefeller Center in Manhattan to Kew Gardens in Queens. The F train in Brooklyn and the 8th Avenue line in Manhattan are next. Construction on the Lexington Avenue line, the nation’s busiest subway route, could start as early as next year."
1389,"But Mr. Byford’s ambitious “Fast Forward” plan will not proceed without significant new funding from state leaders in Albany. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat who controls the subway, is pressing for congestion pricing, a proposal to toll cars entering the busiest parts of Manhattan to raise money for the subway."
1390,"“If Fast Forward is going to gain momentum or if it’s going to die a painful death, it’s going to happen at the hands of Albany legislators,” Mr. Sifuentes said."
1391,"During station closings on nights and weekends, riders could have other options like extra buses, said Veronique Hakim, the managing director of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Because the system is so large and interconnected, there are often alternate subway lines nearby, though that is not always the case in far-flung corners of the city beyond Manhattan."
1392,"“What riders need is certainty and information,” Ms. Hakim said in an interview. “Being able to say this particular line is going to be closed from this hour to that hour. As long as you give people that information ahead of time, they can plan accordingly.”"
1393,"But despite assurances from officials that the impact of the L train repairs will be minimal, transit advocates say the contingency plans are too meager."
1394,The tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn had been set to close entirely for 15 months to repair damage from Hurricane Sandy. Officials planned to offer a “busway” on 14th Street across Lower Manhattan and high occupancy vehicle rules for the Williamsburg Bridge. Then Mr. Cuomo — upending years of preparation — intervened with a new repair plan that avoids a full closure and those alternatives were abandoned.
1395,"When subway lines are closed in the years ahead, the routes should be replaced with dedicated bus lanes that prioritize transit riders over cars, said Joe Cutrufo, a spokesman for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group for bikers and pedestrians."
1396,"“The subway doesn’t share the tracks with cars — neither should buses,” he said."
1397,"While overhauling New York’s century-old subway will be disruptive, installing modern signals is the key to making the system reliable again. In London, another vast and aging system, the signals have been upgraded much faster. On one line with modern signals, trains regularly arrive every 100 seconds."
1398,"In New York, only the L train and the No. 7 line have modern signals, known as communications based train control, or C.B.T.C. The installation was plagued by delays and took nearly two decades, but the L train is now the most reliable with a 90 percent on-time rate. The No. 7 line can run 29 trains per hour during rush hour, up from 27 trains before new signals were installed. Mr. Cuomo has also urged Mr. Byford to use a new technology called ultra-wideband radio that could allow the signal work to be done faster."
1399,"On the F line, where the signals are currently being upgraded, some riders understand the need to shut down parts of the route. Patrick Smith said he watched an interview with Mr. Byford on “60 Minutes” last year that portrayed him as the subway’s cheerful savior. He supports Mr. Byford’s plan to fix the subway."
1400,"“I think the crux of the situation is, how do you modernize a 110-year-old system without grossly impacting everyday life?” said Mr. Smith, who works in information technology and lives in Brooklyn."
1401,"If the subway was closed on nights and weekends, Mr. Smith said he would be fine with taking a backup shuttle bus. “Short-term sacrifice usually pays off,” he said."
1402,"Andrew Fox, who lives in Queens and works in construction on the weekend, said the subway often ran local during repair work which made his commute a “nightmare,” turning a 30-minute trip into an hourlong ride."
1403,"“It’s only massively inconvenient,” he said. “From far out in Queens to Manhattan, a local train is just the worst.”"
1404,"Mr. Sifuentes, the transit advocate, said he welcomed the disruption, as long as the authority provides “a really good bus route to compensate.”"
1405,"“Shut my line down,” he said, “Give me C.B.T.C. I want that as soon as possible.”"
1406,"Regularly closing the subway on nights and weekends would be a dramatic change for New York, where many people work outside the traditional 9-to-5 schedule. Those who work at places like medical centers and restaurants commute at all hours, even between midnight and 5 a.m., said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban planning at New York University."
1407,"“Those are the key hours when office towers are cleaned,” he said, “when hipsters are out at comedy clubs and music venues and, of course, when the vast kitchens are baking bagels, boiling eggs and cutting up fruit.”"
1408,"Christine Sherlock, a teacher who lives in Queens and teaches college classes on nights and weekends, said if she had to take a bus, instead of the subway, that could more than double her commute to two hours. Despite the hassle, she wants the subway to be upgraded."
1409,"“It would be worth it,” she said, “in the long run.”"
1410,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1411,It sounds like something out of Dickens: A wealthy private school on Manhattan’s Upper East Side wants to build a multimillion-dollar athletic facility that will shroud the remnants of a 19th-century orphanage that was uncovered during demolition. The only thing standing in its way is the local priest — the same man whose accusations led to a cardinal’s being defrocked by the pope.
1412,"At the end of a recent Sunday Mass, the Rev. Boniface Ramsey reminded his congregation of this latest crusade. “I just want to talk to you all again for a moment about the wall of St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum,” Father Ramsey said. “The wall is now in danger of being obscured again by the Spence School. This is a big deal for our parish because there was a relationship between that orphanage and our parish all those years ago.”"
1413,"As his congregants at St. Joseph’s Church were aware, the neighborhood drama started after a parking garage on East 90th Street was demolished to reveal a forgotten artifact: an eight-story neoclassical facade that was part an orphanage that cared for thousands of children over a century ago."
1414,"The orphanage was founded in 1857 and closed around 1920. Today the building is a condominium, its eastern facade improbably untouched, hidden by the garage for decades. But its resurrection will be brief: The lot belongs to Spence, the elite all-girls school, and construction is underway on a facility that will feature nine squash courts and an ecology center. When the building is completed next year, the orphanage facade will be hidden again."
1415,"In a statement, Spence said: “The fact that the site will once again serve children, after a hiatus of over a century of connection with St. Joseph’s, should rightfully be honored.”"
1416,"It added, “While we will never know whether any young girl’s path passed through both our institutions, the inspiring possibility cannot be excluded and should be considered by all.”"
1417,"A sense of obligation has also motivated Father Ramsey’s cause. His church and the orphanage were affiliated, and they both tended to the German immigrants of the Yorkville neighborhood in the late 1800s. Several weeks ago, after the garage came down, he started mentioning the wall during sermons and in church bulletins, and he recently wrote to the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission."
1418,"Before a recent Catholic youth league basketball game, Father Ramsey walked three blocks north to the future Spence site. “My aim is to make a fuss about this, and I will continue to make a fuss about this,” he said. “What frustrates me is that Spence should have consulted with the neighborhood. All I want is a plaque. Something that will show what was here. That way the privileged children of Spence can know that children who had no such privilege came before them.”"
1419,"Crusading against Spence is not quite as daunting as speaking out against the diocese. Outside of his parish, Father Ramsey, 73, is best known as a whistle-blower in the sexual abuse case of Theodore E. McCarrick, a former cardinal and archbishop of Washington. But the private schools of Manhattan can be formidable institutions to meddle in the affairs of. Father Ramsey is unfazed."
1420,"“I’m intimidated by the cardinal,” he said. “Not the Spence School.”"
1421,"Spence was founded in 1892, and it sits a block away from Central Park on East 91st Street. The school’s tuition, according to its website, is about $52,000 per year, and its alumnae include Gwyneth Paltrow, Kerry Washington and Anna Wintour’s daughter. The future athletic facility, which is known as Spence 412, will feature a regulation basketball court and a dance studio. Spence purchased the site for $26 million in 2011."
1422,"An email from the school’s real estate lawyer viewed by The New York Times suggested concern as Father Ramsey’s cause gained notice. “We should talk,” the note began. “I have been watching this grow from a cute little story to the sprouting of a public campaign.”"
1423,"“Apparently, one of the Good Father’s options,” it continued, “is to request that LPC” — a reference to the Landmarks Preservation Commission — “begin the designation process for landmarking the building. You can’t make this stuff up. Call me for more and a few suggestions.”"
1424,"Although the orphanage wall is now at the center of a distinctly New York drama, part of its facade had been visible to perceptive pedestrians for decades. But most knew little about its past, including Father Ramsey, who recognized the structure only from a book about St. Joseph’s history. Urgency about the wall’s fate accelerated last month after the weekly community newspaper Our Town ran a story about Spence’s plans for the lot."
1425,"“We don’t think of ourselves as the Upper East Side,” Father Ramsey said. “We’re Yorkville. So, when I found out one of the last real parts of old Yorkville was about to disappear on the account of people not from here, who didn’t even ask anybody, I had to do something.”"
1426,A kind of preservationist fever has since spread around the neighborhood.
1427,"“When the girls who go to Spence grow up, I think they will be disappointed to find out what the parents did to the orphanage wall,” said Zora Szemenyei Silber, 62, a retired elementary schoolteacher and part of St. Joseph’s congregation. “Children don’t forget.”"
1428,"Jim Sidebotham, 68, expressed disdain when he visited the facade. “Like Spence needs more space,” he said. “Squash courts? Just what the girls need. That’s got to be the height of effete, elite snobbery.”"
1429,"Ben Kallos, a City Council member who represents the Upper East Side, has been trying to temper such passions. “The wall takes us back to the roots of Yorkville, and it harkens back to ‘Oliver Twist,’” Mr. Kallos said."
1430,"But, he added, Spence lawfully secured its rights to the site long before there was interest in the orphanage. “I’m hopeful Spence can come up with a solution, but I’m also not sure how much can realistically be done now, and how fair it would be to the school so far into their project.”"
1431,"Earlier this month, Father Ramsey appeared resigned to the fate of the facade. “It looks dim,” he said. But last week, as news of the cause spread, Spence agreed to hear Father Ramsey’s complaints. Mr. Kallos organized a meeting in his offices."
1432,"Spence was represented by its head of school, its architect, a member of its communications team and its lawyer. Father Ramsey arrived alone and brought with him a large book containing baptismal records of the orphanage, its tattered pages filled with rows of cursive handwriting."
1433,"Spence proposed ideas: creating a permanent exhibit to honor the site’s past, having Father Ramsey talk to students during an assembly, starting a scholarship named after the orphanage. “It seemed like they really wanted to accommodate me,” Father Ramsey said afterward. “I don’t know how many of those ideas will ever go further than that room.”"
1434,The school did agree to his main request: a commemorative plaque.
1435,"Back at his church, Father Ramsey reflected on his quest. “I feel I went to bat for the orphans,” he said. “Now I won’t have to go marching up and down the building site with a placard to protest the whole thing. But if that ends up being necessary, I’ll come back.”"
1436,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand — At least 49 people were killed at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Friday, in a horrific and methodical afternoon slaughter, part of which was broadcast live on the internet after the publication of a white supremacist manifesto online."
1437,"The massacre, which Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand’s prime minister, condemned as a terrorist attack and called “an extraordinary and unprecedented act of violence,” interrupted a day of prayer for a small immigrant community in the nation’s third-largest city and shook a country with little history of mass shooting."
1438,"Harrowing first-person footage, apparently from a camera worn by a gunman as he attacked the Al Noor Mosque in the center of the city, was streamed on Facebook — a grim milestone in the evolution of terrorism that raised questions about how tech companies can block extremists from using social media to spread hate and inspire violence."
1439,[Follow our live briefing here.]
1440,"Facebook said it quickly shut down the account, but a 17-minute video showing a man dressed in black shooting at fleeing worshipers and into piles of bodies with a semiautomatic rifle circulated widely online. In addition to those killed, at least 48 people were being treated for gunshot wounds, including young children, the authorities said."
1441,The police said a man in his late 20s was arrested and charged with murder but declined to identify him. The police also said they seized several weapons and found two explosive devices on a vehicle.
1442,"“This is and will be one of New Zealand’s darkest days,” Ms. Ardern said at a news conference."
1443,"Schools in the downtown area were locked down for hours after the attacks as the police tried to determine whether the gunman acted alone. The authorities urged residents to stay indoors, asked mosques to close and cleared nearby Cathedral Square, where people had gathered as part of worldwide protests to demand action on climate change."
1444,"New Zealand’s police commissioner, Mike Bush, said three other individuals found near the scene with weapons were also taken into custody, though investigators later said that one probably had nothing to do with the attacks."
1445,"The shootings were first reported at about 1:40 p.m., around the time of the midday Friday prayer, when the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Mosque, about three miles east, would be most busy. The manifesto had appeared online minutes earlier."
1446,"The document named both mosques, and links to it were posted on Twitter and 8chan, an online forum known for hosting message boards with extremist right-wing discussions. The 8chan post included a link to what appeared to be the gunman’s Facebook page, where he said he would soon broadcast live video of the attack."
1447,"But it was not immediately clear whether the name on the page was that of the suspect, and the authorities declined to comment."
1448,Ms. Ardern said that many of the victims were most likely migrants to New Zealand or refugees.
1449,"“Christchurch was the home of these victims,” she said. “For many this may not have been the place they were born. For many, New Zealand was their choice, the place that they chose to come to and committed themselves to, the place they chose to raise their families.”"
1450,"She added that New Zealand was likely targeted “because we represent diversity, kindness, compassion, a home for those who share our values, refuge for those who need it.”"
1451,"Nasreen Hanif, a spokeswoman for the Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand, said people were anxious for updates and were worried that friends or family members were among the dead."
1452,"“Nobody’s answering their phones,” she said. “We don’t know if they’re at the hospital or out of reach. Some have posted that they are safe, but others have not.”"
1453,Ms. Hanif said the two mosques in Christchurch had asked for help from Muslims across the country to arrange the 49 funerals they would need to plan.
1454,"Historians say Muslims have lived in New Zealand for more than 150 years, but the population has grown with immigration from war-torn countries like Iraq and Afghanistan in the 1990s and 2000s. In a country of nearly five million people, though, only about 46,000 identified as Muslim in the 2013 census."
1455,"The video of the attack, which appeared to be recorded on a helmet camera, showed the gunman driving to the mosque and then opening fire even before he entered the building. For nearly two minutes, he shoots at fleeing worshipers before he runs back to his car and swaps weapons."
1456,"He then is seen re-entering the mosque and opening fire again, methodically moving from room to room and shooting into piles of bodies slumped on the green carpets. Several victims can be seen in the footage, many lying on top of one another motionless in a corner of the room."
1457,"After another few minutes, the gunman leaves again, gets in his vehicle and drives away, pausing occasionally to fire at pedestrians while talking to himself throughout."
1458,"“There wasn’t even time to aim, there was so many targets,” he says at one point."
1459,The police in New Zealand said they were working to remove the video from the internet and urged people not to share it.
1460,"A live video posted to social media appeared to show the attack at Al Noor Mosque, where 42 people were killed. The clip appeared to have been taken from a camera worn by a gunman."

1565,"Facebook said it was alerted by the police shortly after the livestream started. “We quickly removed both the shooter’s Facebook and Instagram accounts and the video,” Mia Garlick, a Facebook representative, said in a statement. “We’re also removing any praise or support for the crime and the shooter or shooters as soon as we’re aware.”"
1566,"Before the shooting began, the gunman made a winking reference to an internet meme, telling viewers to “subscribe to PewDiePie,” a reference to the Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg. Mr. Kjellberg, who has been criticized for anti-Semitism over skits that he called satirical, said on Twitter that he felt “absolutely sickened” that the gunman had mentioned him."
1567,The video and Twitter posts showed weapons covered in the names of past military generals and men who have recently carried out mass shootings.
1568,"The author of the manifesto identifies himself as a 28-year-old man born in Australia. He listed his white nationalist heroes, described his animosity toward Muslims and immigrants, and said he chose to use guns in the attacks to stir discord in the United States around the Second Amendment."
1569,"Aman Singh, 26, who works at a convenience store close to the Al Noor Mosque, said he hid after hearing gunshots and seeing people stream past, bloody and crying."

1579,"For days and nights, unruly crowds sacked 523 stores in Maracaibo as residents stood on their porches wielding weapons to guard against looters. Dozens died in hospitals. Bodies decomposed in the morgue. And what little food remained in refrigerators rotted away as the nation went hungry."
1580,"I drove to Maracaibo with a photographer for The New York Times to witness the chaos wrought by a devastating blackout — likely the largest ever in a country already crumbling from an economic crisis and a shortage of food, medicine and water. Along the way, smoke hovered over the road as business owners burned the trash left behind by looters. At night, only the car’s headlights pierced the darkness, outlining the silhouettes of pedestrians."
1581,"The entire nation was plunged into darkness for six days straight. But here in Maracaibo, a sweltering coastal city, the nightmare continued beyond a week: Desperate people searched for food in stores laid bare or shuttered, and formed long lines in front of the few bakeries brave enough to open. Many businesses were reduced to shattered glass and smoldering piles."

1602,"This is a place on the edge of the electric grid in Venezuela, so it was not unusual for the lights to go out for a number of hours. There were rolling blackouts there. Usually by 4:00 p.m., the lights are back on. But then he got a call from his wife, who said there was not just a power outage in Maracaibo, but all over Venezuela. This was something that wasn’t usual. This was something no one had really seen or remembered before."

1605,nicholas casey
1606,"We’re talking about a country of 30 million people, and almost no one has electricity."
1607,michael barbaro
1608,So the power is out across Venezuela.
1609,nicholas casey
1610,"Across the entire country. And that means things get very ugly, very fast."
1611,michael barbaro
1612,What had happened to trigger this blackout?
1613,nicholas casey
1614,"According to the electricians’ union, it was a brush fire that took place over some cables that were feeding the country. But you have to ask yourself, if one fire is able to turn off all the power to a country, there must be a bigger problem."
1615,michael barbaro
1616,Right.
1617,nicholas casey
1618,"And the problem is that Venezuela is in the middle of an economic collapse. That means that key infrastructure in the country isn’t getting built, and what’s there isn’t getting repaired. On top of this, there’s massive political unrest."
1619,archived recording
1620,"Juan Guaidó, the country’s self-proclaimed leader, is calling for his supporters to take to the streets again to step up pressure on President Nicolás Maduro and demand new elections. Maduro has also called on his supporters to rally today. The power struggle between Guaidó and Maduro has brought the country to a standstill, and that is a huge electricity —"
1621,nicholas casey
1622,"There are still two men who say that they’re the president of Venezuela, and Guaidó actually has the support of America and 50 other countries, as well. This is extremely unresolved. Donald Trump is saying that Maduro needs to step down and let Guaidó be the president."
1623,michael barbaro
1624,"So in this moment when the power goes out, to 30 million Venezuelans, it’s not entirely clear who runs the country or who will be solving the blackout."
1625,nicholas casey
1626,"Not at all. And it’s becoming clear to everybody that Maduro can’t do even the most basic thing that a government should be doing, which is keeping the lights on. So these two events aren’t directly connected to each other, but you suddenly see that one is starting to feed off of the other, which is this discontent that brought Guaidó to the forefront in Venezuelan politics is now being doubled by the fact that Maduro can’t provide electricity. It’s underscoring this question which everybody has asked in Venezuela, which is, if you can’t provide power, are you actually providing a state?"

1630,"So I decided to go to Maracaibo, which is Venezuela’s second-largest city. It’s also at the end of the electric grid. So we knew that this was going to be a place where there was going to be problems, and the problems were going to be very big."
1631,nicholas casey
1632,"So you can hear the sound of the generator here, which is out of a small truck. And there’s basically a line of phones where everybody has plugged in."
1633,nicholas casey
1634,"You have to remember that Maracaibo sits on the Caribbean coast. It’s a really hot, sweltering city. The old joke in Maracaibo was that it’s the coldest city in Venezuela, because everybody has air conditioning. But now, there was no air conditioning. And after a few days, things started to come apart."
1635,speaker
1636,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1637,nicholas casey
1638,"People were running out of food, and it started with the looting. There were big crowds of more than a thousand people that suddenly gathered, looking for food. And these crowds first went to the grocery stores. They sacked almost every single supermarket that was in Maracaibo, but then they kept going. They started taking anything that was available. People were suddenly taking furniture. They were taking washers and dryers. They were taking all of these appliances and anything that they could after this massive economic crisis. You can suddenly imagine if you could get your hands on something that was of value and worth a lot, you would go for it. You would take it, especially if there’s no state. There’s no one patrolling."
1639,michael barbaro
1640,There’s no one patrolling.
1641,nicholas casey
1642,"No one. I talked to many store owners who said that they were waiting for the police to come, and the police didn’t come. Part of the reason for that is because the police themselves, their paychecks are worthless. People aren’t showing up to the jobs. Things are just coming apart this way."

1693,[music]
1694,
1695,nicholas casey
1696,"I needed to see what was going on, but you can’t get into hospitals in Venezuela if you’re a journalist. Many of them are militarized. People have been arrested for going into these hospitals."
1697,michael barbaro
1698,They don’t want you to see.
1699,nicholas casey
1700,This is really at the core of what Maduro can’t do in this country. This is very sensitive to the government. They can’t treat people. So this has even put the hospital staff and the doctors under threat. They’re afraid to speak. But I was able to find a couple of doctors who were able to talk to me behind closed doors in another facility.
1701,michael barbaro
1702,"And here, we’re actually going to change the voices of these doctors so that their identities are protected and they don’t get in trouble for talking to you."
1703,nicholas casey
1704,Right. And these doctors were telling me when I met them that this had been a place where it was already almost impossible to treat patients.
1705,speaker
1706,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1707,nicholas casey
1708,"There was very little water. They were having to wash their hands using bottled water. They were running out of soap. They didn’t have medicines that they needed. And then suddenly, they didn’t have any electricity."

1710,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1711,nicholas casey
1712,One of the doctors I talked to said —

1714,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1715,nicholas casey
1716,The first thing that hit you was the smell.
1717,speaker
1718,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1719,nicholas casey
1720,"There is a stench that is horrific there. And as the people were coming in with injuries from these lootings that were taking place, gunshot wounds, glass wounds because they had broken down the windows, doctors didn’t know how to treat them initially. They were trying to treat them. And in some cases, according to one of the medical officials I talked to, people were getting amputations that they didn’t necessarily need, because this was the only way that they were going to save this person was doing an amputation, when ordinarily, if you’d had everything that you needed, you would have been able to do something else for this person besides take off their arm or their leg."
1721,michael barbaro
1722,This blackout is literally costing people their limbs.
1723,nicholas casey
1724,"Yes. And on top of that, even in the morgue, there’s no power."
1725,speaker
1726,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1727,nicholas casey
1728,So the bodies are starting to rot there.
1729,[music]
1730," That’s during the day. But then the night starts to hit, and you have to continue doing work as people are coming in to try to get treated. People were pulling out their cell phones to use the light by their cell phones to try to treat people at that point. This doctor told me that you could hear people screaming."
1731,speaker
1732,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1733,nicholas casey
1734,"But you couldn’t tell where the screams were necessarily coming from, because the whole place was dark. At a certain point, a couple of days into this, there was a robbery, when an armed group came in and went to the third floor of one of the hospitals and started to steal from the patients who were there."
1735,speaker
1736,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1737,nicholas casey
1738,Taking advantage of the fact that you couldn’t see anyone in there.
1739,speaker
1740,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1741,nicholas casey
1742,So one thing that the doctor said was most difficult about this was there was no information on what was going on or when this was going to be over.
1743,speaker
1744,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1745,nicholas casey
1746,"Finally, the government did come out and say it was an act of sabotage that caused this —"
1747,speaker
1748,[SPEAKING SPANISH]
1749,nicholas casey
1750,— blaming the U.S. and the opposition for what had happened. But this wasn’t something the doctors believed themselves. This was the equivalent of having no information at all still.
1751,michael barbaro
1752,"And how, in the government’s telling, is the U.S. somehow responsible?"
1753,nicholas casey
1754,"They said that it was a cybernetic electromagnetic attack that had been launched from the U.S., likely in Houston and Chicago. And that this was an effort by Donald Trump for regime change. Shut down the electricity and you can help the opposition by making Maduro look like he can’t run the country."
1755,michael barbaro
1756,And how would that even work?
1757,nicholas casey
1758,"There is such technology out there, but he didn’t provide any evidence, any pictures, anything showing that that’s what had happened. And there are satellite photos showing that there was a brush fire that day."
1759,michael barbaro
1760,"And are people buying this story, that the U.S. is behind the blackout?"
1761,nicholas casey
1762,"Whether you buy it says a lot about how you feel about Maduro. If you follow Maduro, you’ve probably followed him into a lot of other explanations as well, which largely is based on the idea that the economic crisis of Venezuela has to do with the U.S. and its imperial desires to bring Venezuela down. So of course you see this blackout as probably being their sabotage. But if you’re tired of Maduro, if you’ve been suffering this economic collapse and you think he’s the cause for it, then you’re not going to believe him for a second. You’re going to see this as one more very strong piece of evidence as to why he needs to go, because he can’t keep the power on."
1763,michael barbaro
1764,"And I guess it’s kind of telling that a blackout would be drawn into this political standoff between these two, Guaidó and Maduro."
1765,nicholas casey
1766,"Everything now is being used as political ammunition. And when you have something that affects 30 million people at the same time, of course that’s going to be the center of the political debate. Why aren’t these lights on now?"
1767,[music]
1768,
1769,michael barbaro
1770,What ended up happening to the power while you were there? Did it ever come back on?
1771,nicholas casey
1772,"There was one neighborhood that we were at that had been without power for eight days at that point. When we got there, people were sitting on their lawns in the middle of the dark drinking coffee. And just when we were about to leave, suddenly, all the lights came back on."

1780,"And it was just this really magical moment. They were really happy. But when you think about it, if these are the moments of hope that people were having, that the lights are going to come back on, that means it’s a long way that Venezuela has to go to actually have real moments of hope."
1781,michael barbaro
1782,"And how long did the lights stay on? Not too long. We were there and the lights were still on in that neighborhood. But since then, they’ve been going on and off throughout Maracaibo. And they just don’t know when they’re going to have power and when they’re not. And I think it left not just me, but almost any Venezuelan terrified about what might be coming next. You just saw a level of violence and disregard for society which I don’t think Venezuelans had seen on that scale in most of their lifetimes. What’s the next thing that’s going to disappear that you couldn’t imagine disappearing, and then what’s going to happen when that’s gone? Nick, thank you very much."

1818,"“I don’t have the medicine I need, and the chance of getting it is now nill,” said Mr. León, saying the rioters had sacked every pharmacy around him."
1819,The power failure has become the latest battleground in a country where two men now claim to be president.
1820,"Juan Guaidó, the opposition head who is recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela’s legitimate leader, has offered it as evidence that the state is failing. President Nicolás Maduro has blamed the United States, which it says worked with the opposition to sabotage the electrical grid — putting Mr. Guaidó under investigation, and sending intelligence agents to detain a well-known journalist for an alleged role."
1821,"The spectacular power failure was most likely result of a simple brush fire that destabilized the country’s electrical grid, union leaders said. It underscored the lack of maintenance of key infrastructure and the years of mismanagement of the country’s economy, which have become the twin hallmarks of the nation’s economic collapse."
1822,"And it laid bare Venezuela’s grim reality: When there is no power, there is no rule of law."
1823,"“You could hear doctors in the hospital yelling at their patients in the dark: ‘Bear with it!’ ‘Just hold on!’ But that does nothing for the pain,” said a doctor in a public hospital in Maracaibo, who asked not to be named, fearing government retaliation. “Six days without power in the 21st century, how is this even possible?”"
1824,It began so much like Venezuela’s many other outages that few even took note at first.
1825,"Maracaibo sits in Venezuela’s most populous state and was the first to receive electricity generations ago. But today it lies on the far western edge of the electric grid, a sweltering Caribbean city whose high energy consumption has left the power flickering on and off for the last three years."

1840,"But food, always in scarce supply in Venezuela, was becoming a concern in the neighborhood. On Saturday, many began to realize any meat they had in their refrigerators would soon be rotting. Using stoves still connected to the gas supply, some residents cooked the meat, while others tried salting and drying it."
1841,"As the day wore on, people began to rush the few gas stations that remained open as lines of hundreds of cars snaked around blocks in the sun. A protest called by the opposition was put down violently by police. Mr. Maduro, silent until the weekend, appeared on television but said little about how the government planned to address the issue."
1842,"“They gave us no information,” Ms. Figueroa said, worrying that popular resentment would soon boil over. “It was like one of those disaster films they used to make, like ‘Soylent Green’ or ‘Underworld.’ We would have to develop our own ways to survive.”"
1843,The first gunshots sounded on Monday outside Omar Chávez’s neighborhood.
1844,Mr. Chávez had just returned from looking for medicine for his daughter and stocking up on dollars when he heard the beginning of a riot. He got to a safe place and kept watch.
1845,"“We could see through binoculars they were looting everything,” Mr. Chávez said. “The shop owners were trying to defend their stores by opening fire, not to kill, but I think there were many dead. No one was controlling this mob.”"
1846,"A group of more than a thousand people had descended on a nearby business district, breaking glass windows and raiding merchandise, according to merchants. Venezuela’s national guard, plagued by months of desertions, was nowhere to be seen."
1847,"“In the middle of this blackout there was no authority,” said Miguel Sierra, who was selling laundry detergent when the looters arrived."
1848,"As night fell, the crowd started setting stores alight."
1849,"“I think they started the fire because the lights were out — there was no other way to see what there was to take,” said Marbella Jiménez, who runs an informal stall."
1850,"As the riots continued, hospitals braced for the injured, who soon showed up with gunshot wounds or injuries from broken glass. But the hospitals, which barely had soap because of the shortages, now also had no electricity."
1851,"A top medical official, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of government reprisals, said 47 people died in Maracaibo’s main medical center."
1852,"“At least half could be attributed to the crisis,” the official said, citing patients who died of heart failure or complications from untreated diabetes."
1853,The medical officials also said several young men who arrived with gunshot wounds received amputations rather than less severe treatments that could have resulted in fatal complications if the blackout continued.
1854,"“You were entering the lion’s den, it was a dark cave,” said another doctor about the hospital. He declined to be named fearing the government. “The worst was the smell: it was a dirty, bloody smell, and the heat made the atmosphere thick and awful.”"
1855,"In one hospital, powered only by a generator that lit up the emergency room, an armed group entered unseen and robbed patients on two floors, according to doctors. The maternity ward in another hospital had no windows, and pregnant women had to be relocated to an outdoor plaza, doctors said."
1856,"This week, Mr. Maduro explained what his government had determined to be the cause of the power outage: a “cyber electromagnetic attack,” organized by the American government out of Houston and Chicago."
1857,The explanation left Ms. Figueroa and many others unconvinced on the eighth day of the outage in her neighborhood. But then a miracle caught her attention: The lights at last flickered back on.
1858,A cheer erupted as street lamps lit the faces of the neighbors who had been sitting around on a dark lawn. But no one knew how long the electricity would stay or when it would be gone again.
1859,"“It’s something new, the great leveler that we all live through equally,” Ms. Figueroa said."

1872,Barry Diller’s park
1873,"Initially, the plan for a new park on the West Side of Manhattan was modest, and the billionaire Barry Diller was tapped to help fund it. “He embraced the notion, but brought in his own experts and commissioned a space age structure,” The New York Times reported in 2017."
1874,"Before Mr. Diller got involved, the park was projected to cost $35 million; its budget has since ballooned to $250 million."
1875, Jeff Bezos’ planned helipad
1876,"When Amazon was looking to open a major campus, Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio lured it with nearly $3 billion in tax incentives and waterfront property in Long Island City. “They even agreed to allow a helipad for Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive,” The Times’s J.

1897,It’s hard to overstate the revolutionary impact that bicycles have had on mankind.
1898,"Paved roads were made for cyclists, not drivers, one author has argued."
1899,"The Times’s Natalie Angier wrote, “Bicycles also gave birth to our national highway system.” And Ms. Angier also noted that suffragist Susan B. Anthony said, “I think it has done more to emancipate women than any one thing in the world.”"

1901,"In 2008, an East Harlem resident, Dulcie Canton, had not just one but half a dozen jobs: dog-walking, cat-sitting, fine-arts modeling, coffee shop barista, just to name a few. And she biked to each of them. Why? “I was struggling to make MetroCard money,” she said in a recent interview."
1902,"“I thought of cycling as a way to save money, going to my gigs,” Ms. Canton said. Besides, she added, “mass transit is crazy.”"
1903,"So, she hopped on her bike and rode. Later, Ms. Canton connected with other female cyclists of color through groups like Black Girls Do Bike and Brown Bike Girl. “I felt like I found my family,” she said."
1904,"Ms. Canton now works as the Brooklyn organizer for Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that promotes bicycle and pedestrian-friendly policies."
1905,"The “first human-powered two-wheeled machines,” debuted in New York in 1819, according to a news release from the Museum of the City of New York. Those machines did not have pedals, and riders mainly coasted. Those machines were called velocipedes."
1906,Bicycles have evolved a lot since then.
1907,"On Thursday, the museum will open the exhibit “Cycling in the City: A 200-Year History.” It will explore the history and cultures of cycling, as well as the machines themselves. The exhibit includes 150 objects, 14 bicycles and three stationary bicycles."

1917,"“I can read,” the man said. “But it doesn’t taste like it.”"
1918,The people waiting behind me began to shuffle impatiently. The cashier shrugged and shifted his feet. Two other employees moved in closer. I started contemplating whether a smoothie was worth waiting out this scene for.
1919,“I can make you another one if you like?” the cashier said.

1921,"“Nope, that’s all right, it’s good, ” the man said. “I like it, and I was just hoping for the recipe to make it at home.”"

1925,"LISBON — As Portugal lost its colonies around the globe, the country’s nearly six centuries of influence ensured a legacy of distinctive decorative style: delicate filigree jewelry, colorful azulejo tiles, intricate wrought iron work and black-and-white patterned stone sidewalks and praças, or plazas."
1926,"Those limestone surfaces are pedestrian objects in more ways than one: made to be trampled on, day in and day out, in places like Macau and Rio de Janeiro. “They are a carpet that people don’t always notice,” said Luísa Dornellas, director of the Escolas de Jardinagem e Calceteiros, the schools of gardeners and stone pavers."
1927,"But in Lisbon, the heart of Portuguese culture, the pavements are considered works of art. Since the City Council established the paving school in 1986, it has trained 224 calceteiros, or pavers, to maintain the limestone surfaces in the city as well as create new ones."
1928,"The school also provides another benefit: It has codified the technique and archived its history. Stone paving had been a skill handed from generation to generation, taught “through oral tradition. Nothing was written down,” said Ana Baptista, a staff member who handles public relations for the school. “We want to preserve these skills.”"
1929,"Patterned pavements are as much a part of Portugal’s heritage as an after-dinner glass of port. The school’s information sheet says that, in 1842, the first patterned calçada, or pavement, was laid by a group of prisoners under the direction of Lt. Gen. Eusébio Cândido Cordeiro Furtado at the Castelo de São Jorge, the Moorish castle overlooking the city. The paving no longer exists but, at the time its black and white zigzag motif was a big hit. “The people of Lisbon enjoyed so much the pavement,” Ms. Dornellas said, that soon after much of the central Praça de Dom Pedro IV, commonly known as the Praça do Rossio, was paved in waves (about 64,600 square feet of the paving still delights residents and tourists)."
1930,"Within years, many of the city sidewalks and plazas, as well as those in its colonies, were carpeted in small pieces of limestone, some laid in patterns but others just in white stone."
1931,"It took manpower. “Up until the 1990s there were 400 pavers” in Lisbon, Ms. Dornellas said. Then, as concrete and asphalt began to replace stone, the number dwindled to just a handful."
1932,"The creation of the paving school reflected the city’s concern for the artistic heritage, but it also provided hope of jobs in an era of high unemployment in Portugal. Ms. Dornellas, describing the school’s history, told a success story of a man in his 50s, out of work, who studied at the school and then last year set up his own thriving paving business. Other graduates are hired by the city to maintain the public calçadas, which today continue to decorate much of the city; the school also has had trainees in many other countries."
1933,"It can take 18 months to complete the school’s course of study and receive a certificate marking graduates as professional stone pavers. “We now have about 20 students each year,” Ms. Donellas said, and they invariably are men: “We did have two women, but one dropped out.”"
1934,"The work is physically demanding. Jorge Duarte, the school’s master paver and trainer (in Portuguese, mestre calceteiro e formador da escola de calceteiros) demonstrated how it is done."
1935,"Outside the school walls, blazingly white in the strong Portuguese sun, Mr. Duarte had been working on a perfectly flat area of about 22 square feet that had been prepared for paving. A kind of stencil, which the school and its students call a mold, lay on the ground. It was in the shape of a butterfly, about three feet wide; its exterior edges were lined with limestone pieces and then the mold removed so the empty spaces could be filled with stone of a different color."
1936,"The students create molds from sheets of laminate-like material; “they are used a few times and discarded,” Ms. Baptista said. Molds used on public projects, however, are made of wood or metal, which can be used repeatedly. The molds are archived, and the city has stored more than 7,000 in a warehouse."
1937,"When it comes to the patterns that can be created, a paver’s imagination is the only limit. One of the most common is waves, which pay homage to Portugal’s maritime past: “our Golden Age in the 15th and 16th centuries,” Ms. Dornellas said. Ships and dolphins abound, as do references to nature — birds, stars, sunflowers — and motifs such as rosettes and the cross of Christ."
1938,"After surrounding the butterfly mold with white stones, Mr. Duarte lifted the mold and began filling in the empty spaces with black stones. Each stone was a little less than a couple of inches in size, and he had chipped each and every one on all sides to fit precisely."
1939,"Machines can do that work but Mr. Duarte prefers to prepare the stones himself. “Some master pavers like to feel the stone,” Ms. Baptista explained. “The creativity flows from the head into the arm and the hand that breaks the stone.” So Mr. Duarte sat on his low stool — every calceteiros has his own — and went to work with a small hammer. Its metal head is sharp on one end, to chip the stone, and flat on the other, to tamp it down, once in place, tightly against its neighbor."
1940,"For the school’s work, the stones arrive from quarries as small pieces (in earlier years, Ms. Dornellas said, it used to arrive in huge chunks). White and black stones, the most popular colors, along with the less common gray, are from the Serras de Aire e Candeeiros region of central Portugal. The rare yellow and pink are mostly quarried in the southern Alentejo region."
1941,"The small stones create a mosaic, with plenty of cracks, or seams, that allow drainage when it rains. “And they are elastic,” Ms. Baptista said, able to shift and adjust when, say, a tree root grows underneath."
1942,"Once Mr. Duarte had all the stones in place, he picked up a heavy wooden maço, which looks like a small butter churn and can weigh as much as 45 pounds, and pounded them until they were level. Then, using a shovel, he dug into a mound of limestone that had been pulverized in the chipping process, deposited it on the pavement, swept it into the cracks with a broom, and then watered it to create what, once it dried, would be a porous mortar."
1943,"The smaller the stones, and the more complicated the pattern, the longer the work takes; for plain pavements, an artisan can create almost 110 square feet a day, Ms. Dornellas said. But if the pattern is more elaborate, only about 10 square feet a day is possible."
1944,"Somewhere in every pavement is the paver’s signature mark; Mr. Duarte’s is a heart. Several feet from his current project was a section of pavement with a stylized black spider design recently laid by three young men from Latvia under Mr. Duarte’s tutelage. At its center was his mark, a cluster of hearts. And on this particular day, with his hammer in one hand and chunk of limestone in the other, he swiftly chipped the piece into the shape of a heart and handed it, as a memento, to a visitor."
1945,"Portuguese calçada can be found “all across the world, in Rio, Angola, Macau, Mozambique,” Ms. Dornellas said. The United States has some examples, perhaps most notably in the John Lennon memorial in Central Park in New York."
1946,"The school’s staff members, including Isabel Polonia, coordinator of the paving students’ studies, are eager to keep paving relevant in a modern world, and artists have been called upon to create new designs. For example, the street artist Alexandre Manuel Dias Farto, whose tag name is Vhils, created one in 2015 in the Alfama, Lisbon’s old town, to commemorate the fado singer Amália Rodrigues, who died in 1999."
1947,"“The pavement starts on the ground and climbs a wall,” Ms. Baptista said. “When it rains it’s like she’s crying, recreating the emotion of fado.”"
1948,"There even is a city monument to the pavers: Two bronze figures, one crouched and chipping at a stone in his hand, the other using a maço to tamp the surface. The statues, created by Sérgio Stichini in 2006, used to be tucked away on a side street, but in 2017 they were moved to a more prominent place, next to the grand Hotel Avenida Palace in the central Praça dos Restauradores. A plaque at the site reads: “Tribute from the city of Lisbon to the Pavers who build the ground we tread.”"
1949,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia — On a recent afternoon, a Chinese politics student at the University of British Columbia waited outside a seven-bedroom mansion, worth roughly 16 million Canadian dollars, in Vancouver’s exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood, hoping for a glimpse of Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, Canada’s most famous detainee."
1950,"But Ms. Meng, who is out on bail awaiting possible extradition to the United States on fraud charges, did not appear. She is holed up at her other Vancouver home, a six-bedroom house worth approximately 6 million Canadian dollars in the wealthy Dunbar neighborhood, while this one is being renovated."
1951,"“Meng is a source of national pride in China, and I wanted to see a superrich Asian lifestyle,” said the student, Parker Li. “Many Chinese people from mainland China feel she is being unfairly bullied by the United States.”"
1952,"Many Canadians, though, feel differently."
1953,"Three months after her arrest, Ms. Meng has become both a subject of curiosity and a polarizing figure in Vancouver, which has had a significant concentration of Asians stretching back to its founding in the 19th century."
1954,"To some, she is yet another wealthy foreigner who has used the city as a real estate investment, helping make it one of the most unaffordable cities in North America."
1955,"And they contrast her predicament — able to travel relatively freely about the city, if with a GPS tracker around her ankle and under 24-hour surveillance — with that of their fellow citizens, several of whom have been arrested by China in apparent retaliation for Ms. Meng’s arrest."
1956,"[China has accused two Canadian detainees of spying. Read more on the allegations, which are likely to widen a political rift between the countries.]"
1957,Tensions between Canada and China have seldom been more tense.
1958,"On Monday, China accused Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat, of spying and stealing state secrets, which the government said another detained Canadian, Michael Spavor, gave to him."
1959,"The accusation came just days after Canada authorized Ms. Meng’s extradition hearing in Vancouver, which is expected to begin Wednesday at the Supreme Court of British Columbia."
1960,"Since they were detained in December, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have been held in secret detention sites, without visits from lawyers and family members. Another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, faces a death sentence in China for drug smuggling."
1961,"And the legal fight has now spread, with more court actions."
1962,"Over the weekend, lawyers for Ms. Meng announced they were suing members of the Canadian Border Services Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the federal government for breaching her constitutional rights when she was detained for three hours in December before being arrested."
1963,"Further ratcheting up the acrimony, Huawei is preparing to sue the United States government for banning federal agencies from using the company’s products."
1964,"In Vancouver, the case against Ms. Meng has played into a citywide fixation with skyrocketing real estate prices and the effect of foreign investment."
1965,"“Meng has tapped into anger and resentment here at the incredible inequality in Vancouver, this idea that foreigners are buying freedom here and turning Vancouver into a hedge city where you park your money but you don’t stay,” said Andy Yan, an adjunct professor at Simon Fraser University who studies the social consequences of Vancouver’s real estate explosion."
1966,"“People are upset that she is under house arrest in a mansion while two Canadians sit in Chinese jails,” he added."
1967,"Mr. Yan noted that her residence in the house in the Dunbar neighborhood, on the west side of the city, had particularly touched a nerve. The area was emblematic of many others in the city that had once been the domain of the aspirational middle class but had become flooded with foreign capital."
1968,"“Now only millionaires can afford to live there,” he said."
1969,"At dinner parties and cafes across the city, many here have dismissed Ms. Meng as a “poor little rich girl” who, under the terms of her $10 million bail, is allowed to leave her house until an 11 p.m. curfew, including traveling to Richmond, a nearby city with a vibrant Chinese community, dim sum restaurants and sprawling shopping malls selling designer brands."
1970,"“If you have to be in prison this doesn’t seem like a bad one to be in,” said Karen Weichel, a neighbor of Ms. Meng in Dunbar, pointing to the executive’s spacious home, guarded by several teams of security guards in suits sitting in Cadillac SUVs."
1971,"They are charged with, among other things, ensuring she doesn’t try to escape."
1972,"The other day, a security guard outside her Dunbar house, said that in recent weeks, she had kept a low profile and stayed at home. On one occasion she bought pizza for the journalists outside the home."
1973,"A purple sedan with “Bubba” on its license plate was parked in the back of the house, blocking the driveway."
1974,"A Chinese neighbor from Beijing who was out walking her dog said that after Ms. Meng’s release on bail, she had run into her on the street as she was getting into her chauffeur-driven car."
1975,"“We find it hard to accept what Canada is doing,” she said. “It doesn’t seem to be able to distinguish between good and evil and we hope that Ms. Meng will come out of this safely.”"
1976,"Ms. Meng herself pays for a team of guards from Lions Gate Risk Management Group, a private security firm, who monitor her, keep a log book and note every person entering and leaving the house."
1977,"Those who offered collateral to facilitate her bail reflected the city, where pedestrians with yoga mats can be seen walking and residents talk obsessively about property: They included a part-time yoga instructor and the realtor who sold Ms. Meng and her husband their two imposing homes."
1978,[Want more Canadian coverage in your inbox? Sign up for our weekly Canada Letter newsletter.]
1979,"Ms. Meng is the eldest daughter of Ren Zhengfei, Huawei’s founder, and rose from being a secretary to the company’s public face. During her bail hearing in December, her lawyer, David Martin, said she was looking forward to spending some quality time with her family during her detention."
1980,"She hadn’t “read a novel in years,” he told the court, adding that she was considering pursuing a doctorate in business administration at the University of British Columbia, where Huawei is financing millions of dollars of research, including into 5G wireless networks."
1981,"Mr. Li, the university student who studies China’s political economy, said Ms. Meng’s case had divided students on campus, with some from mainland China tending to sympathize with her plight and others viewing her arrest as Canada merely trying to apply the rule of law."
1982,"Wenran Jiang, a senior fellow at the Institute of Asian Research at the University of British Columbia, noted that for some Chinese immigrants in the city, Ms. Meng’s arrest had tapped into deep-seated historical memories of Canada’s discrimination against Chinese people."
1983,"Between 1885 and 1923 the Canadian government imposed a “head tax” on Chinese immigrants intended to limit arrivals. And Chinese immigration, with rare exception, was banned altogether in 1923, a ban that lasted more than two decades."
1984,"“Vancouver is a very Asian city so there is a deep fascination with Meng because she is such a high-profile Chinese person,” he said. “For some, she has become a powerful symbol of Chinese people once again being subjugated.”"
1985,"LONDON — It just might be the most adorable thing on four wheels. People smile when one cruises by. They point, they wave, they use the word “cute” a lot, and they ask, “What is that?”"
1986,"The tiny Nissan Figaro has an almost cartoonish design that is guaranteed to stand out. To an American living in Britain, who regularly spots pristine Figaros, it would appear to be a highly popular model that was made recently."
1987,"Every part of that guess is wrong: The Figaro is rather old, built for the 1991 model year, and there never were large numbers anywhere. Nissan never even exported it from Japan."
1988,"Yet here it is in Britain, in the thousands, an oddball little convertible with an ardent following and a back story that is even odder."
1989,More on that in a minute.
1990,"Britain never had dominant carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. Instead, for generations, it had a profusion of small-to-medium manufacturers."
1991,"Those carmakers produced a much wider array of designs than their American counterparts, a good number of them quirky, small, underpowered, none too practical — and beloved by their many admirers."
1992,"But in the face of foreign competition, recessions, bankruptcies and consolidation, British car manufacturing plummeted from its peak in the early 1970s. Brands like Morris, Triumph, Austin, Sunbeam, Daimler, Rover and Reliant died off."
1993,"An increasingly competitive and global market had less room for eccentric cars, British or not, or for models that sell only a few thousand."
1994,"“Cars have lost their personality,” said Nic Caraccio, a devoted Figaro owner and trader who lives outside London. “If you go out on the street now, the Citroëns and Vauxhalls and Skodas and Peugeots, they’re all black or white or silver, and they all look the same. Not the Fig.”"
1995,"Definitely not. And it is the look that entices people here — the curvy, throwback shape, and the front end that could have been the face of one of the animated characters in the movie “Cars.”"
1996,"“The quirkiness, there’s something very British about it, isn’t there?” said Colin Bullock, a harbormaster in London. “It’s so familiar to people, even if they’ve never seen it before. They say, ‘Oh, I used to have one of those in 1962,’ which is impossible, and I just smile.”"
1997,"Owners join Figaro clubs and Facebook groups, give their cars names, often buy more than one per family, and sometimes pay over 10,000 pounds, or $12,500 — more than the car cost new."
1998,"They drive in Figaro rallies and attend classic car shows, proudly displaying their budget compacts the way other people show off their pricey Aston Martins and Rolls-Royces."
1999,"People who took their Figaros to a show in Guildford, a town southwest of London, said one of its best features was the built-in social circle. That comes in handy when the owner’s manual is written only in Japanese."
2000,"“The one thing that worried me when I met my husband, Ian, was whether he would love the car,” said Zoe Collier, who lives in Surrey, runs training courses and calls her car Figlet. He did."
2001,"The Figaro may look a bit like a sporty roadster, but performance is hardly the point. It has a small engine, just under one liter, and the only transmission available was a pedestrian three-speed automatic."
2002,"It has an unusual “fixed profile” convertible roof — the middle folds down, but the sides stay put. The legroom in what passes for a back seat would cramp all but the smallest passengers."
2003,"“It really harks back to the more interesting cars in the past, when there was more of a homegrown industry,” said Steve Huntingford, the editor of the British car buying magazine What Car? “A lot of people really loved those cars.”"
2004,"Vehicle production in Britain gradually recovered from its 1980s nadir, but what has emerged is an industry that is not very British. There are six large-scale carmakers in the country — and every one is foreign-owned."
2005,"Niche luxury brands of British heritage like Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Lotus are also now foreign-owned, as is the maker of London’s famed black cabs. The few British makes that are manufactured in Britain by British companies, like Aston Martin and Morgan, account for less than 1 percent of the country’s car production."
2006,"For many years, it has hardly mattered to the British market where cars were made; most vehicles made here are exported, most sold here are imported, and membership in the European Union allows for seamless trade with 27 other countries."
2007,"It could begin to matter a great deal if Britain leaves the union, as it is scheduled to do on March 29. Manufacturers worry that new trade barriers will obstruct both their international supply chains for parts, and the movement of finished products."
2008,"Analysts say that is unlikely to create a renaissance in British manufacturing for British consumption, much less a return of the idiosyncratic products of old. People looking for something really out of the ordinary will have to keep turning to rarities like the Figaro."
2009,"Nissan built the Figaro in pale shades of aqua, green, gray and taupe — one of a few idiosyncratic, limited-edition models the company made in that era."
2010,"The company originally planned to build just 8,000 Figaros, priced at about $8,300, and strictly for the Japanese market."
2011,"Even before sales began, it was clear that demand would far exceed that figure, so Nissan held a lottery to choose its buyers. Celebrities were among those in the running, generating still more interest."
2012,"Nissan expanded production to 20,000, but even so, most would-be buyers were turned away. Despite the unmet demand, the company stuck to its plan to make the car for just one year."
2013,"From early on, a very few appeared in Britain, as people visiting Japan — including Eric Clapton — bought Figaros and had them shipped home."
2014,"The car required only minor modification to be street legal in Britain, and drivers here, as in Japan, sit on the right side of the car."
2015,"Until 2016, the Figaro was barred from the United States because it did not meet emissions and safety standards, but cars become exempt from those rules 25 years after they are made."
2016,"It took several years before a semiregular pipeline to Britain was created by people like Mr. Caraccio, who buy, repair and resell cars, and who began going to Japan to find Figaros and send them back a few at a time. The first big Figaro gathering here was held in 2008."
2017,"More than 3,000 of the cars are registered as being in active use in Britain, but numbers are no longer rising, and the pipeline has slowed to a trickle."
2018,"“There’s only so many, and they’ve been around awhile,” said Peter Pattemore, who drives a Figaro (named Jimmy), as does his wife, Sandra (hers is Sally). “But we’re going to keep them as long we can.”"
2019,"CÚCUTA, Colombia — As the humanitarian aid at the heart of a Venezuelan border standoff remained shut in warehouses on Sunday, and with President Nicolás Maduro’s blockade still intact, it became clear that the opposition leaders trying to oust him had little in the way of a Plan B."
2020,"Juan Guaidó, the top opposition official, and his allies had hoped that forcing the badly needed food and medicine inside Venezuela would represent a moment of irreversible collapse in Mr. Maduro’s authority. Instead, just one aid truck made it through on Saturday, the deadline set by the opposition to end the impasse, and Mr. Maduro easily fended off the biggest challenge to his power since Mr. Guaidó swore himself in as the country’s rightful leader last month."
2021,"Clashes between opposition protesters and forces loyal to Mr. Maduro, which have left four dead since Friday, continued into Sunday, threatening the image of Mr. Guaidó’s nonviolent movement. The military officials crucial to keeping Mr. Maduro in power largely resisted Mr. Guaidó’s call for mass defections, with only about 150 deserting. And even Mr. Guaidó’s own fate remained unclear: After he slipped over the border into Colombia on Friday, disobeying a travel ban, it was anyone’s guess if Mr. Maduro would allow him to return."
2022,"“It was one of the outcomes we had imagined, but it wasn’t the one we wanted,” said Armando Armas, an opposition lawmaker, adding that it was unlikely the organizers would try to get the aid through again soon. “We can’t expose our people any more. The entry of humanitarian aid can’t be the trigger of a wider conflict.”"
2023,"But while Mr. Maduro prevailed in this border showdown, conditions inside the country remain deeply unfavorable to him. He is still immensely unpopular within Venezuela, where he has overseen one of the most catastrophic economic disasters in Latin American history, a calamity that has led a tenth of the population to leave the country, largely because of shortages of food and medicine. Further damage was done to his image on Saturday as he denied aid to suffering Venezuelans."
2024,"Mr. Guaidó, for his part, has galvanized his country, and more than 50 other nations have recognized his claim to the presidency. The Trump administration, a vocal supporter of Mr. Guaidó, has issued crippling sanctions against Mr. Maduro’s state oil company."
2025,"Vice President Mike Pence will arrive on Monday in Colombia, where he plans to meet with Mr. Guaidó and intends to announce “concrete steps” to further pressure Mr. Maduro’s government. That could include more punishing sanctions."
2026,"Still, even if few doubted that the opposition’s resolve would be lost over its failure to deliver the food and medicine, Saturday seemed like a turning point, with new talk of a need for foreign intervention."
2027,"Mr. Guaidó, a 35-year-old who had emerged onto the national stage only in recent months, had sought a political weapon in the arrival of international aid donations. He announced Saturday as the day of an “aid avalanche,” in which his supporters would defy the president and break his control of the borders. The presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay joined the effort, along with the British billionaire Richard Branson, who flew to the border to attend a concert where a lineup of Latin pop musicians urged that the aid be allowed through."
2028,"Yet by day’s end, the avalanche was more like a drop in the bucket."
2029,"Some of the supplies, instead of reaching Venezuelans in need, had been burned after crossing from Colombia. Mr. Maduro, seeing the aid as undermining his authority, had declared that his country was not a beggar and did not need it. Government forces and allied groups backed up that message with violence, bringing condemnation from the United Nations on Sunday."
2030,"Thwarted at the border, the opposition began rallying around the banner of foreign action to topple Mr. Maduro. Ahead of the meeting with Mr. Pence and other regional leaders in Bogotá on Monday, Mr. Guaidó wrote on Twitter that “we must keep all options open for the liberation of our homeland.” Julio Borges, another opposition leader, said he would ask for the use of force at that meeting."
2031,"President Trump has raised some hopes for such an intervention, saying that “the twilight hour of socialism” has arrived in the Western Hemisphere."
2032,"But “the U.S. rhetoric was over the top,” said Charles S. Shapiro, a former ambassador to Venezuela, adding that the statements may have led some in the opposition to believe that military assistance would be on the way if Mr. Maduro blocked the aid."
2033,"As those shipments were stymied, images of violence marked Colombia’s border bridges on Sunday. Near the Santander Bridge, where aid had been burned the day before, dozens of young men hurled stones at Venezuelan security forces and erected barriers."
2034,Others stalked the streets of a nearby neighborhood in search of ingredients to make homemade bombs and masks to ward off tear gas.
2035,"“Yesterday, we brought humanitarian aid, we brought flowers and flags, and we got bullets instead,” said Delbert Rondón, a 34-year-old who had left the western city of Mérida seeking medicine. “I’m here under the bridge helping the boys — I pass them rocks, rags, bottles of water, vinegar. We have to help them because they are the resistance.”"
2036,"Those scenes, however, were ones that the opposition had sought to avoid."
2037,"Major protest movements in 2014 and 2017 started off as peaceful demonstrations, but as the weeks wore on, they were overtaken by groups largely composed of young men who clashed with security forces in the streets. In 2017 alone, the clashes resulted in the deaths of more than 100 people on both sides."
2038,Mr. Guaidó’s movement had appeared to avoid street violence and requests for foreign military intervention.
2039,"After declaring himself president on Jan. 23 to the cheers of crowds, he had amassed hundreds of thousands of supporters on the streets of Caracas, the capital, and other cities in largely peaceful rallies. His strategy was rooted in a mix of civil disobedience and international pressure, urging Mr. Maduro’s military to abandon him, rather than seeking an outside military campaign to topple him."
2040,"“The nonviolent character of these protests is absolutely key in making a difference,” said David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America. “When there’s fighting, it doesn’t go well for a simple reason: Once these protests get violent, they will be no longer massive.”"
2041,"Mr. Smilde added that the more the opposition requests outside military intervention, the less likely it is that Venezuelans will demonstrate in the streets, believing foreign help is near."
2042,"A march on Sunday on the Colombian border was meant to be a model for others to come. Organizers said the plan had been for protesters to walk alongside trucks filled with humanitarian aid across three bridges, persuading soldiers on the other side to let the aid across with appeals that the families of the armed forces suffer the same shortages as most Venezuelans."
2043,"The marchers received blessings by a priest at an encampment at sunrise, and by early afternoon thousands had gathered with white roses and had begun linking arms near the Tienditas Bridge. Organizers planned to use a tow truck to remove shipping containers left as an obstacle by Mr. Maduro’s government."
2044,"At a pedestrian footbridge farther south, cheers erupted as aid trucks began to approach the border, with hundreds of young Venezuelans sitting atop the shipments."
2045,"But then Venezuelan national guard soldiers fired tear gas canisters toward the cars. Many of the protesters stepped off the trucks and rushed the soldiers, throwing stones. Soon, large crowds were tossing rocks up to the stone throwers on the bridge, as opposition activists and Colombian national police officers watched on."

2048,"AUGUSTA, Ga. — “Folks,” the radio host wrote on his Facebook page, “reports of Whitey Lester’s death were apparently incorrect.”"
2049,"It was just before Christmas, and the host, Austin Rhodes, was in the awkward position of retracting his on-air announcement about James Lester, who is known to everyone in Augusta as Whitey — and who remains very much alive."
2050,"It was a cringe-worthy error. But it also set off a mini-explosion of civic speculation about what Augusta, derided as “Disgusta” by detractors, might eventually be like without Mr. Lester, downtown’s very last strip-club impresario, the man whose businesses have for decades offered a lubricious counterpoint to the Masters Tournament, the hallowed yearly pilgrimage for golf fans hosted by the Augusta National Golf Club that begins this week."
2051,"Bartenders, strippers, real estate speculators, golf fans, preachers and politicians — they are all wondering what a post-Whitey Lester world might look like, and whether his clubs really would go with him."
2052,"Despite reports that Mr. Lester, who is in his mid-70s, has been in ill health, his son, Butch Lester, said in a brief interview that his father was nowhere near death, and he lamented that so much seemed to turn on the matter."
2053,"“That’s a lot of fuss for one man living or dying,” he said."
2054,"But it is hard to imagine the town without him. It was Mr. Lester who was responsible for the regionally famous striptease act known as The Snake Lady, an unholy pretzel of human and reptilian flesh that titillated many a golfer, soldier and late-teenage boy. The dancer and a boa constrictor or two would emerge with the “Jaws” theme playing. A voice would announce a visitor from the “Devil’s den.”"
2055,He was the obvious go-to quote for The New York Post in 2010 when it trumpeted the 19th-hole hot-cha-cha that has long defined Augusta’s relationship with its famous golf tournament.
2056,"For years, Mr. Lester was also a headline-generating juggernaut for the local paper. He was the man who defied Bible Belt convention and survived a career in the cross hairs of evangelical Christians, prudish city officials, and even — in that odd way that the long putt of history sometimes breaks — an assistant United States attorney general named Robert S. Mueller III."
2057,"These days, according to his critics, Mr. Lester is also standing in the way of progress. His detractors contend that his two strip clubs along Broad Street, the Discotheque Lounge and Vegas Showgirls, are the last seedy obstacles hindering a downtown revitalization that might finally help Augusta shed its reputation as a sort of unglamorous urban crust around the sparkling green geode that is the Augusta National."
2058,"“We don’t want to continue to be the butt of jokes,” said Matt Aitken, a former member of the city-county commission and a real estate agent who has a number of properties listed near Mr. Lester’s clubs. “We want to be on the cutting edge of economic prosperity, and to be cool.”"
2059,"A former mill town of 200,000 people about a two-hour drive east of Atlanta, Augusta has waited a long time for its makeover. Its urban core suffered more than most, not only from suburbanization, but fire, floods and a bitter 1970 race riot. For decades, the downtown was defined by empty storefronts, pawn shops, and places like the Discotheque, the more famous of Mr. Lester’s clubs."
2060,"But now, finally, there is energy. There is a fledgling tech sector, helped along by the planned move of the United States Army’s Cyber Command headquarters from Virginia to nearby Fort Gordon. There is a handsome new $40 million convention center and a lovingly restored 1940 theater. There are pedestrians. There is a restaurant on Broad Street that serves quail bisque and pork belly rillette."
2061,"It all starts to taper off the closer one gets to the block with the strip joints, to the chagrin of the real estate agents dreaming of lofts and coffee shops. That block “is like a big missing tooth in the whole city,” said Jonathan Aceves, an agent and head of the neighborhood association for Olde Town, the residential area just to the east."
2062,"But the fate of that block of Broad Street and the mortality of Mr. Lester are tangled like woman and snake. The law made it so. In 1994, when six strip clubs were operating downtown, city officials made it illegal for nude clubs to serve alcohol. But they allowed the owners of the existing clubs, including Mr. Lester, to keep their alcohol licenses until the clubs closed or the owner died."
2063,And so everybody waits.
2064,"They do not mean anything personal by it. But “people made business decisions based on the fact that these clubs would eventually close,” said Joe Edge, president of Sherman & Hemstreet, the company where Mr. Aitken works."
2065,"Augusta is the birthplace of the Southern Baptist Convention and, predictably, many have wanted Mr. Lester gone. In 1986, the mayor at the time, Charles A. DeVaney, was livid when a photo book meant to celebrate America’s cities — and sponsored by the United States Conference of Mayors — used a picture of the Discotheque to illustrate the city."
2066,"“Savannah gets the river, Macon a beautiful fountain and Augusta gets a nightspot that advertises a snake lady,” Mr. DeVaney complained."
2067,"In 1991, city leaders, still on the warpath, passed a law that banned nude dancing in clubs that sold alcohol. But the Discotheque management filed a court challenge and got an injunction, and the Georgia Supreme Court eventually ruled the law unconstitutional."
2068,"The next year, Mr. Lester faced his biggest test when he was indicted on four counts of underpaying federal income tax, part of a four-year investigation into what federal officials believed was an illegal gambling operation being run out of the Discotheque and a cavernous pool hall Mr. Lester owns next door called Riverfront Pub & Sports."
2069,"According to court documents, Mr. Mueller authorized the local United States attorney’s office to apply for an order allowing the wiretap of Mr. Lester’s office. The Discotheque and the pool hall were seized and padlocked by federal officials on a Friday morning in February. The authorities also seized hundreds of thousands of dollars — and hauled away the snakes."
2070,"More than a dozen people pleaded guilty to gambling charges as part of the inquiry. But the civil and criminal cases against Mr. Lester went nowhere. His properties were returned to him on April 3, just before the start of that year’s Masters Tournament."
2071,"Benjamin E. Nicholson V, one of Mr. Lester’s lawyers at the time, said that Mr. Lester was relieved to open just before the crush of Masters traffic. “Whitey had a contingent of Japanese that would spend a million bucks at the Masters,” Mr. Nicholson recalled, “and that made his year.”"
2072,Mr. Nicholson recalled that one snake died in federal custody and taxpayers compensated Mr. Lester handsomely for it.
2073,"When it comes to the local power structure, Mr. Lester has always counted powerful friends among his enemies. Few were surprised when, in 2012, he served as an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of the longtime local sheriff. And few were surprised when, in the run-up to this year’s Masters Tournament, city officials briefly considered a proposal that would allow Mr. Lester to pass his license down to family members."
2074,"When Mr. Edge caught wind of the proposal, he raised hell, and filed an online petition opposing it. It garnered 1,500 signatures and the idea went nowhere."
2075,"While it is legal to operate a strip club beyond downtown in Augusta’s industrial zones, none have opened because of a prohibition on liquor licenses. But this week, amid concerns that tourism might be impacted by a dearth of strip clubs, Augusta commissioners agreed to lift the prohibition. It was not immediately clear whether the Lester family would move their businesses."
2076,"On a recent afternoon at the Riverfront Pub, an employee eating chicken fingers at the bar said that Mr. Lester was not available for comment. The place was covered with photos reflecting a life in the nimbus of a certain kind of fame."
2077,"One photo featured Mr. Lester, bearded and smiling and looking like a roadie for a Southern rock band, next to the basketball legend Scottie Pippen. There were photos of gamblers and golfers and expert billiard players named Weenie Beanie and Cornbread Red. There was a photo of Muhammad Ali, signed by the legend: “To Mighty Whitey,” it says. “Good luck.”"
2078,"Later that night at the Discotheque, Gina Virella, 32, a dancer, said she was studying to be a nurse. She was not too worried about her future. Some of the other dancers, she said, would have to move out of town when the place closed."
2079,"There was trap music on the sound system, and a framed newspaper article from the day Mr. Lester beat the feds."
2080,There was also a framed cartoon that showed a lady from the local chamber of commerce with brochures on all of the attractions Augusta wants its visitors to see.
2081,"“Yeah those places sound great,” a bug-eyed male visitor tells her, “But what I’m really looking for is the famous Discotheque!!!”"
2082,"CHICAGO — Just before the dangerously cold temperatures set in across the Midwest this week, Michael Belz was occupied with thoughts of his son Gerald, an 18-year-old in his first year at the University of Iowa."
2083,Classes at the university had been canceled. Campus was only a half-hour away from the Belz home in Cedar Rapids. But Gerald had opted to stay put and wait out the cold snap in his dorm.
2084,"“At the time, I thought that was the smart move,” Michael Belz said, remembering that his son had trouble getting his truck started the weekend before. “I didn’t want him to get stuck somewhere driving. So he decided he would stay.”"
2085,"Early Wednesday morning, as the temperatures were plummeting, Gerald Belz was found unconscious outside a campus building, a short walk from his dorm. He died later at a hospital. Investigators believe his death was related to the subzero temperatures that plunged Iowa and all of the Midwest into a miserable and dangerous cold snap this week."
2086,"He is one of at least 21 people whose deaths, government officials say, are believed to be related to the bitter weather system that has paralyzed the region. The frigid conditions have sent scores of people to hospitals with symptoms of hypothermia or frostbite, and have closed businesses, schools and many colleges."
2087,"Many of the deaths, which occurred since Sunday, were still being investigated, and precise causes had not yet been established. But officials said in each case that they believed the weather had played a role."
2088,"Among those who have perished, according to local coroners, police and fire departments and other officials: Four men found frozen near their homes in Illinois, Wisconsin and Michigan; six people who died in traffic crashes in Iowa; a pedestrian hit with a snowplow in Libertyville, Ill.; a man found dead between two FedEx trucks at a distribution center in East Moline, Ill.; and a woman found frozen to death inside a Milwaukee apartment after the thermostat malfunctioned."
2089,"In the Buffalo area, one person died Thursday while using a snowblower, and another was found dead after shoveling. Earlier in the week, a married couple in their 20s died in Indiana in a car crash, a man in Milwaukee was found dead in his garage after shoveling and a man died of hypothermia in Evanston, Ill."
2090,"In Williamsville, N.Y., outside Buffalo, a homeless man was pronounced dead after being discovered inside a bus shelter on Thursday morning. Helen Tederous, a spokeswoman for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which is investigating the death, said that the man, Lawrence Bierl, 69, had been a fixture in suburban Buffalo for years."
2091,"“He was a real gentle soul,” she said. “He would talk to people a lot. People got to know him.”"
2092,"An official cause of death had not been determined, but Ms. Tederous and a county official said it appeared to be related to the cold."
2093,"Since the polar air mass set in, several cities have hit record low temperatures, and it appeared that Illinois may have broken the state’s all-time low: A weather observer in Mount Carroll, Ill., recorded a temperature of minus 38 degrees Fahrenheit on Thursday morning."
2094,"In Rockford, Ill., temperatures dipped to minus 31, colder than the previous record of minus 27 from 1982. Moline, Ill., also broke a record, reaching minus 33, according to the National Weather Service. So did Cedar Rapids, Iowa, with minus 30."
2095,"Officials across the Midwest told of harrowing rescues and perilous situations. The Illinois State Police assisted more than 1,300 drivers over one eight-hour period, and the Coast Guard used air boats to rescue seven people stranded in an ice shanty on Lake Michigan off Sturgeon Bay, Wis. A Coast Guard ship sliced through the ice on Lake Huron to rescue a woman needing medical attention on Mackinac Island, Mich. And in Wheeling, Ill., nine members of a family, including a 2-month-old infant, were hospitalized for carbon monoxide exposure after apparently trying to keep their house warm using a charcoal grill in addition to the furnace."
2096,"The weather forecast suggested that some relief was ahead for the Midwest, with temperatures expected to poke above zero by Thursday night. But forecasters warned of a continuing cold wave in the Northeast, with heavy snow in some places and subzero wind chills in others."
2097,[Read more about the warmer weather on the way here.]
2098,"In Iowa, the Belz family said it was awaiting more information from the police about Gerald’s death, and University of Iowa officials said that counselors had been made available to help students."
2099,"On Monday, the university had canceled classes for part of Tuesday, all of Wednesday, and Thursday morning because of the weather. Michael Belz said he had no idea what his son might have been doing that took him outside his dorm room in the early morning hours on Wednesday."
2100,"Officials at the local medical examiner’s office said they had performed an autopsy, but did not have final results and would not release information on the cause of death until they did. University of Iowa police said their investigation was continuing, but that Gerald Belz’s death was believed to be related to the weather."
2101,"A pre-med student, he had been in contact with his girlfriend, Leeanne Mehring-Cruz, through text messages and Snapchat video in the hours before he died, but had dropped off social media around 1 a.m."
2102,"Ms. Mehring-Cruz, who lives in Cedar Rapids, said she had been seeing Gerald Belz for two years. She described him as sweet and brilliant, someone who only showed his soft side to his closest family and friends. One of the last things he wrote that last night, she said in an interview conducted over Twitter, was that he loved how she was always there for him through everything."
2103,"“I wish I could have protected him then,” she said."
2104,"Ms. Mehring-Cruz said she is hoping the police will quickly find out where he was going and what happened to him. “I have no clue what he was doing,” she said. “The last messages we sent were I love you’s and good night’s.”"
2105,"Michael Belz said Gerald, the older of his two sons, was careful and compassionate, studious and avid rugby player who wanted to become a doctor. He was already ahead in his college studies because he had completed Advanced Placement classes in high school."
2106,"He played football in high school, but then turned to rugby. “He loved it, much to the chagrin of his mother, who wanted to protect him and keep him safe,” the father said. “He had a great time with it.”"
2107,"The Belzes last saw their son on Sunday evening, when he was visiting home. Snow had started to fall, and Michael Belz urged him to head back to campus before things got too slippery."
2108,"So Gerald gathered up his things, said his goodbyes and drove back to his dorm. Around 10 p.m., he called his mother to give her the customary assurance: He had arrived safely."
2109,"Watching starlings streak through the arches of the bone-white stone amphitheater in Nîmes, you might forget you’re in the South of France and not Rome. The Colosseum look-alike dates to the end of the first century A.D., when Emperor Augustus named this Celtic settlement on the road linking Italy to Spain a Roman colony. Today, Nîmes is more commonly described as sitting between Avignon and Montpellier, and while the Roman soldiers have been replaced with French Foreign Legionnaires, this city of 155,000 is more a charming travel destination than a seat of power."
2110,"Visitors come to Nîmes for its unusually well-preserved monuments — and for newer feats of architecture. Thanks to a push begun in 1984 by then mayor Jean Bousquet, it now has Sir Norman Foster’s 1993 Carré d’Art, a modern art museum with slender pillars that mimic those of the Maison Carrée, the Roman temple across the street, but whose facade is all glass and aluminum; Jean Nouvel’s 1987 Nemausus public housing project, a pair of shiplike buildings with cantilevered balconies; and the just-opened Musée de la Romanité, a new home for the city’s collection of ancient and medieval art and artifacts, with a facade of nearly 7,000 silk-screened glass tiles that appears to ripple in the light — as if the museum is wearing a toga, its architect, Elizabeth de Portzamparc, has said."
2111,"Increasingly, this marriage of old and new extends to other scenes as well. Young chefs can take advantage of one of the finest covered markets in France — filled with locally made olive oil (the best comes from Oliveraie Jeanjean in nearby Saint Gilles) and wines — and entrepreneurs like the denim designer Guillaume Sagot are reinvigorating local artisanal traditions. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Nîmes was a major textile producer — in fact, the word “denim” derives from “de Nîmes.” “People are receptive to innovation here,” says Sagot. “In Nîmes, you can afford to take a chance.” "

2125,"The liquid, which soon flooded one of Bangkok’s busiest intersections, came from water cannons aimed at alleviating the smog that has shrouded Bangkok for weeks."
2126,"Pedestrians squealed as the plumes of water shot into the air. A vendor of coconut ice cream failed to stop his pushcart from careening into a sewer. A rat scurried, then swam."
2127,Some of the giant hoses were connected to trucks that only contributed to the bad air afflicting Bangkok. Smoke spewed from the trucks’ exhaust pipes. Officials from Thailand’s Pollution Department estimate that vehicle emissions account for roughly 60 percent of the city’s chemical haze.
2128,"A decade ago, the Thai capital was a rarity in Asia, a place where the air had gotten cleaner largely because of a ban on the most polluting vehicles. Those days are gone."
2129,"Earlier this month, Bangkok cracked the list of the top 10 cities with the foulest air on the planet."
2130,"My sons’ school, like more than 400 across the Thai capital, will be closed on Thursday and Friday because of the smog."
2131,"Like many Asian megalopolises, which crowd the catalog of the world’s most polluted cities, Bangkok suffers from a toxic amalgam: unchecked industrialization and urbanization, a car-crazy populace and lax regulation. The burning of fallow fields and a dry season with little wind exacerbate the crisis."
2132,"Even as pollution control monitors say they are eliminating the dirtiest diesel engines, a walk on a Bangkok road can be a choking experience. City buses belch murky smoke. There are too many cars for too few roads, and too little interest in public transportation."
2133,"“In our society, a car is not just a car,” said Tara Buakamsri, the Thailand country director for Greenpeace Southeast Asia. “It’s a representation of affluence and a symbol of ownership. It will be very hard to get people to give up their cars.”"
2134,"Having lived for many years in China, my family is well acquainted with dirty air."
2135,I used to joke that we left Beijing in 2014 as pollution refugees. I had tired of strapping little face masks on our boys just so they could commute to school. On many days they couldn’t play outside at all.
2136,The smiling panda patterns on their masks couldn’t disguise the fact that fine particulate matter is particularly corrosive for children’s lungs.
2137,"The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution caused 4.2 million premature deaths in 2016, claiming far more lives annually than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined."
2138,"We moved from Beijing to Shanghai just as the air there got worse. A couple of years ago, I didn’t realize that our dishwasher had caught fire and was sending smoke throughout the house because everything was already so murky from the pollution."
2139,"Then we moved to Bangkok. Like China, Thailand seems to be going through the same cycle: denial of a chronic problem, ineffectual solutions and then a sudden realization that the chemical miasma isn’t going to magically disappear without coordinated policies."
2140,"For years, Beijing residents spoke of fog rather than smog. When the reality finally hit, the government considered some outlandish ideas, like using giant fans to blow the pollution out of town."
2141,"Scientists agree that spraying jets of water, especially from polluting trucks, will do little to disperse Bangkok’s smog."
2142,"“There are some government agencies that want to help decrease the pollution, but maybe this is not the best thing,” said Pralong Dumrongthai, the director general of the Pollution Control Department of Thailand, in a delicate assessment of the water cannon treatment."
2143,Nor will other unorthodox methods — like water-spraying drones that have been deployed in recent days in Bangkok — fix the chronic air problem.
2144,"Even as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha of Thailand, the head of the military junta that seized control of the country in 2014, played down Bangkok’s pollution, shopkeepers were told they could be liable to up to seven years in prison for hoarding masks."
2145,"The persistent smog has become a rallying cry for some people in Bangkok, where the aftermath of years of coups, street protests and army crackdowns has made the city seem, at least outwardly, an apolitical place."
2146,The current junta has repeatedly postponed national elections — the latest date is set for March 24 — yet there has been little mass outrage expressed about the slow return to a nominal democracy.
2147,"Years of restrictions on free speech and assembly by the National Council for Peace and Order, as the junta is known, have had their effect, even if young people are eager to cast their first-ever ballots."
2148,"But the spike in air pollution has been front-page fare here — eclipsing the news trickling out earlier this month about the bodies of two exiled Thai dissidents found by the Mekong River, their abdomens stuffed with concrete blocks."
2149,"News of the murders was buried in much of the local news media. Instead, editorials demanded answers from the junta about the unhealthy air."
2150,"In China, pollution became a proxy for discontent that could not be expressed in other ways. People began to question the implicit pact made with their authoritarian leaders: We’ll improve your material life, but don’t question how you are ruled."
2151,But what if double-digit growth rates result in a poisoned earth and air? Many Chinese began a national rethink.
2152,"Here, too, ordinary citizens are criticizing the junta for its slow response to the pollution, even if they might not speak out on other political issues."
2153,"For all that lures tourists to Bangkok — orchids, cheap massages, mango and sticky rice — this is not a city that pampers its residents. Proper pavements are a rarity. Tangles of power lines dangle dangerously. A profusion of plastic bags chokes canals and ever-expanding trash heaps."
2154,"Much of the fauna that flourishes, like cockroaches, rats the size of cats and the occasional python snaking in through a toilet, is of the alarming variety."
2155,Yet Bangkok’s charms are undeniable.
2156,"Even in the ugliest agglomeration of concrete, a spray of bougainvillea pushes its way through the cracks. Spirit houses adorned with offerings of red Fanta soda nourish the city’s soul. Dusty ficus trees are wrapped with ribbons, as if their ability to flourish in such a dense urban setting is a gift to the 10 million people who call the metropolitan area home."
2157,"As I was flying back to Bangkok this month, my heart sank as the plane descended into an ocher haze. It was the same feeling of dread I had when returning to China. In the taxi home, my driver was wearing a mask. He shook his head at the bad air. Almost immediately, we got stuck in traffic."
2158,"But, like many drivers in Bangkok, he had hung a garland of jasmine on the rearview mirror. The sweet scent mixed with the exhaust fumes. I was home."
2159,"BANGKOK — In the fall of 2015, I witnessed a late-night kidnapping. The perpetrators weren’t seeking cash, gold or any kind of ransom. They didn’t bother to wear masks."
2160,"They belonged to a Baptist vigilante crew sworn to bring wrath upon drug users. Sure of their righteousness, the men let me tag along and observe their crimes: home invasions, assaults and the abduction of a gaunt day laborer with a speed habit."
2161,"We were in the Himalayan foothills of Myanmar, near the border with China, the heart of the world’s largest methamphetamine trade. It is here that drug lords continue to churn out one of the Southeast Asian underworld’s top-selling products: little candy-pink pills, packed with methamphetamine, that smell a lot like vanilla frosting."
2162,"The pills are becoming more popular in the region than heroin or even marijuana. Armed syndicates produce roughly two billion of these speed tablets a year — more than triple the number of coffees Starbucks sold worldwide in 2015. The rampancy of meth in Southeast Asia has convulsed the people and politics of the region, roiling it with social upheaval with maxed-out prisons, police killings and vigilantes."
2163,The crisis is worsened by the United States.
2164,"Consider the rise of Pat Jasan, that vigilante collective in Myanmar’s upcountry. First assembled in 2014, it now claims to have thousands of adherents."
2165,"In the local language, Kachin, the group’s name refers to “cleansing” the land of drugs. The Kachin are an ethnic minority who were Christianized in the 19th century by American missionaries — and their leaders use church networks to orchestrate this underground resistance to the meth trade."
2166,"Pat Jasan is notorious for its motorbike cavalries, thundering through villages and hunting down drug users. This is what I saw when I joined them in Myitkyina, the country’s northernmost major outpost."
2167,"That rainy night, they stormed the farmhouse of a man on their list. More than two dozen men stampeded into his bedroom, yanking open drawers and ripping up floorboards. This search turned up a meth bong with that vanilla smell."
2168,"The home’s inhabitant — a sheepish man in a tattered sarong — was then hauled away. They brought him to a nearby house hidden on the grounds of a church. I winced as they flogged his back raw with bamboo rods and, to punish him further, forced his legs into medieval wooden stocks."
2169,"Pat Jasan’s leaders defend these tactics as ugly but necessary, a desperate clawing back at the meth scourge imperiling all of Asia. But after the raid, I wondered: Why did they allow me to witness their violence?"
2170,"Repeatedly, vigilantes told me they hope to draw America’s gaze — to provoke the consciousness of that powerful Christian nation, which once gave them the word of God and might now lend its might to their holy crusade against drugs."
2171,That may sound far-fetched. But these vigilantes have reason to view the United States as a partner.
2172,"America’s top allies in the region — Thailand and the Philippines — are both executing versions of our American-style war on drugs. These campaigns enjoy American funding, training and moral support, drawing only a tsk-tsk when they turn vicious."
2173,"In Thailand, officials have followed America’s example by erecting the region’s largest prison system. Around 70 percent of Thai inmates are locked up on drug charges, an overwhelming majority caught with meth pills. While embedded with the Thai police, I saw them drag random pedestrians or motorists off the street and test their urine for drugs. Thai prisons are now so jam-packed that inmates often sleep on crowded cement floors, some forced into spooning positions to save space."
2174,"It’s even scarier in the Philippines, where the police and death squads stalk the slums in search of meth smokers and low-level dealers. More than 12,000 have been killed in just a few years. President Rodrigo Duterte campaigned — and won — on promises to dump so many dealers’ bodies into the sea that the “fish will grow fat.”"
2175,"Despite scattered rebukes from American lawmakers, the United States has funded and trained the police engaging in this bloodletting. Moreover, when these killings were in full swing in 2017, President Trump told Mr. Duterte to “keep up the good work — you’re doing an amazing job.”"
2176,Leaders around the region took notice. Violent crackdowns on meth users are now spreading to Bangladesh and Indonesia. The leaders don’t appear to fear American pushback — and why should they? Congress has continued doling out millions in “counternarcotics” funding to all three countries.
2177,These are just the most blatant ways in which the American government is tangled up in Asia’s meth wars. Less obvious is the link between the region’s meth appetite and our society’s voracious consumerism.
2178,"In the United States, meth is portrayed as a tooth-rotting gutter drug. Yet in Southeast Asia, those pink pills are often taken not to party but to work harder. Each pill brings on a euphoric eight-hour blast, one that zaps boredom and can make repetitive labor pleasurable."
2179,"Stitching name-brand sneakers in a Vietnamese factory, hauling shrimp from Thai waters for export to American supermarkets — all of it becomes more tolerable on meth. This drudge work in Asia fills our pantries and closets. It underwrites middle-class lives in the West, supplying our homes with cheap food, cheap clothes and cheap gadgets."
2180,"So while many Americans become transfixed by opioids, a drug of despair and letting go, meth use in Southeast Asia often reflects reckless ambition — to work that double shift, hit that quota and squirrel away more cash, perhaps for your children’s education."
2181,"If the American government really wanted to help lift meth’s spell over Asia, it might divert more foreign aid toward rehab centers instead of dubious police personnel. Or we’d urge decriminalization-style policies designed to heal addicts instead of piling them up in cages."
2182,"But such thinking goes against an American crusade to propagate hard-line policies at home and abroad since the Nixon era. And though the Trump administration’s policy toward Southeast Asia is largely incoherent, the American drug war in the region keeps chugging along on autopilot, just as it has through a succession of presidents."
2183,"It was President Barack Obama who started funding Myanmar’s anti-narcotics agency. The agency operates under Myanmar’s armed forces, which are notorious for torturing dissidents and ethnic cleansing. This army also created and oversees militias that are major players in the behemoth meth business."
2184,"While one tentacle of Myanmar’s security apparatus traffics pink meth pills, another receives millions of American tax dollars to fight the spread of those very drugs."
2185,"In its most recent budget, Congress re-upped Myanmar’s annual anti-narcotics funding with a fresh $3 million. This amount, while small, confers legitimacy that Myanmar badly craves, especially since some of the country’s top generals face accusations by the United Nations of genocide against Rohingya Muslims."
2186,"If this is the best Washington can offer, then doing nothing would be better. We should stop funding, training and equipping anti-narcotics operations in Southeast Asia that increase incarceration and death."
2187,"Just a few days after that man was kidnapped in Myanmar, I returned to Pat Jasan’s command center to check on him. He was out of the stocks, up and about, nodding along to a lecture from the Baptists."
2188,"They ordered him to ritually burn his plastic meth bong on an altar. As it turned liquid in the flames, the man’s captors held his hand and prayed for his salvation."
2189,"Then they sent him back to his farmhouse with a sore back. The man never deserved to be kidnapped and tormented. But that punishment sure beats wasting years in a sweltering cell in Thailand or, worse yet, getting shot dead by cops in the Philippines."

2193,THE AGE OF LIGHT By Whitney Scharer
2194,"The trend of publishing novels that dramatize the lives of people who actually lived — bio-fiction — carries on full steam. The subjects are most often women whose stories have been overshadowed by the more famous men they lived with: Frank Lloyd Wright’s wife, Hemingway’s first wife, Hemingway’s third wife, Charles Lindbergh’s wife, Freud’s mistress and so on. The 20th-century photographer Lee Miller (1907-77) fits neatly into this category, having been Man Ray’s mistress for several years."
2195,"Miller’s life offers rich material to the novelist. Behind her icy blond beauty and garçonne figure — she was a sought-after model in New York and Paris, where she spent years hobnobbing with Surrealists and the staff of French Vogue — she was one of the few women journalists accredited to cover World War II. Later in life, she became Lady Penrose when her husband received a peerage. And underneath it all, she had had a traumatic childhood, having been raped at age 7 by a friend of the family and infected with gonorrhea as a result."
2196,"In her debut novel, “The Age of Light,” Whitney Scharer delves with great sensitivity into this past and its effect on Lee, how it made her a lively, spirited young woman who was aware of her power over men yet never able to trust them, someone who strove to become an artist and longed for personal and professional freedom. Yet the pedestrian, realist form the novel takes is baffling: Why write a conventional novel about a pair of visionary experimental artists who transformed photography from something meant to document reality into an expressive form of art?"
2197,"Scharer traces the arc of the love affair between Lee and Man Ray in the late 1920s and early ’30s, from their early attraction as they worked side by side in his studio to the slow corrosion of their relationship. Though they are brought together through love of their work and their experiments in the darkroom, Lee’s control issues are a mismatch for Man Ray’s jealousy and fragile sense of his own masculinity; at one party the Surrealists wonder whether he is homosexual, and he offers up “Exhibit A” — Lee — in his own “defense.” Madame Man Ray, as she’s known around town, isn’t amused."
2198,"Lee discovered the process she and Man Ray would call solarization, by which a negative is exposed to light in the darkroom; this produces images in which, as Scharer puts it, “there has been some sort of reversal, and all around the image, where the light and dark areas of the composition meet, there is a fine black line, as if someone has traced it with a soft pencil.” In Scharer’s novel, Lee excitedly shows Man her fortuitous mistake: “When she and Man make eye contact, she can tell he feels it too: a sense that they are doing something momentous. To be able to manipulate the negative itself, its chemical properties, the very nature of it, rather than to alter it manually by scratching or cutting — it feels as if they are creating a new medium altogether.”"
2199,"The work Miller and Man Ray made using this technique moved photography from the faithful representation of a person or a thing in a given time and place to an art capable of presenting the world not as it objectively appeared but as the photographer saw it or felt it. Miller’s and Man Ray’s literary contemporaries were dedicated to a similar pursuit on the page. “Life is not a series of gig lamps symmetrically arranged,” Virginia Woolf wrote in 1919, in terms that resonate with the fuzzy, ethereal quality of the solarized photograph, but “a luminous halo, a semitransparent envelope surrounding us from the beginning of consciousness to the end.” But this is precisely what is missing from Scharer’s novel: any sense that language can be “solarized” like a photograph, that life’s “luminous halo” can register on the page."
2200,"The novel’s tone often devolves to the level of the bodice ripper (“It pleases her, how irresistible she is to him”) or the mall (“Lee wants to roll her eyes but restrains herself”; reader, I did not restrain myself). When Scharer intersplices short scenes from Miller’s time as a photojournalist during the war, the juxtaposition is promising, but doesn’t quite work; the Man Ray material unfolds at so leisurely a pace that it feels jarring when she interrupts it to flash forward."
2201,"Vignettes that show Lee in 1966 at the novel’s opening and 1974 at its close are bizarre and ineffectual, not to mention selective about Miller’s actual circumstances: Her son, Antony, is nowhere to be seen; her marriage to Roland Penrose is written off as a “mistake” with no explanation as to why. Nor is any mention made of Lee’s short-lived 1934 marriage to the Egyptian investor Aziz Eloui Bey. Writers of historical fiction may of course take artistic license with their material to streamline or enhance what we see of a subject’s life. However, presenting Lee late in life, as Scharer does, as a depressed alcoholic dying of lung cancer who no longer much cares if her achievements receive any recognition doesn’t chime with the Lee we see in most of the novel."
2202,"It’s a shame because Scharer is herself a talented image-maker. In one of the wartime interludes, Lee poses for a picture in Hitler’s bathtub, taking her first bath in three weeks. Scharer describes her getting a glimpse of herself in the mirror, where she sees that “her neck and face are Army-issue brown, the dirt almost topographic where it has dried on various layers of sweat.” Scharer also excels at conjuring Lee’s ever-evolving understanding of the power of images. Working with Jean Cocteau on his film “The Blood of a Poet,” Lee “begins to understand photography as cinematic. When she takes a picture, she is laying claim to one moment out of a moving stream of a thousand potential moments, and the act of choosing it, of removing it from its context, is part of what makes it art.”"
2203,"The question of context is a key issue in historical novels. They are often accused of providing escapist fantasies of the past; this is unfortunately the case here as Scharer succumbs to the mythology of Paris in the early 1930s. The global financial crisis barely registers: We are with Lee as she slurps oysters and Champagne in Montparnasse with Man Ray or drinks absinthe with a sexy set designer. Everything is just a little too period-accurate. Of course Josephine Baker is performing the night that Lee goes to Bricktop’s; of course she’s singing “Blue Skies,” the lyrics aligning perfectly with Lee’s own hopeful mood. “The song feels exactly right,” Scharer notes, and this platitude captures what feels exactly wrong with the book. Josephine Baker, the absinthe, “perfect corkscrews of lemon peel” in a martini glass: These become not touchstones of Lee Miller’s lived reality, but metonyms for glamour."
2204,"At a Surrealist salon, early in the novel, Lee hears Claude Cahun give a reading from her autobiography, “Disavowals”: “I want to stitch, sting, kill, with only the most pointed extremity. … To travel only at the prow of myself.” “Lee,” Scharer writes, “doesn’t know — or really care — if she has fully understood what Claude was getting at, but she wants to be how the words made her feel: alone but not lonely, needing no one, living her life with intention.” Scharer turns Cahun’s manifesto into Lee’s personal slogan, which she repeats to herself periodically, robbing it of its aesthetic power, blunting its sting. Yet for Cahun, and for Miller as well, there is no separating the personal from the image from the political context; all are bound up together. At Dachau, Lee thinks of her film canisters as “grenades” she sends back for publication. “The Age of Light” flickers companionably, but never ignites a fire."

2206,Good morning. 
2207,"President Trump and Republicans go on the offensive, British Parliament grabs control of the Brexit process, and Copenhagen puts up a fight against climate change. Here’s the latest: "
2208,"As the president declared victory in the wake of the Mueller report, he and Republican allies vowed to pursue and even punish those responsible for the Russia investigation."
2209,"He called his adversaries “treasonous” and said they should be investigated. “Those people will certainly be looked at,” he said. Many of his allies agreed, while Democrats weighed whether to shift their focus entirely."
2210,"Republican response: Senator Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, announced that he would investigate whether there is any anti-Trump bias at the F.B.I. and Justice Department, and called for a new special counsel inquiry to look at the origins of the last one. "
2211,Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign also lobbied television networks to blackball Democrats who advanced the collusion theory.
2212,"Democratic response: While many 2020 candidates have demanded the release of the Mueller report in full, some top Democrats are urging them to instead focus on issues like immigration, tax policy and health care."
2213,"Britain’s Parliament took control on Monday of the government’s efforts to leave the European Union, inflicting on Prime Minister Theresa May a rebuke not suffered by any recent predecessor."
2214,"After months of deadlock, lawmakers passed an amendment giving themselves the power to vote on alternatives to the government’s Brexit plan. Members of Mrs. May’s cabinet openly discussed contradictory Brexit policies, and rumors swirled of a plot to replace her. "
2215,"What’s next? Several of Mrs. May’s Conservative Party lawmakers called on her to name a date for her departure from power. She has already said she will not lead the party into the next general election, which is due to take place in 2022."
2216,Britain will remain in the E.U. at least until April 12. What happens after that is anyone’s guess.
2217,The alternatives: Options include a “soft Brexit” that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures; a second referendum that could potentially revoke Brexit completely; and leaving without any deal. 
2218,A family that has funded some of the world’s most renowned art institutions is being turned away by many of those museums amid outrage over its links to the opioid crisis. 
2219,"Members of the Sackler family own Purdue Pharma, the maker of the frequently abused painkiller OxyContin. While the drug’s potential for abuse has been known for two decades, only recently has Purdue’s controlling family come under intense scrutiny. "
2220,"Several museums, including the Tate museums in London and the Guggenheim in New York, have rejected any future gifts, concluding that some family members’ ties to the opioid crisis outweighed the benefits of their six- and sometimes seven-figure checks."
2221,"The Sacklers’ reach: Exhibitions and institutions funded by the family can be found at the Louvre in Paris, the Old Royal Naval College in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, Columbia University and Oxford University. "
2222,"Background: Documents submitted in court this year suggested that family members had directed company efforts to mislead the public and doctors about the dangers of abusing the drug, accusations that the Sacklers have denied."
2223,The Danish capital wants to cancel out its greenhouse emissions by 2025. 
2224,"If it manages the remarkable feat, it will be a model for other urban governments on a warming planet. It would require changing how people get around, how they heat their homes and what they do with their trash. "
2225,"Climate change is a top voter issue among Danes. Mayor Frank Jensen of Copenhagen, a city of 624,000, said that city leaders, more than national politicians, felt pressure to act. “We are directly responsible for our cities and our citizens,” he said."
2226,"What it means for the world: Half of humanity now lives in cities, and the vast share of planet-warming gases come from cities. They are both a problem and a potential source of solutions."
2227,Context: Copenhagen has already cut its emissions 42 percent from 2005 levels. Forty-three percent of the city’s population commutes to work and school by bike. 
2228,"Boeing: During flight simulations recreating the problems with the doomed Lion Air plane, pilots discovered that they had less than 40 seconds to override an automated system on Boeing’s new jets and avert disaster."
2229,"Germany: The country’s second-richest family discovered a past connection to Nazis. The Reimann family, which controls JAB Holding Company, commissioned a historian to dig deep into company archives and discovered that two former owners were Hitler supporters who condoned the abuse of forced laborers."
2230,"Accidental landing: A British Airways flight to Germany landed in Scotland instead on Sunday, leaving passengers perplexed. The airline said the company that chartered the plane had submitted the wrong route to air traffic controllers. "
2231,"Israel: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu cut short a trip to the U.S. after a rocket launched from Gaza struck a house in central Israel. The strike left seven people injured, including two children."
2232,"Apple: Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon helped the technology giant unveil its new streaming service, Apple TV Plus, which is set to be introduced in 100 countries this fall. Apple also unveiled Apple News Plus, a news subscription service that will offer access to 300 magazines."
2233,Turkey: Turkey’s banking regulator said it would begin an inquiry into JPMorgan Chase over accusations that the bank provided “misleading and manipulative” investment advice that the regulator said prompted a run on the Turkish lira last week. 
2234,"Traffic: New York is poised to become the first U.S. city to introduce congestion pricing, which would introduce tolls for drivers entering Manhattan’s busiest stretches. The idea aims to reduce gridlock, air pollution and pedestrian injuries. "
2235,"Plant-based healing: Horticultural therapy is used in hospitals, addiction treatment centers, prisons and teen wilderness therapy programs It can involve propagating plants and arranging flowers, and can promote mindfulness and help patients through tough physical therapy. "
2236,Tips for a more fulfilling life.
2237,"Recipe of the day: French onion soup is a familiar classic, but what about French onion grilled cheese?"
2238,"The best opportunities for career development aren’t always in the most influential places. Try finding an outfit that’s on the way up and that offers opportunities to accumulate new skills and social capital, and expand along with it."
2239,"Love your hotel room? Some have become shopping showrooms, allowing guests to take a piece of the vacation home."
2240,"Today is the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Egypt-Israeli peace treaty, a direct offshoot of the 1978 Camp David accords."
2241,"The landmark accords were hashed out in tense talks at Camp David, the rustic presidential retreat in the Catoctin Mountains of Maryland. President Jimmy Carter carried messages and proposals between the cabin of Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and that of President Anwar Sadat of Egypt."
2242,"The retreat as a vacation spot captured the affection of President Franklin Roosevelt, but not of all his successors. Barack Obama preferred visiting Hawaii or Martha’s Vineyard, Mass."
2243,"President Trump goes to his clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., and Bedminster, N.J., rather than Camp David. “It’s nice. You’d like it,” Mr. Trump once said of Camp David, adding, “You know how long you’d like it? For about 30 minutes.”"
2244,"Still, the Navy maintains Camp David as an active military base, ready for a president who will once again routinely make the 30-minute helicopter ride from the White House."
2245,"Mark Landler, a White House correspondent who has visited Camp David, wrote today’s Back Story."

2250,"On an unseasonably warm March afternoon in Brooklyn, the artist Paul Anthony Smith, wearing his usual denim workwear, stands in his studio in front of “Untitled (Duppy Dream in Color too),” a nearly finished, closely cropped, black-and-white photo portrait of a woman wearing a bejeweled crown. Her eyes, emotional and direct, are staring through a geometric pattern that recalls a midcentury breeze-block fence of the kind found in his native Jamaica. Smith, 31, made the barrier by picking for hours at the image with a retrofitted wooden needle tool that he often uses to puncture the surface of his pictures, a technique which evokes both the coming-of-age ritual of scarification once common in West Africa and the luminous pointillism of Georges Seurat. “It sometimes takes a week for me to finish one,” Smith says of his images, as he walks toward the sole window in the work space, located on the fourth floor of an unassuming former factory in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Smith has rented the smallish boxlike space since he moved to New York in 2014 from Kansas City, Missouri, where he studied ceramics at the Kansas City Art Institute. Pinned to the white walls, and still in progress, are four of his signature “picotages” — his word for inkjet pigment prints layered with ornate architectural elements and mounted on museum board — which will go on display on April 4 as part of “Junction,” his first solo exhibition with the Jack Shainman Gallery in Manhattan."

2252,"“The show is inspired by the history of me being a pedestrian at a crossroads where people meet,” he says. “‘Junction’ is about an amazing celebration of people, culture, histories and hardships.” His work, which often depicts joyful everyday scenes from across the African diaspora, abounds with questions of historical memory, the dislocation of colonialism and the tension and ecstasy of making a home in a foreign land. And although the artist is not physically seen in the images, the new layered picotages speak directly to Smith’s own biography, as an immigrant who left his hometown, St. Ann’s Bay in Jamaica, when he was nine years old and moved with his family to Miami. The Smiths, in search of opportunity in a new country, are reflected in the mostly Caribbean subjects, hustling and hanging out, who populate the artist’s collages."
2253,"Tacked to the wall near the studio’s entrance is “Slightly Pivoted to the Sun’s Rhythm,” a work that depicts a beautifully costumed black woman wearing a traditional Carnival outfit. Behind a breeze-block enclosure, she is peacocking her heritage in a procession along Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn during the borough’s annual West Indian Day Parade. The fencing suggests a sly sense of displacement: “Walls are meant to exclude but also protect, and in this case they are used as veils and disguises,” Smith says, examining the image. “It’s like when you come to a new country, do you become a hybrid of your surroundings? Or do you stay who you are within your culture? When I use these images from the West Indian Day Parade, they’re more so about the rhythm, the vibe, the culture and retaining those spirits.” Sitting at a makeshift wooden drafting table in his studio, Smith answered T’s Artist’s Questionnaire."
2254,What is your day like? How much do you sleep and what’s your work schedule?
2255,"Recently I became this person that can’t leave the studio. I’m here all different hours of the day. I just try to sleep while the sun is down. I usually come here at ten and leave anywhere from nine at night to one or two in the morning. I’ll be in here, and sometimes I get frustrated, like I need to go and get a shot of whisky real quick and come back, or I try to keep liquor in here."
2256,How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?
2257,"It takes a while to get into a rhythm, because I’m doing this repetitive motion and my mind changes so frequently. I wear a watch because I count how much I work on each section. And if I’m here from like 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., I probably get six hours of consecutive work done. Some of these works take a week of working on them straight, because I work on one at a time."
2258,What’s the first piece of art you ever made?
2259,"I have sketchbooks in a box over there from second and third grade. But I think the first piece of art that I ever made was when I found a clay deposit in the river in the third grade in Jamaica and I made some ceramic figures. Those stuck with me for a long time, and it kind of continues to propel this creative process in me. I think that’s also probably why I studied ceramics."
2260,What’s the first work you ever sold? For how much?
2261,"The first work I sold was from when I was 14 or 15. I made this painting that I accidentally left on the bus in Miami when I was in high school and I never recovered the painting, but I recreated it and it was sort of reminiscent of an Edward Hopper painting. I sold it at the Coconut Grove Art Festival for $100 and I got $50."
2262,"When you start a new piece, where do you begin? What’s the first step?"
2263,"I start with a buffet of images that I print and mount, and then I usually naturally gravitate toward one, and look at it for a while before I begin to work. I don’t really plan ahead."
2264,How do you know when you’re done?
2265,"It’s like eating. Once you finish, you’re like, that’s it. You don’t need to overwork it."
2266,How many assistants do you have?
2267,Ten fingers.
2268,What music do you play when you’re making art?
2269,"I listen to jazz, a lot of hip-hop, rap. I still love Nas’ “Illmatic.” J. Cole’s “Forest Hills Drive” and “Born Sinner” are such great albums. Lately, I find myself listening to “The Pizza Show” on YouTube, or just various things about food."
2270,Is there a meal you eat on repeat when you’re working?
2271,Fried chicken. Or jerk chicken.
2272,When did you first feel comfortable saying you were a professional artist?
2273,"After undergrad, where I majored in ceramics. I felt like there was hope, and I knew it’s a journey that can only continue to get stronger, and so I felt comfortable in that moment to say: I’m a professional artist."
2274,What’s the weirdest object in your studio?
2275,"I think the plaster-cast chicken foot wall elements that I made a couple years ago, and then there’s a cast cake. I was crazy — I went to Costco, bought a cake, went to the butcher in Bushwick where I was living at the time, bought a chicken foot, pig feet, cow tongue and fish head and chopped them all up. I wanted to make this cake that celebrated the fucked-up nature of the British Empire, the structures. And so I made that cake, chopped it up, froze it, then cast it in alginate and epoxy plastic in my living room. And it’s strange. Even though I eat those things, I still think it’s strange."
2276,How often do you talk to other artists?
2277,"I speak to a few artists on a regular basis: Yashua Klos, Kambui Olujimi, Cheryl Pope and Roberto Visani."
2278,How do you get your news?
2279,Yahoo.
2280,What do you do when you’re procrastinating?
2281,"I watch YouTube, I look at flights, I think about leaving."
2282,What are you reading right now?
2283,"I just picked up two books: David Scott’s “Stuart Hall’s Voice” and Paul Gilroy’s “‘There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack’: The Cultural Politics of Race and Nation.” I’m also listening to an audiobook called “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” by Robert T. Kiyosaki."
2284,What do you usually wear when you work?
2285,"I have a bunch of denim shirts and jeans, and some basic shoes. This shirt I wear the hell out of. I left it in London once and I had to go back to London to get it. It’s from H&M, my jeans are either from Levi’s or the Gap. And my hat is from American Apparel."
2286,What does your studio’s window look out on?
2287,"I have one window. I took the studio with the least amount of windows. It looks out on a back street, the Family Dollar and a granite foundry."
2288,What do you pay for rent?
2289,Too much.
2290,What do you buy in bulk?
2291,Arugula and spinach. I just love greens. Honest truth is I love food and so I buy things in bulk.
2292,What’s your worst habit?
2293,Sucking my teeth.
2294,What embarrasses you?
2295,"A lot of things — I can’t get into specifics. I embarrass myself, too."
2296,Do you exercise?
2297,"I go to the gym twice a week, and it’s mainly to sweat. I just get cranky in the cold."
2298,What’s your favorite artwork by somebody else?
2299,"One of my favorite artworks is a painting in the Whitney’s collection, it’s called “Early Sunday Morning” by Edward Hopper."
2300,This interview has been edited and condensed.
2301,"Despite all he had seen in nearly three decades as executive director of Detroit’s annual auto show, Rod Alberts found himself staring in mild disbelief."
2302,"On a nearby video screen, he watched as an empty autonomous car parked itself, used a sensor to recharge its batteries through thin air, then returned to curbside to pick up its “occupants.”"
2303,"Although controlled from the event’s lower ground floor in Detroit, the vehicle itself was over 7,000 miles away, in Shanghai. Captured in real time by three cameras, the demonstration used an “automated valet” system developed by ZongMu Technology, a Chinese start-up."
2304,"Increasingly, alongside their traditional sparkling new models on rotating stands, top car shows are mixing in heavy doses of technology and hands-on experiences like driving simulators and virtual reality demonstrations."
2305,"“Technology is here to stay,” Mr. Alberts said, noting the scores of start-ups at the North American International Auto Show last month in Detroit. “The mobility world, and our car shows, have changed a lot.”"
2306,[Carmakers no longer see auto shows as can’t-miss events.]
2307,"Ten years ago, Mr. Alberts estimates, the worldwide car population spanned 50 brands and 350 models. Today, with the disappearance of names like Saab, Scion, Mercury and Pontiac, and automakers like General Motors and Ford still trimming their lineups, he calculates those numbers have shrunk by as much as 20 percent."
2308,"All this means fewer cars on Mr. Alberts’ carpets. Moreover, as carmakers increasingly take advantage of social media and shorter build times, model introductions that historically took place in the fall and winter — when many shows are scheduled — now happen year-round."
2309,"However, despite recent headlines proclaiming the imminent demise of conventional car shows, those predictions seem premature."
2310,"The biggest events still draw large crowds, filled with plenty of potential buyers. Last year, an estimated 11 million people attended the nation’s 55 traditional car shows — excluding classic auto and specialty exhibits — according to Foresight Research, an industry data-tracking firm in Rochester Hills, Mich. Despite record-breaking cold weather, the Detroit show’s attendance reached a reported 774,000, off slightly from the year before but hardly dying."
2311,"“It’s true the shows are evolving — but in a positive way,” said Jennifer Colman, president of the Automotive Trade Association Executives. “They’re offering interactive apps, ride-and-drives and other experiences that meet consumers’ needs.”"
2312,"Two years ago, the Detroit show teamed up with PlanetM, an initiative sponsored by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation that fosters emerging “mobility” technologies. This year, including ZongMu in China, 149 tech and start-up companies populated the Detroit show’s lower ground floor, in a showcase for potential investors. Among them:"
2313,"BEDESTRIAN This start-up from Ann Arbor, Mich., plans to deploy autonomous robotic vehicles for “last mile” deliveries in congested urban areas. The company hopes to find a niche among elderly, disabled and veteran populations."
2314,"DERQ Based in Detroit and Dubai, this start-up is focusing on preventing vehicle and pedestrian intersection accidents before they happen. Its technology links “smart city” cameras and sensors to patented predictive algorithms that trigger audio and visual alarms in standard and autonomous vehicles."
2315,"SEEVA TECHNOLOGIES Seeva, a father-daughter start-up in Seattle, uses targeted streams of a vehicle’s heated washer fluid to clean windshields, cameras and sensors on self-driving and standard vehicles. Fully autonomous cars are expected to deploy dozens of such detectors, says Diane Lansinger, the chief executive."
2316,"“It’s a chance to expose new companies and technologies to potential investors and the traditional automotive world,” Trevor Pawl, PlanetM group vice president, said of the Detroit show. “And we get to do that here, where the industry began.”"
2317,"Two months earlier, a similar transformation was apparent at AutoMobility LA, the big annual Los Angeles auto show."
2318,"As in Detroit, dozens of new car models were unveiled, and to great hoopla. But since 2016, when the Los Angeles show’s owners merged with Connected Car Expo, much had changed. The November event became one of the first to address the converging worlds of technology and automaking and to offer public forums for the discussion of knotty issues facing transportation."
2319,"For one thing, there was the show’s serious-sounding “Future of Human Driving” theme. Panelists wrestled with deep-think topics like “The New Demands of Car Design,” “Future Mobility and the Reimagined Car” and “Preparing Highways for the Autonomous Future.”"
2320,"“This was the first time I’ve felt the kind of excitement you get at the Paris and Detroit shows,” said Kimberly Marte, a member of the design panel."
2321,"“We’re in a time of change in how we look at the whole future of transportation,” added Ms. Marte, a lecturer at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. “The L.A. show reflected that, and it gave the event a lot of weight.”"
2322,"Ms. Marte singled out the show’s introduction of a water-wading electric pickup truck with a range of 400 miles. Made by Rivian, from Plymouth, Mich., the truck was billed as the first in a line of “electric adventure” vehicles."
2323,"[Amazon has invested in Rivian, a potential rival to Tesla.]"
2324,"“It was a different kind of buzz,” she said. “Everybody was talking about it, surrounding that truck.”"
2325,"Notably, the Los Angeles show was bracketed by two portentous announcements from the world’s largest automaker: Volkswagen will end production of its iconic Beetle this year, and it intends to cease gasoline and diesel engine development after 2026."
2326,"Even so, as Ms. Colman and others insist, car shows remain very much alive and kicking."
2327,"Steve Bruyn, Foresight’s chief executive, said the number of car-shopping attendees had recently grown, a gain he attributed to greater interest by millennials."
2328,"“The 18-34 age cohort has increased dramatically since 2015,” Mr. Bruyn said, and is now the largest single demographic among attendees who subsequently buy a vehicle."
2329,"“If anything, because of millennials, auto shows have increased in importance in terms of shopping,” he said. “These folks often don’t have prior experience or brand loyalty, so for them attending the show takes on added meaning.”"
2330,"Since 1998, Kevin Mazzucola has been the executive director of the Philadelphia Auto Show, a more localized exhibit, held this month, that seasons its shiny metal with football cheerleaders and live radio broadcasts."
2331,"“When I look out and see 70,000 people on our floor on a Saturday afternoon,” he said, “there’s no question in my mind of the continuing importance of car shows.”"
2332,"“Consumers revel in comparison shopping,” he added. “We give them a chance to see if that new S.U.V.’s third row of seats is really big enough to haul the kids to a soccer game.”"
2333,"Despite his optimism, Mr. Mazzucola perceives a growing need for the shows to educate consumers, especially as the industry moves toward self-driving vehicles."
2334,"“Polls show the public is apprehensive about autonomous cars,” he said. “We need help from manufacturers to alleviate those fears, to use our shows to educate and expose consumers to new technology.”"
2335,"That effort may get a boost next year, when the Detroit show shifts its schedule to June from its traditional January run. “We’re going to break the mold,” Mr. Alberts said."
2336,The more temperate weather will allow the show to add 14 acres of outside space and take full advantage of the city’s revitalized riverfront and surrounding streets.
2337,"“We’ll have sun until 9 p.m.,” said Mr. Alberts, who predicts a galalike atmosphere comparable to the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England. The new show will be a hub for automotive technology, he said, one that offers consumers plenty of room for “experiential engagement.”"
2338,At least one of the Detroit show’s start-ups will welcome the change.
2339,"“We’ve got six products in development,” Ms. Lansinger of Seeva said, “so the show is definitely worth our time. But sometimes when I walk through the main floor I feel like I’m in a history museum.”"
2340,"Doubtless reflecting the views of other technology companies, she hopes better weather will mean a chance to move upstairs, with the marquee displays."
2341,"PALM BEACH, Fla. — President Trump said on Friday that there would be a “very good likelihood” that he would seal off the United States border with Mexico next week, even as he moved to punish Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for migrant caravans by cutting off all foreign aid to the countries."
2342,The moves escalated a sustained berating of countries he blames for being unable to stop the flow of migrants trying to make their way north.
2343,"“I will close the border if Mexico doesn’t get with it,” Mr. Trump said to reporters who had gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his winter retreat in Florida. “If Mexico doesn’t stop it.”"
2344,"At Mr. Trump’s direction, the State Department on Friday began the process of informing Congress that it intended to end the foreign aid. A person with knowledge of the decision said that Mr. Trump met with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday, after which diplomats were directed to begin the process of cutting off the funds by drafting letters to lawmakers. Mr. Trump publicly said as much on Friday in comments to reporters."
2345,"“No money goes there anymore,” Mr. Trump said. “We’re giving them tremendous aid. We stopped payment.”"
2346,"The State Department issued a statement late on Friday saying: “At the secretary’s instruction, we are carrying out the president’s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle. We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.”"
2347,Mr. Trump has threatened to close off the border and cut off aid to the three countries — known as the Northern Triangle — several times before and has not followed through.
2348,"But his comments on Friday signaled a new escalation and a diplomatic assault on America’s neighbors in the hemisphere as his administration confirmed that it would review ways to reshuffle Border Patrol agents, shut down traffic lanes and close ports of entry at the southwest border. He began the day with a morning tweet saying that he would close the border “next week,” and then told reporters that he was prepared to close off trade and commercial ports of entry."
2349,"A full or partial sealing of the border would effectively close off the United States from one of its largest trading partners, but it could leave American citizens who cross back and forth with a sluggish or potentially nonexistent system of returning to the United States."
2350,"“I’m not playing games,” Mr. Trump said on Friday, as he threatened to close the border with Mexico."
2351,"[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]"
2352,"The president has been emboldened since the release of a report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, found that his campaign had not cooperated with the Russian government. And a partisan upholding of his national emergency declaration over a wall along the southwestern border has prompted Mr. Trump to ratchet up harsh words against immigration as he seeks to galvanize supporters ahead of the 2020 presidential election."
2353,"As he engaged in multiple photo opportunities throughout the day, Mr. Trump’s actions and comments indicated that his mind was not on the scenes at hand but on immigration."
2354,"“How are we doing at the border?” he asked a military official on a tour of Lake Okeechobee, the site of a restoration project in the central part of the state. During a meeting at Mar-a-Lago to announce that Linda McMahon, who has led the Small Business Administration, had resigned, he again turned to immigration."
2355,"“We have the most laughed-at immigration laws of anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump said to reporters as he and Ms. McMahon sat in the ornate front room of the club. “They’re the Democrats’ laws, and I got stuck with them.”"
2356,"Mr. Trump’s decision to end the aid to the Central American countries is likely to anger members of Congress from both parties, who have supported spending money to try to address the root causes of the violence that has caused migrants to flee those countries to come to the United States."
2357,"Currently, the United States spends about $620 million a year for gang prevention programs and other initiatives aimed at helping support civil society in the three countries. Advocates say that cutting the funds will only accelerate the migrant flows into the United States."
2358,But the president has repeatedly expressed anger that the United States sends money to the countries even as caravans of migrants make their way to the border.
2359,"In an email from the director of the Office of U.S. Foreign Assistance Resources on Friday night, senior State Department and United States Agency for International Development officials were instructed to “redirect” all 2018 assistance “away from these countries” and to “cease and desist” all 2017 spending already started."
2360,The email sent State Department officials scrambling to carry out the president’s order. It was unclear how quickly the funding would cease since the governments had not yet been notified formally of the decision.
2361,"It is also unclear whether the department can redirect all of the money to other parts of the world. Some of the money meant for the 2017 fiscal year has already been allocated to specific contracts, so it might not be able to be withdrawn, according to a person familiar with the effort."
2362,"Mr. Trump told reporters that he would consider shutting down ports along the border, a decision that could imperil the transit of goods between the United States and Mexico. According to government figures, Mexico is the United States’ third-largest goods trading partner, with $557.6 billion worth of products flowing across the border in both directions."
2363,"A move by Mr. Trump to shut down or drastically curb trade with Mexico would pose significant risks to the American economy. It would also represent a stunning reversal in trade relations between the two countries, which last August put their differences aside to renegotiate their portion of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The new deal, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, still needs to be approved by Congress."
2364,"The president lamented that Mexico was making a “fortune” off the United States, and said Mexico’s immigration laws were the “strongest immigration laws of anywhere in the world.” (Mexico is much weaker than the United States at enforcing its border laws.) Mr. Trump also again invoked migrant caravans — including one containing hundreds of people heading to the United States — as a reason Mexico needed to act."
2365,"“Mexico is tough,” Mr. Trump said. “If they don’t stop them, we’re closing the border.”"
2366,Americans would feel the effects in other ways. Border control agencies are already reviewing ways to slow down immigration processing at the border. A senior homeland security official confirmed on Friday that shutting down ports of entry along the southwest border was “on the table” to handle the surge in migrants seeking asylum.
2367,"Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said in a statement that she had asked volunteers to add more support at the border, and suggested that American citizens may encounter difficulty getting through as a result."
2368,"“Make no mistake: Americans may feel effects from this emergency,” Ms. Nielsen said. “As personnel are reallocated to join the crisis-response effort, there may be commercial delays, higher vehicle wait times at the border and longer pedestrian lines.”"
2369,"She added that “despite these impacts, we cannot shirk our responsibility to the American people to do everything possible to secure our country while also upholding our humanitarian values.”"
2370,"Stephen H. Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, said there were a few options available to Mr. Trump if he wanted to move to stop the flow of people at the border, including slowing down processing at ports of entry. The administration has already limited the number of migrants who can apply for asylum each day."
2371,"“He could pretend that this was necessary in the interest of national security,” Mr. Legomsky said, “and it could be that the courts would be hesitant to second guess a national security claim by a president.”"
2372,"Mr. Legomsky said putting up trade roadblocks and slowing down the processing of people would have harmful effects, both on American citizens who could find themselves “marooned” in Mexico and on families, including groups of women and children, who are fleeing violence and poverty."
2373,"“There’s a huge humanitarian concern,” Mr. Legomsky said. “So many of the people are these Central American mothers and children fleeing from high levels of violence. They would be effectively stuck in the border areas which are also extremely dangerous.”"
2374,"On Thursday, the president said that he did not share concern over the plight of people in danger. In front of supporters at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., he used harsh language to describe the thousands of people who have tried to flee violence and poverty, calling the problem an “invasion” and referring to asylum seekers as a “big fat con job.”"
2375,"In a news conference in El Paso on Wednesday, Kevin McAleenan, the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said that an influx of migrants had reached a “breaking point.”"
2376,"In February, there were 76,000 crossings at the border, which marked an 11-year high and signaled that the Trump administration’s harsher policies have not stopped the flow of people trying to enter the country."
2377,"The threat to close the border is one that Mr. Trump has made previously but not carried out. But he has not yet attached a deadline by which he would take such a drastic measure, and did not respond to reporters who asked on Friday whether he would set one."
2378,"The homeland security official said the Trump administration had not yet decided to shut down a major port, but that the department had been forced to divert agents from ports of entries and interior checkpoints to handle large groups of migrants trying to illegally come into the United States, including families."
2379,"GOOD KIDS, BAD CITY A Story of Race and Wrongful Conviction in America By Kyle Swenson"
2380,"Journalists fortunate enough to have started their careers at small-town newspapers or on city desks at metro dailies know about the jailhouse mail. The envelopes arrive every so often, packed almost to rupture with handwritten letters and supporting documentation meant to provoke the recipient into investigating the sender’s agitated claim of innocence. One of my own regrets as a reporter is not having done more with the letters I got — because you never know."
2381,"Kyle Swenson got some of those letters while on staff early this decade at The Cleveland Scene, the city’s alternative weekly. And he also got a phone call. Not from a man in prison, but from a man named Kwame Ajamu, who had been released on parole in 2003 after serving 28 years for a 1975 murder he said he had nothing to do with. Looking back, Swenson conjectures that one reason he took Ajamu’s claims as seriously as he did was that Ajamu was so committed to press his case despite having already gotten out. He wanted his name cleared — and most of all, he wanted to free his brother and friend, who were still behind bars for the same murder."
2382,"Swenson, a product of the Cleveland suburbs and not long out of college, decided to dig in. His resulting article, published in June 2011, would represent a major step on the path to vindication for the men. Three years later, they would make the history books for an ambiguous honor: With a combined 106 years in prison, theirs was most likely the longest wrongful imprisonment to end in an exoneration in the history of the United States."
2383,"This is the story Swenson sets out to recount in his book, though he makes plain early on that it is not the only story he is going to tell. Tales of exoneration after wrongful imprisonment face some fundamental narrative challenges. For one thing, the outcome is already known: long-overdue vindication. For another thing, these accounts present a dramatic situation that is almost too vast to conceive of — the nightmare of spending a decade or two or three locked away for a crime you didn’t commit — while at the same time often fairly pedestrian and limited in its legal particulars. It’s the sort of story that is both too big for a book, and not big enough. To address the latter problem, Swenson has paired his account of what happened to these three men with the story of the city in which they were arrested and convicted."
2384,"Their fate, Swenson suggests, is tied up with the fate of Cleveland, which, when they were born in the 1950s, was still one of the 10 biggest cities in the country, but by the time they were charged in 1975 was in sharp decline, a product of white flight, de-industrialization and disinvestment. He links the men’s wrongful imprisonment to a litany of ongoing institutional failures in the city, among them neglecting to apprehend a serial killer who, undetected for years, hid 11 women’s bodies at his home in an impoverished East Side neighborhood; the devastation wreaked over the last decade by subprime lenders; and a sweeping corruption racket in the government of Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland. “If we’d hit the point where we no longer expected our police officers to stop serial killers before body counts reached the double digits … if whole neighborhoods could disappear now under fine-print mortgages while the county government simply watched a tax base drain away,” he writes, “was it so hard then to believe the criminal justice system could put the wrong men in jail for a murder?”"
2385,"The answer to that rhetorical question is of course no, but the details of how the system got this one wrong still manage to shock. On May 19, 1975, a white 58-year-old money-order salesman by the name of Harry Franks was making his rounds collecting cash when two young men confronted him outside a convenience store, hit him with a metal pipe, tossed acid in his face and tried to grab his briefcase full of money. One of the robbers pulled a gun and shot Franks, killing him, while wounding a woman inside the store."
2386,"In the ensuing days, the police would get tips about several possible suspects. But they took the word of 12-year-old Edward Vernon, who had been in the crowd of kids that gathered around the crime scene and, when an officer came over to inquire for witnesses, eagerly volunteered himself. He later identified Rickey Jackson, 18, as the shooter and Ronnie Bridgeman, 17 (who later changed his name to Kwame Ajamu), as the co-assailant; the police alleged that Wiley Bridgeman, 20, Ronnie’s brother, had driven the getaway car. The ensuing trials of the defendants, who like Vernon were African-American, were riddled with red flags: A teenage girl who was inside the store insisted that the attackers were not Rickey and Ronnie; inconsistencies proliferated in the accounts Ed gave the police and the various juries; testimony by other children that Ed had not left school early that day on a city bus, a crucial element of his account. One boy testified that when he asked Ed on the day of the murder how he could have seen the killer when the other kids he was with had not, Ed said, “I have got X-ray eyes.” Nonetheless, juries voted to convict all three."
2387,"Swenson does his best to conjure the unimaginable years that follow, as the men are dispersed across the Ohio prison system. Rickey witnesses three murders and a gang rape. Wiley is diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia and spends nearly half his time in mental health units."
2388,"Also suffering, though, was Ed Vernon, whose life spins into a spiral of crack addiction. He spends two years behind bars on a drug charge. Later, he encounters Wiley, out on parole before being returned to prison for a parole violation, and rebuffs his pleas to come clean about the case. The break finally comes when a local pastor manages to confront Vernon about his decades-old lies, which dissolve in a sudden upsurge of self-liberating honesty."
2389,"It is only now, when the truth pours out of Vernon, that the context of the lies becomes known: the pressure that detectives were putting on him to deliver on his claim to having witnessed the killing, going so far as to threaten him with perjury charges. The role of these officers was so crucial that one is left wanting to know more about them. Swenson sketches the rise of tough-on-crime policing in the 1970s that formed the backdrop of the officers’ actions, but they are individuals, like Vernon and the defendants, whose motives and moral agency could have used more expansive treatment. Swenson’s account of the War on Crime context also elides the role that was played by demands from within the black community to take on drug dealers."
2390,"Another shortcoming is one of excess, not absence. Swenson has a predilection for figurative language that occasionally hits the lyrical mark but more often distracts. Just in the book’s first two paragraphs one encounters “roadways split like bad fruit,” “a bent elbow of sidewalk” and “drivers slinging past us like pinballs,” among several other metaphor- and simile-laden sentences."
2391,"It’s almost as if Swenson doesn’t entirely trust his material to carry a book without his stylistic embellishment. But it does. It’s the story of a grave injustice, whose long-overdue correction delivers a strong emotional punch when it finally arrives. More broadly, it’s a story about negligence, about all the ways in which residents of cities such as Cleveland have been left abandoned by government and society at large."
2392,"There’s so much talk these days about the great urban rebirth that the persistent struggles of non-superstar cities are too often overlooked. Swenson does a service simply by capturing the daily demoralization of existence in such a place: “It was hard to tally the net effect all this institutional calamity had on your average Clevelander,” he writes. “When the basics of your city — catching killers or putting diplomas in kids’ hands or stabilizing a tax base — don’t work anymore, there’s a feeling of being edged out of the American mainstream.”"
2393,"A big part of that abandonment involves the media: The plight of these cities is increasingly at risk of being ignored because there are so few reporters left to document it. Swenson is now at The Washington Post. Cleveland is lucky to still have The Scene — many other cities have lost their alt-weeklies — but the city’s daily paper, The Plain Dealer, has been debilitated by cutbacks. One can’t help wondering what life-shattering injustices might go unaddressed in the future for lack of a curious reporter to take a call or open an envelope."
2394,"WASHINGTON — House and Senate negotiators on Monday night agreed in principle to provide $1.375 billion for fencing and other physical barriers at the Mexican border, part of a broader agreement that would stave off another partial government shutdown without funding President Trump’s wall."
2395,"The agreement would allow for 55 miles of new bollard fencing, with some restrictions on location based on community and environmental concerns, according to two congressional aides, who requested anonymity to disclose details of the private negotiations. That is a fraction of the more than 200 miles of steel-and-concrete wall that Mr. Trump demanded — and 10 miles less than negotiators agreed on last summer, before Democrats took control of the House."
2396,"The deal, which must still pass the House and the Senate, and secure Mr. Trump’s signature, came together just before Mr. Trump, framed by banners emblazoned with “Finish the Wall” at an event in El Paso, doubled down on his demands."
2397,"“We’re building the wall anyway,” he told the crowd, saying that aides had told him that the negotiators had made progress."
2398,The funding for 55 miles of new fencing is a figure far lower than the $5.7 billion that Mr. Trump had demanded and marginally less than the $1.6 billion for 65 miles of pedestrian fencing in the bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee had passed last year.
2399,"In December, the president, concerned about reneging on his signature campaign promise, refused to sign onto that legislation, forcing the nation’s longest government shutdown."
2400,"The negotiators also agreed to reduce the number of migrants and undocumented immigrants who can be held in detention. Democrats’ demand for a limit on how much detention space could be used for unauthorized immigrants arrested within the United States had threatened to derail the negotiations over the weekend, but lawmakers agreed to waive the demand."
2401,"Instead, lawmakers agreed to adhere to levels, set by a number of detention beds, established in the previous budget. That would fund 40,520 beds, a decrease of about 17 percent from current levels, which Immigration and Customs Enforcement reached in recent months only by surpassing its funding caps."
2402,"Privately, Democratic aides admitted the provision could have no impact on the number of beds ICE assigned for detainees. There is nothing to prevent Trump administration officials from funding a greater number of slots in excess of the lower target number, and then securing congressional outlays to cover those expenses, as ICE officials have done routinely in recent years, the aides said."
2403,"Beyond the border barriers, the agreement, which primarily funds the Department of Homeland Security, would provide $1.7 billion more for border security, including technology at ports of entry, more officers and humanitarian aid."
2404,Here’s how much the proposed border deal would add to existing barriers.
2405,"[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]"
2406,"The Republican and Democratic leaders of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees announced the agreement, which includes seven unfinished spending bills, after three private meetings on Monday. Disaster relief for areas affected by storms and natural disasters last year will not be included, and lawmakers said they would address it separately."
2407,"It is expected to be finalized as early as Tuesday, well before the Friday deadline when funding would again lapse for a number of federal agencies. With fears of another damaging shutdown, lawmakers seemed confident that they had the support of party leadership and that Mr. Trump would be willing to sign the agreement."
2408,"“We think so,” Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told reporters when asked about the likelihood of the president’s signature. “We hope so.”"
2409,"“The specter of another government shutdown this close, I thought tonight we didn’t want that to happen,” he added later."
2410,"Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, had urged him to “get it done” in negotiations, Mr. Shelby said. Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said she had been in close communication with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and expected her support."
2411,"“She has confidence that I made the right decision,” Ms. Lowey told reporters."
2412,"White House officials did not respond to requests for comment about the terms of the agreement, and the president’s conservative allies on Monday night were already denouncing the deal. Sean Hannity, a Fox News commentator and a confidant of the president’s, called it “a garbage compromise.”"
2413,"Pentagon officials spent the weekend readying for the possibility that Mr. Trump would declare a national emergency, something that his allies said he is still considering as a means to secure border wall funding."
2414,But Republican lawmakers remained optimistic that their agreement would hold.
2415,"“This has been a difficult one,” said Representative Kay Granger of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. “I think everyone will say, ‘Good work.’”"
2416,"A specific point of contention had been the number of detention beds under the control of ICE, which had stalled talks over the weekend."
2417,"House Democrats, urged on by immigration rights groups, had pushed hard, hoping to leverage White House fears of another damaging shutdown into a softening of the president’s hard-line immigration policies that they say have torn apart families, wrenched productive workers from the communities they have lived in for years and infused a heartlessness into official American immigration policy."
2418,"The Democrats’ goal was to cut the overall number of detention beds, including those occupied by asylum seekers and people caught at the border, from its current level of around 49,000 to 34,000, the number funded during the Obama administration, Democratic aides said. That, they say, would end sweeps and roundups, and force ICE to focus on pursuing hardened criminals."
2419,"“We started at zero on the wall, and we compromised a lot after that, and we are now asking them to change, too,” said Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, Democrat of California and a member of the 17-member House and Senate conference committee tasked with hammering out a compromise."
2420,"Mr. Trump caught on. When Mr. Shelby presented him with the Democrats’ demand, he rejected it quickly, according to two people briefed on the exchange."
2421,"“These are the people coming into our country that we are holding and we don’t want in our country,” the president told reporters at the White House on Monday. “That’s why they don’t want to give us what we call ‘the beds.’ It’s much more complicated than beds, but we call them ‘the beds.’”"
2422,"In private, Republicans responded with a plan that would exempt many detained immigrants from the cap, including those people either charged with or convicted of crimes, including misdemeanor drug offenses and violent felonies. That, in turn, was rejected by Democrats."
2423,"“You have ICE agents picking up mothers and fathers and children in their own neighborhoods. That’s why the beds issue is so much more important than the wall,” said Ms. Roybal-Allard, whose Los Angeles-area district is 85 percent Hispanic, the highest percentage of any district in the country."
2424,"The number of beds occupied by detainees fluctuates over time, influenced by a variety of factors, including ICE enforcement policies and the flow of migrants at the border with Mexico. The rate of that flow is unpredictable and determined by factors such as the performance of the economies north and south of the border, crime, gang activity and the business practices of coyotes paid to transport migrants from Mexico and Central America to California and the Southwest."
2425,"The number of monthly apprehensions of migrants at the border has averaged 25,000 to 40,000 for most of the past decade, but has risen to about 50,000 over the past several months, according to statistics compiled by the Department of Homeland Security."
2426,"If ICE does not have enough room to place individuals and family members they detain, they must loosen their enforcement actions, creating a powerful motive for new migrants to enter the country illegally, Trump administration officials say."
2427,"“You cannot have border security, without strong interior enforcement, whether there is a wall there or not,” said Matt Albence, the deputy director of ICE, on Monday in a conference call with reporters."
2428,Republicans closed ranks to blast the plan.
2429,"“This is a poison pill that no administration, not this one, not the previous one, should ever accept,” Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor. “Imagine the absurdity of this: House Democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain.”"
2430,"TRAUNSTEIN, Germany — The rumor began, as so many do these days, on Facebook."
2431,"A group of Muslim refugees in southern Germany, it was claimed, had dragged an 11-year-old girl to a pedestrian underpass and raped her. When the police denied the claim, it was said that politicians beholden to the European Union had ordered them to cover up the assault."
2432,"The rumor proved unfounded, but it provoked waves of fear and anger as it was pushed out across Germany by Facebook’s News Feed. Users worked one another up into fits, concluding that these dangerous refugees, and the duplicitous politicians who shielded them, would all have to be thrown out."
2433,"In most of the world, rumor-fueled meltdowns are taken as a fact of life, a product of Facebook’s propensity for stirring up people’s worst impulses."
2434,"But Andreas Guske, a trim, steely-eyed police inspector in the refugee-heavy Bavarian town of Traunstein where the rumor circulated, didn’t think his community could afford complacence. Attacks on refugees were already rising. And southern Germany is a front line in Europe’s battle over identity and immigration."
2435,"“Facebook is not just like a pinboard where people hang things and others read them,” Mr. Guske said in an interview. “Facebook, with its algorithm, influences people.”"
2436,"Researchers agree, finding that the platform surfaces negative, primal emotions and that it can even distort users’ sense of right and wrong."
2437,"And rumors, noted Mr. Guske, head of the police department’s communications office, travel faster in the age of social media, often growing more dangerous as they spread."
2438,"“That was not the case before Facebook,” he said."
2439,"So the police inspector and his two deputies set to work. Their goal: Through shoe-leather police work and door-to-door outreach, they would eradicate the rumor online and off, taking it as seriously as a pandemic or a new street drug."
2440,"Mr. Guske’s team members do not arrest people who post inflammatory rumors, or fine them. Instead, they act more like public health workers, inoculating communities from viral misinformation and its consequences."
2441,Their efforts reflect rising concern among governments that Facebook is spinning up violence and extremism. They also reflect a lack of faith in the company to address the problem.
2442,"“We see that peoples’ feelings of safety and their actual safety are moving apart, like a pair scissors that are opening,” Mr. Guske said. “We’re trying to close those as much as we can. Hate can arise from this, which we’ve seen can turn the population against migrants and refugees.”"
2443,A Facebook spokeswoman said the company had been “working closely with German authorities” and had “trained hundreds of German officers over the past years on how to use our tools.”
2444,"The company says it has taken steps to curb hate speech, instituting special rules against anti-refugee posts. It also works with fact-checking organizations, including in Germany, to debunk false information on the platform."
2445,"Facebook enlists thousands of moderators to scrub posts that break its rules. It is a scalable solution that fits the company’s business strategy. But it does little to address Facebook’s real-world impact or to curb hate and misinformation that fall within the rules, like many of the rumors making the rounds in Traunstein."
2446,Mr. Guske takes a more on-the-ground approach.
2447,"To stop the rumor about the supposed rape of the young girl at the underpass, Mr. Guske started by identifying local residents who had shared it on Facebook. Then he traced the story as it jumped between the social network and offline rumor mills — a reminder that Facebook moderators, who monitor only the platform itself, cannot stop misinformation’s spread into the real world."
2448,"Mr. Guske had two goals: to persuade the rumor’s progenitors to publicly disavow their claims, and to find whatever kernel of truth had grown into the tall tale. Showing local residents how Facebook had distorted reality, he believed, was the only way to persuade them to reject what they had seen there as false."
2449,"The rumor began, they found, when the police arrested an Afghan citizen accused of groping a 17-year-old girl two towns over, and pulling up some of her clothes."
2450,"As Facebook users shared accounts of the incident, they added spurious detail. One assailant became several. A groping became a rape. And a 17-year-old victim became an 11-year-old."
2451,"The police posted a statement reconstructing the rumor’s spread. But Mr. Guske knew a sober fact-check would never rise as high as a salacious rumor on Facebook’s News Feed, which promotes content based in part on its ability to keep users engaged."
2452,"So his team showed up at the homes of users who had first spread the rumor, showing them evidence that they had gotten it wrong. All but one removed or corrected their posts."
2453,"Karolin Schwarz, who runs a Berlin-based organization that tracks social media misinformation, said she often worked with German police departments to combat misinformation on social media. Mr. Guske’s team in Traunstein is, she said, “by the far the best I’ve seen.”"
2454,"“Police departments should do this more,” Ms. Schwarz said. “It’s kind of great.”"
2455,"Most law enforcement officials, she said, take the view that “it’s only the internet.” Even those who take the threat seriously rarely act quickly enough to stop a rumor’s spread."
2456,"“These things, if they reach thousands of people, you cannot get it back,” Ms. Schwarz said."
2457,"Mr. Guske lamented that Facebook, a $500 billion company, left it to overworked police departments to manage the risks created by its platform."
2458,"Last fall, a police chief in the southern Indian town of Gadwal drew attention for taking on an approach much like Mr. Guske’s to fight social media rumors. Countries in Asia and Africa, which represent the future of Facebook’s business, have proven most susceptible to violence linked to the platform, experts say."
2459,Yet few police departments there have the resources of one in a German resort town like Traunstein.
2460,"Other police departments in Germany, where skepticism of Facebook runs deep, are taking a harder look at social media."
2461,"Gerhard Pauli, a state prosecutor in Hagen, a small city in the country’s postindustrial northwest, said his department was seeing more cases of violence that seemed to trace back to Facebook and other platforms."
2462,"When Andreas Hollstein, the mayor of neighboring Altena, was stabbed by an angry resident, the police concluded that social media outrage over the mayor’s pro-refugee policies had helped provoke the attacker."
2463,"“This is a danger we’ve always had in the history of humanity,” he said. “But nowadays, the technical capabilities are exploding.”"
2464,"Though Facebook has worked with Germany’s regulation-prone government, Mr. Pauli said the German police still struggled to get the company’s attention."
2465,"Asked if he coordinated with Facebook, Mr. Guske said: “No, not really. That’s hard. It’s a problem.”"
2466,"Mr. Guske is not an obvious sleuth for the digital age. He is a gray-haired police veteran, his 29 years of service mostly spent as a police inspector and, later, a liaison with local youth."
2467,"He settled into communications work, thinking that it would be quieter. Then the Group of 7 summit came to Bavaria in 2015."
2468,"Protesters came as well, and Mr. Guske’s role overseeing department social media brought him into contact with online rumors and posts whipping up outrage. Though social media was broadly considered frivolous at the time, Mr. Guske worried about its impact."
2469,"The next year, when Facebook rumors seemed to rise in concert with attacks on refugees, he retooled his team to track and try to halt the rumors. Though some dismissed the link as a coincidence, research released last year strongly suggests that online speech contributed to the violence."
2470,"Every rumor, Mr. Guske believes, undermines the credibility of officers like him who try to debunk it."
2471,"And because he is running his own little experiment, he can combat only the vitriol that originates in his jurisdiction."
2472,"Social media allows anyone, anywhere to spread rumors about his corner of the world. A number of white nationalists, taking a special interest in Bavaria’s culture wars, have done just that. And Mr. Guske is powerless to stop them."
2473,"“It’s hard to prevent fake news, because once Facebook pushes it —” he trailed off, shaking his head and slapping his palm on the table. “What more can you do?”"
2474,Washington used to know how to have a serious debate about border security.
2475,"Republicans demanded more money for Border Patrol agents and necessary fences. Democrats argued for better surveillance technology and more resources at the ports of entry. The two parties squabbled over how much to spend, how to pay for it and how it all fit into the broader struggle to overhaul the nation’s broken immigration system."
2476,"But President Trump has demolished the decades-old, bipartisan understanding about how to bargain over the border. In Mr. Trump’s world, there are no alternatives that can form the basis of a legislative give-and-take, much as his allies and adversaries might hope for them. For the president, the only way to stop what he calls an “onslaught” of illegal immigrants is to erect a massive, concrete or steel barrier across the nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico."
2477,"“Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!” he tweeted last month."
2478,"By conjuring images of a towering stone edifice around a medieval fortress — and branding those on the outside as invaders threatening to bring crime, drugs and disease to the United States — Mr. Trump has transformed what used to be a complicated, nuanced negotiation into a take-it-or-leave-it demand, laced with xenophobia, that has shuttered nearly a quarter of the government for weeks."
2479,"“He turns a debate that is fundamentally about more or less, measured in dollars, and makes it a debate that is wall or not,” said Frank Sharry, a pro-immigration activist who has battled over border security for decades in the nation’s capital. “It’s become cartoonish.”"
2480,"For decades, immigration has been an emotional and bitterly fought battle in Washington and around the country. But even so, there has been a consensus among most Republicans and Democrats that securing the southern border requires a mix of costly strategies. That included a large number of Border Patrol agents posted at key points along the vast stretch of land from San Diego to Brownsville, Tex., fences in urban areas and barriers to stop vehicles from crossing and high-tech surveillance gear to alert the Border Agents to the presence of migrants and drugs."
2481,"Until Mr. Trump was elected, the sticking points had largely been about other parts of the broader immigration debate — cracking down on people who stay longer than their visas allow; preventing companies from hiring illegal immigrants; expanding opportunities for legal immigration; and providing status to those already in the country illegally, including immigrants brought to the United States as children."
2482,"Such a comprehensive deal is completely out of reach now. But Mr. Trump’s behavior during the past several weeks suggests that even reaching a smaller, more targeted agreement on security arrangements at the border is more elusive than ever before."
2483,"The current government shutdown, which began just before Christmas, is now the longest one ever in United States history. In the 22 days since the government shut down, there have been virtually no negotiations by congressional lawmakers or the White House. There have been no marathon, pizza-fueled sessions in back rooms at the Capitol. Lawmakers have not traded detailed proposals with each other. Mr. Trump refused to give an inch in his Oval Office speech, and has spent more time in an extended photo-op at the border than he has at the negotiating table."
2484,It has all left veterans of past border debates exasperated and frustrated.
2485,"“We know how to secure borders,” said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist who was a top aide to Senator Marco Rubio in 2013 when the Republican senator from Florida helped lead the last major, bipartisan effort to overhaul immigration. “The 2013 immigration plan had what everybody agreed was the most effective way possible to secure borders and other points of entry.”"
2486,"With the backing of President Barack Obama, a bipartisan group of eight senators that year succeeded in passing a comprehensive overhaul of the nation’s immigration system. But the legislation, which passed with 68 votes, prompted fierce opposition from conservative Republicans, who condemned it as amnesty for 11 million undocumented immigrants. It was never brought up for a vote in the House."
2487,"Still, the Senate legislation was an indication of where the two parties could agree on border security. It doubled the number of Border Patrol agents, from 19,000 to almost 40,000, an increase that even the authors of the proposal agreed was overkill but was designed mostly as an enticement to win Republican support."
2488,"Senators from both parties also agreed on money for technological improvements along the border. The bill allocated $3.2 billion for drones, infrared ground sensors and long-range thermal imaging cameras to give Border Patrol agents advance notice when migrants cross illegally, especially at night. It also included money for an electronic employment verification system for all employers and upgrades at airports to catch immigrants who overstay their visas."
2489,"And the consensus included some physical barriers — what Mr. Trump might call walls and others would call fencing. Years earlier, the Secure Fence Act of 2006 allocated money to build about 650 miles of barriers along the border. The 2013 bill, had it been signed into law, would have increased that total to almost 700 miles, mostly along the eastern half of the border with Mexico."
2490,"Almost all of the fencing that Congress has approved has already been built. In populated areas, the fence is tall and steel or chain-link and designed to keep people out. In other places, the barrier is nothing more than short, metal poles spaced out to keep vehicles from driving through, or low, wooden fences that run alongside pedestrian paths."
2491,"In 2011, a Government Accountability Office report concluded that despite 649 miles of completed fencing, the “the southwest border continues to be vulnerable to cross-border illegal activity, including the smuggling of humans and illegal narcotics.”"
2492,"The report recognized that barriers have mostly not been built in the vast, empty stretches in Texas, where rivers and mountains as natural borders have prevented cars from crossing into the United States and made the trek by foot difficult, if not impossible. But Mr. Trump seizes on conclusions like the G.A.O. report’s about the continued influx of illegal immigrants at the southern border as proof that he is right in demanding a continuous wall."
2493,"In remarks to reporters after a meeting with Democrats at the White House earlier this month, Mr. Trump insisted that the only way to prevent immigrants from crossing between the 25 official ports of entry is to erect fences everywhere else."
2494,"“We can’t let gaps. Because if you have gaps, those people are going to turn their vehicles, or the gangs — they’re going to coming in through those gaps,” the president said. “And we cannot let that happen.”"
2495,"But there continue to be questions about the wisdom of building a wall from “sea to shining sea,” even from inside Mr. Trump’s administration."
2496,"A different G.A.O. report, released last year, examined the preliminary cost estimates by Customs and Border Protection of what it would cost to extend the wall along the entire border. The report criticized the border agency, saying that the cost estimates did not take into account that costs would vary depending on the kind of terrain where they were built."
2497,"In recent days, the rhetoric between the two sides has become more strident than ever. Mr. Trump and his Republican allies have pointed out that Democrats supported fencing in the past, though they purposefully ignore the context of those votes and the difference between the fencing that Democrats supported and the all-or-nothing wall that the president has demanded."
2498,"Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California has called the wall “immoral,” cementing her position against it."
2499,"“At this point, the idea we could overlook the rhetoric and get a deal done is much harder,” Mr. Sharry, the pro-immigration activist, said."

2547,"Events are subject to change, so double-check before heading out. For more events, see the going-out guides from The Times’s culture pages."
2548,The Times’s John Leland reports:
2549,"It’s T-minus two days until the Academy Awards, but there’s still time to catch many of the Oscar hopefuls, both on streaming services or in theaters."
2550,"Here’s where you can see some of them, or watch the big event:"
2551,"• Shorts are the unsung heroes of the Oscars. The IFC Center in Greenwich Village has the nominees in all three categories: documentary, animated and live-action. (It is also showing “Roma,” 10 nominations, and “Shoplifters,” one nomination for best foreign-language film.) Alamo Drafthouse Downtown Brooklyn, BAM Rose and Nitehawk Prospect Park are also showing the animated and live-action shorts."
2552,"• “BlacKkKlansman,” which earned the first directorial nomination for Brooklyn’s Spike Lee, is still in theaters."
2553,"• Thrillist has a list of viewing parties. Also, amNew York has a roundup of Oscar-watch parties of varying degrees of fanciness, from QED in Astoria (among its prizes is an Amazon gift card) to Sir Henri Penthouse (“free gourmet popcorn”) to Cecconi’s Dumbo (“a free glass of prosecco at the start of the red carpet show”)."
2554,It’s Friday — practice your acceptance speech.
2555,Dear Diary:
2556,It was 1986. I was fresh out of college and newly arrived in Manhattan to pursue my dream of becoming an advertising copywriter on Madison Avenue.
2557,"I got an entry-level position at Launey, Hachmann & Harris. The job initially involved mostly answering phones and greeting clients getting off the elevator. It didn’t matter. I was thrilled to be starting my career in New York City."
2558,"New York was a little rough around the edges then, but the cost of living was still relatively high. I was three months and six paychecks into the job when I realized there was no way I could make ends meet after rent (only $350!) in a shared Upper East Side apartment, student loan payments, food and other necessities."
2559,I’ll never forget summoning the courage to walk into Bob Launey’s office to explain my situation.
2560,He chuckled.
2561,"“I wondered how long it was going to take you to figure out you couldn’t live in New York City on that,” he said. “What do you say to another $300 a month?”"

2565,"CALEXICO, Calif. — The barbed wire overhead evokes danger and violence, but Maritza Hurtado cannot take it seriously. When the sharp coils were placed on top of the old border fence several months ago, running right along the main boulevard, she chalked it up to political propaganda from a White House that does not understand life along the Southwest frontier."
2566,"“This is not a war zone,” Ms. Hurtado said from her tax and immigration consulting office in downtown Calexico, from which she can peer into Mexico. “I’ve had a business here for 30 years and we’ve never needed the barbed wire. Why now? To me, it feels as if I’m enclosed.”"
2567,"For nearly a year, President Trump has pointed with pride to a renovation project replacing two miles of border fencing in Calexico. He hailed it as “the start of our Southern Border WALL!” — to the great consternation of many of the town’s residents, who are wary of becoming the public face of a hard-line immigration policy that most here do not agree with. The attention the president’s tweet brought was surreal, in part because the construction replaced an unsightly stretch of steel fencing that was already there."
2568,"Nationally, partisans and journalists began to debate whether the 30-foot-tall steel slats that make up the replacement barrier should be called a “wall” like the one Mr. Trump promised during his campaign. Others said it was just a “fence,” a distinction that has taken on great importance in Washington."
2569,"Lost amid the battle over credit and semantics was how Calexico residents themselves felt about becoming characters in Trump-era political theater. For many, a sense of apprehension turned to anger when the military installed barbed wire on top of older border fencing, which runs through downtown."
2570,"“This community is basically being used for political purposes,” said Ms. Hurtado, who served as the town’s mayor until December. “And it’s happening throughout these border cities that are just like ours.” She tried to remain diplomatic when television news crews asked her for comment about the barrier last spring, she said, to “avoid making more drama for this community that has nothing to do with the national problem.”"
2571,"But she said she felt incredulous over the administration’s insistence that the replacement fence is part of the wall: “Before we started this project here to do the replacement, Border Patrol came to visit us about three times to ask us to please participate in avoiding the drama. They came to say, three times, ‘You guys, just so you know, we’re starting this project, and it’s not the wall,” recounted Ms. Hurtado, a Democrat who did not vote for the president. “And then here comes Trump and says, ‘It’s the wall!’”"
2572,"[Read more about how the people who live on the border feel about the wall: ""We have other problems here that need fixing.""]"
2573,"The town has received a steady dose of attention from Trump administration officials since last spring. Vice President Mike Pence visited the barrier in April and said the administration was “committed to seeing the construction of a border wall.” In October, the Homeland Security secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, visited to unveil a plaque crediting the president with the barrier."
2574,"The number of pending immigration cases has grown by nearly 50 percent under President Trump, what many lawyers and advocates say is a crisis."
2575,"This month, the president tweeted again: “The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven’t built any NEW WALL,” he wrote, apparently in reference to the barrier in Calexico. “Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service!”"
2576,"Amid a continuing national debate about the border, which has resulted in the longest government shutdown in history, many in this town of 40,000 have struggled to reconcile ominous warnings they see projected from the White House about life on the border with their own experiences living in the quiet agricultural community 120 miles east of San Diego."
2577,"Calexico has long celebrated its interdependent relationship with Mexicali, its sister city directly across the line; the two cities’ downtowns are bisected by pillars where the border lies. Shoppers from urban Mexicali, which has a population of about 1 million, are vital to Calexico’s small-town economy and cross to shop at large outlet stores on the American side. Americans head to the Mexican side on weekends for cheap health care, entertainment and concerts."
2578,"“We’re right up against each other. Each city depends on the other,” said Hildy Carrillo, the executive director of the Calexico Chamber of Commerce, who like Ms. Hurtado did not vote for Mr. Trump. “The families are on both sides of the border. The businesses are on both sides of the border. And the education, the entertainment and the culture are on both sides of the border. Punto.”"
2579,[Read about how charities are stepping in to help released migrants.]
2580,"Rather than a border wall, residents here express enthusiasm for modernizing the Calexico West Port of Entry, which they hope will expedite traffic and allow for a fluid flow of business between the two sides. The number of legal northbound crossers each day, leading to hourslong lines, is astounding: about 20,000 pedestrians and up to 20,000 vehicles, according to the General Services Administration."
2581,President Trump says construction for the wall is underway. We mapped the current fencing and what his administration has done so far.
2582,"Ground was broken in 2015 on the first stage of the renovation, a $121.9 million project completed in September 2018. Town officials are hopeful the second phase will be funded by Congress."
2583,"“We have been waiting for that funding, for years, for our port of entry,” Ms. Hurtado said. “That’s been our struggle. We don’t need a wall. We’ve been struggling to get the money for the door.” The president’s previous threats to shut down the border had also concerned her. “We’re depressed and you’re going to kill us if you shut things down. It’s like, help us by knowing us, you know?”"
2584,"After Mr. Trump’s tweet about the “Border WALL!” Ms. Hurtado had T-shirts made and distributed. They read, “It’s Not A Wall.”"
2585,"The high volume of legal traffic does not mean that illegal border crossings do not happen here. The risk those migrants pose, however, and the characterization of the numbers who jump the fence is enormously overstated, Ms. Carrillo said."
2586,"The real danger, many here said, lies in drug trafficking conducted through sophisticated tunnel systems built by cartels."
2587,"During a drive through downtown Calexico, Victor Carrillo — Ms. Carrillo’s cousin and a former City Council member, mayor and county supervisor — pointed to a house where federal authorities found an expansive underground tunnel in 2016 that ran from the United States to Mexico. As he drove, Mr. Carrillo and a friend pointed to other areas where tunnels were found, where sink holes formed because of attempted burrowing and where the authorities suspect there could be new tunnels."
2588,"“They’re everywhere. Every new apartment complex you see go up, you figure” there might be a tunnel there, Mr. Carrillo said."
2589,"A wall, he pointed out, does not even begin to address that problem."
2590,"The politics of the Imperial Valley are generally not with the president. The county gave Hillary Clinton 68 percent of the vote in 2016 compared with 27 percent for Mr. Trump. The 51st Congressional District, which runs along the southern border from the Arizona border to San Diego, supported the incumbent Democrat, Representative Juan Vargas, with 71 percent of the vote versus 29 percent for his Republican challenger. Eighty-four percent of Imperial County residents are Latino, according to 2018 data by the United States Census Bureau."
2591,"That is not to say that there are not people here and in the broader Imperial Valley, which is a large agricultural region, who support the president’s policies. But in Calexico, it seems, few like to speak about it publicly. And even some of those who lean conservative have reservations about the president’s talk on immigration."
2592,"John Renison, 70, an Army veteran and longtime Calexico resident who is a former City Council member and county supervisor, began his political career here in the 1990s as a Republican but is reluctant to identify with either party today. But he said the barbed wire running through Calexico is a distasteful statement, as is, he said, the president’s general rhetoric about immigration."
2593,"“We do not have a crisis on the border. We are not in fear of being invaded like he said,” Mr. Renison said. “What’s really laughable is you think you’re going to stop illegal immigration by constructing walls and fences.”"

2595,"It had long been considered a dangerous crossing, with more than 200 commuter trains barreling by every day, traveling up to 80 miles per hour — even as streams of cars waited to drive over the tracks."
2596,It was so troubling that it was one of seven hazardous crossings along a 20-mile stretch of Long Island Rail Road track that were scheduled to be eliminated.
2597,The construction work at the crossing in Nassau County was set to begin next year; plans called for a bridge for trains and an underpass for vehicles. But that was not soon enough to avoid a rush-hour tragedy on Tuesday.
2598,"Two Long Island Rail Road trains traveling in opposite directions slammed into a vehicle that had apparently driven around the crossing gates on School Street in Westbury. Three people, all of them inside the vehicle, were killed."
2599,"Passengers on the two trains scrambled to safety, fleeing flames that they worried would engulf one train and dodging debris that smashed through the front of the other. For a brief, terrifying moment, rails twisted, metal crunched, windows shattered and each train wobbled. Panicked passengers dreaded that the cars would tip over before they could get out."
2600,"Of the hundreds of people on the trains, seven were taken to Nassau University Medical Center. Three were admitted, doctors at the hospital said."
2601,"On Wednesday, officials were still determining why the vehicle had worked its way around crossing gates that witnesses said were down. Red warning lights had also been blinking. Officials said that at least one witness had indicated that the vehicle had been in an accident and was apparently fleeing the scene of that incident when it made its way onto the tracks."

2666,"An eastbound train that had just left the nearby station in Westbury struck the vehicle first, spinning it around. Then, a westbound train going much faster bore down on the vehicle and crashed into it."
2667,"Sandwiched between the two trains, the vehicle burst into flames and was all but destroyed. “All that we have left of it is the engine itself,” the Nassau County police commissioner, Patrick Ryder, said on Wednesday."
2668,"The westbound train continued on its doomed path in a scene that some witnesses said resembled a disaster movie, with the train hurtling toward the Westbury station, then crashing into its platform. The force of the impact drove chunks of concrete and pieces of metal into the front of the train amid a shower of sparks."
2669,"The engineer turned and grabbed a passenger in the first car, shoving the person away from the debris, Mr. Ryder said, adding that the engineer would have been killed had he not abandoned his place at the controls."
2670,"A floor manager at the Fine Fare grocery store on Old Country Road, about a half mile from the crash site, said on Wednesday afternoon that the occupants of the car worked at the store, and had for about seven years."
2671,"A memorial table with a cardboard donation box and photographs of the men was placed at the front end of the store, in front of the cash registers. A printed message on the box read, “We thank you for your support for their families, in loving memory of our dear friends and coworkers,” with the message repeated in Spanish."
2672,"“Good people, that’s all I can say,” the manager, Giovanny Taveres, said after he placed a black ribbon on a memorial table. “Good people, hard working people.”"
2673,"Mr. Taveres said all three of the men had worked on Tuesday — two worked in the meat department, and one ran the store’s dairy department. They left work saying they were headed to a barbershop to get haircuts, Mr. Taveres said."
2674,"The vehicle involved in the crash had been at a nearby shopping strip before it headed toward the crossing, according to employees and customers of the barber shop, Los Primos."
2675,"One barber at Los Primos said the men had come in at about 5 p.m. Tuesday for haircuts, then went to a bar and restaurant next door. They left after a couple of hours, the barber said."
2676,"As they left, he said, they had a minor accident — he described it as a fender-bender — with another car. The other driver said she would call the police, the barber said."
2677,"She returned to her car to make the call, he said. The men pulled away and headed toward the railroad tracks."
2678,"On Wednesday, the railroad canceled 12 trains on its busy Main Line. During the morning rush, Manhattan-bound trains squeezed by the wreckage on one track because the accident had made the second track impassable. The westbound train remained where it had come to a stop, the twisted rail beneath it complicating efforts to clear the corridor and replace the ruined track. A crane arrived, apparently to free the cars."
2679,"Officials from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees the Long Island Rail Road, expressed sorrow over the deaths. Philip Eng, the president of the railroad, said drivers should not try to sidestep crossing gates."
2680,"“Why folks try to risk their lives and other people’s lives, perhaps to save a few minutes, is one I can’t answer,” he said in response to a reporter’s question at a news conference."
2681,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Nassau County executive, Laura Curran, called for the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the crash. But a spokesman for the board said it had no immediate plans to do so because it did not see any broader national issues or safety problems."
2682,"Street-level crossings have long been a hazard in the New York City region, which is crisscrossed by three major commuter railroads with hundreds of spots where streets run across tracks. In 2015, a crowded Metro-North Railroad train slammed into a sport-utility vehicle on the tracks at a crossing in Westchester County. The fiery crash killed seven people — the driver of the S.U.V. and six people on the train."
2683,"As for the Long Island Rail Road, Mr. Cuomo last year announced a plan to replace the seven crossings, and add a third track for about 10 miles through Queens and Nassau County."
2684,He said at the time that people had talked about upgrading the Main Line and improving safety “since the 1940s.”
2685,"There were six fatal crashes on the Main Line between 2007 and 2017, according to the transit agency."
2686,"One of them, at the School Street crossing in 2009, involved a 56-year-old man who apparently threw himself in front of a train, Federal Railroad Administration records showed. Peter I. Cavallaro, the mayor of Westbury, said the crossing had “always been a concern for both pedestrians and for cars” in the village."
2687,"Too often, the crossings invite a dangerous combination of cars, trains and human nature: impatient drivers who drive around the crossing gates, thinking they can beat a train. Drivers also sometimes disregard the gates when they have been down for a while, assuming they are stuck."
2688,"By the time drivers reach the gates, they have ignored other warnings. Painted on the pavement are railroad crossing signs and thick, white lines that are supposed to stop motorists tempted to skirt the gates."
2689,"Mortimer L. Downey, who was a deputy transportation secretary during the Clinton administration, said accidents at crossings were a major problem for railroads."
2690,"“In a collision between you and the locomotive,” he said, “the locomotive is always going to win.”"
2691,"In 1982, a van in Mineola, about four miles from the site of Tuesday’s crash, drove around crossing gates and was struck by a five-car train. Nine teenagers were killed in the late-night crash. The state decided to build a railroad bridge over the crossing, but the project took 16 years and $85 million to complete."
2692,The School Street crossing was set to be eliminated as part of the $2.5 billion upgrade. The proposal also called for widening or raising bridges along the Main Line to reduce the chances of hitting abutments.
2693,The railroad also planned to install an automatic braking system designed to prevent a crash if a train operator does not apply the brakes fast enough.
2694,"The Long Island Rail Road has 296 street-level crossings, and agency officials said the number of accidents at the crossings had declined drastically in recent years."
2695,"In 2017, there were 17. In 2018, there were seven, all before the Long Island Rail Road became the first in the country to put attention-getting flexible delineators — rubber posts attached to the surface of the street that bend if someone drives over them — on all of its street-level crossings. The railroad also said it had worked with the online app Waze to ensure that GPS devices alerted motorists when they were approaching such crossings."
2696,The railroad said there have been no incidents involving motorists turning onto the tracks and going through street-level crossings since it installed the delineators. It put new reflective paint on the pavement leading to the crossings at the same time.
2697,"The crossing where Tuesday’s crash happened is in an industrial triangle, with a waste-transfer station on one side of the road. A factory for a metal-fabricating company was on the other side until recently, when the building and its lot were taken for the planned improvement project."
2698,"Just before the accident, passengers on the eastbound train realized that something was wrong. “It felt like there was metal banging on the bottom of the train,” said Jose Gomez, a passenger in the second-to-last car."
2699,"The train stopped, the power went out and the westbound train passed by making a similar noise, he said."
2700,"A few minutes later, passengers on the westbound train saw flames streaking along the metal skin of Mr. Gomez’s train."
2701,"“It felt like you were going through a furnace momentarily,” said Nirmal Mitra, a copy editor at Newsday who was on his way home on the westbound train. He said the train rattled, and there was a more powerful thud."
2702,"“I thought we were going to get derailed,” he said."

2704,"Los Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than 12 miles an hour. In San Francisco, car speeds have fallen to 10 miles per hour. And Seattle’s streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogether."
2705,"Major cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them. But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan, the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy — even though it was once considered politically toxic, according to municipal officials and transportation analysts."
2706,"“New York’s use of congestion pricing could be a game-changer,” said Travis Brouwer, an assistant transportation director in Oregon, which has considered congestion pricing for traffic-jammed Portland."
2707,"“If New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance, it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricing.”"
2708,"New York, the country’s largest city, will charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars. The tolls are expected to start in 2021."
2709,"Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time, closely watching New York’s move, “to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability and mobility,” said Kelly Cofrancisco, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney."
2710,"Los Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing, and Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in 2021."
2711,"“It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say ‘They’re doing this and it’s working,’” said Michael Manville, an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California, Los Angeles, who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing. “At the very least, it changes the conversation in other cities.”"
2712,"Not everyone is ready to sign up. Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit, where “driving isn’t a choice, it’s a necessity.”"
2713,"A handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place; it has helped clear roads in London, Stockholm and Singapore. But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poor."
2714,"Fueled by an economic boom, a revival of urban areas, a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon, the average speed in urban downtowns fell to 15 miles per hour last year, down from 18 miles per hour in 2015, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics company."
2715,"“I believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities,” said Phil Washington, the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “Here in Los Angeles, our congestion challenges are just as bad, if not worse, than Manhattan’s.”"
2716,"He added, “We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worse.”"
2717,"In New York, many details of a congestion pricing plan — including how much drivers will be charged — are still being worked out. The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started 18 months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business, civic and labor leaders, who saw no other way to tackle gridlock."
2718,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward, making it a centerpiece of the $175 billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled. Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor, threw his support behind it. They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the city’s crumbling subway system."
2719,"And city transit officials, facing a growing financial crisis, warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increases."
2720,"Congestion pricing’s moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country. Historically, cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones — only to find that those, too, became jammed, said Matthew Turner, an economics professor at Brown University."
2721,"As a result, America’s roads are carrying more traffic than ever. The number of people driving to work climbed to about 130 million in 2017, up from 121 million in 2012, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Of those, more than 116 million drove alone, and only 14 million car-pooled. Just 8 million workers took public transportation."
2722,"The increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health, safety and environmental implications. The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high."
2723,"Traffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities: The boom leads to an influx of new residents, businesses and construction. More than two dozen major American cities, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, have more congestion now than a decade ago, according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIX."
2724,"The most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of 97 hours last year, up from 82 hours in 2015. That, in turn, cost the economy roughly $87 billion in lost productivity last year, up from $74 billion in 2015, according to INRIX."
2725,"“It only takes one car that doesn’t get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic,” said Trevor Reed, an INRIX transportation analyst."
2726,"In Seattle, Amazon’s relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub. Now, major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlock."
2727,"“As we build a city of the future, we must reduce our reliance on cars,” Ms. Durkan said. “My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars, a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollution.”"
2728,"Road pricing has been used on some American highways since the 1990s, with tolled express lanes — or so-called Lexus lanes — built alongside regular lanes, offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for it."
2729,"Cities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets. “There’s a critical mass forming where people are saying, ‘enough is enough,’” said Stuart Cohen, the founding director of TransForm, a California-based group that released a recent report on congestion pricing. “They’ve tried everything else and nothing’s working.”"
2730,"Still, Charles Komanoff, a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan, said the idea of “putting a price on driving” clashes with America’s car-loving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom. He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to “shooting a rocket to the moon.” “There’s so much gravity — the forces opposing this are so powerful — it almost seems like defying nature,” he said."
2731,"Oregon looked at congestion pricing in 2005, but “our traffic wasn’t that bad, so people weren’t willing to pay a toll to escape it,” Mr. Brouwer said. But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices. State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the state’s first highway tolls on a seven-mile stretch through Portland."
2732,"Congestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs, and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transit."
2733,"“Social equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing,” Mr. Cohen said. “In West Coast cities, equity is very high on the political agenda.”"
2734,"But Mr. Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on. Congestion fees, he added, can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished drivers."
2735,"In Los Angeles, public buses traveled at an average of 11.8 miles per hour last year, down from 12.2 miles per hour in 2013, according to transit data. Mr. Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride free."
2736,A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing “because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of life.”
2737,"Still, congestion pricing remains a tough sell. After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging $5 to drive in some neighborhoods, Boston’s mayor’s office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricing."
2738,"In New York, drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below 60th Street, where the average speed for vehicles is down to 4.7 miles per hour, from 6.9 miles per hour in 1994."
2739,"John Corlett, a lobbyist for AAA in New York, said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls. “To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope,” he said."
2740,"But Sam Schwartz, an architect of the city’s congestion pricing plan, said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New York’s progress. “If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere,” he said."
2741,"San Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown, including expanded bus and rail service, installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes, said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which is leading the city’s congestion pricing effort."
2742,"“Everyone agrees there’s a problem,” Ms. Chang said. “There are multiple views of the solution. But frankly, we’ve tried a lot of them and they’re not enough.”"
2743,"CÚCUTA, Colombia — The political showdown over the delivery of aid to Venezuela turned deadly Friday when its security forces fired on protesters near the country’s Brazilian border, killing two and wounding a dozen in a confrontation that could signal a more violent and destabilizing struggle over who can claim to be the country’s legitimate leader."
2744,"A critical moment loomed on Saturday, when Venezuela’s opposition, led by Juan Guaidó, vowed to deliver tons of donated humanitarian aid from abroad, against the orders of President Nicolás Maduro."
2745,"The protesters killed on Friday, members of the Pemón indigenous group, opposed Mr. Maduro’s decision, saying the population needs the food and medication. They were shot after closing a road to prevent security forces from passing. Outraged fellow protesters were reported to have seized a Venezuela National Guard commander and his deputies in retaliation."
2746,"The bloodshed came as the presidents of Chile, Colombia and Paraguay flew to the Colombian border town of Cúcuta in a display of anti-Maduro resolve — and were joined by Mr. Guaidó, who defied a travel ban. Crowds converged in the town, where tons of aid have been stockpiled, cheering Latino pop stars in a pro-Guaidó show arranged by Richard Branson, the billionaire entrepreneur."
2747,"By Friday night, Venezuela’s government said it was temporarily closing the three main border bridges between Cúcuta and Venezuela."
2748,"In the history of border standoffs, the one shaping up on the edges of Venezuela has turned into a particularly combustible mix of political theatrics and deadly risks."
2749,"“We are going to see if they will attack people in a peaceful protest, or if they will open the door to this aid,” said Darío Ramírez, a Venezuelan city councilman who fled to Panama five years ago and came to Cúcuta with other opposition activists. They intended to accompany the aid shipment into Venezuela over the Tienditas Bridge, which Mr. Maduro’s forces have blocked with tanker trucks."
2750,"In recent weeks, it has become clear that the standoff at the border is about much more than food and medicine."
2751,"The opposition sees a chance to break through Mr. Maduro’s blockade of the shipments, establishing Mr. Guaidó, who they and more than 50 other countries call Venezuela’s legitimate president, as the one who can provide the country food."
2752,"President Trump said he viewed this moment as the “the twilight hour of socialism” in the hemisphere, a turning point where the Venezuelan military would abandon its president and hand Mr. Trump a foreign policy victory."
2753,"Mr. Maduro sees the pretext for a foreign invasion, which led him to shut the borders to Brazil and the Caribbean island of Curacao while calling the aid shipment a Trojan horse meant to destabilize him."
2754,"And Venezuelans, who have suffered from years of deadly shortages of food and medicine, wonder if this is the end of the crisis that has engulfed their country — or the start of a bigger, perhaps more violent, struggle that would begin on the border."
2755,"“We are tired,” said Jesús Sánchez, a 26-year-old who left the Venezuelan port town of Puerto Cabello and said he would march with the aid on Saturday against Mr. Maduro. “If he goes against us, who are coming disarmed, it is going to get ugly.”"
2756,"The morning began with C-17 military planes revving up in the United States to complete a last airlift of supplies to the border, followed by the arrival of Mr. Trump’s special envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams. As the day progressed, a string of Latin American leaders landed at Cúcuta’s airport as well."
2757,"“They must put themselves on the right side of history, for the good of the people,” said President Iván Duque of Colombia, referring to the Venezuelan soldiers blocking the aid on the other side of the bridge. “To get in the way of aid is a crime against humanity.”"
2758,"Yet the international pressure only left Mr. Maduro digging in and laying blame on Mr. Trump. “The people of Venezuela are saying: ‘Trump, hands off Venezuela!’” he wrote on Twitter."
2759,"Near the Tienditas Bridge, which links Colombia and Venezuela and where much of the aid sat in a warehouse, a crowd of many thousands came to the concert organized by Mr. Branson. Part Latin pop spectacle, part political protest, the event quickly became a stage where artists and concertgoers took the microphone to air their grievances against Mr. Maduro."
2760,"“I came because they’ve destroyed my country,” said María Alejandra Machado Méndez, a 29-year-old teacher from Venezuela, as she stood listening to the singers, which included Maluma and Luis Fonsi. “There’s nothing left for us because they’ve robbed it all. I want to tell my students in the future that I came out to fight.”"
2761,"Despite an international travel ban imposed on Mr. Guaidó by the Venezuelan authorities after he proclaimed himself president last month, he attended the concert and was photographed standing with the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay as fans cheered."
2762,It was unclear whether Mr. Maduro would order border authorities to prevent Mr. Guaidó from re-entering Venezuela or have him arrested if he sought to return.
2763,"Activists said that they were asking concertgoers to remain at the bridge to pack supplies through the night in preparation for the attempted crossing on Saturday. A priest would be on hand to pray with the activists for a safe journey, said Víctor Julio Barboza, who coordinated aid at a small camp set up beside the bridge."
2764,"“The idea is people will stay till the early morning hours and walk with the humanitarian aid,” said Mr. Barboza."
2765,Yet the confrontation in Brazil had already cast a shadow over the upcoming events.
2766,"Ricardo Delgado, a leader of the Pemón indigenous group near the Brazilian border, said the tensions began in the predawn hours when a convoy from the Army and the National Guard tried to reach a checkpoint on the border. A group of indigenous protesters blocked their passage, because they want the aid to come in."
2767,"Mr. Delgado said he told convoy officers that they could not pass, and they left. But hours later, he said, the convoy returned, this time shooting at the indigenous group blocking the streets."
2768,"“I was sleeping and the shooting woke me up,” he said."
2769,"After the deadly confrontation Friday morning, indigenous leaders seized Gen. José Miguel Montoya Ramirez, the head of Bolívar state’s National Guard force, and some of his subordinates, two opposition lawmakers from the area said in interviews."
2770,"The lawmakers, Olivia Lozano and Américo de Grazia, said it was unclear how long the indigenous leaders intended to hold the captives. The lawmakers said the indigenous leaders were trying to ensure security forces would not block the entry of aid."
2771,Military officials did not confirm reports of the detention.
2772,"The White House condemned the shooting and urged the military to let aid into Venezuela. “Egregious violation of human rights by Maduro and those who are following his orders will not go unpunished,” read a statement issued Friday night by the White House press secretary."
2773,Whether events would proceed more peacefully or erupt into more violence on Saturday was anyone’s guess.
2774,Opposition leaders said they planned to take on Mr. Maduro’s forces directly rather than smuggle in the aid through border routes used by contraband traffickers.
2775,"The main point of entry would be the Tienditas Bridge, where a shipment would pass surrounded by protesters who would join them from the Venezuelan side. Others would take smaller packages over pedestrian foot bridges."
2776,"“We’ve faced tear gas before,” said Laurence Castro, an opposition lawmaker from Caracas."
2777,"In Venezuela, several thousand government supporters, mostly public workers, militias and pensioners, gathered on their side of the Tienditas bridge for a counter concert."
2778,"Organizers divided into groups and filed in lines facing the stage, a strategy used in the past by the ruling party to create the appearance of a continuous sea of people when seen from a particular angle."
2779,"“What aid are they talking about when they rob us of billions of dollars in sanctions?” said Gonzalo Ceballos, a retired schoolteacher and ruling party activist who came by bus from the city of San Cristóbal. “We’re congregating here to prevent an aggression that seeks to take control of Venezuela’s strategic resources.”"
2780,"Some said they came to the event in search of free food, traveling from as far as Caracas. One young couple with a child was reduced to begging on the outskirts of the event when they realized no food was being distributed."
2781,Among those who had traveled to the Colombian side of the border were a number of former Venezuelan military officers who have repudiated loyalty to Mr. Maduro. Some spoke openly about armed rebellion against Mr. Maduro.
2782,"“The eyes of the world are here,” said Carlos Guillén Martínez, an army lieutenant who fled the country last year and who has vowed to take up arms against Mr. Maduro."
2783,"Others Venezuelans had come to Cúcuta hoping to take advantage of the activity around the concert to try to make ends meet. Mileidi Ramírez, 42, had come from Venezuela’s Merida state to sell candy at the concert in order to buy food back at home."
2784,"“I left my kids in Venezuela, I have nothing to eat,” she said."
2785,"WASHINGTON — Four Americans were among 19 people killed in Syria on Wednesday in a suicide bombing that was claimed by the Islamic State, just weeks after President Trump ordered the withdrawal of United States forces and declared that the extremist group had been defeated."
2786,"The attack targeted an American military convoy in the northern city of Manbij while troops were inside the Palace of the Princes, a restaurant where they often stopped to eat during patrols, residents said. While the Americans were inside, a nearby suicide attacker wearing an explosive vest blew himself up."
2787,"The bombing raised new questions about Mr. Trump’s surprise decision last month to end the American ground war in Syria. Critics of the president’s plans, including members of his own party, said Mr. Trump’s claim of victory over the Islamic State may have emboldened its fighters and encouraged Wednesday’s strike."
2788,"It was at least the sixth major attack by the Islamic State in less than a month, according to one United States official, and was one of the deadliest days that the American-led coalition had suffered in the fight against the group."
2789,"Mr. Trump’s withdrawal announcement, made over the objections of his top national security officials, “set in motion enthusiasm by the enemy we’re fighting,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a prominent Trump ally who has nonetheless criticized the military drawdown."
2790,"“I saw this in Iraq. And I’m now seeing it in Syria,” Mr. Graham said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday."
2791,"Even as the White House offered condolences over the deaths, Vice President Mike Pence insisted in a statement that the Islamic State had, in fact, been defeated."
2792,"“Thanks to the courage of our armed forces, we have crushed the ISIS caliphate and devastated its capabilities,” Mr. Pence said. “As we begin to bring our troops home, the American people can be assured, for the sake of our soldiers, their families and our nation, we will never allow the remnants of ISIS to re-establish their evil and murderous caliphate — not now, not ever.”"
2793,"There are about 2,000 American troops in Syria. Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, declined to comment when asked if the attack would affect the withdrawal plans."
2794,"The American casualties included two service members, a civilian employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a military contractor, according to the United States Central Command and a Pentagon official. Three other service members were wounded."
2795,The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll from the explosion at 19 — 10 Syrian civilians and five local fighters in addition to the four Americans.
2796,"Surveillance footage posted on social media showed a street with cars double-parked in front of the restaurant and pedestrians on the sidewalk. Then came the blast, consuming the sidewalk in a giant fireball and sending passers-by running for cover."
2797,"A statement from the Islamic State, released through its Amaq news agency, said that the suicide attacker detonated his explosive vest to target a patrol of coalition soldiers and local militiamen near the restaurant in Manbij."
2798,"The city has been ruled by nearly all sides fighting in the Syrian civil war that broke out in 2011. The United States began deploying troops to fight the Islamic State in Syria in 2015; a year later, an American-backed militia of Kurdish and Arab fighters ousted the extremists from Manbij."
2799,"Since then, Manbij has largely been governed and protected by American-backed local councils. While the city is hundreds of miles from any territory held by the Islamic State, it sits next to areas controlled by Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies. American forces maintain a number of bases near Manbij and run frequent patrols."
2800,"The bombing on Wednesday puts Mr. Trump in a tough position: He has long promised to pull the forces out, but also threatened in a Twitter message on Sunday to hit the Islamic State again, and “hard,” if the group lashed out."
2801,"In December, Mr. Trump announced he would withdraw American forces from Syria in as little as 30 days. A day later, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned in protest. Before he left the Pentagon, however, Mr. Mattis signed the formal order to begin the military drawdown."
2802,"But last week, John R. Bolton, the White House national security adviser, outlined conditions for the withdrawal that could leave American forces in Syria for months or even years. So far, the military has begun withdrawing some equipment — but not troops — from Syria. The overall plan for the withdrawal has yet to be described in detail."
2803,Wednesday’s attack revived the debate over Mr. Trump’s strategy.
2804,"“I strongly urge the president to forcefully respond and ensure we do not withdraw our troops until ISIS is completely destroyed,” Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement."
2805,"“The fight against ISIS is clearly not over,” said Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. He said the bombing “is a stark reminder that the Trump administration needs a clearly developed and articulated strategy to secure the gains we have made in the fight.”"
2806,"Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican who heads the Armed Services Committee, also urged Mr. Trump to reconsider the military withdrawal. However, Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who supports the drawdown, met with Mr. Trump at the White House to urge him to stay the course."
2807,"Mr. Paul emerged from the White House saying that he was optimistic Mr. Trump was following through on his Syria policy and that “I really believe there will be changes in Afghanistan, as well.”"

2818,"“I have never been prouder of the president, and I do not say that lightly,” he said during a call with reporters afterward."
2819,"Islamic State fighters have also repeatedly struck in and around the eastern Syrian town of Hajin, where an American-backed Kurdish militia has been battling over the last sliver of territory controlled by the extremists."
2820,"“All I know is that I.S. attacks, like, 3,727,638 times a day,” Mustafa Bali, a spokesman for the militia known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, said sarcastically on Wednesday, speaking through an interpreter."
2821,"The number of Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria is estimated at 20,000 to 30,000, according to recent reports by the Pentagon, the United Nations and the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank based in Washington."
2822,The extremist group has repeatedly boasted in online messages that the military withdrawal from Syria is evidence that it has outlasted the Americans.
2823,"American military officials have warned that there was also a surge in violent attacks in Iraq in 2011 as United States troops were withdrawing from that conflict. Wednesday’s bombing in Syria, the officials said, could be viewed as a signal from the Islamic State that, contrary to Mr. Trump’s assertions that the caliphate has been destroyed, it remains a threat."
2824,"Hassan Hassan, an analyst at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy and an author of a book about the Islamic State, said the attack in Manbij showed that the extremists could still strike in the heart of an area that has long been liberated from its control — and has been the recipient of extensive American support."
2825,"“The U.S. has focused on the city so much and it still has ISIS cells,” he said. “That should be a warning to everyone, that they should build on what the U.S. has been doing rather than just cut and run, leaving the city exposed to an ISIS recovery.”"
2826,"Mr. Hassan’s research indicates that there are many Islamic State sleeper cells scattered around different parts of Syria and Iraq, as well as in Turkey and elsewhere. He called American involvement and presence the most important factor in the Islamic State’s demise, and said a swift withdrawal of United States forces could allow the jihadists to surge back, perhaps reclaiming as much as 50 percent of their former territory."
2827,"Other members of Mr. Trump’s administration have said United States forces should remain in Syria for a number of reasons — including to have leverage in negotiations with President Bashar al-Assad to end the civil war, to keep Iran from expanding its influence, to protect the United States’ Kurdish allies and to prevent a jihadist resurgence."
2828,"Before Wednesday’s bombing, two American service members had been killed in Syria since the first contingent of Special Operation forces entered the country in 2015."
2829,"In March, Master Sgt. Jonathan J. Dunbar, an elite Army commando, was killed by a roadside bomb near Manbij. And in 2016, Senior Chief Petty Officer Scott Cooper Dayton, a bomb disposal technician, was killed in a roadside blast near the town of Ayn Issa."
2830,"Before travelers could fly there, St. Louis, on the Mississippi River, was a natural point of continental convergence for rails, trails and sails, the gateway to the West in the 19th century. That traffic, and the industry that grew up around it, created a legacy of wealth and power that is reflected in the city’s architecture and memorials to its complex history. These days, the downtown core, which boomed with industrialization in the early 20th century, and hollowed out with a rush to the suburbs thereafter, is filling up with new residences, hotel projects and cultural venues (including a museum dedicated to the blues). You can still drink Budweiser in the massive factory where it’s made, but you’ll also find microbreweries that emphasize local ingredients; innovative takes on soul food at restaurants like Gourmet Soul; and flavors introduced by immigrant communities from the Balkans and beyond."
2831,"The 630-foot Gateway Arch, the grand 1965 city landmark, remains the same, including the vintage tram rides to the top (tram ride from $12). But a four-year, $380-million remodeling of Gateway Arch National Park (admission $3) reframes the monument’s connection to the city and to the westward migration it commemorates. A highway that divided the park from the city has been covered, providing additional park land and easy pedestrian access. A sloping plaza now ushers visitors into the subterranean Museum at the Gateway Arch, overhauled to explore Western colonization from different viewpoints, including that of Manifest Destiny (themed “the West was won”), Native Americans (“the West was stolen”) and Mexico (“the North was taken”). Design fans will appreciate the new gallery devoted to Eero Saarinen’s brilliant catenary arch design, including the models of relatively conservative entries it beat in the design competition. Students of history shouldn’t miss the Old Courthouse, part of the park and the site where Dred Scott and his wife, Harriet, sued for their freedom from slavery. "
2832,"St. Louis is the original home of the ubiquitous macro-brew Budweiser. But microbrew operations, some employing veterans of Bud, have created competing pints at newer brewers like Side Project Brewing, Narrow Gauge Brewing Company and Urban Chestnut Brewing Company. If forced to pick one, don’t miss the original upstart, the Saint Louis Brewery, makers of Schlafly beer. Since 1991, the Schlafly Tap Room has occupied a historically registered 1901 printing company building west of downtown in a handsome neighborhood of brick warehouses still awaiting revival. There’s hardly a type of beer Schlafly hasn’t made over the years and the taps turn seasonally. Look for the hazy white lager and refreshing kölsch (pints $6)."

2834,"Many St. Louis chefs champion the abundance of Missouri-grown foods, including, on the high end, the chef Michael Gallina. The native of St. Louis worked at New York’s Blue Hill at Stone Barns for nearly 10 years before moving back home to open the farm-to-table restaurant Vicia. The vegetable-centric menu celebrates Midwestern ingredients with fine-dining flair in the window-wrapped room, and warm servers set a relaxed tone. Dishes change with the seasons, but recently included ham-studded crispy fried rice ($16), fork-tender, grass-fed beef with whey onions ($18), and turnip tacos ($18) that use paper-thin turnip slices as shells for make-your-own tacos, accompanied by strained yogurt, pickled red onion, black beans and optional pork or mushrooms. The bar does liquid wonders with herbs and even leftover yogurt whey."
2835,"Amanda Clark, an historian, can spout all the pertinent facts and figures about St. Louis. But she wanted to combine them with more offbeat, seamy and overshadowed city stories when she founded Renegade Stl tours six years ago. Now the company has expanded its portfolio to include tours themed to disasters and catastrophes, photography, baseball and manufacturing history. The two-hour Downtown History and Architecture Extravaganza (from $20) is a good first outing, covering St. Louis’s start in 1764 as a French trading settlement; the Gilded Age boom when city merchants profited outfitting westward migrants; and the midcentury development of the Gateway Arch. En route she points out architectural gems from the architects Louis Sullivan and Philip Johnson and discusses the city’s early experiment in legal prostitution and its ongoing struggle with brick theft from historic buildings."
2836,"Waves of immigrants — including Italians in the restaurant-filled Hill district and Germans, among them the founders of Anheuser-Busch beer — have left their mark on St. Louis. More recently, beginning in the 1990s, refugees from Bosnia flocked to affordable St. Louis, particularly the Bevo Mill district, home to a replica of a wooden fountain found in Sarajevo. The community’s proudest culinary expression is found in suburban Webster Groves where Balkan Treat Box, long a popular food truck, just opened a brick-and-mortar, lunch-only shop dealing grilled beef sausages called cevapi ($11) and Turkish wood-fired pide flatbread with Balkan kajmak cream ($11)."
2837,"In the Botanical Heights District, named for its proximity to the comprehensive Missouri Botanical Garden, Union Studio provides one-stop shopping for a variety of local art, clothing, jewelry and crafts. Wander over to browse for handle-free ceramic mugs by the potter Al Westcott, handmade ties and pocket squares by Lonesome Traveler and sensuously draping pendant necklaces from Mahnal Jewelry by Shayba Muhammad. Pick up souvenirs from an assortment of St. Louis-themed cards, pins and dish towels. If perishables are more your style, hit Union Loafers bakery and cafe next door for a loaf of fresh sourdough."
2838,"Two of the city’s many interesting museums are small enough to hit in one stimulating spree. First, stop in the Grand Center neighborhood at the Pulitzer Arts Foundation (free), a fascinating blend of Tadao Ando’s minimalist architecture and rotating exhibitions of contemporary art from St. Louis’s famed publishing family. Continue downtown to the two-year-old National Blues Museum ($15), which pays homage to the American musical form that evolved from field hollers and rags by W.C. Handy to Muddy Waters’ electric blues and Chuck Berry’s early rock ’n’ roll. Interactive exhibits allow visitors to write and create their own blues song by choosing piano, harmonica and guitar styles, writing lyrics and mixing it all up in a sound booth. Send yourself the finished results via email. Besides being a great introduction to the blues, the museum celebrates African-American culture in St. Louis, which is also home to the Scott Joplin House State Historic Site where the ragtime composer lived, and The Griot Museum of Black History, featuring exhibits on slavery and wax figures of area-born celebrities, including Josephine Baker."
2839,"The chef most closely associated with St. Louis’s culinary emergence, Gerard Craft, has done French, Italian and now, in his new restaurant called Cinder House, South American food. A tribute, in part, to his childhood nanny from Brazil, Cinder House serves a mix of wood-fired dishes from grilled prawns ($15) to steaks (from $32), and Brazilian pork, beef and chimichurri feijoada ($32) and moqueca seafood stew ($30). Situated in the riverfront Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis, Cinder House includes a spacious outdoor patio that serves caipirinhas and mojitos ($11), in addition to Instagrammable views of the Gateway Arch."
2840,"There is a wealth of choices in the rich performing arts scene, including the Repertory Theatre of St. Louis, which includes the playwright Tony Kushner as an alumnus. St. Louis Black Repertory bills itself as the nation’s largest professional African-American theater company. Earlier this year it staged the premiere of “Canfield Drive,” exploring media coverage of the 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson, Mo.; “Nina Simone: Four Women” runs May 15 to June 2. The second-oldest symphony in the country, the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra plays in Powell Symphony Hall, an ornate 1935 vaudeville theater. In summer, the 100-year-old Municipal Opera Association, known as the Muny, stages popular musicals (“Guys and Dolls” kicks off the season June 10) in a vast 10,800-seat outdoor stadium in Forest Park."
2841,"Arrive early or prepare to line up at Half & Half in suburban Clayton, where the chef and owner, Mike Randolph takes breakfast seriously. A little more than half of the menu in the sunny, bustling storefront skews savory, with dishes like a fried egg sandwich ($8.50), and veggie hash with eggs and potatoes that comes in a piping hot skillet ($11). On the sweet side, there’s pancakes with raspberry jam, mascarpone and granola ($11) and s’mores French toast ($10.50). Wash it down with bottomless cups of locally roasted Blueprint Coffee ($3.95)."
2842,"The site of the St. Louis World’s Fair in 1904, the nearly 1,300-acre Forest Park serves as the wilderness and playing field for urban residents, as well as a cultural magnet with attractions that include the Saint Louis Art Museum, Missouri History Museum, Saint Louis Zoo and Saint Louis Science Center. You can drive around the park, but the best way to see it is on foot, following paths that wind through forests and prairies and around tranquil ponds. Park-goers can also rent a kayak at the boathouse ($15 an hour), play tennis ($5) or golf (from $22)."
2843,"With its many museums, St. Louis covers the spectrum of culture, anchored on the playful end by City Museum (admission $15). The all-ages playground, based in a 600,000-square-foot former shoe factory, houses a mix of eclectic exhibits and carnival attractions, including a Ferris wheel and giant slide on the roof. Slides, as well as stairs, connect four levels of this arty fun house, which features an aquarium, collections of architectural artifacts, mosaics and taxidermy and a mini shoelace factory. Its “no maps” policy encourages guests to let loose and go where the treehouse or the underground caves lead."

2848,"In recent months, Kansas City has become an unexpected destination for technology companies looking for a place to test ideas. The city’s goal: To be what it calls a living lab."
2849,"Far from technology centers on the coasts, Kansas City and dozens of other cities have begun competing for federal grant dollars and tech company attention. They want to remake themselves as “smart cities,” where technology is seen as a tool to help grow, improve school systems and air quality, and make traffic move faster."
2850,"“People are starting to notice us,” the mayor of Kansas City, Mo., Sly James, said. “We have people coming to town thinking there are going to be cows and tumbleweeds and coming away with a whole other idea.”"
2851,"Hundreds of cities, large and small, have adopted or begun planning smart cities projects. But the risks are daunting. Experts say cities frequently lack the expertise to understand privacy, security and financial implications of such arrangements. Some mayors acknowledge that they have yet to master the responsibilities that go along with collecting billions of bits of data from residents."
2852,"Concerns have intensified as Kansas City prepares to expand its technology experiment from downtown to poor neighborhoods on the city’s East Side. The expansion will bring free wireless to homes, but also dozens of surveillance cameras and a gunshot detection system, and some residents worry that in the quest to be seen as forward thinking, the city may be handing off too much control to private companies and opening up residents to consequences it doesn’t fully understand."
2853,"“We increasingly see every problem as a technology-related problem, so the solution is more technology,” said Ben Green, a Harvard University graduate student who studies cities and technology. “And you have cities, which are caught in this devil’s bargain, where they feel they don’t have the resources to provide the services people need, and so they make these deals with tech companies that have money, but which in the long term might not be beneficial to either them or their residents.”"
2854,"In Seattle, officials this year began to dismantle a network of surveillance cameras and wireless devices that the police had deemed vital in fighting crime, but that drew complaints over the network’s ability to track cellphones."
2855,Several government officials in Toronto were fired this month after they tried to rush through a large technology project proposed by a company affiliated with Google.
2856,"And high-tech criminals have also presented problems: In Atlanta, hackers broke into the City Hall network this year and demanded a ransom to unlock it."
2857,Supporters of “smart cities” say that the potential is enormous and that some projects could go beyond creating efficiencies and actually save lives. Among the plans under development are augmented reality programs that could help firefighters find people trapped in burning buildings and the collection of sewer samples by robots to determine opioid use so that city services could be aimed at neighborhoods most in need.
2858,The hazards are also clear.
2859,"“Cities don’t know enough about data, privacy or security,” said Lee Tien, a lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on digital rights. “Local governments bear the brunt of so many duties — and in a lot of these cases, they are often too stupid or too lazy to talk to people who know.”"
2860,"Cities habitually feel compelled to outdo each other, but the competition has now been intensified by lobbying from tech companies and federal inducements to modernize."
2861,"“There is incredible pressure on an unenlightened city to be a ‘smart city,’” said Ben Levine, executive director at MetroLab Network, a nonprofit organization that helps cities adapt to technology change."
2862,"That has left Washington, D.C., and dozens of other cities testing self-driving cars and Orlando trying to harness its sunshine to power electric vehicles. San Francisco has a system that tracks bicycle traffic, while Palm Beach, Fla., uses cycling data to decide where to send street sweepers. Boise, Idaho, monitors its trash dumps with drones. Arlington, Tex., is looking at creating a transit system based on data from ride-sharing apps."
2863,Kansas City is trying to position itself as the most forward-thinking of all.
2864,"It has promoted its use of technology with aggressive marketing, proclaiming itself the nation’s “smartest city.” It has hosted international conferences, offered advice to other cities, and its tech guru, Bob Bennett, has become the public face of a smart cities movement."
2865,"“Cities that fail to embrace technology today, that fail to embrace a data-driven approach, those cities will be in the digital Rust Belt 20 years from now,” Mr. Bennett said."
2866,"Much of Kansas City’s progress stemmed from its selection in 2011 as the first metropolitan area to get Google Fiber, an ultrafast internet and television service. Then five years ago, it was approached by Cisco Systems, the tech giant."
2867,"At the time, Kansas City was digging a trench under Main Street for a streetcar line. Cisco told officials that since there would be a hole in the street anyway, the city might as well install fiber optic cable and electronic sensors to monitor traffic."
2868,"The sensors, Cisco argued, would help City Hall understand how the city behaves in an unobtrusive way, and at relatively little cost."
2869,The city also built 25 kiosks along the 2.2-mile streetcar line to provide tourist information and installed public Wi-Fi. It installed surveillance cameras and LED streetlights also outfitted with video cameras.
2870,"The city borrowed much of its $3.7 million portion of the cost. Sprint, which manages the Wi-Fi network, contributed about $7 million, while Cisco invested $5 million."
2871,There was no competitive bidding.
2872,"The city’s downtown corridor now monitors nearly everything that happens along this stretch of road — cars, pedestrians and parking spaces. The wireless system has been used by 2.7 million people."
2873,"But some results have been modest. Despite sensors linked to traffic signals, motorists have saved only an average of 37 seconds from their commutes, according to the city."
2874,And a crime location predictor with an algorithm that takes into account everything from 911 calls to weather patterns has yet to reduce assaults in the city’s entertainment district.
2875,"Sprint collects data from users who log onto the wireless network, including their home ZIP codes, internet searches and location."
2876,"Some of the information — including phone numbers and other potentially identifying information — is available even if one does not log on to the wireless network, city officials and data experts said."
2877,Sprint declined to discuss the data it collects or how it uses it.
2878,"But the company said its work was critical in cities like Kansas City, Mo., where people want access to the latest technology. (While Kansas City, Kan., also received Google Fiber, most of the technology changes are occurring on the Missouri side of the river.)"
2879,"“People are ready for smart things,” said Patricia Watkins, Sprint’s director of emerging solutions. “For the first time, instead of asking why we’re doing this, they’re asking, ‘Why can’t we do this?’ It will force cities to move ahead with these things because their constituents will be asking for it.”"
2880,"On Kansas City’s East Side, officials hope to extend the wireless system to reach homes of about 80,000 residents along Prospect Avenue, one of the main thoroughfares in the neighborhood. Only about 40 percent of homes there have internet access."
2881,"The city says it wants to transform the neighborhood, which has a high crime rate and is dotted with vacant buildings. It plans to install air quality sensors, water meters to detect leaks, a bus line, surveillance cameras and a gunshot detection system."
2882,Some residents thought the changes would bring an economic boost to the area.
2883,"“I’m just elated,” said Cheryl Barnes, president of a local residents’ group. “It will provide a measure of hope to the neighborhood.”"
2884,"Quinton Lucas, who represents the East Side on the City Council, said while the project represented “a psychological investment in the area,” he worried about all the surveillance."
2885,"“I have a concern about monitoring inner cities in a different way than other neighborhoods,” he said. “Is this going to accrue to the detriment of young black men?”"
2886,Mr. Lucas said he wondered whether Kansas City was moving too fast.
2887,“When you look at the amount of change in the world — and basically we’re operating on a hunch — how are we sure if we are getting the best deal available?” he said.

2889,"Our columnist, Sebastian Modak, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2019 list. He arrived in Houston after stops in Puerto Rico and Panama. "
2890,"At first glance, much of Houston looks alike. Making your way out of the “Loop,” the I-610 highway that circles the city center like a shirt collar, skyscrapers give way to manicured office parks and strip malls, each seemingly a carbon copy of the last. But when you look a little closer, you notice that in one of those strip malls, all the business names carry the tonal accents of written Vietnamese. In another, two Indian restaurants sit on either side of a service specializing in money transfers to Central America. In a nearby parking lot, a family — the men wearing skullcaps and knee-length agbada shirts and the women in brightly-patterned hijabs — loads up a sedan with the ingredients for a meal that I imagine tastes like another home, thousands of miles away."
2891,"Houston is widely considered to be one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. According to the city’s planning department, 48 percent of residents speak a language other than English — and more than 145 languages are spoken in the city. Twenty-nine percent of the population is foreign-born. "
2892,"Diversity wasn’t the main reason Houston was on 2019’s 52 Places to Go list, but food and culture were. There’s the addition of the Drawing Institute to the brilliantly curated Menil Collection; a wave of new trendy Downtown food halls; the glitzy Post Oak hotel, home to a Rolls-Royce showroom and Frank Stella art — all rising out of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. But unless you sequester yourself in the chic apartments of Downtown or the mansions of River Oaks, that diversity is everywhere you look — and everywhere you eat. "

2937,"So, feeling a kind of kinship with all those Houstonians who live between worlds based on my own unmoored and multicultural background, I leaned into it. I ate more than I should have and blew my Uber budget pretty quickly, but over three meals in a single day, I found a Houston I never imagined existed in the cracks between SUV-clogged freeways and oil-boom money."
2938,"“You’d fit in perfectly out here,” Robin Wong said to me, referring to Southwest Houston, home to Alief, where Chinatown blends seamlessly into Little Saigon; the Hillcroft area, recently named the “Mahatma Gandhi District” where South and Central Asians share retail space and public schools; and a host of other ethnic enclaves. “In this area, everyone’s a minority,” he said."
2939,"We had just sat down for a midmorning feast at Ocean Palace, a dim sum hall that in scope more resembles a castle (moat included) than a restaurant. I joined Robin, 43, and his brother Terry, 45, to learn about this neighborhood, Chinatown, where they had grown up. I also wanted to hear about their restaurant, Blood Bros. BBQ, which they run with their childhood friend, Quy Hoang, 46, who carries the distinction of being the first Vietnamese-American pitmaster in the city. (Mr. Hoang had celebrated his birthday the night before and for reasons that you can probably figure out, couldn’t make it for our allotted 11 a.m. time slot.)"
2940,"The two brothers took control of the ordering, conferring in low tones as they checked items off a piece of paper. Over a spread of slick cheung fun rolls, scalding shrimp-filled har gow dumplings, chicken feet, turnip cakes, and more, the Wong brothers told me what it was like growing up in the most diverse section of the most diverse city in the U.S."
2941,"“My best friends, my childhood friends, are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, black, white—— You get exposed to so much growing up in Alief,” Robin said. “And people here, they love it; they love trying new things. It’s part of being from this neighborhood.”"
2942," Much of the attention around Blood Bros., which opened late last year in the suburb of Bellaire, has been on the owners’ backgrounds: Two Chinese-Americans and a Vietnamese-American pitmaster hitting the Texas trinity of BBQ — brisket, pork ribs, sausage — does not make for your average BBQ joint. That attention only increased when they started thinking more outside-the-pit. Some days, they will do a smoked turkey banh mi, which I can say firsthand is just as good as it sounds, the charcoal accents of the turkey providing a counterweight to the tanginess of the banh mi’s traditional fixings. They’ve experimented with Thai green curry boudins, a Cajun sausage traditionally stuffed with rice, liver, and aromatics, and their brisket fried rice is one of the restaurant’s most popular sides."
2943,"“It’s not about Asian-inspired whatever. We just make what we like,” Robin said, after pointing out some theoretical riffs he could pull on the dim sum spread out before us, only half joking. “We love the har gow dumplings. But what if we smoked them?”"
2944,"Houston might be the least pedestrian-friendly major city I’ve ever encountered. You will spend a lot of time in cars. Besides the relatively dense Downtown area, the city is very spread out. I didn’t rent a car and probably should have. If you choose to go carless, you’ll be taking a lot of Ubers and Lyfts, which thankfully are more affordable than in many cities in the United States."
2945,"That being said, I found Downtown a great place to stay. While, with the exception of some new food halls, there’s not all that much to do in the area if you’re not part of the business casual crowd, I found myself 15 minutes from everything, whether it was dim sum in Chinatown, the quirky bars and cafes of Montrose, or Cafeza, in the First Ward, which hosts a killer open jam session every Monday night. "
2946,"The first thing I noticed when entering Afghan Village, an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall in Hillcroft (a k a the Gandhi District) was the flags. Side by side, Afghan and American flags filled most of the free space behind the counter; a vertical American flag was draped across one corner of the restaurant, and another small one stood tucked into a corner just above the tandoor. The green, black, and red of the Afghan flag provided the color scheme for the whole space."
2947,"Omer Yousafzai, 41, opened Afghan Village over six years ago. He came to the United States in 2001, following his brother, studied law, and then spent years working with the U.S. military in a linguistics recruitment program. That brought him back to Afghanistan where American and Afghan soldiers alike craved home-cooked Afghan meals instead of the frozen food shipped in from the U.A.E. and elsewhere."
2948,"“That’s when I started thinking, ‘An Afghan restaurant could be a good idea,’” he told me as we dug into bowls of finely balanced lamb and chicken karahi (a lightly spiced curry), lamb chops, and fluffy naan fresh out of the tandoor."
2949,There was never any question where he would open that restaurant. 
2950,"“There’s something about Houston that attracts so many people,” he said. “It takes you in.”"
2951,"When I asked him to try and pinpoint the reason for that, he identified the city’s diversity as a kind of self-perpetuating system."
2952,"“I think the reason is its diversity,” he said. “You can blend in here. You can claim this place is home and nobody questions that.”"
2953,"A childhood friend connected me with Iveth Reyes, 30, a social worker in Houston’s public school system, saying that she would know where to find legitimate Mexican food. "
2954,"Ms. Reyes told me to meet her at Raizes Mexican Kitchen in Stafford, just outside Houston’s city limits, which she said was the place to try the real deal from Michoacán, the Mexican state where she was born before being brought over the border by her parents at the age of two."
2955,"The restaurant’s owner, Aristo Gaspar, 50, also from Michoacán, has been in Houston for more than 30 years and now operates three restaurants around the city. He brought out plates of carnitas tacos and enchiladas smothered in a chile reduction that more closely resembled mole than the salsa you’ll find at Tex-Mex spots. Looking up at the menu, I noticed that the Mexican dishes were listed right alongside chicken and waffles. Mr. Gaspar has learned to adapt to many tastes."
2956,"“This food still tastes like home,” Ms. Reyes said, as we spread habanero sauce on the plate of enchiladas."
2957,"She works in an elementary school in Gulfton, Houston’s most densely populated neighborhood, which has long been a first stop for new immigrants to the city. She didn’t have the same utopian view of cross-cultural harmony that I had encountered in others. "
2958,"“The younger kids all get along; it’s like they don’t even know there’s a difference between them,” she told me. “But as they grow older they start forming cliques.”"
2959,Ms. Reyes told me that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey people put their differences aside and got to work repairing what was broken.
2960,"“You really saw how close-knit this city is and how it can come together,” she said. “People were out helping neighbors, or bringing their boats into different neighborhoods to help people get around.”"
2961,"She pointed to her mother, Olga Farías, as an example. With electricity out after the hurricane, Ms. Reyes’s mother was called into the school cafeteria, where she worked, to clean out the freezers. Disobeying orders to throw away all the leftover food, she loaded up her car instead and drove around the city looking for people in need of a meal."
2962,"“It sucks that it took a tragedy to bring that out of the city, but it did,” Ms. Reyes said."
2963,"WHEN THE CULINARY mecca Dean & DeLuca opened in 1977 in SoHo, then a wasteland of industrial buildings that had been overtaken by artists, the shop was both a harbinger of the glossy retail scene that would soon consume the neighborhood and one of New York’s first importers of now-common ingredients: leatherwood honey from Australia, smoky Gouda from Holland, extra-virgin olive oil from Sicily. Artists like Donald Judd, who had bought a cast-iron building down the street, would swing by Joel Dean and Giorgio DeLuca’s shop every week for groceries. The duo brought to downtown tastes and textures once confined to small European villages, made using centuries-old techniques."
2964,"But beyond its gastronomic legacy, Dean & DeLuca also made a name for itself in New York — and eventually, at its more than 40 locations, around the world — for another innovation: its ultraminimalist store design, conceptualized by the artist Jack Ceglic, the enterprise’s unnamed third partner, who was for 46 years the partner of Dean, who died in 2004. (DeLuca, 75, still lives in Manhattan; Pace Development, a Thai real-estate corporation, now owns the company.) Ceglic, then a painter who specialized in figurative portraiture, had no intention of becoming directly involved in the 2,400-square-foot store, but he was the pickiest of the three, so he was drafted by Dean: “He said, ‘You don’t like anything, Jack, so you design it,’” Ceglic, now 83, recalls."
2965,"In an era defined by shag carpeting, wicker baskets and macramé tapestries — the prevailing palette was, as Ceglic recalls, harvest gold and avocado green — he decided the corner storefront should instead be completely free of color or texture: a monochrome box that would contrast against, say, the crimson of sun-dried tomatoes. In keeping with the minimalist floor-through apartment that he and Dean resided in nearby (the current owner has kept it, museumlike, as one of the last examples of the period’s early ’80s loft style, all white columns and exposed piping), Ceglic built out Dean & DeLuca with bright white plaster walls, floors of matching white ceramic tile, butcher-block countertops in bleached maple and glass-and-stainless-steel cases to display the prepared foods and salads, a novel concept at the time. In a gesture that was considered daring 40 years ago, the walls were lined with open chrome shelves, made by a Pennsylvania company called Metro, upon which condiments and crackers were displayed like first edition books. As electricians wired industrial ceiling fans and plumbers hooked up stainless steel sinks, Ceglic pushed most of his metal racks and butcher-block tables toward the middle of the store, creating an oasis of colorful fresh vegetables amid gleaming copper cookware to entice pedestrians, like an installation inside a new SoHo gallery."
2966,"Ceglic’s aesthetic — part of an overall movement toward what would be called high-tech design (a combination of “high style” and “technology”) — proved to be enduringly influential, helping usher in a new era of kitchens. A generation of Patrick Batemans who bought Italian seasoning salt at the store started swapping out their maple cabinets and Formica countertops for open shelving, aluminum spice canisters and stainless steel islands with locking caster wheels. The effect was a cross between a commercial-grade restaurant kitchen and a masculine fantasy of the bachelor home cook, with brawny professional-grade appliances, handsome imported knives and Pyrex bowls. In fact, this elegant reconception of the efficient kitchen, which was rapidly becoming the social nucleus of the modern American home after having been a hidden-away female preserve, came to dominate, its high-low appeal blurring the distinction between the industrial and the domestic."
2967,"IT IS ALSO how Ceglic himself continues to live. Down a pebbled walkway a few blocks off the main drag of lavishly quaint East Hampton, N.Y., his weekend home rises from the flat terrain like a newly constructed barn, from behind a raw concrete courtyard wall surrounded by a throng of ferns. The 2,300-square-foot home, which Ceglic originally designed for himself and Dean 18 years ago, quietly contrasts with the area’s chocolate-hued, shingled farmhouses and pristine Georgians. Ceglic’s house is constructed entirely from standing-seam steel forged in prefabricated lengths by an Ohio company that specializes in airplane hangars and other industrial buildings; its cool blue-gray finish blends into the Long Island sky and is guaranteed by the manufacturer to last 20 years. The narrow, 20-foot-high windows are the kind used for SoHo storefronts; the horizontally divided, steel Dutch front door is standard-issue for firehouses; the floors throughout the main 48-foot-long living space — “the plaza,” as Ceglic calls it — are poured concrete with radiant coil heating. The walls, skim coated with white plaster, are crowned by three celestial south-facing windows."
2968,"Ceglic lives here with his partner, the 66-year-old architect Manuel Fernandez-Casteleiro; they met 14 years ago, after a mutual friend told the architect that Ceglic’s house resembled one of his firm’s dramatically austere residential projects. “I came and saw the house and said, ‘Oh my God!’” Fernandez-Casteleiro starts to explain, before Ceglic finishes his sentence: “We shared the same ideas.”"
2969,"And good thing they did, because the home, like the high-tech movement it reflects, follows few conventional design tropes. If anything, it’s a testament to stripping away residential clichés — knowing what not to do, recognizing what to leave out. For instance, there are few interior doors aside from a restaurant-style, swinging aluminum one that hides a toilet and a barn door that hides another water closet. The bedroom — little more than an upholstered bed frame surrounded by white metal shelves that hold architecture and design books — is at the center of a master suite ingeniously shaped like a nautilus; as you work your way inward, you reach a walk-in closet in which the couple has hidden a collection of contemporary art that includes Andy Warhol drawings and photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans and Catherine Opie, and then a deep porcelain bathtub originally made for hospitals. In the main room, Ceglic keeps the walls bare “because I have this problem with visual noise,” he says. “I think it’s nice when you have a dinner party and the people at the table become the portrait.” Even the wall switches are very low, 28 inches from the ground, lest they distract his eye."
2970,"AS MIGHT BE expected, much of the home is oriented toward eating. Fernandez-Casteleiro does the grocery shopping and Ceglic cooks — simply, from memory, occasionally referring to Dean & DeLuca’s 1996 cookbook — inside a narrow kitchen that’s engineered entirely out of stainless steel fixtures in precise specifications (34-inch-high countertops, two inches shorter than standard to align with his wrists; 34 inches between the island and the oven behind it; no double sinks permitted) that allow him to work without wasting movement. All of it comes from a Long Island supply company that’s now run by Ceglic’s former Dean & DeLuca assistant. They eat at a gangplank-long mahogany table custom made in the early ’80s by Ceglic’s friend Joseph D’Urso, another pioneer of high-tech design, flanked by metallic de Stijl chairs painted a cyan hue, designed in 1927 by the Dutch architect J.J.P. Oud."
2971,"Other than that semblance of a dining area, the room is adorned with little more than a giant 20-year-old tree fern that nearly reaches the 20-foot ceilings, a squat wood-fired iron stove, a few Kvadrat-upholstered vintage chairs and some artifacts gathered over the years, such as a Victorian palm pedestal and a carved elephant statue bought decades ago at a yard sale. The couple occasionally updates these tableaus, shopping from a collection of Modernist, Edwardian and Victorian pieces hidden in the basement. In contrast with their strictly controlled interiors, they allow their two-acre yard to largely remain wild, with the deer that proliferate free to munch on the day lilies, clearing space for ceaseless waves of bright green ferns."
2972,"The house has always been out of step with what passes for Hamptons style; Ceglic and Dean themselves only ended up here after the decades-long gay reverie that transformed the Fire Island Pines into an AIDS-induced nightmare. But the clean, unsentimental ethos of the residence has gained fans over the years, and other rich creative types nearby have hired Ceglic to design their homes, retreats that while physically in the Hamptons, remain psychographically apart from it. In Bridgehampton, for instance, Ceglic created a compound for five Broadway veterans — the director Joe Mantello, the playwright Jon Robin Baitz and the actors Ron Rifkin, Ken Olin and Patricia Wettig — that appears as several shadow-gray shipping containers linked like oversize Legos."
2973,"Inside such pared-down spaces, Ceglic believes life and art are best lived separately. If you follow the alleyway behind his patio, you’ll find another blue-gray structure: a cavernous, 1,000-square-foot cabin fronted by a garage door. Ceglic and Fernandez-Casteleiro built it five years ago, and it is here that Ceglic spends his days, creating the life-size portraits that he has focused on since his early days in New York, a collection of work in the vein of Robert Longo, another hero of the high-tech movement. Recent ones, made in oil stick on 72-inch-by-48-inch sheets of paper, are based on candid photographs he took of 20-somethings obsessively staring downward at their smartphones. When not at the Long Island house, the couple lives in a similarly uncluttered apartment on lower Fifth Avenue in Manhattan; Ceglic finds his subjects while traversing the city, surreptitiously capturing them from across a subway car or waiting in the lobby at the doctor’s office. Typically, these people are too absorbed in texting to notice him as he watches them. The cultural shift toward gadgets that consume us — arguably with the same frenetic verve that characterized the Dean & DeLuca food revolution — has permanently changed the spaces around us. But once again Ceglic has chosen to turn that unease with modern technology into something palatable: art."

2975,"One frigid morning last month, April Turner sidled up to the parapet of a 21-story apartment building on the Upper West Side, climbed over the edge and dangled herself 188 feet above the pavement."
2976,"Suspended by ropes like the ones used by rock climbers, she slid past balcony ledges and window frames, careful not to lock eyes with dumbstruck residents. With a tiny mallet and a point-and-shoot camera, she cataloged cracks and blemishes on the building’s facade, pausing at each floor to feel around for fatal flaws."
2977,"If pedestrians bothered to watch, they might have applauded as she touched down near a neighboring nail salon. Without fanfare, she detached her gear, walked back inside the co-op and took the elevator to the roof for another drop — to canvass another section of the postwar building’s dappled face."
2978,It’s all in a day’s work for a growing number of New York City’s building facade inspectors.
2979,"The city requires that of the approximately 1 million buildings in New York City, those taller than six stories — more than 14,500 structures — have their facades inspected every five years, to ensure the safety of passers-by below. Rather than using bulky swing-stage scaffolds, like the ones for window washing, or hydraulic cranes that block traffic, an increasing number of design and engineering firms are training their staff to rappel down the side of skyscrapers in search of dangerous defects."
2980,"Rope-access inspections can be less expensive, less time-consuming and less likely to provoke the ire of co-op and condo boards because they are less obtrusive than other means. In a city crowded with new towers, the inspections are expected to grow more popular — good news for thrill seekers hoping to scale the city’s terra-cotta canyons. Among them: A growing number of women, who have been historically underrepresented in these jobs."
2981,"“My entire class was basically all females,” Ms. Turner, 29, said of her rope-access training in 2016, which was a first for her instructor. “There were two men, and one dropped out.”"
2982,"Ms. Turner is an assistant project manager for CANY, an architecture and engineering firm that specializes in building facades. She joined the firm in 2013 as a drafter, but her co-workers urged her to train for rope work after they learned she was an amateur boulderer. "
2983,"CANY began performing rope-access inspections in 2000 with four staff members, all of them men, said Stephen Lythe, the chief executive. The work also requires the assistance of rigging crews, who supervise the drops. Now, eight out of 15 of the firm’s rope-access technicians are women."
2984,"Ms. Turner’s job mostly involves client meetings and paperwork, but as the late-February deadline for building owners to submit safety reports approached, the pace quickened to four rope-inspections in a week, when usually she does one a month. In all, she has performed about 40 on-rope inspections."
2985,"Her favorite part of the job? “You get to see New York,” she said. “It’s a private viewing, almost.”"
2986,"In the relatively short history of facade inspections in New York City, industrial rope access, as it is known, is a recent addition. In 1980, the City Council enacted Local Law 10 in response to the death of Grace Gold, a Barnard student killed by falling masonry the previous year. The city mandated that all buildings taller than six stories undergo a “visual inspection,” which, critics said, could mean a cursory glance with binoculars from the ground."
2987,"In 1998, the City Council passed the more rigorous Local Law 11 after a series of dangerous accidents, including one at a Madison Avenue office building where loose brick rained down on the street. Now known as the Building Facade Safety Program, the rules require a physical inspection of the street-facing elevations and a visual survey of the others."
2988,"But accidents continue. Last year, a man in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan was struck and killed by a piece of a fire escape that fell seven stories."
2989,"The bulk of these inspections are still performed on scaffolds or cranes, but that is changing for a number of reasons."
2990,"“Rope access will find its place more and more with these new, complicated buildings,” said Howard L. Zimmerman, the founder of Howard L. Zimmerman Architects, which specializes in building exteriors. The firm performs about 500 to 600 facade-safety inspections every five years. In 2017, it began performing rope-access inspections, which now make up about 10 percent of all its inspections. "
2991,"The triangular Flatiron Building, which Mr. Zimmerman’s firm was hired to inspect in December, illustrates why. The firm used a team of five rappelers to examine the 22-story terra-cotta-and-limestone building in one day, for around $25,000. A conventional inspection with scaffolds would have cost closer to $100,000 and taken weeks to complete, because of permitting issues and limited rigging space on the building, said Carolyn Caste, the firm’s director of facade compliance. (Ms. Caste, who has been with the firm since 2010, first rappelled off the side of a building last year.)"
2992,"As buildings are typically inspected every five years, the newest ones required to have their facades checked were built around 2014. Going forward, inspectors can expect more unusual buildings, with odd shapes and cantilevered boxes dictated by irregular lots and restrictive building codes. Not all jobs will be more cost-effective or faster with rope access, but many could benefit from the flexibility that ropes offer."
2993,"Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner at Schwartz Sladkus Reich Greenberg Atlas LLP, a law firm that represents real estate clients, said the inspections can put neighboring building owners at odds. He represents clients in building-access negotiations about 30 times a year — three times as many as a decade ago — in instances where scaffolding might be hung for weeks or longer to comply with inspections. Unhappy residents in neighboring buildings argue that the scaffolds block views, blot out the sun and limit access to outdoor space. Rope inspections rarely take that long, because the rigging is more versatile and easier to install."
2994,"But in spite of objections, the work is necessary. “It’s kind of frightful what you see on some of these buildings,” said David May, an architect and principal at Superstructures Engineers + Architects, which specializes in exterior restoration."
2995,"In the prewar set, there are unstable parapets and spalling concrete. Midcentury buildings, with their cost-saving, hollow-cavity walls, might have rotting steel ties that could send bricks tumbling down. Sagging lintels — the support beams above windows — and cracked balconies can plague buildings of all ages. And, of course, there is the chronic fear of falling air-conditioners, shared by many New Yorkers."
2996,"New glass towers also pose risks: “Spontaneous glass breakage,” for instance, is industry-speak for a manufacturing defect in which nickel contaminants in glass cause cracks or worse."
2997,"Last year, 564 out of 3,305 buildings inspected, or 17 percent, were deemed unsafe, either because of an imminent safety hazard like loose brick or because of uncorrected issues from a previous inspection. The largest share of reports — 1,479, or 45 percent — was deemed conditionally safe, provided specified repairs were completed. "
2998,"There were 247 requests for rope-access work in 2018, up from 193 in 2015, according to the Department of Buildings. Those numbers include other rope work, including facade repairs, said Yegal Shamash, an assistant commissioner, who noted that he has seen a steady rise in rope-access inspections over the last 10 years. "
2999,"“I had no idea that kind of niche in the architecture world existed,” said Amy DeLuca, 33, a project manager with CANY. “I ended up seeing a promotional photo of someone rappelling” down the side of a building, she added, “and I said, ‘I want to do that.’” She joined the firm eight years ago, and became its first female rope-access inspector in 2015. "
3000,"Xsusha Flandro, 37, an architectural conservator with the firm, and a trained rope-access technician, has swung from about 20 buildings in New York. And she has noticed a pattern."
3001,"“When I’m on a regular construction site, I’m usually the only female,” she said. But on the ropes, there are far more women. "
3002,"Why? “I’ve asked this question of them,” she said, “and I kind of agree — women are less afraid of heights.”"
3003,"The number of women in rope access has grown industrywide, said Jody Bird, the executive director of the Society of Professional Rope Access Technicians, one of the largest certification groups."
3004,"Level-one certification does not require past climbing experience, but it typically involves a four-day training course, as well as written and field tests. Subsequent levels require 500 hours of rope time and more advanced testing."
3005,"The organization has 8,500 to 9,000 certified technicians in the oil rig, wind turbine and building restoration industries, among others. While it does not track the kind of work its technicians do, Ms. Bird said she has seen an increase in the number of women overall. Last year, for the first time since the group’s founding in 1996, it appointed two women as committee chairs, she said."
3006,"Yet even as demand grows for this kind of work, there are only 100 or so people performing rope-access facade inspections in New York, said Jarrett Huddleston, the principal at CANY. And they’re often misunderstood."
3007,"“I was out on the side of buildings when all of my friends were drawing details of bathroom fixtures,” said Ms. Caste, a registered architect whose classmates have more conventional career paths."
3008,"“My mom doesn’t want to know anymore,” said Ms. DeLuca, who spares her the details. "
3009,"One example: She regularly “face plants” on the side of glassy towers, because they lack grip. Also: rappelling on taller buildings is a serious ab workout, because the ropes are longer and heavier. "
3010,"And awkward interactions with onlookers are a rite of passage. “One of my co-workers caught someone coming out of the shower, and it was full-frontal,” Ms. DeLuca said. On Halloween, a hand emerged from an office window to give her a piece of candy. "
3011,"And it’s not uncommon for police and firefighters to arrive at an inspection, because neighbors have called in reports of people hanging from the side of a building, Ms. Caste said. "
3012,"The recent building boom should keep inspectors busy. Between 2020 and 2025, some 1,500 additional buildings will be required to have inspections, said Jill Hrubecky, an executive engineer with the Department of Buildings. While some in the industry are pushing for the use of unmanned drones — heavily restricted, in most cases, in New York — this is one of the few fields where robots won’t soon prevail. “Nothing is going to replace a hands-on inspection,” she said."
3013,"The new towers may be a boon to the rope-access inspectors, but these taller, sleeker structures, skinned in glass and metal, haven’t earned many fans among them."
3014,"“Anything pre-1940s is my cup of tea,” said Ms. Flandro, who has a background in ceramics and sculpture. She was chosen to climb the ropes for CANY in large part because of her conservator skills."
3015,"“We get to touch these pieces of terra cotta that no one has touched in a hundred years,” said Ms. DeLuca, who considers it one of the perks of the job. But familiarity can also breed contempt."
3016,"“In architecture school, it’s always new, new, new. You’re supposed to like everything modern,” she said. After some face time with the city’s new glassy skyline, she has changed her stance: “It doesn’t look great close up.”"

3018,"If you think the Sunshine State is all about theme parks and frying on the beaches, you probably haven’t been to St. Augustine. In the oldest, continuously occupied European settlement in North America, visitors get the glorious beaches along with a healthy dose of unexpected delights: Spanish colonial and Moorish-style architecture, interesting museums and history galore. Founded as a Spanish colonial outpost in 1565 — 55 years before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock — the Ancient City feels vaguely European, albeit with better air-conditioning. It’s also a distinctly American place where you can indulge in a butter pecan milkshake; explore the city’s 144-block Historic District on foot or bike; and, if you’re willing to step out of town for a few hours, play the imposing 17th island green that the world’s best golfers will navigate at the upcoming Player’s Championship in nearby Ponte Vedra Beach. The water at the city’s fabled Fountain of Youth might not transport you back to your salad days, but there’s enough magic on St. Augustine’s brick streets to make you a believer."
3019,1) 3 p.m. Magic waters
3020,"We’ll never know for sure whether Juan Ponce de Léon was looking for the Fountain of Youth when he sighted what he thought was an island north of St. Augustine that he named “La Florida” or “Place of Flowers” on Easter Sunday, March 27, 1513. In any case, you can visit a site near to where Ponce landed that’s been referred to as the Fountain of Youth for more than a century. In 1909, Luella Day “Diamond Lil” MacConnell, a Chicago physician who made a fortune during the Klondike Gold Rush, began to market “Fountain of Youth” water that some maintain was from a well dug in 1875. At first drink, the Ponce de Léon’s Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park might seem kitschy. But the lush 15-acre park overlooking the Matanzas River and St. Augustine Inlet is actually a delightful and informative place to pass a few hours among the majestic live oak trees and preening peacocks. The $2.50 Fountain of Youth spring water bottles sold in the gift shop make a great souvenir, but be forewarned, the “magical” water tastes pretty foul. (Note: what looks like a snack bar in the parking lot is an excellent place for lunch — Smoked Southern BBQ, run by a James Beard-nominated chef.) "
3021,"In 1586, the Englishman Sir Francis Drake and his crew of 2,500 buccaneers raided the city, burning it to the ground. A series of subsequent pirate raids led to the construction of the Castillo de San Marcos, a massive stone fortification (that also happens to be a magical place to watch the sunrise). Continue your history lesson at the easy-to-miss St. Augustine Pirate & Treasure Museum (877-467-5863), tucked away on a side street. It brings to life St. Augustine’s back story, and the stories of pirates like Captain Kidd, who had to be hung twice, because the noose snapped the first time. Founded by Pat Croce, the former president of the Philadelphia 76ers, the museum also includes entertaining tours led by Capt. William Mayhem, an Air Force vet who is a real character ($14.99 adults;$7.99 children; tour included)."
3022,"In the heart of the Historic District, you’ll find The Floridian restaurant, with indoor and outdoor seating on quiet Spanish Street, which is lined with moss-draped live oak trees. Chef Genie McNally specializes in Southern comfort foods and healthier alternatives to the usual suspects. Try the cheddar-and-veggie stuffed cornbread, topped with blackened fish and a chimichurri aioli drizzle. Dinner runs about $20 to $30 without drinks. "
3023,"Tucked away on a side street in the Historic District, tiny Cousteau’s Waffle & Milkshake Bar is a veritable graveyard for New Year’s resolutions. Order a superb, hand-spun butter pecan milkshake with maple syrup, candied pecans and bourbon whipped cream ($6.49) and savor it as you take a long stroll. Pedestrian St. George Street is full of life, but for a quieter look at some beautiful Spanish and British colonial style buildings, venture south of Plaza de la Constitution to Old Town and linger on Aviles Street, the nation’s oldest street, where you’ll find galleries selling local art and handmade crafts. "
3024,"St. Augustine is no place to skip breakfast. For an excellent selection of baked goods and a spot of live bluegrass music, head to the outdoor St. Augustine Amphitheater Farmers Market (8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Saturdays), where you can pick up everything from seafood to souvenirs and plenty of quick bites, including great vegan and gluten free muffins at Hugo’s. If doughnuts are your thing, hustle over to Swillerbees before they run out of the Hey Shorty, with chocolate frosting, Nutella and crumbled shortbread cookies ($2), or Miami Vice, a cream cheese and guava jelly mess of a treat. For less sweet fare and what may be the best café con leche north of Miami, the Cuban-American La Herencia Café on Aviles Street, serves the Guajiro — an open-faced omelet over Cuban toast, topped with black beans, roasted pork, salsa and Romano cheese, with a side of sweet plantains ($12)."
3025,"Take the 45-minute tour of the opulent Spanish Renaissance-style Hotel Ponce de Léon and admire the grand lobby with its 68-foot domed ceiling and the old dining room’s 79 Louis Comfort Tiffany stained-glass windows ($12 adults, free for children under 10.) Then walk a block to the Villa Zorayda Museum ($10 adults, $5 children 7-12, free 6 and under.) Franklin W. Smith, a Boston hardware merchant, was a traveler, and his stunning Moorish Revival Style home, a one-tenth-scale reproduction of a portion of the Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain, is dripping with antiquities from around the world. The audio tour is full of great yarns, none better than that of the museum’s Sacred Cat Rug, a 2,400-year-old cat hair rug found by Nile fisherman in the tomb of an Egyptian princess. The rug depicts a large cat that is said to curse anyone who walks on it. According to the audio tour, a dead cat appeared on the doorway after the rug was removed for cleaning several years ago, reinforcing the legend of the curse."
3026,"The Players Championship is one of the most lucrative golf tournaments in the world. The Players Stadium Course, where the tournament takes place just outside St. Augustine, is a lush green nirvana, even for nongolfers. Outside tournament time, docent “storytellers” will take you on a free golf cart tour around the course. Among other sites, you’ll see the notoriously treacherous 17th hole, with its island green, where more than 120,000 errant balls are retrieved from the lake each year. After the tour, have lunch on the veranda overlooking the 18th hole at 19. Try the grilled grouper tacos ($17) or the delightfully creamy and rich butter chicken ($16)."
3027,"The words “reasonable” and “fresh seafood” don’t coincide often enough near Florida’s beaches, but they do at the Mango Mango’s Caribbean Grill & Bar on St. Augustine Beach. The menu is eclectic, the prices are reasonable and the vibe is pass-the-hot sauce friendly. The stuffed corn cakes are pure magic but save room for the richest, most delectable peanut butter pie you’ve ever had, a bargain at $5.99. Afterward, resist the urge to turn in early, and play air hockey at Sarbez!, a dive bar and grilled cheese sandwich emporium with live music and craft beers aplenty."
3028,"What started in 1893 as an improvised attraction where tourists waiting at a train stop paid to see locally captured gators, has evolved into one of the country’s oldest zoos: The St. Augustine Alligator Farm Zoological Park, which claims to be the only one that features all 24 crocodilian species. You can take a zip line over a lagoon habitat, and see an extraordinary array of exotic birds, reptiles and mammals. Save time to become acquainted with Maximo, a beast of a crocodile from Australia who is nearly 16 feet and 1,250 pounds. It took almost a year to convince the farm he grew up on — which raises crocodiles to make handbags — to agree to sell his lady friend, Sydney, but his mood improved considerably once they were reunited in their Florida habitat."
3029,"Treat yourself to an indulgent Southern brunch on the wraparound porch at Preserved Restaurant in the heart of the Lincolnville neighborhood. Set in a Victorian home once occupied by Thomas Jefferson’s great-granddaughter, Preserved is run by Brian Whittington, a James Beard-nominated chef who transformed a minimarket into one of the city’s best restaurants. The Mayport shrimp and grits, warm scones with jam, and roasted oysters are all outstanding. Expect to pay about $20 for brunch. History buffs should linger in the neighborhood, which was settled by freed slaves and played a significant role in the Civil Rights movement. The first stop (#101, 79 Bridge Street) on the ACCORD Freedom Trail walking/driving audio tour — described as “the first medical/dental office constructed in St. Augustine without racially segregated waiting rooms” — is just a block from the restaurant. (Dial 904-335-3002 and enter each stop number to hear commentary.)"
3030,"Pick up a shark tooth identification guide at one of the many local shell shops and head to Vilano Beach. Anastasia State Park has softer sand and is a better spot for swimmers, but Vilano is a local favorite that’s ideal for surfing. When the tide is turning out, comb the shore for fossilized shark teeth. With a little patience, you’ll go home with the ultimate souvenir. "
3031,"Opened in December 2018, the Embassy Suites St. Augustine Beach Oceanfront Resort is a comfortable resort on a lovely stretch of beach. Children will love the oceanfront pool, and there are plenty of recliners and fire pits, perfect for stargazing during the free nightly cocktail and hors d’oeuvre hour. Rates start at $169 for a double room."
3032,"In the Historic District, try the uniquely designed Collector Inn (from $189), built on a cluster of nine landmark buildings dating to 1790, or the Casa Monica (from $193), a luxury hotel in an extraordinary Moorish Revival style building built in 1888 by Franklin W. Smith, the owner of Villa Zorayda."
3033,"If you’re looking for a vacation rental, check for listings near the beaches, particularly in St. Augustine Beach and Vilano Beach, where rates start at $100 a night for no-frills cottages and go up from there, depending on size, proximity to the beach and season. "

3035,"[For the latest on the weather in the Midwest, read our Friday updates here.]"
3036,"CHICAGO — Midwesterners trudged ahead Thursday into a familiar, grim reality: temperatures well below zero, schools and businesses closed, stern warnings to wear extra layers or, better yet, just stay indoors."
3037,"The polar vortex that arrived earlier this week has for days disrupted life across an entire region. Deaths and injuries were reported. Decades-old records fell. And, for one more day, even stepping outside remained a painful, risky experience."
3038,"But the forecast finally suggested relief ahead. By Thursday night, temperatures across much of the Midwest were expected to poke above zero. By the end of the weekend, meteorologists predicted as much as a 70- or 80-degree swing, with balmy-for-February readings in the 40s or 50s and rain instead of snow."
3039,"Still, risks remained. A band of snow complicated travel on Thursday, and in the Northeast, officials warned of their own cold wave, with heavy snow in some places and subzero wind chills in others."
3040,Here are the latest developments:
3041,"• At least 21 deaths are believed to be related to the bitter weather system, government officials say, including that of a University of Iowa student who was found behind an academic hall several hours before dawn on Wednesday. [Read more about those who have died here.]"
3042,"• A weather observer in Mount Carroll, Ill., recorded a temperature of minus 38 on Thursday morning. If confirmed by state officials, that would become Illinois’s record low, supplanting the previous record of minus 36. [See photos here that show what life is like in the frozen Midwest.]"
3043,"• The sustained cold taxed energy systems across the Midwest, leading to some power failures and urgent calls to customers to reduce the heat in their homes."
3044,"• Many schools, businesses and restaurants remained shuttered on Thursday, though some offices were reopening and many more were expected to reopen Friday."
3045,"• By Thursday evening, airlines had canceled more than 2,300 flights in the United States, according to FlightAware. On Wednesday, cancellations topped 2,700."
3046,"• The East Coast was feeling the bitter cold, too. Temperatures barely broke the double digits in New York City. [Read more here about how the city’s homeless population is coping with the cold.]"
3047,"In Iowa City, a student at the University of Iowa was found dead in the early morning hours of Wednesday. Gerald Belz, 18 and a pre-med student, was found lying outside, unresponsive, near a campus building after 2 a.m. local time."
3048,"Since Sunday, local authorities have said that at least 21 deaths appeared to be connected to the weather, though some were still being investigated and precise causes remained unknown. Among those who have perished, according to local police, fire officials, coroners and other officials: Four men — in Illinois, Wisconsin and two in Michigan — who were found frozen near their homes; six people who died in traffic crashes in Iowa; a pedestrian hit with a snowplow in Libertyville, Ill.; a man found dead between two FedEx trucks at a distribution center in East Moline, Ill.; and a woman found frozen to death inside a Milwaukee apartment after the thermostat malfunctioned."
3049,"In the Buffalo area, one person died Thursday while using a snowblower and another was found dead after shoveling. Earlier in the week, a married couple in their 20s in Indiana died in a car crash, a man in Milwaukee was found dead in his garage after shoveling and a man died of hypothermia in Evanston, Ill."
3050,"In Williamsville, N.Y., outside Buffalo, a homeless man was pronounced dead after being discovered inside a bus shelter on Thursday morning. Helen Tederous, a spokeswoman for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, which is investigating the death, said that the man, Lawrence Bierl, 69, had been a fixture in suburban Buffalo for years. “He was a real gentle soul,” she said. “He would talk to people a lot. People got to know him.” An official cause of death had not been determined, but Ms. Tederous and a county official said it appeared to be related to the cold."
3051,[Read more about Mr. Belz here.]
3052,"Officials told of harrowing rescues and perilous situations. Some people resorted to dangerous means to keep warm. In Wheeling, Ill., nine people, including a 2-month-old infant, were hospitalized for carbon monoxide exposure on Wednesday after a family used a charcoal grill to heat their home."
3053,"Keith MacIsaac, the Wheeling fire chief, said in an email that the family’s furnace was working, but that they used the grill for additional warmth. All nine people were taken to hospitals and expected to survive."
3054,"“If this had occurred at night when people are sleeping, this easily could have resulted in nine fatalities,” Chief MacIsaac said."
3055,"Throughout the Midwest, hospitals reported patients arriving with symptoms tied to the weather. The Illinois Department of Public Health said at least 30 people statewide had been to emergency rooms for frostbite or hypothermia-related visits by Wednesday morning."
3056,[You could get frostbite in a matter of minutes. Here’s what to do.]
3057,"At Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis, the emergency department reported “many patients” who were injured or ill because of the weather. Frostbite cases alone led to at least 13 admissions."
3058,"“It’s busier than it would normally be,” Dr. Douglas D. Brunette, an emergency room doctor in Minneapolis, said on Wednesday afternoon. “But it’s not a mass casualty incident yet.”"
3059,"Officials in New York and other parts of the Northeast warned residents to prepare for temperatures that, while not nearly as cold as the Midwest, could still be dangerous."
3060,"In Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut, where it was expected to dip into the single digits or lower, officials opened warming centers."
3061,"In New York City, where it was 10 degrees at midday, Mayor Bill de Blasio urged people to “bundle up and stay inside as much as possible.” With wind chills expected to fall below zero, city officials warned landlords to provide adequate heat to their tenants."
3062,"Conditions were worse in the western part of the state, where Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency in several counties and instructed some state workers to stay home. More than 13 inches of snow fell Wednesday in Buffalo, a record for Jan. 30, and more was falling on Thursday."
3063,"At least two cities in Illinois and one in Iowa reached record lows overnight, as a dangerously deep freeze kept its hold on the Midwest."
3064,"In Rockford, Ill., temperatures dipped to minus 31, breaking a previous record of minus 27 from Jan. 10, 1982. Moline, Ill., on the border with Iowa, also broke a record, reaching minus 33 on Thursday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Cedar Rapids, Iowa, set a record of minus 30."
3065,"Chicago did not reach a record low overnight — the previous record was minus 27, from Jan. 20, 1985. But the city was expected to be hit with one to three inches of snow on Thursday, beginning in the late afternoon and stretching into the evening."
3066,[We asked people in Chicago who work in extreme cold for their practical tips for survival. Here’s what they said.]
3067,"After several days of brutally cold weather, Chicagoans have something to look forward to, said Matt Friedlein, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service."
3068,"“We’ll be on our way up here soon,” Mr. Friedlein said. “In fact, later in the week, it looks like temperatures in the 40s across much of northern Illinois. No matter what, it will be a significant warm up when you consider how cold we are right now.”"
3069,Car breakdowns and medical emergencies took on greater urgency across the Midwest as police and fire departments dealt with dangerously low temperatures and increased workloads.
3070,"The Illinois State Police assisted more than 1,300 drivers over an eight-hour period on Wednesday, about 10 times troopers’ normal workload. In Michigan, where the extreme cold thwarted efforts to treat frozen roadways, emergency workers closed part of Interstate 675 on Thursday after a series of crashes. And in Indiana, a state trooper helped a dog named Marley and its owner warm up after finding them in a stalled car along a highway."
3071,"The cold was especially risky for those surrounded by water. The Coast Guard used air boats to rescue seven people stranded in an ice shanty off the coast of Sturgeon Bay, Wis. And on Mackinac Island, Mich., where the dangerous weather made plane travel impossible, another Coast Guard ship sliced through the ice to rescue a woman needing medical attention."
3072,"“The crew responded admirably in adverse conditions to answer the call,” said Lt. Steele Johnson, the commanding officer of the ship that rescued the woman, in a statement. “We’re happy to have done our part in getting her the advanced medical treatment she needed.”"
3073,"In Minnesota, Xcel Energy asked customers to conserve power and reduce their thermostats to 63 degrees or 60 degrees, depending on their location. Xcel also paid for hotel rooms for customers who lost their gas supply in Princeton, Minn., where the temperature on Thursday morning was minus 35."
3074,"“Your cooperation is critical to try to prevent widespread natural gas outages,” the company posted on its website."
3075,"In Michigan, a fire Wednesday night at a Consumers Energy facility led to fears of a natural gas shortage. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer went on television late at night urging residents of the state’s Lower Peninsula to reduce their thermostats to 65 degrees or less."
3076,"“You can play a role in helping people across the state survive these extreme temperatures,” Ms. Whitmer said in a statement."
3077,"Consumers Energy also asked several manufacturers to halt production because of the natural gas shortage. Erin Davis, a General Motors spokeswoman, said work was stopped on Wednesday night at 11 plants in Michigan. Many workers had been told not to report for their shifts on Thursday."
3078,"[With schools closed, one family tried five polar-weather experiments. Here’s what happened.]"
3079,The extremely low temperatures this week in parts of the United States stand in sharp contrast to the trend toward warmer winters. But they may also be a result of warming.
3080,Emerging research suggests that a warming Arctic is causing changes in the jet stream and pushing polar air down to latitudes that are unaccustomed to them and often unprepared. Hence this week’s atypical chill over large swaths of the Northeast and Midwest.
3081,Chicago will be as cold as the Arctic on Wednesday. We’ll show you why.
3082,"Friederike Otto, an Oxford University climate scientist who studies how specific weather events are exacerbated by global warming, said that while not all of these extreme events could be attributed to climate change, the profound changes in the earth’s atmosphere raised “the likelihood of a large number of extreme events.”"

3086,"• “A man wearing a grayish jumpsuit, sky-blue cap and surgical mask, whom the Japanese news media identified as Mr. Ghosn, emerged from the detention center at around 4:30 p.m. surrounded by police officers.”"
3087,• The outfit “allowed him to sneak past a crowd of Japanese and foreign reporters who had been waiting hours for him to appear.”
3088,"• “After a moment’s hesitation, Mr. Ghosn got into a small van, while the police loaded luggage and bedding into a larger black van that was the focus of reporters’ attention.”"
3089,"Mr. Ghosn’s bail cost 1 billion yen, or almost $9 million. A judge approved it yesterday, and an appeal by prosecutors was rejected. Mr. Ghosn paid his bail in cash today before his release."
3090,"Things are looking up for him. Japanese prosecutors convict 99 percent of indicted defendants. But now that he has a new lawyer and has focused international attention on the Japanese criminal justice system, Mr. Ghosn’s case is “increasingly looking like it’s not a slam dunk” for prosecutors, Stephen Givens, an American corporate lawyer in Tokyo, told Mr. Dooley."

3093,____________________________
3094,"Mike Bloomberg announced yesterday that he won’t pursue the Democratic Party nomination next year. Instead, he’ll spend his billions on philanthropy — and working to defeat President Trump."
3095,"It’s an acknowledgment of the long odds against him, as a pro-business centrist at a time when the Democratic front-runners are embracing Medicare for all and the Green New Deal."
3096,"He had “a real but narrow path” to the nomination, according to his advisers, which could have disappeared if Joe Biden runs. Mr. Bloomberg conceded this in a Bloomberg View op-ed, writing, “I am cleareyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”"
3097,"Instead, he’ll remain focused on fighting climate change. His latest effort is on reducing and eventually eliminating the use of fossil fuels. He will also promote gun control, and maintain his political organization to aid the eventual Democratic nominee."
3098,"Mr. Bloomberg’s decision may weigh on Howard Schultz, the other centrist, pro-business billionaire considering a presidential bid. If Mr. Bloomberg, with an established political brand and an estimated $55 billion fortune, doesn’t think he can spend his way to victory, critics will ask how a less-famous, less-wealthy billionaire could."
3099,"Conspicuously absent from Premier Li Keqiang of China’s speech to lawmakers yesterday was any mention of the nation’s plan to become a global tech powerhouse, Lingling Wei of the WSJ notes."
3100,"Mr. Li used to champion “Made in China 2025,” a plan under which the country would quickly increase its capacity to design and produce advanced technologies, reducing its reliance on trading partners and even undercutting rivals like the U.S. He gave it pride of place in his previous three annual speeches."
3101,"But that vision alarmed Washington. “Officials in the Trump administration have called the plan a threat to fair competition, saying it encourages state subsidies for domestic companies and forces technology transfer from foreign companies with the aim of driving them out of business,” Ms. Wei writes."
3102,"Now the name has gone, but the ambitions remain. Mr. Li didn’t use the words “Made in China 2025” yesterday — but he did talk about advanced computing, biotech and alternative energy. And he promised to “make China strong in manufacturing” and “encourage more domestic and foreign users to choose Chinese goods and services.”"
3103,"The bigger question is what this means for Beijing’s trade talks with the U.S. Hard-liners in the Trump administration fear that China may promise policy changes, then simply go on as before."
3104,"U.S. companies returned $1.25 trillion to investors through share buybacks and dividends last year, a new high, Robin Wigglesworth of the FT reports."
3105,"Corporate America has paid out $8 trillion through buybacks and dividends to investors over the past decade, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices."
3106,"How much? By Mr. Wigglesworth’s estimate, that’s “more than enough to buy all the major listed companies of the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Sweden” at current prices. Or just about all the gold ever mined."
3107,"Those numbers will fuel the battle over buybacks. While supporters say they’re good for companies and investors, critics — including senators of both parties — argue that they come at the expense of raises for workers and investment in R.&D. That debate will rage on."
3108,"Britain’s central bank is working to help its financial system weather the turbulence that would accompany leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement, the FT reports."
3109,"British banks are strong enough to withstand the potential disruption, the Bank of England says. But “financial stability does not guarantee market stability or economic stability,” Mark Carney, its governor, told British lawmakers yesterday. He predicted “significant market volatility.”"
3110,"Weekly auctions of euros, as part of an arrangement with the European Central Bank, will help the bank to maintain its cash levels. It already has similar arrangements for the dollar, and recently announced weekly auctions of British pounds."
3111,"“The new swap line is ‘a further prudent precaution’ to ensure financial markets can function smoothly in the months spanning Britain’s departure from the E.U.,” the FT reports. The bank’s Financial Policy Committee has also “taken action to address the main risks of disruption for U.K. insurers, asset managers and clearing houses.”"
3112,"As Deutsche Bank tries to turn itself around, it is relying in large part on Matt Zames, a well-known Wall Street veteran who now works for one of its big shareholders. More on that from Jenny Strasburg of the WSJ:"
3113,"• Mr. Zames rose through the ranks at Bear Stearns and then helped JPMorgan Chase move past its “London whale” trading disaster. He’s now at Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that has a stake in Deutsche Bank and is also a paid adviser to it."
3114,"• Soon after Cerberus was hired, Mr. Zames spent weeks at Deutsche Bank’s offices. “He quickly focused on what Cerberus considered a key to Deutsche Bank’s revival: that it move quickly to take more risk with its cash,” Ms. Strasburg reports."
3115,"• He has also met with Germany’s deputy finance minister, Jörg Kukies, to discuss a potential merger of Deutsche Bank with Commerzbank (in which Cerberus also holds a stake)."
3116,• Mr. Zames’s advice reportedly hasn’t always gone down well with the bank’s executives: “Finance chief James von Moltke last fall told colleagues he felt Mr. Zames was pressuring him to move too quickly to loosen constraints on investing the bank’s cash cushion.”
3117,"• But Mr. Zames reports directly to Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s C.E.O. And, as Ms. Strasburg writes, “Some insiders and trading partners half-jokingly call Mr. Zames the ‘virtual C.E.O.’”"
3118,"Goldman Sachs is embracing a more casual dress code, according to Laura Noonan of the FT. That means bankers can shed their suits for … slightly more dressed-down outfits."
3119,Goldman didn’t give specifics. No items of clothing have been allowed or banned; instead workers were told to “exercise good judgment” and dress to meet client expectations.
3120,"The move was announced by David Solomon, Goldman’s C.E.O., who also happens to be a D.J. on the side. It’s meant to appeal to younger workers whom the firm hopes to hire."
3121,"The bank is following rivals like JPMorgan Chase in embracing a more relaxed dress code. Goldman actually let its engineers dress more casually nearly two years ago, leading to some junior workers being advised against wearing “ripped and overly tight T-shirts.”"
3122,"But business casual has limits on Wall Street. JPMorgan bankers shunned jeans for fear of their bosses thinking they had no client meetings. (That said, Goldman bankers on the West Coast have been known to occasionally dress more casually — think jeans and sneakers — to fit in with their tech and media clients.)"
3123,Scott Gottlieb unexpectedly announced  plans to resign as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration this month.
3124,"The founder of Papa John’s pizza, John Schnatter, will step down from the board after someone else is chosen to fill his board seat."
3125,Anheuser-Busch InBev reportedly plans to replace Olivier Goudet as chairman amid concern that his day job at the food conglomerate JAB has created conflicts of interest.
3126,"President Trump plans to nominate Jessie Liu, the U.S. district attorney for the District of Columbia, for associate attorney general."

3155,"On a sultry November afternoon in Mérida, Mexico, I sat with my friend David Serrano on the terrace of Apoala, a Mexican-fusion restaurant on the Plaza de Santa Lucia, tucking into Flores de Amarillo — zucchini blossoms stuffed with Oaxacan cheese — and people watching. David, a Mexican by birth and a Mérida resident by choice, deftly picked out the vacationers (in short pants, like myself, because of the heat) from the locals (in long pants, like David, because of the insects)."
3156,"An elegant blonde woman in slacks drifted over to the table to say hello to David — Elena, he explained, a fashion designer from Milan. A few minutes later a tanned couple, the husband leaning on a cane as a result of a riding accident, dropped by — Ralf and Yvonne, the Germans who run the Yucatán Polo Club. After lunch we stopped at Ki’Xocolatl — the chocolate store next to the restaurant run by two Belgians — and bumped into Carmen, a painter from Mexico City, and Marcela, a Yucatecan artist who got out her phone to show me pictures of the sculptures she makes from sisal fiber."
3157,"So it goes in Mérida, the capital of Mexico’s Yucatán state and a magnet for creative souls from both sides of the border and beyond. They come from the United States and Canada, Mexico City and Europe, lured by the city’s un-Disneyfied Mayan and colonial heritage. Among the expats: the artists James Brown and Jorge Pardo, the designers Laura Kirar and Marjorie Skouras, and the chefs Jeremiah Tower and (until his death in 2016) David Sterling. Just don’t call it the next San Miguel de Allende."
3158," “People go to San Miguel to retire,” David, acting as both my host and tour guide during my first visit to the city, said back in the car. “Here you come and work. I think the heat wakes you up.”"
3159,"The heat — or maybe it was the food — was having the opposite effect on me. But our Uber driver, Israel, a Yucatecan of Lebanese descent, cranked up the AC in his Dodge Neon. The radio was also rousing: Israel blasted KIIS FM (“You’re the One That I Want”) as he negotiated the narrow streets lined with tall colonial houses in sherbet colors back to David’s place."
3160,"We had spent the morning driving around the centro historico. Mérida, named for the ancient Spanish city, was founded in 1542 by the conquistador Francisco de Montejo y Leon on the site of the Maya city of T’ho. On La Plaza Grande (the main square) David pointed out the Catedral de San Ildefonso  and the Casa de Montejo, both constructed of stone from the ancient pyramids and temples, both dripping with Renaissance ornamentation. “You see the Roman influence, just as there was the Roman influence in Mérida, Spain,” David explained. “The French came later.”"
3161,"On cue, Israel had turned up the Paseo de Montejo, the city’s main artery, and suddenly we were surrounded by palm-shaded mansions in the Beaux-Arts style — the trophy homes of the 18th- and 19th-century millionaires who made their fortunes producing henequen (or sisal) from the agave plant. The rich Yucatecans rejected Hispanic culture in favor of all things French, and Paseo de Montejo bears more than a passing resemblance to a street in old New Orleans, which happens to be a sister city."
3162,"The pale blue exterior of the 200-year-old house in the Santiago barrio that David and his partner, Robert Willson, bought a few years ago is reserved, almost anonymous. Inside it looks the way you might imagine a casa restored by two guys who used to run one of Los Angeles’s premier design showrooms would look. There are 20-foot beamed ceilings and boldly patterned concrete tile floors, terra cotta sphinxes and French chairs made of steel and twine. The lush scent of plumeria wafts from the courtyard, where a Piranesi-inspired mural overlooks a turquoise pool."
3163,"“People come here and visit ruins and cenotes the first time,” David had told me, “look at houses the second time, and buy a house the third time.” Happily for first-time visitors, more than a few of those who return and buy renovate their homes as boutique hotels or rentals. Hotel Diplomat, down the street from David’s place, is one of the more intimate B & B’s, with just four rooms, while Casa Lecanda, two blocks from Paseo de Montejo, is one of the more luxe ones. Urbano Rentals offers several meticulously restored town homes in the centro historico. "
3164,"I repaired to my guest room, settling in for a siesta on the steel canopy bed. An Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta ear worm had worked its way into my head, but at some point I dozed off. When I awoke my room was dark, and rain pelted the roof — a steady, cooling volley punctuated by rumbling thunder."
3165,"Luckily Israel’s musical tastes were varied. The next morning, he was playing Mexican techno. In a light drizzle we set off for the ruins of Uxmal, a Maya city 50 miles south of Mérida, known for its ornate Puuc-style architecture and its fine state of preservation."

3201,"Uxmal, population 20,000, give or take, was founded about 500 AD by Chac Uitzil Hun, I learned from my guide, Fabio, a Yucatecan with a mouth full of gold and a wicked sense of humor. We made our way around the Pyramid of the Magician, the site’s tallest structure, to the grass-covered Ballcourt. Competitions here generally concluded with a human sacrifice, Fabio said, doing a little pantomime of the victor having his heart ripped out and offered to the gods, his gold teeth sparking in the mist."
3202,"We climbed the steep stone steps to the Governor’s Palace, whose massive mosaic facade boasts 103 masks of the rain god Chac (no cenotes nearby). As we passed a group of German tourists sharing a joint, one of them lost her footing on the steps. “Careful,” Fabio warned. “We lost someone here yesterday.”"
3203,"“They say that to everyone,” David observed when I told him about it back in the car."
3204,"After touring the oldest remnants of Yucatán civilization, we set out for its newest frontier. Many of the affluent Mexicans moving to Mérida are settling not in centuries-old casas in town or haciendas in the country but in the spanking new suburbs of el norte — a long swath of gated communities and giant malls to the north of the city. Our destination was a restaurant called Tatemar in Plaza La Isla, a just-opened 180-store mall developed by Carlos Slim, the richest man in Mexico (and an investor in The New York Times)."
3205,"Carlos Arnaud, who owns the Oaxacan-flavored Tatemar with his sister Sara, steered us to a table overlooking La Isla’s artificial lake and handled the ordering: grouper with guacamole, octopus with maize purée, pork and shrimp tacos. “Here in the Yucatán, Mayan culture was untouched until the Spanish,” he said, joining us at the table. “Oaxaca is more of a melting pot, so you carry the tradition of cooking with corn and beans, but in a different way, using chocolate and moles.”"
3206,"Traditional Yucatecan cuisine, on the other hand, weds Mayan ingredients (corn, chilis, pumpkin) with culinary contributions from Spain (pork, lard, Seville orange) and other parts of Europe. Mr. Tower, the chef, who has lived in Mérida for the last decade, haunts the city’s food stalls for fried pork belly and other Yucatecan staples. Gringos who want to master time-honored recipes like pavo en relleno negro (roasted turkey in charred chili sauce) can take classes at Los Dos, the cooking school founded by David Sterling."
3207,"Meals can go on for hours here. We were in Tatemar until sundown, feasting and chatting. David and Carlos spoke in glowing terms about Mérida’s rapid growth. When he arrived here four years ago, David said, there were seven Starbucks; now there are 18. “The first wave of discovery was like 10 years ago,” Carlos noted. “Tulum went through all the stages of growth in five years. You can’t grow there like you can here because of the size.”"
3208,"When we left the mall the sun was sinking below a stand of tamarind trees. Suddenly there was an explosion of bird chatter — the evening song of blackbirds known locally as X’Kau — a reminder that, for all the golf courses and Porsche dealerships, we were still in the jungle."
3209,"Among Mérida’s best exhibition spaces, Lagalá, Galeria La Eskalera, the Fundacion de Artistas, and Centro Cultural La Cupula are all in the centro historico. La Cupula, a sprawling garden-linked complex, hosts music, dance and theater performances as well as exhibitions. A show of David’s recent paintings happened to be up when I was in town, so we swung by the morning of my last day in the city. “Predictions and Sortileges” is a series of canvases, executed in white acrylic on brightly painted backdrops, about fortune telling. We paused in front of a painting of a female medium with a pair of birds on her head, surrounded by a faithful audience. “She gets power telling people what they want to hear,” David explained. “Like Trump.”"
3210,"We had been asked to lunch at the country hacienda of Laura Kirar, the designer, and her husband, Richard Frazier. So we picked up a roasted chicken at a roadside stand, and Israel navigated a series of narrow village roads lined with shacks in taffy colors and teeming with mototaxis, pedestrians and dogs that seemed oblivious to both."
3211,"Hacienda Subin is a romantically crumbling 18th- and 19th-century Moorish-style compound on 40 acres in the jungle. Like the other haciendas in the area it was once part of a henequen ranch. Laura and Richard, who moved here from New York full time a year and a half ago, are living in a pool house they built while they painstakingly restore the main buildings. “It’s like children,” Richard said, pouring coffee sweetened with agave nectar. “You don’t know what you’re getting into until it’s too late.”"
3212,"Dozens of the sisal haciendas outside Mérida have been renovated as resorts. One of the newest and poshest is the Chablé Resort and Spa, in Chocholá — 38 modern casitas, each with its own pool and hammock, on the jungled grounds of the former henequen estate Hacienda San Antonio Chablé. As for Hacienda Subin, Richard and Laura are rehabbing its factory building as a multipurpose space for community events."
3213,"Expat colonies can be insular, but Mérida’s outlanders are establishing deep roots here. On our way back to the city we stopped at Plantel Matilde, a 39,000-square-foot arts center rising like a modern acropolis in the middle of the jungle. Conceived by the Mexico City sculptor Javier Marin, Matilde serves as a campus for international art students and local schoolchildren as well as a studio and exhibition space for the artist."
3214,"After a full day my host had planned a casual dinner back in town. But this was Mérida: the meal, at a simple cantina called Catrin, was a long, festive, Mezcal-fueled affair. Richard and Laura showed up, as did Marcela, the sisal sculptor. There was Jason, an artist from Chicago, and Kate, from Poland, who did hair, and Ross, from New York, who works in real estate."
3215,We passed around platters of cactus salad and vegetarian flautas and empanadas. The conversation returned to Mérida’s recent growth. Not everyone shared David’s and Carlos’s enthusiasm for the changes. Jason groused about the traffic and noise. Ross said the Levi’s plant was polluting the water with toxic dyes.
3216,"“We need Ross just to make sure it’s not all puppies and rainbows here,” said Laura. “If you quote me make sure you say it was after a couple of tequilas.” Laura also opined that anybody looking for “a good place to be creative” still couldn’t do better than Mérida — a point disputed by no one."

3225,"Particularly notable reports might have video, sometimes live, as well as a timeline of new developments, and a chat-scroll full of users discussing what they’re seeing. (“This is the second time this has happened in a month,” noted one citizen in TAXI ENGULFED IN FLAMES. “Is it gonna blow up,” wondered another, watching the live video broadcast of firefighters putting down the fire.) "
3226,"Analia Acevedo, a 22 year-old who lives in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, joined the app during her final year at the College of Mount Saint Vincent in Riverdale. There, she said, “most of the students would use it.”"
3227,"“Sometimes it makes me feel paranoid, and afraid knowing that there is a lot that goes on,” she said. “It does give me some comfort knowing my surroundings, but I’m always torn between wanting to know and see everything, or to have that blind eye toward everything.” "
3228,"Conflicted enthusiasm is a common sentiment among Citizen users: I don’t know if I want to know, but I can’t not know. In any case, it’s free, it’s right there, and it’s always refreshed. It’s a new feed. And as with our other feeds, it can be hard to look away."
3229,"Other feeds are full of friends and photos, made for you to see. This one is full of information that feels faintly illicit. To new users, the app itself can feel like a bit of a mystery, too. Where does it come from? How does it work? What … does it want? Here’s what we know."
3230,"Before there was Citizen, there was Vigilante, founded by Andrew Frame, formerly of the internet-based phone company Ooma. “Vigilante is a new technology that opens up the 911 system,” said a launch announcement for the app in 2016. “With Vigilante,” it continued, “vital information is unlocked and everyone can do their part.” This sounded an awful lot like, well, a prompt for vigilantism. At the time, the New York Police Department issued a critical statement: “Crimes in progress should be handled by the NYPD and not a vigilante with a cellphone.” Soon thereafter the app was removed from Apple’s App Store for violating the company’s policies. "
3231,"But Citizen is Vigilante, redesigned and relaunched, with a less of an emphasis on what it might get you into, and a bit more on what it might let you avoid. The NYPD spokesman at the time the department was disavowing Vigilante, Peter Donald, now works for the company, and was the employee who responded to questions about the app."
3232,"Vigilante’s #CrimeNoMore hashtag has been replaced with Citizen’s #ProtectTheWorld. Citizen’s parent company, Sp0n, has raised 13 million dollars from Silicon Valley investors, according to Crunchbase, with seed money coming from Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund."
3233,"Citizen debuted in New York City in 2017, then opened in the San Francisco Bay Area. It launched in Baltimore in February, and Los Angeles last week. The company says it has plans to expand to more cities soon. Citizen has not shared user numbers, but it’s been rated over 19 thousand times in Apple’s App Store, and it displays a tally of notifications it sends: More than 31 thousand phones near Times Square buzzed about the flaming cab, according to the app."
3234,"It is not clear, at first, where Citizen’s reports come from or how they’re selected. But they arrive constantly, in an authoritative voice, providing the app’s signature ambient sense of alarm and disorder. "
3235,"Under the hood, Citizen is essentially a transcription service for emergency radio. The company employs teams of people to listen to police, fire and emergency radio transmissions and to submit certain categories of incident for including in the app. (“Citizen has a detailed editorial guide about what goes into the app and why,” Mr. Donald said. “Citizen does not include, for example, suicides inside a private residence, suspicious people, or vague suspect descriptions.”) "
3236,"For decades, it’s been possible to listen to emergency broadcasts with hardware police scanners, used by hobbyists, reporters, off-duty law enforcement and neighborhood busybodies. (And, occasionally, ambulance-chasing lawyers. Or criminals.) "
3237,"Citizen, however, is devoting resources to converting raw scanner traffic — which is by nature unvetted and mostly operational — into filtered curated digital content, legible to regular people, rendered on a map in a far more digestible form. Rich Carlson, a retired Chicago-area police officer, a longtime scanner enthusiast and salesperson for a company that sells scanner devices, compared Citizen to long-gone “notification networks” of three decades ago, in which “operators” would listen to scanners and send out alerts to members’ pagers. "
3238,"But Citizen isn’t just for listening and watching. The app suggests, in some cases, that users go out to stream and document incidents that are unfolding around them. This is unusual. “Our mantra in the scanner business, and with the clubs, is: listen to it at home, and stay home,” Mr. Carlson said. “We never recommend people go to an incident.” "
3239,"If you install Citizen, and check it enough, chances are the app will ask you if you’re able to safely stream from a nearby scene. This results in a lot of footage of smoke, and of police cars parked outside of buildings. Occasionally there’s something more gripping or morbid: someone trapped on the other side of an elevator door, waiting to be freed; a raccoon running around a store; a mangled car; a sheet over a body. "
3240,"Mike Pecchillo, 32, lives in Ozone Park, Queens, and has broadcast on Citizen a handful of times. “I’m kind of like the nosy neighbor,” he said. He checks the app regularly, and subscribes to other scanner feeds on social media. (He’s thinking about buying a real radio, soon.) When he hears about something nearby, he’ll go to the scene. Maybe there he’ll stream to Citizen, where he said he once had over three thousand viewers. “The chats can get wild,” he said. "
3241,"But he’ll also check Stringr, an app that pays users to record footage to be sold to news organizations, to see if they want a recording. “It really depends on what it is,” he said. “There was a shooting nearby, and I was there in two seconds. Stringr was paying like 60 bucks for that footage.” (Citizen footage, with a logo watermark, is provided to television stations free of charge.)"
3242,"Mr. Pecchillo’s hobby puts him in the occasional company of other Citizen users, some of whom take the task quite seriously. One user, who works under the name BoyWonder, has broadcast on the app more than 675 times. He can be spotted all around Brooklyn, ending his broadcasts with “catch you on my next scene.” Another popular user has streamed over 200 times under the username “CityStreets.” "
3243,"“More than 100,000 live videos have been recorded on Citizen,” Mr. Donald said. “The overwhelming majority of these videos have been streamed by organic users on our safety network.”"
3244,"The company has experimented with modes of production. A former contractor with the company said that, for a time in 2017, he was paid to create video for the app. (He signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company; The Times has agreed not to share his name). "
3245,"“We had a small crew,” he said. “We met at the office a few times.” The company instructed him how to produce the footage they wanted: to narrate; to record stable footage; to interview people. He was told not to claim he was working for Citizen. He worked in “sort-of shifts,” he said, and compared the job to previous work he had done for Postmates, the delivery app. “There would be all kinds of ways they would pay,” he said. “The number of views when you went live, how long you went live, whether it became a ‘story,’” he said. (“When new markets are opened, Citizen works with a team of ambassadors to meet with key community groups and introduce our technology,” Mr. Donald said.)The contractor said he made about $250 a week on average. A 2017 job listing posted by the company sought a “Freelance Smartphone Reporter” to join “a new kind of street team.”"
3246,"“Your primary task will be to witness and live stream incidents such as crimes, fires, and other emergency events going on in the city,” the listing said, “all from your mobile phone.”"
3247,"The company is also quietly testing a new tool called GuardianNet, which makes available a version of Citizen’s internal scanner-listening software to regular users. After agreeing to a set of rules and guidelines for which types of incidents to report — volunteer-produced reports are still vetted by employees before they appear in the app — I was able to log into the app and watch other “Dispatchers” work in a control-center-like interface. In the application’s chat room, a volunteer chatted with Citizen employees about a “code three” nearby — lights and sirens — before telling them that he had to go, because he was running late for class. "
3248,"“We have been exploring ways to get the community more involved in helping bring awareness to different neighborhoods and help others stay safe,” Mr. Donald said. “We are moving slowly and thoughtfully to ensure we get it right.”"
3249,"Citizen is just one of a growing number of app-based options for making yourself either more aware of your surroundings or just extremely paranoid. (Or both.) Nextdoor, the neighborhood-based social media app, has long seen its communities become obsessed with crime and the real and imagined threat thereof. It has struggled for years with racial profiling by its users. Ring, the controversial Amazon-owned internet-connected doorbell company, lets users upload videos recorded by their devices to a neighborhood feed, which is supplemented by Citizen-style crime reports. "
3250,"Nextdoor is a wide-ranging social network, and Ring sells hardware that put a camera on your house. What Citizen says it offers to users is awareness and safety: “Citizen is empowering everyday people to participate in their own safety,” said a spokesman for the company in a statement. The company shared recent stories that emphasized how information in the app could be actionable for users. A Citizen user helped find an abducted boy in Manhattan after the app sent out an alert. Last year, Dan Humphry, a law student at Fordham, was notified by the app of a fire in his own apartment building. “It was about 3 or 4 in the morning, and I wake up, smelling smoke,” he said. “I look at my phone and there’s an alert.”"
3251,"“Users write to us every day telling us how Citizen is changing how they engage with their neighborhoods,” the company says in its publicity materials. But this is believable in multiple potentially conflicting ways. Apps with maps are among the most powerful on our phones. They show us our world from space and offer at least an illusion of control and omniscience. Filling one with reports of possible crimes and danger, instead of restaurants or friends, is potent. In Citizen chats, some users earnestly wonder what’s happening, and if everyone at a scene is ok. Others simply gawk, demanding a better angle from a streamer, or making guesses at what happened. There’s a lot about decline, and about “bad neighborhoods.” This specific type of awareness can inform. It can also be alienating. Most commenters ignore the open bigots and trolls. But they show up where and when you might expect them, to offer their take on the crime unfolding down the street."
3252,"What Citizen wants from its users is less clear. There are no ads, and there is no way to pay for the app. “The company is exclusively focused on growing the safety networking over the next significant period of time,” the company says. Citizen asks its users for full access to their phones’ location data, which is a potentially lucrative resource on its own.  It also asks users for access to contacts. But, the company says, “Citizen does not advertise or sell user data.”"
3253,"There are, however, hints that the company may see a role for itself on the inside of the emergency response infrastructure. "
3254,"When the app launched in Los Angeles, the company published a conventional announcement: “Citizen Comes to Protect the City of Angels.” It also published a call for users around Greater Los Angeles to contact their police chiefs, fire chiefs and mayors, asking them to grant Citizen access to their radios, which, as is increasingly popular across the country, encrypt communications. That means that in pockets around Los Angeles, Citizen’s operators can’t listen in, and semiprivate, functional emergency communication remains just that, away from the gaze of the anxious public. “Citizen has no formal relationships with any municipalities,” Mr. Donald said. He did say that the company would “welcome that conversation.”"
3255,"The weekend traffic in the center of Athens was awful on the late January day I decided to visit the site of Plato’s Academy. Each of the narrow, slightly dog-legged streets in Plaka, the old city, was completely jammed, because recent angry protests, some of them violent, had forced the closing of roads around Syntagma, or Constitution Square."
3256,"Still, pedestrians were out in impressive force, filling the streets, intent on enjoying their Saturday shopping. Athenians take their weekends very seriously. Pantelis, my cabdriver, threaded his way delicately around people suddenly lurching, seemingly semi-oblivious, into the street and the constant chorus of motorcycles appearing out of nowhere and disappearing noisily into the distance."
3257,"Once past the clogged junction at Monastiraki Square, we pushed more easily along Ermou Street and headed northwest. We came to an area scattered with warehouses and former factories. The cab stopped by a huddle of abandoned buses. Ahead of us was what looked like an open area of greenery. Pantelis pointed and said, “Akadimia Platonos.” This must be the place, I thought."
3258,"Plato’s Academy is now a public park in a not particularly nice part of town. It is just next to Colonus, Sophocles’ birthplace and, according to the legend he helped to invent, the final resting place of Oedipus. The day was cool and sunny, but the previous 48 hours had been filled with storms, strong winds and intense rain."
3259,"As I entered the park from the south, the ground was muddy with large puddles. My boots slipped and slid underfoot as I made my way past a man talking loudly on a cellphone in what I think was Bengali. A couple were playing in the distance with their dog. There was an empty playground and a rather nice gravel area for playing pétanque, which is apparently popular with the locals. It was also deserted."
3260,"I oriented myself with notes and guidebooks and made my way to the ruins of Gymnasium, which is thought to have been the main building of the Academy. A large grassy hollow indicated the site of a former archaeological dig. I peered through some trees into the open, green area of the ruins. There was a solitary man standing, very reflectively, smoking a huge joint with what appeared to be a bottle of water at his feet. In fact, the only people I saw around the various ruins were doing exactly the same thing as this man: quietly getting wasted on a Saturday lunchtime. I began to doubt whether the liquid was water or some kind of clear alcohol, as these men didn’t have the appearance of compulsive Brooklyn yoga hydrators. Ah, the sacred groves of academe!After a moment’s hesitation, I walked down into the ruins, exchanged a brief “ya sass” (hello) with the man, who didn’t seem to care in the slightest that I was there. It was very quiet, and all around was a calming, low chatter of birds. No riots here."
3261,I began to try to imagine the Academy.
3262,"The school, founded by Plato around 387 B.C.E., was named the Hecademia and later Academia after the nearby sanctuary dedicated to the hero Hecademus. In Plato’s time, the area occupied about 1.5 hectares (about 3.5 acres) and was reached by leaving the city of Athens by the Diplon gate and walking along a road flanked by a public cemetery. The Gymnasium was a rectangular complex, approximately 200 feet long and 100 feet wide. Standing in the ruins, the scale of the building felt larger than I had anticipated. The site was excavated in 1929-39 and a plan of the main building was published."
3263,"An open courtyard or atrium was surrounded on three sides by a single-story, roofed colonnade or peristyle, which may have provided shelter for academicians engaged in reading and copying papyri or perhaps just passing the time. In the middle of the atrium stood a cistern, which supplied water, and farther north are the remains of a pedestal on which stood statues of the nine muses, the protectresses of the arts and letters."
3264,"The Academy is literally a museum, a temple or a sacred space, an association that is continued in Aristotle’s Lyceum and on into the most famous library of the ancient world: the Museum of Alexandria (which contained its famous and famously destroyed library), founded by the Ptolemies after 297 B.C.E.Behind the muses was the main building of the Academy, divided into a number of rooms. We are not exactly sure of their function, but it is highly likely that they were used for teaching and were equipped with boards, writing materials, geometric instruments, globes and celestial spheres. But the center of the Academy was the library, well stocked with texts, stacked papyri, possibly with labels, on which the titles were inscribed. The library was the first of its kind in Athens."
3265,"To delve a little deeper, here’s an intriguing question: What was on the shelves of Plato’s library? What had he read and what did he give his students to read? We can only guess, but it’s likely there would have been writings on mathematics, geometry and medicine, volumes by Homer and Hesiod. From the evidence of the Dialogues, it is clear that Plato had read the long-lost works of pre-Socratic thinkers like Heraclitus (“On Nature”) and Anaxagoras (“Nous”), and texts by the Eleatic thinkers like Parmenides. It is also said that Plato made an extremely expensive purchase of three works by Pythagoras. There would also have been works by the Sophists, whom Plato loathed, and possibly the widely read works of the atomists, like Democritus, whom Plato completely ignored, possibly out of envy."
3266,"In addition to the bookshelves storing these texts, there was possibly a wooden dais for the readings, lectures and discussions that took place daily. Most intriguing perhaps in the design of the Academy is the House of the Reader, or anagnostes. It is said that a young Aristotle served as Reader or Lector during his 20 years in the Academy. Apparently, he was nicknamed Nous or Mind by Plato, which seems appropriate. It would appear that the agnostic Reader was responsible for reading aloud every treatise submitted for publication in the Academy."
3267,"What is striking is the wholly geometric nature of the design of the Academy, which my new friend, Mr. Staikos, thinks was due to the influence of the Pythagorean school that Plato encountered on his trips to Sicily and that had been revived by Archytas of Taras, a friend of Plato’s and some say the model for the philosopher king described in the Republic. Legend has it that the motto of the Academy, written over the entrance, was “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter.” For the Academy is not just a building. It is an idea, in accordance with Plato’s theory of the forms, but also the Pythagorean view that ultimate reality is expressed by number."
3268,"But the Academy was also a privately funded research and teaching facility, situated outside the city. Most of us have a rather whimsical idea of philosophy as a bunch of men in togas having a chat in the agora. And we think of Socrates as a gadfly, philosophizing in the street and somehow speaking truth to power. It’s an attractive idea. But this is the literary conceit of philosophy — one that is still in circulation today. It is the fiction that Plato wants his readers to believe."
3269,"Behind that fiction stands the library, the editing and copying rooms, and the entire research engine of the Academy, which was devoted to the careful production and dissemination of knowledge through texts and teaching. Much as we may flinch at the idea, philosophy has always been academic and linked to the activity of schools since its inception."
3270,"At this point, a rather vulgar question comes to mind: Who paid for the Academy? According to Mr. Staikos, the cost of construction is estimated at 25 to 30 talents. As a wild modern-day estimate, we could say that the Academy cost a couple of hundred thousand dollars to build. How did Plato get this money? We don’t know. It is said that he was captured on his return trip from Sicily in 387 and sold as a slave on the island of Aegina, which Athens was at war with at the time. According to one account, Anniceris of Cyrene paid a ransom of 30 minas. But he refused to be paid back after Plato was returned to Athens, and the money was used to pay for a plot of land where the Academy was built."
3271,"Although the splendidly unreliable Diogenes Laertius says that Plato possessed no property other than what is mentioned in his will, he received a large sum of money from Dionysius I. Plato had a significant fund of money at his disposal (the exorbitant figure of 80 talents is mentioned). Indeed, Plato is also said to have had a banker called Andromedes. In other words, Plato was rich and had wealthy patrons and very probably wealthy students."
3272,"We are less attracted to the idea of the wealthy Aristocratic philosopher sequestered in his research facility and making occasional overseas trips to visit foreign tyrants than the image of the poor, shoeless Socrates causing trouble in the marketplace, refusing to be paid and getting killed by the city for his trouble. But our captivation with this image, once again, is overwhelmingly Plato’s invention."
3273,"And behind his extraordinary inventiveness, Plato performs a characteristic disappearing trick. Truth to tell, we know very little about Plato. According to Plutarch, he was a lover of figs. Big deal! Plato is mentioned only a couple of times in the many dialogues that bear his name. He was present at Socrates’ trial but — in a beautifully reflexive moment that he describes in the Phaedo — absent from the moment of Socrates’ death, because he was sick."
3274,"In fact, we don’t even know that he was called Plato, which might have been a nickname. Laertius claims that he was actually called Aristocles, after his grandfather. “Plato” is close to the word “broad” in Greek, like the broad leaves of the platanos or plane tree under which Socrates and Phaedrus sit and talk about eros. Some think that Plato was so called because he was broad-shouldered because of his prowess in wrestling."
3275,"I began to ponder and wandered from the Gymnasium, across the park and a street to the scant remains of another building in the Academy complex, which is approximately 130 feet square. It has the typical dimensions of a palaestra, or wrestling school. In my mind’s eye, I saw an elderly Plato sitting watching his academicians wrestle, occasionally offering coaching advice and encouragement."
3276,"Sometimes the less we know, the more space is open to the imagination."
3277,"Plato worked at the Academy until his death in 347 B.C.E., interrupted only by two more extended trips to Sicily. The Academy survived for a few more centuries until it was destroyed by the Roman general Sulla in 87 B.C.E. during the sack of Athens. The buildings were probably burned along with many other sanctuaries, and the trees from the grove of academe were felled to provide timber for his siege machines. So it goes, I thought."
3278,"A faint but clearly perceptible smell of urine hung in the air of the palaestra. On the corner as I looked up, two men were rummaging carefully and quietly through a baby-blue refuse bin."
3279,"What was striking was how exposed and all these remains were: no fences, no border walls and no security cameras."
3280,"It was time to go. On the corner of Hodos Platonos, Plato Street, I noticed a bar unsurprisingly called Platon. I thought about having a quick glass of red wine in Plato’s honor, but lost courage, took two photos, and left."
3281,"Simon Critchley is a professor of philosophy at the New School for Social Research and the author of several books, including “What We Think About When We Think About Soccer” and the forthcoming “Tragedy, the Greeks, and Us.” He is the moderator of The Stone."
3282,"Now in print: “Modern Ethics in 77 Arguments” and “The Stone Reader: Modern Philosophy in 133 Arguments,” with essays from the series, edited by Peter Catapano and Simon Critchley, published by Liveright Books."
3283,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
3284,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
3285,"On Friday, the Shops & Restaurants at Hudson Yards will open, the culmination of more than a decade of planning, strategizing and developing, and New York City will have the newest, shiniest, largest expression of what we used to call a “mall.”"
3286,"Glide, if you will, up its escalators and you can get a manicure-mid-meditation at Sundays or an $800 haircut at Sally Hershberger, dip into a new-concept Zara or the first “offline” store from the e-tailer Mack Weldon or Rolex or Cartier. Spin through the first New York City Neiman Marcus or its kookier neighbor, Forty Five Ten, a fellow Dallas retailer with outposts in Miami; Aspen, Colo.; and the Napa Valley of California. "
3287,"Stay for lunch — chicken fingers (at Momofuku’s Fuku) or high-end Korean-inflected cuisine (at Momofuku’s Kawi), Shake Shack or the newest Thomas Keller restaurant — and a restorative 10-minute siesta in a Provençale-scented aromatherapy room at the Conservatory, a new store offering a little bit of everything (including Provençale-scented siestas). Hit Lululemon, Tory Burch and, what the hell, Sephora, and now it’s time for dinner. Won’t you stay?"
3288,"Hudson Yards hopes you will. If you need, the first Equinox Hotel awaits just outside. Rooms start at $700 a night."
3289,"The retail center, all one million square feet of it, is the shopping, dining, pampering hub of Hudson Yards, the largest wholesale innovation to the New York landscape in years. It is nothing less than a full neighborhood developed by Related Companies, the mega-developers run by the billionaire Stephen M. Ross, in a joint venture with Oxford Properties Group. (Related also owns Equinox.) "
3290,"Built over 28 acres and atop still-active train yards, Hudson Yards runs from 10th Avenue to 12th Avenue, and 30th Street to 34th Street. (The Hudson Yards district is zoned as far east as Eighth Avenue and as far north at 42nd Street, so it will grow.) It includes office towers and residential towers, a new performance space (the Shed), a giant new piece of public art (the Vessel), a public square and garden, and this retail center."
3291,[The Times’s architecture critic asks: Is this the neighborhood New York deserves?]
3292,"Kenneth A. Himmel, the president and chief executive of Related Urban, who oversaw the project, is a veteran developer of mixed-use developments, including Water Tower Place in Chicago, Copley Place in Boston and the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle in Manhattan. They all pale before the scope and ambition of Hudson Yards. "
3293,"“This one,” Mr. Himmel said, “we knew was the mother of all mothers.”"
3294,"When all is said and done, Hudson Yards will be home to L’Oréal and Warner Media and the Tapestry brands (Coach, Kate Spade and more); to Boston Consulting Group and the global investment firm KKR and Point72 Asset Management (Steven A. Cohen’s investment firm). Current listings for available residences at 15 Hudson Yards include a $4.315 million two-bedroom apartment and a $32 million penthouse. The Shed will have diverse programming, including Björk and Boots Riley. New York Fashion Week is in discussions to move there as well, as soon as September."
3295,"If the new neighborhood, as Related is marketing the development, were a country, a tour guide chirped a few months back in the company’s 360-degree multimedia presentation center, it would have a gross domestic product comparable to Iceland’s."
3296,"At opening, the retail center will be 90 percent leased, with 100 stores and 25 restaurants, from fast-casual to fine dining, hoping to draw customers not only in but up to scale its gleaming heights. (A 35,000-square-foot “Spanish food experience” by the chef José Andrés is just outside.) "
3297,"When the retail complex is fully open, Related projects that it will see 60,000 visitors per day. It has designed the center for frictionless ease, to float between floors with minimal effort, and slide from well-known brands to first-time bricks-and-mortar retailers plucked from the direct-to-consumer e-tail boom on its Floor of Discovery. "
3298,"Still, Mr. Himmel acknowledged, there is always the question: Will it work?"
3299,"“When you throw a big party, you send out 200 invitations and hope that 150 people come,” he said. “We think we’ve cast the net out to thousands and thousands of people who are going to enjoy the project. But you always hold your breath.”"
3300,"One reason for that is that malls — “vertical retail,” in industry parlance — are a tricky and often unsuccessful proposition in New York City, where shopping is typically integrated into the cityscape, on sidewalk thoroughfares like Fifth and Madison Avenues, or shopping districts like SoHo or NoLIta."
3301,"Recent years have seen an influx of vertical developments, including Brookfield Place and the Oculus downtown, both of which have struggled. In January, Saks Fifth Avenue, one of Brookfield’s anchor tenants, closed its 86,000-square-foot women’s store after a mere two years."
3302,"Vertical retail and indoor malls are “two things New York City has never embraced,” said Arthur Maglio, the leader of the Faith Hope Consolo team at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, who had a few clients interested in Hudson Yards spaces. He cautioned, though, that Hudson Yards didn’t have a direct parallel to earlier attempts. "
3303,"“It’s really at the forefront of where malls are heading,” he said. “On a macro level, the mall at Hudson Yards is pivotal for retail.”"
3304,"One of the few successful malls in Manhattan is a Related property, the Shops at Columbus Circle at the Time Warner Center, anchored by a Whole Foods and an Equinox gym below street level and tethered to high-end condos above."
3305,"“People said vertical retail wouldn’t work in New York,” said Webber Hudson, an executive vice president at Related Urban. “We were able to prove them wrong.”"
3306,"But Related has had to contend with the lingering sense that New York is not a mall town and that Hudson Yards, the fantasy of one developer more or less magicked out of nothingness, is somehow “not New York.” "
3307,"“I used to go to Dubai a lot,” said Sally Hershberger, whose salon is on the ground floor of the complex. “This is really Dubai for me, but better, because I can walk there. I don’t have to schlep all the way to Dubai to get that kind of energy.”"
3308,"That energy is not necessarily a point of pride in a pedestrian’s paradise like New York, which has a certain satisfaction in its cheek-by-jowl mix of glamour and grit. Architectural innovations at Hudson Yards, like the setting back of certain floors, serve specifically to give a sense of streethood. All it takes, Mr. Hudson suggested, is a slight renovation of expectations."
3309,"“It’s just like any street,” he said. “It’s just that our sidewalk runs vertically through the project.”"
3310,"Related hopes Hudson Yards draws huge crowds of visitors, locals and tourists alike. The developer is keen to point out that it has two major streams of easy access: the 7 subway line, which the city extended in 2015 to the development’s doorstep, and the High Line, a tourist magnet that sees some seven million visitors per year and likewise spits out its strollers at Hudson Yards’ feet."
3311,"But the complex’s greatest advantage may be the tens of thousands of people who will live and work on-site. When the development is complete, it will comprise more than 18 million square feet, with 4,000 residential units and businesses expected to bring 55,000 workers to the area, providing a captive audience: Some of the buildings will open directly onto the mall’s key floors. "
3312,"Brian Bolke, the founder of the Conservatory, a new store attempting a showroom-style, inventory-less model, said he was initially uninterested in pursuing a lease at Hudson Yards. "
3313,"But one of the key draws, he decided, was what he called “the extraordinary relocation of the corporations that moved down there.” Many of the new tenants, including Neiman Marcus and the Equinox Hotel, described robust plans already in the works to market to those living and working in Hudson Yards."
3314,"It’s a symbiotic relationship. The new employees and residents patronize the stores, and the stores serve the new employees and residents, who are relocating to an area of Manhattan as yet underserved, even largely unknown."
3315,"“It’s literally a neighborhood that nobody’s ever been in,” said Daniel Arsham, one of the principals of Snarkitecture, the architecture and design practice that is opening Snark Park, a ticketed, immersive and Instagram-friendly art installation. “I was in Detroit last week and trying to explain to people where this physically sits and nobody has any reference for the area.”"
3316,"The main profit driver of large, mixed-use developments like Hudson Yards are condo sales, which are a harder multimillion-dollar sell in an area without conveniences, as Hudson Yards pre-Hudson Yards mostly was. "
3317,"Retail “almost becomes an amenity,” Mr. Maglio said, though he cautioned that the retail isn’t forgotten. But because Related needs these merchants as much as it needs their rents, it incentivized their deals, as is standard practice, and in some cases invested in their businesses. "
3318,"“Innovation requires investment,” Mr. Hudson said when asked. Ms. Hershberger confirmed that the company had invested in her salon. “They made it nice for me, put it that way,” she said."
3319,"Related may have made Hudson Yards nice for some of its tenants, but the early reaction to the project has much to do with how nice New York City made with Hudson Yards. Related won development rights for $1 billion in 2008 after the city and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority solicited bids. It has since received tax breaks and incentives, which, when coupled with the city’s extension of the 7 train, add up to nearly $6 billion in government assistance, according to research out of the New School."
3320,"Critics complain that these tax breaks favor billionaire developers, corporations and luxury buyers, not everyday New Yorkers. New York magazine recently illustrated a diamond-encrusted Hudson Yards on its cover, calling it “a billionaire’s fantasy city.”"
3321,"Lynne Sagalyn, an emeritus professor at Columbia Business School who has written on redevelopment, dismissed questions of seemliness. "
3322,"It is clear that given the city’s budget and constraints, development of the site, including the building of the platform over the train yards, would require private-sector investment, Dr. Sagalyn said, for which it would have to give incentives. (Dr. Sagalyn is a board member of Blackstone Mortgage Trust, which provided a loan for the construction of the Spiral, a new office tower in the Hudson Yards district.) “Gauging the magnitude of the subsidies is the right question,” she said. “Did they give away the store?”"
3323,"Proponents of the development say that the area will generate jobs and property taxes that will benefit the city for years to come, and that New York needs to change with the changing times."
3324,"“I worked in New York in the early ’80s,” said Chris Norton, the chief executive of Equinox Hotels. “You wouldn’t go down to that part of town. It was nothing.” What makes New York great, he said, is its continual reinvention."
3325,"“If you’re looking to continue to see New York develop and see new things happen, I don’t know if there’s many ways to do it besides vertically,” said Joe Cole of Forty Five Ten, who designed the space with his wife, Kristen Cole, its president and chief creative officer. “It feels like the future.”"
3326,"Geoffroy van Raemdonck, the chief executive of Neiman Marcus, echoed the sentiment. “We look at this neighborhood as being the next generation,” he said."
3327,"Neiman Marcus already does significant business in New York: $100 million in online sales in the New York area in the 2018 fiscal year, Mr. van Raemdonck said. But the Neiman Marcus at Hudson Yards will be the first in New York City, and Hudson Yards’ largest store, encompassing three floors and including two restaurants, a bar and an education and event space. "
3328,"“There were many opportunities that passed and were not chosen,” he said. “This felt like something we couldn’t miss.” Related and its new tenants are hoping that shoppers won’t be able to miss it, either."
3329,"“I would be very hesitant to project how it’s going to do,” Ms. Sagalyn said. “I think people will go over there just to see it — it’s a new part of the city. But how many people return and return there to shop? We’ll see.”"
3330,"The condos at 15 Hudson Yards are already 60 percent sold, and Related will begin selling 35 Hudson Yards, with 143 residences and prices beginning at $5 million. More office towers will begin construction soon. According to recent transplants, the neighborhood is coming to life. Nick Wooster, a veteran retail executive and longtime resident of the West Village, moved in three years ago."
3331,"“I do understand that what makes New York New York is not necessarily this,” he said, but New York’s days of wearing its grit and discomforts as a badge of honor may be behind it. And in any case, far from living at the ends of the earth, Mr. Wooster is on 10th Avenue. "
3332,"“I do not delude myself into thinking that I live in the Village,” he said, “but it doesn’t feel as disconnected.”"
3333,"About the retail center’s prospects, he was sanguine. “This is what I believe about today: All bets are off. The rules that we knew 30 years ago don’t necessarily apply.”"
3334,"Asked about how to keep Hudson Yards humming well into the future, Mr. Himmel said it would now be up to his tenants to draw their customers."
3335,"“We’ve done everything we possibly can to set the stage for this,” he said. "
3336,"In any case, the architect of the mother of all projects is ready to begin work on Related’s next project, in Silicon Valley."
3337,"“We have full approvals, 100 percent green light, to build over 12 million square feet of mixed-use,” Mr. Himmel said. “We don’t have to go up. We don’t have to combine all these uses in the same building. We’re going to do a street scene.”"
3338,NOBODY’S LOOKING AT YOU By Janet Malcolm
3339,"It will seem perverse, but it can’t be helped: To understand how Janet Malcolm has become one of the most distinctive American writers, you must ignore the 2,823 pages of her dozen books — even the one that occasions this review, “Nobody’s Looking at You” — and focus on her single book of photographs. Published in 2008, “Burdock” is so apparently peripheral to her corpus that Malcolm’s Wikipedia page doesn’t include it in an otherwise exhaustive bibliography. The book’s 28 color plates are images Malcolm took of the large green leaves of the burdock. Why this plant? “Burdock is a rank weed,” she writes, “that grows along roadsides and in waste places and around derelict buildings. It has a rough, harsh atmosphere. Writers have used it to denote ruin and desolation; Chekhov, for example, has burdock growing outside the unspeakable hospital of his story ‘Ward No. 6,’ and Hawthorne marks the decline of his house of seven gables with ‘an enormous fertility of burdocks’ nestled in its angles. … It is a tall, unruly ensemble of oversized lower leaves and thrusting stems of smaller leaves, culminating in spires of thistle-like magenta flowers that turn into burrs. In nature the lower leaves — the leaves that I collect — have a messy droopingness; they seem to be crawling along the ground. In my attic studio, stuck in bottles filled with reviving water, they come to attention and into their own. No associations of gloom and roughness adhere to them. Even before the camera completes the task, my act of plunder has given them aesthetic clout. Each leaf assumes its own pose and exhibits, almost flaunts, its individuality.”"
3340,"The passage I quote showcases a number of characteristic Malcolm gestures. There is above all the precision of usage: “rank” (which means growing too thickly and having a foul smell, but first meant proud and then luxuriant and then, in its abundance, a pest, a history of meaning hidden in Malcolm’s monosyllable); “atmosphere” (this seems precisely the wrong word to describe a weed, but in Malcolm’s use it suggests that the plant’s abundance has a weather of its own); “ensemble” (a group of musicians, making the weed not a random mess but a harmonious whole); “spires” (invoking the contradictory architecture of this dissolute thing); or … I’ll stop there (though one pines to argue for “unspeakable,” “unruly” and, of course, “plunder”). All that verbal care delivers news from Malcolm’s well-stocked mind. Chekhov and Hawthorne used the weed as a symbol in their fiction, Malcolm’s knowledge showcasing not her smarts but the contrast the paragraph is built to deliver: the gloom that has, in another wonderful Malcolm word, adhered to the plant — its reduction to symbolism in literature; its misrepresentation as uninterestingly ugly — which is, to Malcolm, an error, a wrong. She wants to show us, through her photographs, a way we might see things differently."
3341,"Seeing things differently is the essence of what sets Malcolm apart. Few writers pay attention with the precision, acuity and patience she has exhibited during her career of telling stories about other rank weeds: the faces people show the world. Her work was hybrid before hybrid was a thing: It balances her skills as a reporter (avid, nosy attention) with those of a scholar (writing about anything, it’s clear she’s read everything), a literary critic (tuned to how language, written or spoken, foregrounds its maker’s gifts and faults) and, above all, a storyteller. She is uncommonly concerned with finding a form that delivers the force of the story she is telling."
3342,"Malcolm has been a magazine journalist for half a century — writing for The New Yorker for 55 years — and to say that she has been formally innovative is, broadly speaking, against journalistic type. Journalists depend on pre-existing forms to ensure they get deadline work done, the storytelling wheel not reinvented just turned around again and again. The “profile,” for example, what Malcolm has called “the lax genre of personality journalism,” has a familiar rotation: A first section situates us in the subject’s compelling company; a second summarizes the work that sets the subject apart; a third charts their biographical path; a fourth puts us with them excitingly again. I know this structure in my bones: I make a living executing it. To read Malcolm remaking the profile is both a lesson for readers (I am learning so much!) and a tacit reproach to fellow practitioners (I am wasting my life!)."
3343,"Consider “Forty-One False Starts,” Malcolm’s 1994 profile of the painter David Salle. Each of Malcolm’s 41 numbered sections starts as if the piece had begun again: “All during my encounter with the artist David Salle. …”; “In the winter of 1992, I began a series of interviews with the artist David Salle”; “When I was interviewing the artist David Salle. …” Some of these false starts accumulate into mini-essays on microtopics relating to Salle (the fickleness of the art world; Salle’s sense of being misunderstood; Thomas Bernhard’s fiction), while others peter out (Malcolm’s biographical section on Salle is one exhausted sentence). What does this amount to? The Salle who emerges is both vain and un-self-conscious, talented and slipshod, fascinating and pedestrian. A journalist might see in this inconsistency a series of failed ledes; an art aficionado might see an attempt at mimesis, with Malcolm embodying in the form of her piece the fractured sensibility of Salle’s own paintings, their disarray. But the reader experiences them as a performance of the limits inherent in knowing anyone: Most people don’t add up. While the aim of many profiles is to assemble a clear, and not infrequently flattering, view of a person, Malcolm is willing to acknowledge imperfection — her subject’s; her own — and to deliver doubt."
3344,"“Nobody’s Looking at You” features essays written between 1996 and 2018. These 18 pieces are organized into three unnamed parts, but they conspire to form a meaningful whole. The first consists of five profiles; the second collects reportage that looks at the way we speak, variously defined, and how it reveals (often unpleasantly) our natures; the third, and longest, showcases Malcolm’s literary criticism. The book’s cunning title suggests its uniting theme: how rarely, when we look at or listen to or read someone’s work, we manage to see things clearly."
3345,"Malcolm’s title is salvaged from what is an otherwise frustrating profile of the clothing designer Eileen Fisher. Fisher proved an opaque subject for Malcolm. They spoke many times, and Malcolm was granted access to meetings in which she found herself marooned on the little island of Fisher’s executives, with its strange corporate patois. Malcolm was also baffled by some of what Fisher said, at one point remarking, “I had no idea what she was talking about.” Fisher insisted that the piece was about “Eileen Fisher,” the corporate entity, while Malcolm insisted that it was about Eileen Fisher, the real person. “When you say ‘It’s not about me’ and that you’re not interesting,” Malcolm observed, “that’s a very modest way of talking about yourself.” “I grew up Catholic,” Fisher replied. “You know, the ‘Nobody’s looking at you’ thing. … That’s what my mother said all the time. ‘Nobody’s looking at you.’ ... It was just safer to be invisible.”"
3346,"While it’s fair to say that Malcolm’s desire to write about Fisher was effectively thwarted by her subject — we get an unrevealing tale of Fisher putting a cat out and a look at the way corporate minders try to keep executives blandly on point when doing publicity — Malcolm did come away with that phrase, which could be her battle cry. At the start of her landmark book, “The Journalist and the Murderer” — her consideration of the relationship between subjects and authors occasioned by Joe McGinniss’s nonfiction book about Jeffrey MacDonald, a doctor who killed his pregnant wife and two little daughters — Malcolm wrote: “Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible. He is a kind of confidence man, preying on people’s vanity, ignorance or loneliness, gaining their trust and betraying them without remorse.”"
3347,"Malcolm implicates herself in that immorality, and the essays in “Nobody’s Looking at You” might be understood, in their sequencing, as an amplification of that earlier book’s famous opening and frank project. For after the fraught Fisher piece sets the bar low on visibility, Malcolm gives us a feast of looking in the next profile, “Performance Artist,” about the young piano virtuosa Yuja Wang. As famous for her fiery playing as for her risqué outfits, Wang saw her onstage clothing described by one music critic, Malcolm tells us, as “stripper-wear.” Here is how Malcolm puts Wang before us for the first time: “Her back was bare, thin straps crossing it. She looked like a dominatrix or a lion tamer’s assistant. She had come to tame the beast of a piece, this half-naked woman in sadistic high heels.” If the piece on Fisher, a clothing designer, was about how we mask ourselves in what we wear, the Wang piece is about how an artist discloses herself through her performances, figuratively and literally. Watching and listening to Wang, Malcolm wonders, “Is the seeing part a distraction (Glenn Gould thought it was) or is it — can it be — a heightening of the musical experience?”"
3348,"Seeing, listening: They’re the two major faculties upon which the journalist depends. Frequently Malcolm admits to her limitations. After Wang tells her about discovering Mozart, Malcolm confesses that she “didn’t and still don’t completely understand.” In a profile of the broadcaster Rachel Maddow, Maddow’s explanation of how she decides what the focus of a given show will be and how her meeting with her staff during the day tends to confuse more than clarify her intentions, Malcolm tells us: “I noticed none of this at the meeting I attended; I just found it hard to follow.” These admissions don’t feel like rhetorical moves, ethical appeals meant to earn the reader’s good will. Rather they feel like the substance of lived life, revealingly shared."
3349,"Malcolm’s presence in these pieces, you might at this point feel like reminding me, could be understood as nothing more than the habit of mind pioneered by the so-called New Journalists: Gay Talese, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson. And yet I am here to disagree. Taking no particular issue with the work of her colleagues, I wish nonetheless to say that Malcolm, line to line, is a more revealing writer, one whose presence in her pieces isn’t meant to advertise the self so much as complicate the subject. And also, line to line, she is a better writer."
3350,"Here, in the new book, is how Malcolm sees Dianne Feinstein: “A ’30s movie character in her own right, with her Mary Astor loveliness, and air of just having arrived with a lot of suitcases.” Here is how she describes a moment in the history of the Supreme Court: “The hearing for the nomination of Ruth Bader Ginsburg had the atmosphere of a garden party held to fete a beloved aunt about to embark on a wonderful journey.” Of “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” a reality show of yore: “Something always seems a little off in reality television. You don’t believe that what you are seeing happened in the way it is shown to have happened, any more than you think that the man in the Magritte was born with an apple attached to his face.” Each of these evocations is as much a portrait of the thing being said as of the person saying it, a person who, in addition to all her other virtues, is frequently very funny."
3351,"Then there is Malcolm’s reading of the face of John Roberts, in her timely essay “The Art of Testifying,” as he faced congressional questioning before his confirmation as chief justice of the United States: “Roberts had a wonderful way of listening to questions. His face was exquisitely responsive. The constant play of expression on his features put one in mind of 19th-century primers of acting in which emotions — pleasure, agreement, dismay, uncertainty, hope, fear — are illustrated on the face of a model. When it was his turn to speak, he did so with equal mesmerizing expressiveness. Whenever he said ‘With all due respect, Senator’ — the stock phrase signaling disagreement — he looked so genuinely respectful, almost regretful, that one could easily conclude that he was agreeing with his interlocutor rather than demurring.”"
3352,"Such a description is — to use one of Malcolm’s characteristic superlatives — delicious. It is the micro version of the form of her essay on David Salle: an accumulation, through the presentation of differences, of a singular picture of ambiguity. The key, if there is a key, to finding the source of Malcolm’s dedication to this complexity arrives at the end of “Nobody’s Looking at You,” in its largest section, devoted to Malcolm’s superb literary criticism. In an essay on the magisterial control Tolstoy exerts over the world he invents, Malcolm writes: “As we read ‘Anna Karenina,’ we are under the same illusion of authorlessness we are under as we follow the stories that come to us at night and seem to derive from some ancient hidden reality rather than from our own, so to speak, pens.” What Malcolm seems to pine for — what all writers do and few manage to seize — is authority, the kind of understanding that only the creator, or a rare creator anyway, can claim for the stories we live. “If the world could write by itself,” Isaac Babel observed, “it would write like Tolstoy.” But because the world can’t, we are fortunate to have Malcolm’s kind of authority, one founded as much on her failures as on her successes at seeing."
3353,"Where I live, there is always someone driving slowly on the road ahead. This is by the sea in the English countryside, and the roads are narrow and burrow-like, with high hedges on either side to protect the fields from the coastal winds. The roads are digressive in character, rarely traveling directly to a specific location. They branch across the flat fields like veins. It is hard to see what’s coming, and because there aren’t many vantage points, it’s easy to get lost. Still, it’s nothing that requires excessive caution. There’s no particular reason for alarm, in fact quite the reverse. Yet people drive at 15, 20, 30 miles an hour. No matter how many of them you get past, there’s always another one around the next bend."
3354,"A large portion of these drivers are elderly; their cars often are immaculate and new. At certain seasons, there are also many tourists, trying to maneuver their caravans and motor homes along the winding narrow lanes. There are farms here, and so it is sometimes tractors that block the road, their big churning wheels flinging clods of mud behind them that spatter across your windshield or land thudding on the hood of your car. There are stretches where the road briefly straightens so that you can see far enough to overtake. People in big, powerful cars do this boldly and calmly and as though insensible to risk. Others hesitate and miss their chance. But no matter how many times you overtake, within a few minutes you will be stuck behind someone else."
3355,"This is a rural area, a backwater, and so it could be assumed that people here are rarely in much of a hurry. Alternatively, it could be said that the relative isolation of our lives can make us less aware of others and of the spaces we share. The coast road is the local thoroughfare: It is usually necessary to take it to get nearly anywhere you might need to go. It passes through numerous villages whose architecture of narrow bridges and constricted high streets, though scenic, presents many obstacles to the flow of traffic. Problems are constantly arising, and though it could not be said to be the fault of these quaint places, they take on something of the character of an obstacle course when large numbers of vehicles are trying to pass through them. The houses and cottages here are old and have remained the same size, while the vehicles that pass them have become larger: Sometimes the cars are no more than two or three feet from their windows. When the traffic is at a standstill, some of the smaller cottages look dwarfed by the cars. It is possible for the people in the cottages and the cars to look at one another through their respective windows."
3356,"Several times a day, the road through a village will be backed up both ways with stationary traffic, so that it can seem as though there is some calamity or attraction there. Yet it is only the spectacle of people trying to do what they want where it is impracticable, for the reason that the vehicles are much bigger and more unwieldy than the humans inside them. At the center of the jam, you will often find, for instance, a giant motor home and a delivery truck face to face, unable to get past each other on the narrow village street. This situation can sometimes have no solution other than for one whole line of cars to reverse out of the village to allow the other to pass. If there is no one available to suggest and oversee this operation, the impasse can last a long time. But usually someone assumes the position of authority. It often becomes clear that many of the participants trying to unravel these snarls are unable to fully maneuver and control the cars they are driving. Others struggle to adapt to the change of circumstance and to the necessity of acting as a group. Passing such a situation on foot, the sight of the rows of human faces trapped behind and framed by their windshields can be especially striking, as though a portrait painter had drawn them."
3357,"On the open road, the slow drivers often fail to effectively communicate their intentions and aims. They will brake for no perceptible reason on a straight and empty stretch, or lose speed until they come inexplicably to a halt, presumably unaware that there is anyone behind them. If they signal, they do it too late in the buildup to an action; often it is a case of working out what they are doing or mean to do by reading their driving behavior. A person who slows down at every junction or side road, for example, can be guessed to be looking for a turn but unsure of where it is. Others will brake suddenly when they pass a pub or a shop, evidently considering going in. The usual autonomy and separation of the car, its hermeticism, is reversed: The responsibility of driving, its visual and mental burden, is passed to those outside it. This area being a backwater, as well as a place for holidaymakers, it may be the case that people feel entitled to shed that burden here. In this remote place, the distinction between private and public worlds is less clear; the contract of the road, its status as a sphere of regulation by agreement, breaks down."
3358,"Yet there are others for whom this suggestion of lawlessness is the catalyst for signaling their intentions too zealously. They drive, as it were, sanctimoniously, as though to teach the rest of us a lesson. If they are going to make a right turn, they do it with a great fanfare of long-drawn-out indicating and braking. They obey the rules of the road so deliberately and self-consciously that their behavior becomes distracting, like actors threatening the integrity of a crowd scene by continually drawing attention to themselves and to the role they are being expected to play. It is as though, for them, the road is not a shared reality but a kind of fiction, an opportunity to become visible through disguise."
3359,"I have often heard it suggested that elderly citizens should not drive, and that is certainly a consideration where I live. I recall a few years ago, a woman of 94 killed a girl of 10 at a pedestrian crossing. There have doubtless been a number of such incidents, but this one has stayed in my mind. One reason, I suppose, has to do with narrative, with the fact that the meaning of this woman’s life was entirely altered by a single event at its end: This is not how stories generally work. Because she had already lived an unusually long life, I wondered whether the woman wished she had died before killing the girl, but the question of who is responsible in that situation appears to be somewhat opaque. You might see the car as a weapon lawfully placed in the driver’s hands, in which case a woman of that age ought perhaps to have decided not to drive it; or you might see the laws that leave the decision to her as murderous. The car itself could be viewed as the murderer, since its capacity for destruction is so tenuously linked to that of the person driving it."
3360,"The reason most often given by the elderly for continuing to drive is the wish to retain their independence. Without a car, in other words, they would become subject to and entrapped by the reality of their own lives. There are many others for whom this is also the case, people whose arrangements — whether through force of circumstance or as a result of the choices they’ve made — would be made untenable by having no car. This is a rural area where few services are reachable on foot, so most of the people who live here fall into that category. To have no car, around here, is to be the victim of circumstance."
3361,"Several years ago, as the mother of small children and in a different place, I tried to live without using a car, an undertaking that made every action more effortful in what was already an effortful phase of life. I was not, obviously, trying to make things easier for myself: I was acting as I did out of principle. Something in my circumstances had made cars unappealing to me. Nearly everything I had to do would have been simplified by using a car, and I believe I saw in this fact a kind of death, as though by taking the easy way out I would miss the opportunity to learn the truth about my situation. Other people were often appalled by this decision and treated its consequences with mockery or anger. There were also a small number of parents who had made the same choice. It was not, largely speaking, a choice made for economic reasons; rather, it appeared to be an ethical response to the fact of parenthood, an attempt to take full responsibility for causing new individuals to exist."
3362,"These days, I often witness the sight of a man or woman on a bicycle with a child and heavy shopping strapped to the back, pedaling furiously through the rain while being overtaken by a stream of cars, or drawn up at a traffic light beside a large clean car with another parent and child sitting calmly inside. The difference between the two is striking without being immediately comprehensible. They might almost be said to represent a mutual criticism; alternatively, they could be seen as demonstrating fundamentally different attitudes to children. If it is true that the cycling parent’s behavior signifies at least the willingness to make greater efforts on behalf of his or her child, from the outside it can look like the reverse. The driver could even view the cyclist as irresponsible, for failing to adequately protect his or her child from the dangers of the driver’s own vehicle."
3363,"Now that my children are grown, I drive again, as though my example no longer counts for anything. I remember, from other phases of life, the feeling of freedom and well-being that came from walking or cycling where I needed to go. But around here, such behavior would be impracticable. It would be the reverse of freedom, or at least it would appear that way. In the past, people routinely walked long distances, but now the roads are full of cars. It seems to me that if I walked instead of driving, I would make contact with my younger self and with some truth I have forgotten, but to make that decision would almost be to make the fact of oneself too important."
3364,"The village where I live is on the coast road, and there is much talk among the residents about how to control the speed at which people drive through it. The slowness that frustrates and impedes us when we are trying to drive on the roads outside the village becomes immaterial from our perspective as homeowners; from this angle, it appears that people around here drive not too slowly but too fast. This might seem merely a good example of the corrosion of truth by point of view, but for those interested in the facts, one aspect of the mystery is easily resolved: The local council has performed numerous speed-testing exercises on the village road and found that a majority of cars passing through are indeed driving in excess of the speed limit."
3365,"We accept that we ourselves are guilty of speeding thoughtlessly through other people’s villages but become sensitive in our own. Equally, it might be agreed that a person traveling by bicycle will feel an antipathy toward cars, yet once inside a car can immediately become irritated by cyclists, and as a pedestrian could dislike them both, sometimes all in the course of a single day. What is harder to make sense of is our certainty that everywhere other than our own village people drive at speeds so slow they become dangerous. The speed limit inside the village is 20 miles per hour. A car traveling at 30 would be going too fast, yet on the open road 30 can be considered too slow. Is the explanation, therefore, to be found in the inflexibility of people’s speeds, their determination to travel at the same pace no matter where they are?"
3366,"It is not clear to me whether the residents themselves drive too fast through the village. I have often noticed that people go in for the sermonizing kind of driving when they are in the vicinity of their own house, particularly if that house is troubled by traffic problems: It might be said that they have become disempowered to the degree that their individual example is the only recourse left to them. But equally there can be a feeling of entitlement, of being above the law, on your own terrain. It has been noted that one person often recognized speeding through the village is a member of the parish council, the chief advocate for the imposition of stringent speed restrictions. Where driving is concerned, there seems to be a peculiar difficulty in unifying different points of view: The personal reality of the driver is unassailable, even by his own conscious mind. At the “Speed Awareness Course” that is the penalty for minor speeding offenses, participants are shown a short film in which, asked to concentrate on a particular aspect of the action, they entirely fail to notice a man dressed in a gorilla suit walk across the screen waving his arms and beating his chest. The point we’re being asked to accept is that when we drive, what we see is not reality. But what, then, is it?"
3367,"This is an area of abundant wildlife, and one characteristic of the roads around here is the number and variety of animals that lie crushed everywhere on the pavement. The bloodied heaps of feathers and fur dry out and decay over time, flattened by the traffic until they become pale two-dimensional shapes that are hard to identify any longer as what they once were."
3368,"The creatures most commonly killed appear to be the larger game birds — pheasants and quail — that are forever darting out into the road in front of passing cars. The smaller native birds tend to spring away at the sounds of approach, but these big ones seem to exist in a state of strange bewilderment, easily panicked and yet without the slightest idea of how to save themselves. If they are standing beside the road, the noise of a coming car will cause them to run directly in its path. The same is true of the small clumsy deer originally from China — Muntjac — that were introduced to the countryside in the 1920s and have steadily multiplied. Rabbits and squirrels, though quick, are ubiquitous and without particular stratagems and are frequently flattened. Hedgehogs, on the other hand, move so slowly that the question of whether they are crushed or not presumably lies entirely in the hands of fate. Occasionally a stoat or weasel will zoom triumphantly across the road like a funny undulating mustache, too cunning to be caught. A roe deer of considerable size once lay by the road outside the village for the many weeks it took it to decay, so that every time you passed, you saw it at a new stage of this process, the sleeping form still there day after day, visible from some way off."
3369,"It is doubtless upsetting to hit a bird or animal, and many people swerve to avoid them. Others don’t, either because the circumstances would make swerving dangerous or because — whether through indifference or rationality — they don’t accept that responsibility for the situation lies in their hands. The driving situation, in other words, does not legislate for the behavior of animals, and so it is not the individual driver’s job to avoid them. The car itself, of course, is designed to protect the people inside it, not the objects that cross its path. The airbag that cushions the driver in the event of a collision does not have its exterior equivalent to cushion the thing being collided with. Yet in its weight and hardness, its velocity and power, the car is a more or less invincible aggressor. Nothing soft and living stands a chance against it. When cars were first invented, the number of people and animals they hit was proportionately extremely high: The car was not yet a reality that could be anticipated and avoided, to such an extent that early cars had to have a person walking in front of them waving a red flag. An analogy might be that if rocks suddenly began falling from the sky, many people would be hit by rocks before they developed systems and strategies to protect themselves. Yet around here at least, these systems are rudimentary compared with the cars’ own advancements in speed and comfort and passenger safety."
3370,"It is often regretted that children can no longer play or move freely outside because of the dangers of traffic; inevitably, many of the people who voice these regrets are also the drivers of cars, as those same restricted children will come to be in their time. What is being mourned, it seems, is not so much the decline of an old world of freedom as the existence of comforts and conveniences the individual feels powerless to resist, and which in any case he or she could not truthfully say they wished would be abolished. There is a feeling, nonetheless, of loss, and it may be that the increasing luxury of the world inside the car is a kind of consolation for the degradation of the world outside it."
3371,"Because of family circumstances, during the past couple of years I have had to drive frequently to the city and back. Emerging from the countryside, I am often startled by the ceaseless flow of heavy traffic. It seems incredible to me that so many people could be pursuing their private aims in this public way. But are cars people?"
3372,"The spectacle of mass movement can look like something unstoppable, yet it is the easiest thing in the world to impede the flow of traffic or to bring it to a halt. On my route, there are long stretches of motorway, and the traffic is always thickening or lengthening as it meets and then absorbs an obstruction. It doesn’t take much for this thickening to become an actual blockage. The sense of embroilment usually comes without any knowledge of what has caused it: Often the first sign of it is an increase in awareness of the individual identity of other drivers. The forward-flying host begins to be differentiated; cars that seemed anonymous and distant become closer and more familiar; a web of recognition begins to form itself. The phase of community that follows — lacking any redeeming narrative or central event — is more or less indistinguishable from mutual entrapment. In this context, the difference between a car and a person is not entirely clear. Moments earlier, the car was the disguise for, and the enlargement of, the driver’s will. Shortly, when the traffic stops, it will become his burden and his prison. But during the phase of transition, their mutual relationship seems more biological, a kind of linked separateness."
3373,"All sorts of things can cause the traffic to stop: an accident, a scene at the side of the road. It’s often surprising how minor these dramas are, compared to the size and extent of their consequences. Their power is cumulative; it arises from the number of people exposed to the incident, however trivial. I once talked to a man who specialized in patterns of traffic flow, and he showed me a set of diagrams illustrating how the merest distraction in one place, something so small that it would cause passers-by to briefly glance at it and therefore unconsciously decrease their speed, could over time result in the whole motorway coming to a standstill in another place miles away."
3374,"The drama of the road, once you have been observing and participating in it for a number of years, can be seen to change and develop. New themes arise or die out; new narratives emerge and either progress or fade away again; certain behaviors grow widespread and occasionally take hold. In Britain, for instance, the fast lane of the motorway is increasingly full of people driving slowly, while the other two lanes are often more or less empty. On a motorway, it might be said that you ought to know your place: Here, increasingly, it is clear that a majority of people — wrongly or otherwise — believe that place to be the fast lane. This belief, and the behavior that attends it, has numerous consequences, one of which is that it is now almost impossible to get quickly where you want to go. Rather than representing an opportunity for passing, the fast lane is dominated by the person going most slowly, who dictates the speed at which everything behind him is traveling."
3375,"As a result, despite the fact that the rules of the road forbid it, people here are now deciding to overtake on the inside. There is some confusion in Britain about what this practice should be called: “Undertaking” is — it would seem — the logical formulation, despite its funereal associations. It used to be the case that only reckless or seemingly lawless drivers would undertake, but now a wide range of people can be seen doing it, to the extent that when the traffic is heavy, the middle and slow lanes often move faster than the fast one. Undertaking is perceived to be cheating, but the more people do it, the more it becomes justified as a response to the corruption — as it were — of the principle of the fast lane. People decide to take things into their own hands; if there is no longer any fast lane to provide a context for their aims and abilities, they must act for themselves."
3376,"On motorways, often a truck will abruptly swerve out into the fast lane to overtake another truck, its size operating as a kind of authority. From a distance, the trucks seem more or less indistinguishable from each other: Their differences in speed are minimal; the reasons for one of them to overtake another are not entirely clear. The drama of this act, being slow to accrue, is therefore unexpected when it comes, but its apparent violence is quickly undermined by the bulk and slowness of the perpetrator. A long line of car drivers quickly builds up behind to watch him inching past a vehicle as slow and cumbersome as his own. When he has succeeded, they hurtle by him with contempt. If the difference in speed between the two participants is sufficiently minimal, the contest can take a long time and cover many miles of ground, and when this happens, the overtaking driver becomes, at a certain point, an aggressor again. His lack of power is having serious consequences: Angry as they might be, the cars can’t get past him. He has rendered them helpless."
3377,"It seems possible that people experience more extreme emotions when they drive, and reveal cruder prejudices, than they might otherwise be aware of or admit to. Perhaps the soldiers of the past, in their suits of armor, felt similarly disinhibited and more capable of violence. Road rage is a common occurrence: People can often be seen shouting or gesticulating at one another from their cars, whereas in the street or other public places, such violent outbursts and attacks are rare. Once you’re inside a car, it becomes permissible to comment on those outside it, to remark on their appearance or demeanor, with a brazenness absent from most social situations. The occupants of a moving vehicle might even feel licensed to heckle or harass those they see, yet when the car is stripped of its power — by being stopped by traffic lights, for instance, or at a standstill in a traffic jam — and those occupants are exposed, their violence and aggression can rarely be sustained. They may even be frightened of being confronted in the flesh. It has often been observed that people behave in their cars as though they cannot be seen."
3378,"Recently, stuck in a traffic jam, I saw an elderly and respectable-looking man leaping wildly and jerkily in his seat, his arms flailing, his face half-demented with anger, shouting things at other drivers that could not be heard through the glass."
3379,"Occasionally, I meet a person who has never learned to drive. Sometimes he or she is a city dweller for whom the need to learn has never arisen with sufficient force. Sometimes a lack of opportunity is the cause; sometimes privilege is. There are also people who appear to have known from the beginning that driving wasn’t for them. Often they are individuals society might label as sensitive or impractical or otherworldly; sometimes they are artists of one kind or another."
3380,"I myself never considered not learning to drive. Had I not learned, my life would doubtless have taken a somewhat different course: I would probably not have been able to live here on the coast, for instance. Yet I don’t remember it as having been much of a choice at the time; I don’t recall having a sense of the alternatives."
3381,"I think about it sometimes, the life I would have lived if I hadn’t learned to drive. When I look at my history of driving, I begin to see in it a brutalizing element. That history, I suppose, has been analogous to the history of my own will, of all the things I have made happen that wouldn’t have occurred naturally on their own. Increasingly I find myself wondering at the nature of the story it has made up: rived with contradictions and inconsistencies and problems of point of view, its relationship to the truth opaque. My impatience with the slow drivers on these coastal roads, for instance, remains at odds with my fear of cycling on those same roads: Perhaps it is myself I am afraid of. Despite my claims to equality, when my husband and I go somewhere together by car, I automatically get in the passenger seat. At busy or complicated junctions, I find myself becoming self-conscious and nervous about reading the situation: I worry I don’t see things the way everyone else does, a quality that otherwise might be considered a strength. Sometimes, stuck on the coast road behind the slow drivers while they decide whether or not they want to turn left, it strikes me that the true danger of driving might lie in its capacity for subjectivity, and in the weapons it puts at subjectivity’s disposal. But how can you know when the moment has arrived at which you are no longer capable of being objective?"
3382,"Recently, renting a car alone on a trip abroad, I realized that something had changed: The world no longer seemed entirely familiar to me. I struggled to comprehend the strange layout of the car’s controls; navigating out of the parking lot, I couldn’t get a sense of the shape and size of my vehicle, and the interface of the foreign motorway was at moments unintelligible to me. Other drivers surged up impatiently behind me, sounding their horns. I had forgotten, it seemed, how to drive; or rather, the degree of responsibility that driving entails suddenly seemed unmanageable to me. Why was everyone else not likewise crippled by this realization?"
3383,"I moved into the slow lane, but trucks loomed up in the rearview mirror one after another and then overtook me, their huge forms seeming about to suck me under as they roared past. I wanted to pull over, but the inescapable fact was that I had to remain on the motorway in order to get off it. On that wide, gray, unfamiliar road, swept along in the anarchic tumult of speeding cars, every moment all at once seemed to contain the possibility of disaster, of killing or being killed: It was as if driving were a story I had suddenly stopped believing in, and without that belief, I was being overwhelmed by the horror of reality. The river of cars plummeted on, relentless and unheeding. But the fact of myself, of my aloneness, had somehow been exposed."
3384,"Back home, rounding a bend on one of the empty roads where I live, I came upon an overturned sports car on the roadside. It was a hot summer’s day: The upside-down car had its roof down. Lying stiffly beside it amid the foaming white cow-parsley were its occupants, a man and a woman, their pale legs sticking straight out in front of them, their shocked faces as rigid as dolls’ faces, their summer clothes askew. The man still had his sunglasses on; the woman’s broad-brimmed hat lay in the middle of the road. The accident could only just have happened, but no one had seen it, and there was no one there."
3385,"ON A MID-DECEMBER morning at her home studio, which is perched on a wooded hill near Mount Tamalpais in Marin County, Calif., the 98-year-old dance artist Anna Halprin was leading a movement class. “Think about positive and negative space,” she said, observing from a director’s chair as her 12 students — a retired preschool teacher, a fine-linens importer — assumed a range of positions at once ordinary and not. One woman began to crawl through the parted legs of another, as if a child at recess, while a third communed with the wall, splaying her limbs against its rust-colored surface. Warmed up, the class then made its way to the adjacent 1,800-square-foot redwood deck that Halprin’s late husband, the landscape architect Lawrence Halprin, built in 1952. Since its construction, artistic heirs of Halprin, including Simone Forti, Yvonne Rainer, Trisha Brown and Meredith Monk, have visited the deck at one time or another to practice and move with her. An esteemed teacher and performer, Halprin is known for her use of scores, or task-based improvisations, as well as for making dances inspired by nature. Once outside, a pair of students inspected some overhead branches and then offered full-body impressions of leaves rustling in the wind."
3386,"It’s difficult to see the beginning of things, and this is especially true of artistic movements, which tend to bleed together at their edges. And yet Halprin’s deck is considered one of several birthplaces of what would come to be called postmodern dance — an experimental school that posed formal questions about just what dance could be — which otherwise originated in New York in the early 1960s. Its 20 or so most active and influential practitioners were mostly trained dancers working on the fringes of the dance-world establishment and their visual artist peers, all of whom recognized that one of the things dance could be was a type of conceptual or performance art, other then-burgeoning and medium-blurring movements that regarded the three-dimensional body as a Duchampian ready-made. Together, this group retooled the common dance vocabulary and redefined who might be seen as a dancer, which inevitably had implications beyond the realm of composition, upending assumptions about beauty and bodies at a time not unlike our own."
3387,"[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]"
3388,"While stylistically divergent, postmodern dance tended to reject virtuosic movements in favor of pedestrian ones like walking, crouching, flailing and falling — take Rainer’s 1963 piece “We Shall Run,” in which the dancers made good on their word. It also embraced humor and a Dadaist sense of the absurd, as evidenced by Lucinda Childs’s “Carnation” (1964), in which the artist placed a colander on her head and a stack of fanned dishwashing sponges in her mouth, or David Gordon’s singing of “Second Hand Rose” and “Get Married, Shirley” during the first performance of his finger-wiggling “Mannequin Dance” (1962), which he conceived of while in his bathtub. “‘Swan Lake’ it ain’t,” the New York Times weekly arts columnist Grace Glueck reported overhearing at the First New York Theater Rally in 1965, which featured a dance work by the artist Robert Rauschenberg combining live turtles, saltine crackers and a campy tap routine by the dancer Deborah Hay."
3389,"Until then, thinking about dance had been, as Gordon once lamented, “peculiarly conservative,” with performative Western dance history unfolding rather apart from the other arts and consisting largely of ballet (which had been twirling in place since the 1600s until its neo-Classical offshoot was developed by George Balanchine) and modern (which the experimentalists felt was overly and falsely expressive). The postmodern movement wasn’t exactly a strident dismissal of all that had come before: “I think there was a question of, ‘Why do these people take ballet if they’re just carrying mattresses around?’ But I felt it was important for dancers to have a certain discipline,” says Childs. Discipline, however, did not mean favoring what was considered a dancerly body, with long legs and good turnout. Postmodern choreographers placed trained and untrained dancers — as well as more- and less-toned ones — side by side, dispensing with the makeup and organizational structure of formal companies so as to privilege the mind and movements of the individual. In deconstructing dance, then, they managed to democratize it."
3390,"“We’re still feeling the reverberations of that moment,” says the New York-based choreographer Pam Tanowitz, who might be described as a contemporary postmodernist. In a way, in fact, we’re feeling them as much as ever. Postmodern dance developed alongside both artistic and social upheavals, particularly second-wave feminism and, though it was not often expressly political about things other than aesthetics — “there wasn’t a specific agenda,” says Childs — the style’s early champions, many of whom were women, were seeking alternative ways of moving through space and, by extension, life. Their work is a reminder, as we live through our own reckoning surrounding the control and mistreatment of women’s bodies, of the ongoing validity of that search."
3391,"PART OF POSTMODERN dance’s power lay in the fact that, for all of its foreignness, it was also familiar. Here were movements taken from the street or home and performed by able but merely human bodies in intimate settings — namely at downtown galleries, lofts or the freewheeling Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village, either in the main sanctuary or upon the painted lines of the basement basketball court. As in life, gestures often lacked musical accompaniment: The dancers took many cues from the composer John Cage — most famous for his composition “4’33”,” in which no music is played for the duration of the title, the only noises coming from the environment surrounding the performance — and from Cage’s partner, the choreographer Merce Cunningham, who applied the same theories of indeterminacy found in Cage’s music to movement. Cunningham, who would have turned 100 this year, would sometimes flip a coin to decide the next move, giving his work a nonlinear, collagelike quality."
3392,"These were ideas simultaneously being explored in visual art, which was engaged in a similar resetting of boundaries as Pop, Minimalism and conceptual art replaced Abstract Expressionism, with which modern dance was closely aligned; for one, both were preoccupied with working on the floor, as in the paintings of Jackson Pollock and the dances of Martha Graham. Postmodernists remained keen on gravity, however. Certain choreographers would come to treat the floor as a dance partner, just as multidisciplinary artists like Ana Mendieta and Bruce Nauman used it in their performance pieces as a site for symbolic regeneration or heady writhing. (“Once, after seeing me perform, my father said, ‘Well, that was very nice, but now that you’re in your 40s, perhaps you should think about standing up,’” says Forti.) In 1960 and 1961, first at the Reuben Gallery in the East Village and then again at Yoko Ono’s Chambers Street loft, Forti showed “Dance Constructions,” featuring a choreography centered around a series of physical structures (a slanted board, a hanging rope), which she created after coming across pictures of the Japanese performance artist Saburo Murakami bursting through a row of paper screens. In one of her constructions, an abstracted portrait of a domestic drama, Rainer and the artist Robert Morris, Forti’s then husband, bobbed up and down from opposite ends of a wooden seesaw. Forti considered her work as much dance as sculpture, its human performers art objects like any other — but it hardly mattered, since, for this brief and exceptional window, art, dance and music were almost synonymous."
3393,"If postmodern dance’s acceptance as visual art was fueled by the form’s sheer conceptualism, it was helped along by its genre-hopping participants. The 1960s New York art scene was famously small, and disciplines blended together as a result. In addition to Rauschenberg and Morris, visual artists best known as painters and sculptors such as Alex Hay, Carolee Schneemann, Red Grooms and Andy Warhol were all part of the greater Judson scene. “Bob [Rauschenberg] was with [the dancer] Steve Paxton and I was with Alex and for a while we were a little foursome,” says Deborah Hay. “Bob liked to cook for people, so we’d go to his place for steak or lobster and then we’d all go dancing at Max’s Kansas City.” As the dance artist Ralph Lemon puts it, “The fact that these people were sleeping together doesn’t get talked about enough,” adding that the exchange between art and dance at that time must have been “visceral.”"
3394,"Lemon came up in the late 1970s, when the new new dance was infusing postmodern constructions with overt social commentary, and was greatly influenced by what he calls dance’s “lineage of white women.” It’s true that the downtown scene at that time included few artists of color — uptown, Alvin Ailey was leading his own dance revolution — and it’s also true that, simply because they’d always been there, women in dance held power not necessarily afforded to those in other artistic realms. “We all learned the same movement,” says Rainer. “By the mid-60s I was having women lift men.” Ana Janevski, a curator of the Museum of Modern Art’s recent exhibition “Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done,” believes Judson’s esprit de corps had a “proto-feminist” bent. “This was essentially a group of women working together democratically and mining their own lives for material,” she says. For Rauschenberg’s turtle piece, Brown danced in her wedding dress."
3395,"In time, though, the moment of equilibrium passed and the community collapsed, reality itself acting as a sort of score. After the last Judson dance concert in 1964, Childs taught elementary school for five years to support herself before returning to the field. Rainer’s return, following a long career making experimental films, came much later, in 2000. Forti lived for a time in Rome, crossing paths with the Arte Povera movement, and Deborah Hay eventually landed in Austin, where she hosted group workshops. Even in the ’60s, says Hay, when visual artists and dancers were intensely collaborative, they were still split over the matter of finances: It was the visual artists who had money. That gap only widened as contemporary art became ever more expensive, and by the 1980s, art institutions had little incentive to invest in something as inherently ephemeral and thus nearly impossible to own as performance. Around this time, Childs professionalized by starting her own dance company and moved increasingly afield from the visual arts community, performing on more traditional proscenium stages. The work, though, remained radical. At one of the early showings of Childs’s seminal “Dance” (1979), the technically simple leaps and phrases of which create complicated floor patterns that evoke the line drawings of Sol LeWitt, one of Childs’s collaborators on the piece, a disgruntled viewer threw eggs."
3396,"THOSE YEARS HELPED us to understand the body not just as a tool for making art but as a battleground. Deborah Hay talks about finding her own language for movement in the post-Judson years and about practice as protest: “I’ve been choreographed as a woman. I’ve been choreographed as an older woman. I’ve been choreographed as a liberal. I’ve been choreographed as a Jew. I’ve been choreographed as a single woman. I’ve been choreographed as a mother,” she says. “When I dance, I try to enlarge that choreography.” At 77, she still spends every morning in the studio. Eventually, though, so-called ordinary movement becomes less so. One of the things that does separate a dancer’s work from a painter’s, say, is that it must change along with her body. Rainer, now 84, has incorporated text into her recent work and given herself the role of reader. Childs, 78, mostly choreographs for others these days, but she danced her 1973 work “Particular Reel” as part of MoMA’s Judson exhibition this past fall, her measured gestures still assured and her presence still potent. It is a striking thing to see her and her contemporaries onstage or merely moving across a room (as Forti did during our interview to retrieve a poem she’d written that week), knowing we may not have much longer with these witnesses to and architects of an extraordinary time. “They’re here,” says Lemon. “Right in front of us. They’ve placed these bodies with minimal physical information left to give, and in that requisite reduction is something profound.”"
3397,"“This is sort of the last chance to get it all down,” Tanowitz says of recent attempts by contemporary companies and art institutions, from MoMA to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, which have acquired pieces by dancers like Brown and Monk for their collections, to preserve early postmodernist contributions by reconstructing scores and restaging works. (Brown died in 2017, but her company lives on, still holding rehearsals in her loft at 541 Broadway.) Younger artists have also taken on the responsibility of preservation and recontextualization. In 2017, the artist Adam Pendleton made a video portrait of Rainer that alternates between footage from 1978 of her dancing her minimalist-leaning “Trio A” sequence and present-day scenes of her reading found text accounting the deaths of black Americans including Eric Garner and Tamir Rice. In this revisiting, Rainer’s quick and careful steps become pleas for space in which bodies can move freely, unrestricted by race, gender or immigration status."
3398,"Halprin, who early on saw dance as a social corrective and pathway to personal healing, creating community-based work with the arts organization Studio Watts Workshop after the Watts riots of 1965 and with people with AIDS in the ’80s, is also attuned to the more minor injustices of modern life. “That one’s a graphic designer,” she said to me of one of the students in her California studio. “When else does he get a chance to connect to his spirit? He doesn’t.” Most of these women are hesitant to describe dancing — and theirs in particular — as spiritual, but, if one has dismissed a technique-based approach whereby one dances to become better at dancing, an alternative objective, it was abundantly clear on the dance deck, is joy. How encouraging that this joy might be available to anyone willing to look for it. At the end of class, the students gathered on the deck around Halprin, who was wrapped in a wool blanket-coat she wore as a dance student in the Midwest in the 1930s, as she described seeing a rendition of her 1965 work “Parades and Changes,” in which a group of dancers slowly undress, performed at San Francisco’s de Young Museum last October. “My 9-year-old great-granddaughter was there and has taken to telling her father, ‘You see, Dad, ordinary movement can become art. You just have to do it with awareness.’”"
3399,"ATLANTA — The supplicants came bearing tithes. Salted cashews, a plastic fruit cup, homemade crafts. The guest of honor, a Virginia opossum named Starfish, sat curled atop a pink fleece bomber jacket, spitting out chewed-up almond detritus. The animal appeared indifferent to the point of distraction, beady eyes staring far past the shelves of combat boots surrounding her and into some unknown realm. "
3400,"“Sometimes she falls asleep with her eyes open,” said Ally Burguieres, Starfish’s caretaker, to a fan."
3401,"Starfish has no tail (it was nibbled off by her littermates), but what she lacks in appendages, she makes up for in admirers: nearly a quarter-million on Facebook and Instagram combined. Here inside Junkman’s Daughter, a novelty shop in the Little Five Points neighborhood of Atlanta, a few hundred of them were patiently lined up for their shot at a celebrity encounter."
3402,"Many attendees made the same pilgrimage last year, when Starfish’s predecessor, Sesame, hosted a similar event. Sesame died in June 2018, after which Starfish inherited his Instagram — gamely, one might say. People still hunt opossums, the only marsupial native to America, and only a century ago the critters were considered dining-room delicacies, even in the White House. "
3403,"That’s not on the table for Ms. Burguieres, 36, a certified wildlife rehabilitator who shares a vegan diet with Starfish and often uses the account to promote animal rights. Her most recent efforts include a campaign to eradicate New Year’s Eve “possum drops” in North Carolina; the petition collected well over 100,000 signatures in just a few days."
3404,"Upstairs in a small loft, she and her sister Evie, 31, propped tote bags on shelves and neatly arranged opossum-themed prayer candles and charm bracelets on a card table."
3405,"Downstairs, a line that started forming nearly an hour early had serpentined past racks of fluorescent wigs and novelty socks all the way to the front door. Many attendees sported T-shirts and enamel pins bearing Sesame’s visage or their own handmade verminalia. Almost all were crowned with felt opossum ears glued to glitter headbands by the Burguieres sisters."
3406,"At the very front of the line stood Allison Sanchez, 49, and Lee Yarbrough, 47, who had arrived early, Ms. Sanchez wearing emerald green leggings screen-printed with the face of Glenda, an opossum she had nursed back to health. “It’s been really cool watching people turn around their opinion,” she said, “instead of just seeing them as creepy, hissing animals.” "
3407,"Ms. Yarbrough chimed in, matter-of-factly: “Possums are the new llamas.” She noted that llamas first seemed to capture the public’s attention a few years ago; now, she said, you can find llama merchandise at Kmart. She suspects opossums and their vermin brethren are headed in the same direction, toward mass appeal. And why not? “They’re just pointy kitties.”"
3408,"During a meet-and-greet, Starfish’s fans ascended the steps to fawn, document and broadcast on social media. Each person spent a minute or two on the couch with the animal before stopping at the thrumming merchandise table in an oxytocin daze. "
3409,"Ally Burguieres designs what’s for sale, and Evie and two other sisters, who all live in New Orleans, take turns fulfilling e-commerce orders and making sales out of three shops in the Lower Garden District and the French Quarter. Ms. Burguieres shares some proceeds with wildlife rescue organizations under the name Sesame’s Treat Fund."
3410,"Standing in line, three friends who had driven about an hour from Gainesville, Ga., breathlessly angled for a glimpse of Starfish from below. They were considering getting matching opossum tattoos afterward."
3411,"Mary Ward, 24, appreciates the opossum’s underdog status. “People are, like, horribly repelled by them, but they actually do a lot of good, and they’re cute,” she said. “And … their little hands!” "
3412,"Seth Cordell, 28, took out his phone to show off some of his favorite Instagram accounts, including ones dedicated to a pet beaver and a raccoon. Soon, everyone in the vicinity was swapping the handles of their favorite celebrity vermin."
3413,"“It’s a social movement,” said Victoria Armour, 25. She was half-joking, but she does think that these long-maligned critters appeal to the self-deprecating, vaguely misanthropic worldview she shares with many in her generation. “We can all relate to an animal who’s just focused on eating and rummaging through trash. We’re no longer liking the fluffy animals. We want the weirdos. We want the jaded ones. We want the ones who were kicked out of society.” "
3414,"Online, vermin historically considered pests are being remarketed: raccoons become “trash pandas”; opossums are “trash cats”; skunks are “fart squirrels.” Know Your Meme has an entire page dedicated to opossum subculture. "
3415,"Owners of raccoons, skunks, prairie dogs, pigeons and opossums are racking up millions of views on YouTube, amassing Instagram followings in the thousands or millions, designing and selling their own swag, and sometimes even shilling for brands."
3416,"From humanity’s perspective, these are the lowliest undesirables of the animal kingdom. They feast on the garbage we create; they invade our spaces. In their 2013 anthology of essays, the anthrozoologists Kelsi Nagy and Phillip David Johnson II called them “trash animals” — a caste of animals deemed largely worthless and vulgar. "
3417,"“Even among so-called nature and animal lovers,” the authors wrote in the book’s introduction, “the term ‘trash’ opens up a moral loophole through which slip the creatures that are deemed ugly, gross, problematic, alien, or insignificant.” "
3418,"Now, however, a quick search on Etsy for the very same term yields T-shirts that read “My Spirit Animal Is a Trash Panda” ($14.98), stickers with a crown-adorned opossum that say “Trash Queen” ($4), and sweatshirts printed with a raccoon surrounded by the phrase “Live Fast Eat Trash” ($29.45). "
3419,"“It’s Called Trash Can, Not Trash Can’t,” reads one $3.99 opossum sticker on Society6. Ally Burguieres herself has received piles of fan art, including one drawing of Sesame marrying the Babadook. “Someone commented that Sesame and the Babadook were ‘the gay icons we needed,’” she said. “I loved that.”"
3420,"Over the weekend, a Twitter thread from the Museum of English Rural Life lovingly depicting the capture and adoption of a stray bat went viral."
3421,It’s a considerable shift from cooing over cute corgis or piglets.
3422,"The first question people tend to ask Megan Borgmann about Gizmo, her 12-pound pet skunk, is the most obvious one. “Yeah, he’s de-scented,” she said. If done at an early age, Ms. Borgmann said, the procedure is about as invasive as a spay or neuter. Gizmo can’t spray anyone with that signature sulfuric cologne, but his long claws still freak people out a little."
3423,"Ms. Borgmann, who is 33 and lives outside of Indianapolis, first encountered and became infatuated with pet skunks in her former job as a vet tech. (Indiana is one of 17 states in which it is legal to keep skunks as pets.) After some research, she and her husband, Thomas, found a breeder and welcomed Gizmo into their home in July 2017."
3424,"Gizmo is “extremely affectionate and opinionated,” meaning that he loves to snuggle, but will bossily nibble Ms. Borgmann’s toes when he wants to be picked up. She trained Gizmo to use a litter box mostly, though sometimes he goes on their dog’s bed and will occasionally defecate inside a shoe in apparent spite after a nail trimming. "
3425,"Jackets, socks and dog toys have gone missing, only to be found in his “den” underneath the Borgmann marital bed, which is shared with Gizmo."
3426,"“Skunk-proofing” the house has required some redecorating. “We’ve gotten used to keeping stuff above toddler height,” she said. Ms. Borgmann buys grasshoppers and mealworms to mimic what Gizmo would eat in the wild. Sometimes, she lets him chase the grasshoppers around in the bathtub. "
3427,"Danielle Stewart, 33, lives in Wills County, Ill., with her boyfriend, two horses, a dog, a cat and a raccoon named Rocket, whom she purchased from a breeder four years ago (though, as with Ms. Borgmann, not before spending some time on a wait list). "
3428,"Like many Instagram influencers, Rocket has a knack for posing, long sharp nails and a penchant for avocados. He also has a flair for swiping things; past larcenies include hairbrushes, water bottles and, one time, a spatula, plucked from the counter as it was being used. “That was probably the highlight of his career,” Ms. Stewart said."
3429,"Petty theft is one of the many day-to-day challenges Ms. Stewart has encountered on her journey of vermin stewardship. Travel is problematic. “It’s harder for me to find somebody to watch Rocket than it is finding someone to watch my horses,” she said. Family members, like Ms. Stewart’s mother, often step in, “but every time we’ve gone on vacation, he’s had an absolute temper tantrum back home.”"
3430,"Ms. Stewart tries to use Instagram to educate her 40,000 followers about such challenges, but this too is difficult. Raccoons have only one litter per year, and last year Ms. Stewart was inundated with inquiries from internet strangers who stumbled upon a kit in the wild and “rescued” it. "
3431,"“I get DMs every spring, and I’m just like, ‘Find a rehabber. Do the right thing by this animal,’” Ms. Stewart said. “I don’t think anybody listens to me, unfortunately.”"
3432,"Removing a raccoon from the wild is not only illegal, she said, but it also may prevent the animal from having access to veterinary care, since vets won’t treat animals that lack necessary permits."
3433,"A lack of paperwork can make hormone-induced behavioral issues worse, too, as vets won't neuter or spay a permit-less raccoon. At six months, raccoons enter puberty, during which Rocket was “an absolute demon.” Those issues subsided with time because Rocket is neutered, but if they aren’t, “they just stay that way.”"
3434,"Ms. Stewart is an old hand at humans welcoming vermin into their habitats. “I know people that had raccoons 20, 30 years ago as pets,” she said. “It’s not really a new thing. It’s just new as in, everyone else is seeing it on the internet for the first time.” "
3435,"Does our newfound appreciation for the trash pet signify a sort of existential zeitgeist, a newfound empathy for the misunderstood, a mirror of the millennial condition?"
3436,"“It’s popular now because these guys are cute,” Ms. Stewart said, “and they take cute pictures.”"
3437,"Still, in the history of animal-human relationships, it’s rare to find examples of such a swift rebrand. Humans have been acquiring animals to display wealth and get attention for centuries, but often those animals are spectacles, like peacocks or pythons. "
3438,"Even today, the exotic pet trade is big business, but one that typically traffics in flashy, unfamiliar specimens like bearded dragons. For vermin enthusiasts, the appeal isn’t showiness or rarity; it may be their very banality that resonates."
3439,"Linda Kalof, a professor of sociology and animal studies scholar at Michigan State University, sees precedent in cats. For centuries, Christian cultures repudiated them as evil, until the 16th century, when cats imported to Europe from the Mediterranean became a status symbol. "
3440,"“They were considered much more beautiful than common cats, which were still considered pests,” Dr. Kalof said."
3441,"Rats, too, enjoyed a rare status upgrade in the collective cultural bestiary around the time of a savvy fellow named Jack Black, who worked in 18th century London as a rat catcher. “Eventually, Black began keeping unusually colored rats, which he decorated with ribbons and sold to women as pets,” Dr. Kalof said. "
3442,"He taught them to ride in his shirt pocket and run up and down his sleeves. Trained to do tricks and trussed up in bows (foreshadowing the pet clothing of today), the brown rat became a desirable curio among Victorian gentry. "
3443,"Two centuries later, their domesticated successors (a subspecies known as “fancy rats”) are commonly sold in pet stores and kept in homes around the world, even in New York City, whose feral population of brown rats numbers in the millions."
3444,But this permissiveness toward rodentia took decades — certainly a slower evolution than the steady uptick in interest around “pet possums” that Google Trends can trace over the last five years. 
3445,"“We have these innate predispositions to look at animals, to pick them out in our environment,” Dr. Kalof said, citing the biologist E.O. Wilson’s biophilia hypothesis, or the idea that humans are naturally inclined to seek out nature. On Instagram, we have an infinite two-dimensional zoo in the palms of our hands, where the spectacle of animalia is on display and caged behind glass 24/7."
3446,"With permits from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the United States Department of Agriculture, Ms. Borgmann has taken Gizmo to a handful of educational events and pet expositions as a sort of ambassador of the species. Like Ally Burguieres and Ms. Stewart, she feels a responsibility to teach people about the risks and regulations inherent in keeping these animals — “so it isn’t just some Joe Schmo that doesn’t know anything about husbandry keeping an animal that fell out of a tree.”"
3447,"But that IRL diplomacy isn’t without its own risks, like the threat of rabies. “If Gizmo were to bite someone, it would be reported to the health department and he would be immediately euthanized,” Ms. Borgmann said. “It does kind of hinder or change how we would interact or how he could interact with the public.”"
3448,"Online, though, Ms. Borgmann can educate and proselytize freely. Her Instagram account for Gizmo has nearly 30,000 followers and adds a few hundred each day. She senses that attitudes toward critters like Gizmo are changing thanks to online platforms, where “you’re not seeing them in your trash can, or cleaning up their mess the next morning.” "
3449,"Instead, people are learning that they have emotions, quirks, preferences. They live on the margins: weirder than dogs or cats, but too pedestrian to be prominently featured in zoos or coloring books. "
3450,"For the most part, we only talk about them when we’re complaining about them, or narcing on them to pest control companies. “You see these animals, or you’ve heard of these animals, for years, but you’ve never actually seen them, in a sense,” Ms. Borgmann said. "
3451,"Or, at least, not up close and wearing pajamas. “People think possums are ugly, but when I see Starfish, I'm like, that’s the cutest freakin’ thing I’ve ever seen.”"

3453,"It was a late-April evening in 2011 when news broke that two photographers were killed by a mortar blast in the besieged city of Misurata, one of the last anti-Qaddafi rebel strongholds of the Libyan civil war."
3454,"Calls were made. Texts were exchanged. Word spread that these two seasoned conflict photographers, Tim Hetherington and Chris Hondros, were killed in action, and their closest friends and colleagues were meeting to regroup and attempt to digest the tragic news together at a familiar spot: a small bar nestled just below the High Line on the corner of 23rd Street and 10th Avenue."
3455,"“We’re meeting at the Half King,” a text would read. Before long, the shocked and devastated had arrived to grieve at this impromptu meeting place by the hundreds. Friends and colleagues cried together. Acquaintances embraced in grief. And strangers shook hands, bonding over tragedy."
3456,"“It seemed like there were hundreds of people there, without exaggeration,” said Timothy Fadek, a New York-based photojournalist who was close with Mr. Hondros. “But when I think about who was there, I can’t even remember it. It was all such a blur. We were all just so enveloped in our grief. That was really telling about the Half King — how it organically developed into a locus for war photographers and photojournalists.”"
3457,A spotlighted portrait of Mr. Hetherington equipped with his camera and standing in front of armed Liberian rebels has since hung alone on a portion of the wall at the far corner of the bar.
3458,"The Half King, a bar and restaurant in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, has been for the better part of two decades a watering hole for writers, photographers and filmmakers. On a given afternoon, you might have seen journalists and their editors discussing projects over coffee at one of the pub’s wooden booths. You may have passed publicists sharing baskets of jalapeño poppers with prospective authors in the adjacent dining room. You may have overheard war-hardened combat photographers swapping violent scenes of faraway places over $5 happy hour draft beers along the lengthy stretch of bar top."
3459,"But after Jan. 26, the Half King, along with its in-house reading series and photography exhibits, will permanently close. With the bar’s rent having nearly tripled since it opened almost two decades ago, the market value of the neighborhood’s commercial real estate had finally caught up to the owners, and the bar, according to them, had become financially unsustainable."
3460,"“For the last few years, the only reason this place still existed is because we loved it,” said Sebastian Junger, a co-owner of the Half King, longtime war journalist and author of “The Perfect Storm.” “We wanted to take one last stand against the ‘generification’ of New York City. It finally got to the point that we were actively losing money and we just couldn’t sustain that for very long. I can’t imagine opening another bar, because we’d face the same headwinds that this one is being forced closed by.”"
3461,While not the only bar in New York City that caters to the arts — KGB Bar still hosts regular readings and bars like the Arts and Crafts Beer Parlor in Greenwich Village organize art exhibits — it filled a unique niche.
3462,"Steps away from an entrance to the High Line was the Half King. Inside was a dimly lit bar and a few wooden booths. About twice a month or more, since the bar opened, an invited author would set up shop toward the back of the bar’s spacious dining room. The doors would close, and for a couple of hours, the writer would discuss his or her most recent book with a moderator and a mixed crowd of fans, colleagues, and any unaware diners that may have found themselves present and yet to finish their meal. The event, which was held about 30 times this past year alone, became an integral part of the bar’s identity: The Half King Reading Series."
3463,"“I introduced every reading by saying, ‘There’s 10,000 different things you could do in New York any single day, and we don’t take for granted that you’ve chosen to be with us,” said Glenn Raucher, who assumed the role of curating and moderating the series a year ago."
3464,"“I wanted to make sure that the experience was organic, holistic and that everyone in the room got something from it,” said Mr. Raucher, who ordered a Widow Jane whiskey, neat, before moderating each reading. “And I sweated over time trying to make that happen. Even on the nights when we only had a few people, you could say the conversation only took on more importance.”"
3465,"In his early days of curating the series, Mr. Raucher remembered asking how much “carte blanche” he had in choosing the guests. “You have all the carte blanche you want,” Mr. Junger replied. “Just nothing too shiny.” The goal was, according to Mr. Raucher, to keep true to the ethos of the bar and present works that touched upon a wide-range of topics and issues, and more important, create a discussion that guests felt worthwhile being a part of."
3466,"Since the launching of the Reading Series, speakers have ranged from authors like Bill McKibben, the acclaimed environmentalist, to Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston, to the writer Vegas Tenold, who wrote the book “Everything You Love Will Burn,” about his time embedded in the American far right."
3467,"But beyond the readings, the Half King was a pioneer in its photography exhibits. Every six to eight weeks, fine art photographers and world-class photojournalists would showcase their work, usually with a presentation given by one of the photographers. The exhibits, since 2010, have been curated and moderated by Anna Van Lenten, among other experts. And in its early stages, James Price, a photo editor at Newsweek, was involved."
3468,"There was a show devoted to shots of Jimi Hendrix playing at Woodstock, and one of the most popular exhibits was a showcase in 2014 of melting icebergs by the photographer Camille Seaman, which included a climate change discussion with the director of the NASA Goddard Space Institute."
3469,"“We’ve shown photographs from 1917 of Lowell Thomas following Lawrence of Arabia around the Middle East,” Ms. Van Lenten recalled. “I mean, literally from when Lowell followed him around with a big box on his back and making glass plate negatives.”"
3470,"“Photographers here were just as much respected as storytellers as writers were as storytellers,” Ms. Van Lenten said. “People are drinking beer and eating sweet potato fries, while we are talking about spotlighted art. For me, that’s pushing the democratic feature of photography.”"
3471,"The bar opened in 2000. Mr. Junger, who also directed the war documentary “Restrepo” with his close friend Tim Hetherington, started the Half King with Scott Anderson, an author and longtime magazine journalist who covered war extensively, and Mr. Anderson’s wife, Nanette Burstein, an award-winning filmmaker. But the bar’s conception began sometime before 2000, on a few bar stools at Sunny’s Bar on the Red Hook waterfront."
3472,"“Let’s buy a building in Red Hook,” Mr. Junger recalled thinking. “We’ll have a bar on the first floor. We each take a floor. And we’ll have a fireman’s pole that would run down into the bar from our apartments."
3473,"“Our idea wasn’t to make money, but to pay our mortgage and break even,” Mr. Junger added. “Who wants to break even anyway? We just wanted our own bar and our own fireman’s pole.”"
3474,"A fourth partner, Jerome O’Connor, already an experienced bar owner, may have been the one to put the dream of a firefighter’s pole to rest. After he came on, the location on the West Side of Manhattan — a pretty derelict stretch of 10th Avenue back at the turn of the century — was chosen. It was remodeled entirely, much of it with lumber salvaged from a 200-year-old barn in Pennsylvania."
3475,"Despite its isolation, the Half King quickly picked up a following. Artists and gallery folk would dine in. Soccer players from Chelsea Piers leagues would swing by for drinks after matches. The tables were constantly occupied, and as intended, including by those friendly with the owners."
3476,"“I remember when I was in Darfur for The Times Magazine, and I realized the Half King started to hit,” Mr. Anderson said. “I ran into a Dutch photojournalist, and we were just hanging out and talking. I told him about owning a bar in New York and mentioned the Half King, and he goes, ‘Oh, I know the Half King.’ This place kind of became a mecca.”"
3477,"The bar had barely been open a year when the World Trade Center was attacked on Sept. 11. In the aftermath the Half King was one of the first bars open and reachable from ground zero. It drew a crowd of emergency medical workers, firefighters and police officers who were making pit stops for lunch or drinks during the cleanup. Much of the traffic heading from ground zero to the morgue uptown passed by the Half King."
3478,"“So they would all turn right here,” Mr. Anderson recalled. “It was constant. I can remember virtually every night for weeks, there would be a long line of ambulances. Especially if they would recover a fireman or policeman’s body, there would be a long motorcade of ambulances.”"
3479,"Just a couple years later, during the blackout of 2003, the Half King again kept its doors open. Inside was lit by candle, and cold food was being served before it inevitably spoiled. People stranded in the area sought respite in the bar, but rather than eating, took to drinking heavily."
3480,"While her partners were away from the city, Ms. Burstein had to manage the chaos alone. “The cash registers weren’t working and the food was going to go bad,” she said. “It could have been madness. At one point, I had to literally stand on top of the bar and shout, ‘Everybody calm down!’”"
3481,"And in 2012, Hurricane Sandy ravaged Manhattan, leaving the bar to fend for itself. It was once again without power and in the declared “dark zone,” which began at about 30th street."
3482,"“We were flooded with two feet of water,” Mr. Junger said. “I got a generator from somebody. We went outside of New York, somewhere in New Jersey, and got big jugs of gasoline. It felt like ‘Mad Max,’ and the gasoline was gold. If you had two five-gallon jugs, you were king.”"
3483,"After a major cleaning and overhaul, the bar survived, despite not having received any federal assistance, which the owners had applied for."
3484,"In the end, it wasn’t a disaster that changed the fortunes of the Half King; it was the High Line. The railbed turned pedestrian park opened in 2009 and was finally completed in 2014. During those years, commercial real estate prices rose exponentially based on the massive influx of tourists. Many art galleries in the area closed and local residents moved out. The Half King, the owners realized, had changed."
3485,"“I remember friends saying, ‘God, you guys are so lucky, you’re right there.’ But it really did change the clientele,” Mr. Anderson said. “And so we had a lot of out-of-town tourists coming here, but it stopped being a destination area for a lot of New Yorkers.”"
3486,"Despite the changes to the neighborhood, a core group of writers, journalists, photographers and war veterans have stayed loyal to the Half King."
3487,"On Sept. 11 last year, C.J. Chivers, a Marine veteran and war correspondent for The Times, read from his book “The Fighters,” which was moderated by fellow Marine turned author, Phil Klay."
3488,"“He’s a friend of the bar, so there were many people there,” said Mr. Raucher, who noted a striking number of veterans in the crowd. “There were at least 70 or 75 people in the room, and yet when they were talking,” Mr. Raucher said, “you could hear a pin drop. You could feel the electricity of how important what he was talking about was to everybody in the room.”"
3489,"For some, the bar has served as a bridge between New Yorkers and the foreign lands they visited. (The origin of the bar’s name comes from an 18th-century Seneca chief who served as an honorary spokesman between tribes and foreign armies.)"
3490,"“I had a lot of friends that, in the beginning, I had never seen outside of a war zone,” said Michael Kamber, a combat photographer for The Times and now the director of the Bronx Documentary Center. “We had only seen each other in Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia or wherever, and you could go to the Half King, and suddenly, they’d be there.”"
3491,"Mr. Kamber said that he appreciated the simplicity of the place. “It wasn’t a precious fine art space where they were selling work for thousands of dollars; it was for working photojournalists.” He had met Mr. Junger while covering the civil war in Liberia, and later worked on assignment with him for Vanity Fair, in Nigeria. A photograph from that assignment still hangs on a wall in the bar’s private room."
3492,"For nearly two decades the original Half King sign had hung above the doorway, but over time it became weathered and worn. Some time ago, Mr. Junger thought a replacement was needed. He ordered a new sign, but weeks passed, and then more weeks passed. By the time it had arrived, the decision had already been made to close the bar for good. The new sign was hung anyway."
3493,"Who is Ivo van Hove and why are theatergoers saying such (thrilling) (furious) (mystified) things about him? How did the unassuming Belgian director, who since 2001 has made the theater company Toneelgroep Amsterdam his base of operations, turn into the most important auteur on the international stage circuit — and now a three-time Broadway director?"
3494,With Mr. van Hove’s divisive production of “Network” earning more than $1 million a week on Broadway — having Bryan Cranston as your star doesn’t hurt — The New York Times gathered three writers who have followed his path for nearly two decades.
3495,"In this edited conversation, Ben Brantley, co-chief theater critic for The Times, and the critics Elisabeth Vincentelli and Jason Zinoman aim to make sense of Mr. van Hove’s ascent, from Off Broadway to a Tony Award, David Bowie to “All About Eve.” With a Broadway revival of “West Side Story” looming on the 60-year-old director’s docket, the theater editor, Scott Heller, kept them from rumbling."
3496,[Read about seven other adventurous directors.]
3497,SCOTT HELLER  How rare it is to be meeting for a three-way debate about … a theater director?
3498,"JASON ZINOMAN  A pleasure, really. And a testament to the success of Ivo van Hove."
3499,"BEN BRANTLEY  And who would have thought, when he first started his explosive demolitions of hallowed classics at New York Theater Workshop in the late 1990s, that he would become a mainstream force."
3500,"ZINOMAN I was trying to think (and maybe you can help me) of another artist who has transitioned from experimental theater to the red-hot center of Broadway with as much success. Richard Foreman was on Broadway, I believe, twice. Peter Brook has a longer résumé but hasn’t been on Broadway since 1984."
3501,HELLER Julie Taymor?
3502,"ELISABETH VINCENTELLI The only artists with this kind of crossover success are musicians or visual artists. Someone like Philip Glass, for instance. But American theater is different: the entry gate to the mainstream is guarded ferociously."
3503,"BRANTLEY And when you think of how many American avant-gardists (Peter Sellars, Robert Wilson) have had to go to Europe to experience popular acclaim, it’s all the more astonishing. His 2015 “View From the Bridge,” which turned Arthur Miller’s kitchen-sink drama into majestic tragedy, was the turning point, I suppose."
3504,"HELLER Let’s talk about the mainstream. Has van Hove tailored his aesthetic for mass consumption, or are theater audiences more primed than ever for what he has to offer? And, even before that, try to capture for us why, at his best, he excites each of you — and I promise, we’ll get to why he frustrates, too!"
3505,"VINCENTELLI I’ve seen almost all his New York shows since “A Streetcar Named Desire” in 1999, and I don’t feel his aesthetic has changed much, if at all. What has changed is the American audience’s willingness to enter his world. He’s a brilliant director of visuals, which puts him in sync with our incredibly visual culture."
3506,"BRANTLEY Agreed, Elisabeth. And the fact that he introduced video cameras into his mise en scène so early as a means of seeing, literally, different faces (and facets) of his characters certainly jibes with a screen-dominated moment in culture."
3507,"ZINOMAN He creates a kind of chaos onstage, with all the points of view. You often never know where to look."
3508,"VINCENTELLI Plenty of Broadway shows are actually very high-tech, but their use of technology tends to be kept behind the scenes. Van Hove brings the artifice to the forefront."
3509,"BRANTLEY And he does that with acting itself, making us aware of the various tricks and tropes performers use and how they manipulate that ultimate tool of acting, the human body."
3510,"HELLER You’ve all written about video as a stage tool going back decades — the Wooster Group and beyond. The same with stylized acting styles. What happens when van Hove applies these techniques to familiar texts — Shakespeare? A novel like “The Fountainhead”? And movies — so many, many movies, re-enacted onstage?"
3511,"BRANTLEY I’m glad you mentioned the Wooster Group, because they really pioneered the multicamera, multi-mic art of disorientation. Van Hove uses these things specifically to illuminate the text, I think, sometimes in rather literal-minded ways. But he also — in two of his epic examinations of corrupting tyranny, “Kings of War” and “The Damned” — allows us to see behind the scenes of the corridors of power, so we’re always aware of several levels of action happening at once."
3512,"ZINOMAN I no longer think van Hove adjusts his techniques to fit or illuminate the text so much as he shoehorns the material into his particular aesthetic. He’s become a rigid if often stunning stylist, whose longtime collaboration with the designer Jan Versweyveld is his most important partnership. One hallmark is shooting a scene on the street that is then projected in the theater. It invariably get a laugh when the audience sees New York pedestrians acting baffled by actors performing near hot dog carts. It’s the kind of cheap laugh David Letterman would get when he took cameras on the street. But the backdrop is Nazi Germany in “The Damned” and a media hellscape in “Network.” His use of media here is jarringly at odds with the content in a way I am not sure he is in control of."
3513,"BRANTLEY I do think one of his concerns is to erase borders and tear down walls, not just to rattle us with avant-garde self-consciousness, but to suggest our own kinship with the people onstage. He did this more effectively in “The Damned,” I thought, by beginning with the cast in civvies and letting the characters’ preparation for the big party that begins the show become our entry point into the story."
3514,"ZINOMAN While I think of him as more interested in form than content, he seems right now very focused on politics."
3515,"VINCENTELLI The “one size fits all” accusation isn’t entirely off-base. (It reminds me of accusations lobbed at Robert Wilson, also not off-base.) What concerns me a bit is the reliance on multimedia these days, which wasn’t always the case in van Hove’s earlier shows. I wonder if it has something to do with an overuse of films as source material. I wish he’d go back to the classics!"
3516,"BRANTLEY But he’s less a one-trick pony than his reputation would have it. Remember his viscerally immediate, relatively technology-free adaptation of Bergman’s “Scenes From a Marriage” a few years ago? He cast three different sets of performers as the same couple at different ages, and it universalized our (or at least my) identification with them. I think, oddly enough for a modernist, he’s a universalist."
3517,VINCENTELLI All the talk about multimedia obscures his amazing work with actors. The performances he gets from them can be stunning. I remember them more than the video gewgaws.
3518,HELLER Give me an example.
3519,"VINCENTELLI Toneelgroep’s Hans Kesting, strikingly physical as Richard III (“Kings of War”) and Mark Antony (“Roman Tragedies”)."
3520,"BRANTLEY How about Saoirse Ronan’s malevolent serving girl in “The Crucible”? Or Elizabeth Marvel’s flayed, viscera-exposing performances in “A Streetcar Named Desire” and “The Little Foxes”?"
3521,"ZINOMAN I’m not much of a believer that van Hove is great for actors. But Ben reminds me of another admirable trait: his gutsy conceptual flourishes. In “The Crucible” he dared to suggest that the witches might in fact be real. I had never seen this before. I didn’t find the execution of this idea to have enough conviction to completely work, but respect the attempt."
3522,"VINCENTELLI It’s hard to overestimate the impact his European upbringing has on his work on American and British classics, like “The Crucible.” He doesn’t come to them with the same baggage. This does not always entirely pan out, but when it does, the results are illuminating — “View From the Bridge” is a perfect example."
3523,"HELLER Let’s circle back to Jason’s points about van Hove’s politics. “Network” ends with a controversial flourish, in which we watch footage of presidents being inaugurated since the 1970s, culminating with Trump. The audience howls. Is this merely playing to the crowd?"
3524,"BRANTLEY Absolutely. It’s pandering and unnecessary. Many of my problems with “Network” have to do with the source material. What wowed me about the production, though, was Bryan Cranston’s stunning performance as a man made by media — and the way that guy interacted with the onstage cameras, and his own reflected images!"
3525,"VINCENTELLI I agree with Ben, that was a cheap shot."
3526,"HELLER So capture for me how or when van Hove makes richer, more bracing political arguments."
3527,"ZINOMAN He doesn’t. “Network” is not an anomaly. The only person who hammers television as much and broadly as the artists behind “Network” is Trump himself. In other hands, some of this would be played as satire, as in the original movie. But van Hove, as far as I can tell, is incapable of a sense of humor. His one mode is epic, grim, relentless tragedy."
3528,"BRANTLEY He is a tragedian, first and foremost, though I think we can make room for tragedians in a time when they’re a rare breed among directors. No, he lacks a sense of satire and even of irony, except in a cosmic sense. What I think fascinates him and what often works for me, is the idea of monolithic personalities, damned to suffocate under their own passions (or egos). That was true of Mark Strong’s amazing Eddie Carbone in “View From the Bridge” and the monarchs from “Kings of War.”"
3529,"VINCENTELLI I don’t think of him as a political director at all. Sometimes I feel he stumbles into it, but that’s not his primary or even secondary mode. What he does best is excavate new readings from plays you thought you knew — subtext from text. For instance, he had Bruce McKenzie play Stanley in “Streetcar,” an actor who’s not the beefy, hypermasculine guy people commonly associate with that character. That was revelatory to me — the shapes masculinity can take."
3530,"ZINOMAN I want to go back to the idea that his characters, as Ben puts it, are damned. I agree. And doomed. This unifies much of his work: Everything is inexorable. But there are drawbacks to this, particularly as he works with an increasing diversity of material (next up: “West Side Story”). He seems uninterested in creating suspense or generating surprise, except through visual flourishes."
3531,"BRANTLEY For me, one of his most remarkable gifts is his ability to sustain a feeling of suspense (that Götterdämmerung doom) even though you know where you’re headed. And it works with dark, monumental classics like “View” and “The Crucible.” Curiously, his one attempt at Greek tragedy that I’ve seen, an “Antigone” starring Juliette Binoche, was utterly uninvolving."
3532,"VINCENTELLI I’m fine with him always working in the same register. Are we complaining that Jerry Zaks always does comedy? He’s brilliant at it. As for gimmickiness — that criticism isn’t aimed at, say, Richard Nelson, whose Apple Family plays are just as gimmicky. But because they are in a familiar naturalistic mode, nobody notices or cares. What van Hove is doing is loosening up, if only a bit, the naturalistic grip on mainstream American stages. That’s a big deal in our world."
3533,"ZINOMAN Now that he’s getting to work on the most prominent stages of the commercial theater, I do think his range matters. We agree “View From the Bridge” was wonderful. But is he the right director for “West Side Story”? This question is no longer academic."
3534,"HELLER Part of what has gotten him these opportunities is the embrace of critics like the three of you. He has become a name, a brand of sorts, that theater fans follow. Or not. As one commenter to a Times review wrote: “Ivan Van Hooey. Enough. Please. Make him go away.”"
3535,"VINCENTELLI When you go to “The Damned” and you hear people having animated discussions — pro and con — on the street afterward, there’s something happening that I think is very exciting. People arguing over directorial choices! That is just incredible to me. I’ll forgive “Lazarus,” the Bowie show, just for that."
3536,"ZINOMAN I agree with Elisabeth that inspiring heated argument about theater directing is wonderful. But I also think we have a bias for ambition that can make us go easy on van Hove. For instance, let’s take the most provocative decision I have seen him make, the molestation scene in “The Damned.” That was a very young actor, and he lingered in that scene in a way that was meant to make us uncomfortable. To be fair to him, the scene was in the film. But theater is a different medium. And when I watched it live, I didn’t think about the decadence of Nazi Germany or the corruption of that family or any contemporary parallels. The only thing on my mind was that actor: How did they explain this scene to her? Van Hove had already shown us executions, orgies, adult bodies smeared in blood and feathers. Did we need this too? Was it worth it?"
3537,"BRANTLEY All of your concerns were certainly on my mind when I watched. I think it would require more space than we have to justify that particular choice. But you’re right, it jerked us out of the moment. I, too, found myself wondering how the young actress had been prepared for that moment."
3538,HELLER Is sex in van Hove-world simply part and parcel of the grimness that Jason talked about?
3539,"VINCENTELLI I’ve seen women take issue on social media with the way his productions can be physically taxing for actors. But from everything I’ve read, actors love working with him and the process is thorough and methodical. As for what’s onstage, I don’t find his depiction of sexuality grim. It can be brutal, manipulative, yes, but it’s also matter-of-fact in the way it looks at power relationships and how they are expressed through sex."
3540,"BRANTLEY I’m also often aware of the loneliness of the characters in his productions, even when they’re locked in carnal embrace. That was part of what was so beautiful to me about his interpretation of “Angels in America” — the hopeful futility of reaching out and touching someone. And I think he just might do well by Eve in the upcoming “All About Eve,” given his stage version of John Cassavetes’s “Opening Night.”"
3541,"HELLER The productions do keep coming. Beyond his own work, I wonder: Has he influenced other directors, or what we’re all seeing onstage?"
3542,"VINCENTELLI What he does can be expensive, and American directors with ambitions and ideas are usually short of cash. There is not the same institutional support system as in Europe or Britain."
3543,"BRANTLEY But I do think he’s opened doors for directors who take less traditionally naturalistic approaches to theater. After all, the Daniel Fish “Oklahoma!” is Broadway bound. And perhaps there’s a touch of van Hove in its use of merciless simulcast video and the witty contradiction between text and action."
3544,ZINOMAN Success doesn’t just lead to imitation. It expands the realm of the possible for producers.
3545,"NEWARK — After football practice one summer evening in 2008, a Pop Warner league coach and two of his players were driving through the Clinton Hill section of Newark when a car swerved and blocked their path. Suddenly six police officers emerged from unmarked vehicles and forced them out of their car at gunpoint."
3546,"“I felt like this: Don’t kill me, just send me to jail. Please don’t kill me,” one of the boys, Tony Ivey Jr., then 13, would later say in a videotaped interview."
3547,"The officers, members of a narcotics squad, searched the car and found nothing but football equipment. The coach had been taking the boys to get hamburgers."
3548,"The episode became known as the case of the Pop Warner Three, and it was one of more than 400 misconduct allegations cited two years later when the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey asked the Justice Department to investigate the Newark police."
3549,"Newark’s mayor, Cory Booker, had swept into office in 2006 pledging a safer city through zero tolerance on crime. And while killings actually rose in his first year, over the next three they fell to historic lows. Yet grievances against the police were piling up in the city’s black wards, with allegations of racial profiling, unlawful stops and excessive force. The A.C.L.U. and local activists pressed for reforms, complaining about pushback from Mr. Booker, whose administration was promoting the plunging homicide rate."
3550,"And when the A.C.L.U. finally went public with its plea to the Justice Department, the mayor went on WNYC radio, telling an interviewer that the petition was “one of the worst ways” to bring about meaningful change. “We don’t need people who are going to frustrate, undermine and mischaracterize our agency,” he added."
3551,"Today, the mayor turned United States senator is running for president, building his candidacy, in no small part, on a platform of criminal justice reform that places him at the forefront of shifting national thought on questions of crime and punishment. On the campaign trail, he has made passionate pleas for expunging minor drug convictions, ending private prisons and expanding re-entry programs for the formerly incarcerated. He recently introduced legislation to remove marijuana from the federal list of controlled substances and to expunge past convictions, noting the disparate arrest rates of black and white users."
3552,"In Newark a decade ago, he was a rising-star mayor with a problem. The way he handled it may offer insights into what kind of president he would be."
3553,"Suburban-raised, Stanford-educated, Mr. Booker, 49, had begun his political career in Newark by moving into decrepit public housing to earn his inner-city bona fides, a story replayed on documentary film even before his election. When he took over City Hall with his zero-tolerance vow, he was walking a tightrope: Citizens were crying out for tougher policing, yet the crime-fighting tools he employed, including stop-and-frisk searches for drugs or weapons, ran the risk of alienating the very people he was seeking to help, especially given Newark’s searing history of police brutality."
3554,"As Mr. Booker now tells it, he was both enforcer and reformer from the first, seeking to drive down crime while transforming a department crippled by scarce resources and antique equipment, and shot through with a culture of brutality protected by an intransigent police union."
3555,"But an examination of Mr. Booker’s stewardship of the police department — based on dozens of interviews with officials and activists, Booker allies and Booker critics — suggests a mayor slow to make changes, fixated on the top-line measures of crime-fighting success while at times ceding too much authority to his police director and other aides."
3556,"“He wasn’t as hands-on as I would have been, if you will, with the department,” said Ronald L. Rice, a state senator and former Newark police officer who lost to Mr. Booker in the 2006 mayoral election."
3557,"As a new mayor navigating a city with time-hardened political powers, Mr. Booker often sought to play mediator rather than impose some of the confrontational reforms — such as an independent police monitor — that would have alienated the police union."
3558,"“The police are a political force as well as a paramilitary force. And any politician that takes on the police to stop police brutality or violations of constitutional rights — they’re going to incur the wrath of the police,” said Lawrence Hamm, chairman of the People’s Organization for Progress, a progressive group that protested against the police during Mr. Booker’s mayoralty."
3559,"In a recent interview, Mr. Booker described himself as intimately involved with policing, though he framed that involvement in the sort of communal, we’re-all-in-this-together terms that suffuse his campaign arguments for himself — his omnipresence at community meetings, his contact with block leaders into the wee hours of the morning, the civilian caravans he dispatched into dangerous precincts of the city."
3560,"“I don’t know how much more hands-on you could get a mayor at that point,” he said. “This was a very big priority for me in my early days. I was just pushing like you wouldn’t believe. So I was on the streets.”"
3561,"Even so, he acknowledged that he should have more quickly reined in police abuses. He attributed that failure, in large part, to a reliance on “imperfect data, imperfect measures,” that erroneously showed complaints going down."
3562,"“Even as I had strived my entire life to be a force for equity, fairness, justice and opportunity, it was obvious that some of our police practices, on my watch, were undermining not only my own values but my life’s mission,” he wrote in his 2016 book, “United.”"
3563,"Ultimately, the Justice Department intervened at the A.C.L.U.’s request and Mr. Booker came around, calling the investigation a “win-win” for the city. That inquiry would document a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the Newark police: Three-quarters of pedestrian stops failed to meet the legal criteria, and blacks were at least 2.5 times more likely than whites to be stopped or arrested. The police department remains under a Justice Department consent decree."
3564,"Today, in the era of Black Lives Matter, these tactics and their outsize impact on minority communities have helped drive a broad reassessment of criminal justice policies. That has left many politicians with tough-on-crime histories, especially on the Democratic side of the aisle, in a potentially awkward place. For Mr. Booker, there is an extra layer."
3565,"In the interview, he recalled how, as a young black man, he had been a police target himself. He described the episode in a column written at Stanford in 1992, after Los Angeles had erupted in fire and rage over the acquittal of three police officers in the beating of Rodney King."
3566,Mr. Booker’s trial by police stop had come near the George Washington Bridge.
3567,"“Five police cars, six officers, surround my car, guns ready,” he wrote. “I sat shaking.” The officers told him he had fit the description of a car thief."
3568,"Newark’s policing problems date at least to the 1950s, when relations grew tense between the mostly white force and the city’s growing black population."
3569,"The combustible mix exploded in July 1967, after two officers arrested and beat a black cabdriver who had passed their double-parked patrol car. Four days of rioting and looting killed 26 people, injured more than 700 and left Newark a smoldering national symbol of urban violence and blight."
3570,"“I call police brutality in the city of Newark ‘Newark’s original sin,’” said Ronald C. Rice, a former councilman and the son of Mr. Booker’s opponent in the 2006 mayoral race."
3571,"After a campaign built on twin promises of safer streets and downtown renewal, Mr. Booker inherited that traumatic legacy, along with a high rate of violent crime — three times the state average — that made Newark among the most dangerous cities in America."
3572,"Cutting crime, and being seen cutting crime, became his obsession. He set up a BlackBerry alert for every shooting. He left a staff meeting to be with a 14-year-old struck by a stray bullet. He chased down a scissor-wielding bank thief in broad daylight."
3573,"He was already famous, a nationally recognized face from the Oscar-nominated documentary of his failed 2002 mayoral campaign, run during his tenancy at the notoriously troubled Brick Towers. His first year in office was chronicled in a Sundance documentary series, “Brick City,” and he became a regular presence in living rooms around the country: talking Newark reforms on Oprah’s couch, trading late-night jokes with Jay Leno and Conan O’Brien, making frequent appearances on “The Colbert Report” and “Real Time with Bill Maher.” One blogger nicknamed him “Hollywood.” Everywhere he pointed to changes in Newark as evidence that his unique brand of positive, uplifting politics could work in this hardscrabble city."
3574,"The changes were real. During his first term, homicides fell nearly 40 percent, and reports of rape, arson and auto theft saw similar declines. It was enough for Mr. Booker to grow boastful during his 2010 state-of-the-city address."
3575,"“In Newark we are driving down crime in historic proportions,” he said, turning to the police officers in attendance. “Thank you for this tremendous, unprecedented work for public safety in our city.”"
3576,"At the heart of the effort was the zero-tolerance strategy brought across the river from New York by Mr. Booker’s new police director, Garry McCarthy."
3577,"Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, New York’s police department, and Mr. McCarthy with it, had embraced what is known as “broken windows” policing. The idea was that eliminating outward signs of crime, like public drunkenness and urination, loitering, graffiti and, indeed, broken windows, would reduce more serious crimes. Mr. McCarthy was also an exponent of stop-and-frisk, which would be fiercely debated in New York."
3578,"“I will enforce all laws, from traffic laws, with people speeding down our streets, to littering laws,” Mr. Booker had proclaimed in his inaugural address."
3579,"In an interview, Mr. McCarthy said he had pitched Mr. Booker on bringing this style of policing to Newark. He told of a stop two weeks into his tenure when officers frisked a man drinking on a corner and found two guns."
3580,"“So what’s the moral of the story?” Mr. McCarthy said. “If they had forgone the opportunity to intercede in the low-level event of drinking an alcoholic beverage in public, they would not have prevented a murder likely that night, because that guy was there to take his corner back.”"
3581,"Both Mr. McCarthy and Mr. Booker have said that, even as their officers stopped people on the street, their approach was meant to be constructive. They said it was a way to improve community relations, much as Mr. McCarthy had sought to do as a commander in the drug-ridden Manhattan neighborhood of Washington Heights. In the interview, Mr. Booker also pointed out that the Newark police had long used stop-and-frisk."
3582,"Mr. Rice, the former councilman, said that while he personally opposed broken-windows and stop-and-frisk policing, he understood why many of his constituents had welcomed it."
3583,"“My ward was a residential ward, and the quality-of-life issue was the most important thing,” Mr. Rice said. “People wanted to come back home and be able to live their lives in peace. They supported stop-and-frisk. They supported being aggressive with the guys on the corners and moving them away.”"
3584,"But for many people in Newark, four decades after the riots, the tactics were akin to throwing gas on a smoldering fire."
3585,"“There was an exponential spike in stop-and-frisk, racial profiling, excessive force,” said Udi Ofer, the former executive director of the A.C.L.U. of New Jersey. “That’s what happened in Newark.”"
3586,Travis Rattray was 15 when he got caught in the dragnet in 2010. He was waiting for a friend on the friend’s porch when four officers drove up. One got out of the car and confronted him.
3587,"“I was explaining to him what I was doing, why I was out there waiting,” Mr. Rattray recalled. “I wasn’t out here selling drugs or anything.”"
3588,"The officer accused him of belligerence and smashed his head into the door, shattering the glass, then pulled him down the stairs, according to Mr. Rattray’s account. At some point, he was joined by the other officers."
3589,"“I was probably all of 110 pounds at the time, and I had two grown men trampling me with their knees while I was on the ground,” he said."
3590,"Mr. Rattray screamed for his mother, who came running from down the street to find her son handcuffed, his braces pushed through his lip."
3591,"“She had to pull braces off my lip. It was actually like stuck together,” he said. The officer faced criminal charges, but was acquitted despite a video of the beating."
3592,"“It was overzealous,” said Bishop Jethro C. James Jr., senior pastor of Paradise Baptist Church, who went on to describe “an incident I will never forget.”"
3593,"It was Mother’s Day, and the police had blocked the street near his church to investigate a shooting. “The folks couldn’t get into the parking lot of my church,” he said."
3594,"The pastor started to move the barricade. “All of a sudden, this young lady in a squad car, lights on, 10:30 in the morning, says, ‘Sir, don’t touch that barricade.’ I told her the barricade could not block my entrance, and she put her hands on her weapon. She had been trained under this zero tolerance. She didn’t look like me, but she was going to shoot a pastor in front of his church.”"
3595,"Mr. Booker, he said, later called him to apologize."
3596,"The lawyer for the Pop Warner Three, Avidan Y. Cover, now a law professor at Case Western Reserve University, said that traffic stop was a case study of the police department’s practice of stopping vehicles, despite insufficient legal justification, in neighborhoods where drug dealing was considered common. The coach and his players eventually settled a lawsuit against the city."
3597,"“They were paying their way out of these problems, but not changing police tactics,” Mr. Cover said."
3598,"As complaints mounted, the A.C.L.U. began pushing for change."
3599,"It called for dashboard cameras in police cars, but complained that the city would commit to placing them in only 12 percent of vehicles. Misconduct complaints seemed to disappear in the police bureaucracy, but when the A.C.L.U. paid to print brochures so citizens would understand the complaint process, “testers” sent to station houses couldn’t find them, although posters describing the process were visible. In a city where the police force still skewed whiter than the population, demands for an independent police monitor were ignored."
3600,"In 2009, the A.C.L.U. issued a report card, grading Mr. Booker’s police practices as a “D.”"
3601,"“Both Mayor Booker and his appointed police director, Garry McCarthy, promised the A.C.L.U.-N.J. that they would reform the city’s police practices. However, we have not seen significant improvement,” the organization said in a statement."
3602,Mr. Booker said his efforts to stem police abuses while also fighting crime required “a massive turnaround effort on every imaginable level.”
3603,"“This was like taking over a police department that was just devastated by lack of resources, lack of investment, with a lack of professionalism in terms of the way politics ruled in the department,” he said in the interview."
3604,"Officers were still using typewriters instead of computers and filing forms in triplicate. “You have to understand. We didn’t have cars. I used to joke that they were like Flintstone cars, the ones we had, with holes in the floors,” Mr. Booker said."
3605,He also had to contend with the police union.
3606,"“You fire a police officer for bad conduct, and then they force you to rehire them and you lose the court case,” Mr. Booker said. “I mean, this was a very frustrating time.”"
3607,"“At times I felt like I was caught between trying to push really fast and having a police union that pushes back on you,” he added."
3608,"In the fall of 2010, after four years of sluggish progress, the A.C.L.U. turned to the Justice Department. Its petition cited 407 allegations that it said were indicative of police misconduct, most from Mr. Booker’s time as mayor."
3609,"Since the beginning of 2008, the petition said, 51 lawsuits had been filed against the Newark police, many claiming beatings, theft, illegal searches and threats. An additional 50 people had filed notices that they planned to sue. Of 261 complaints filed with the department’s internal affairs unit, only one had been upheld."
3610,"The petition, Mr. Booker wrote in his book, “felt like a stab in the back.” In the interview with The Times, he said his public criticism of the A.C.L.U. was born of a frustration that the organization took its complaint to Washington, rather than working with him behind the scenes to address the problems."
3611,"“I felt we were working together, and that’s why I was sort of caught off guard by the actual complaint,” Mr. Booker said. “We share the same goals, ultimately.”"
3612,"He pointed to the many public safety reforms he was instituting that went beyond just the police department: “senior citizen groups working with police, a police-clergy alliance, the changes we were making in our court systems.”"
3613,"“It was very much this idea that the way we deal with these problems is build community,” he said."
3614,"But to some officials in Newark, such initiatives — and the mayor’s media-grabbing derring-do — had taken precedence over the practical details."
3615,"“His management style was in contrast with his public image that he was creating by going into a fire, by going into a shooting, or being followed by a camera,” said Augusto Amador, a member of Newark’s city council."
3616,"Mr. Booker, he said, had erred by taking the word of subordinates that things in the police department were fine. “I think that, in a sense, contrasted with the fact that the city was not being run properly, and the problems we had in the police department reflected that.”"
3617,"Mr. Ofer, the A.C.L.U. official, said he was not sure that Mr. Booker fully understood the implications of his broken-windows policy at the outset, and he credited Mr. Booker with coming around."
3618,"“It’s definitely fair to say that after the filing of the A.C.L.U. petition but before the Justice Department concluded its investigation, something clicked,” said Mr. Ofer, who is now the A.C.L.U.’s deputy national political director. “I don’t know if he was just persuaded by the petition.”"
3619,"As Mr. Booker tells it in his book, there was another factor: his chief of staff, Modia Butler, who sat him down in the mayor’s office and told him that he had grown blind to some of his constituents’ complaints."
3620,"“If I stepped out of my crime-fighting bubble and was once again just another young black guy, I would not only embrace a comprehensive investigation, I’d be demanding it,” Mr. Booker recalled Mr. Butler telling him. The message was punctuated with a blunt assessment: “I had my head up my large black posterior region.”"
3621,Mr. Butler also sold the potential Justice Department intervention as a blessing — “millions of dollars’ worth of free consulting” — for an underfunded department that had just laid off 13 percent of its force.
3622,"As he digested the A.C.L.U. complaint, Mr. Booker realized that he was missing ground-level data on the community impact of broken-windows policing in Newark."
3623,"“I had established no reliable analytics on these types of issues,” he wrote. “At a time when I was fond of using that old saying, ‘In God we trust, but everyone else bring me data,’ I was making the critical mistake of not looking at good data on police-community relations and misconduct. I was confusing activity with progress.”"
3624,"So when the Justice Department announced that it would be investigating allegations that police brutality, baseless searches, intimidation and false arrests had become commonplace in Newark, the mayor held a news conference and changed his tune."
3625,"“Please come in,” he said. “We encourage you, we’re asking you, we’re welcoming you.”"
3626,"As crime rose in his second term after controversial cuts to the police department to shore up a sagging budget, Mr. Booker endorsed a civilian review panel. In what would be his final state-of-the-city address in 2013, he conceded that he had fought with council members on creating the board, but had been won over."
3627,"“It is my vision that this citizen-led police oversight panel will help us to make Newark a model for police-community trust, respect, cooperation and, ultimately, safety,” he said."
3628,"Mr. Booker was elected to the Senate seven months later. In 2015, his successor, Ras J. Baraka, issued an executive order creating the Civilian Complaint Review Board, though the police union recently won a lawsuit stripping it of subpoena power."
3629,"In  January, the Justice Department’s independent monitor issued a status report on the police department. The reform process, it wrote, is still a work in progress: While community meetings and trainings are improving, the department’s data systems “continue to contain critical deficiencies.”"

3631,Four of the six best records in the N.B.A. belonged to Eastern Conference teams through Saturday night’s play.
3632,"The Golden State Warriors, meanwhile, reached the 41-game midpoint of the schedule on a pedestrian (for them) 54-win pace."
3633,"The first half of the regular season, in other words, has defied most preseason prognostications and requires special examination to properly sort out the 1-to-30 landscape. So it is an ideal time to reconvene what is known as the Committee (of One) and share my team-by-team progress report in the form of N.B.A. Power Rankings."
3634,"The Committee, as it has since the 2002-03 season, determines the order by weighing what is happening in the present alongside each team’s big-picture outlook — with sprinkles of subjectivity and whimsy thrown in."
3635,"What used to be a weekly endeavor for me is only a once-a-season enterprise every January now. Yet the goal, as always, is to provide a more up-to-date and detailed assessment than the standings do."
3636,(Records and statistics are current heading into Sunday’s games.)
3637,1. Toronto Raptors (32-12)
3638,"The Raptors were this season’s first 30-win team, which is impressive when Kawhi Leonard and Kyle Lowry have been in uniform together only three times in Toronto’s last 17 games. The threat of the Los Angeles Clippers signing Leonard away in free agency is all too real for every basketball-loving Canadian, but the Raptors may still assemble the best possible sales pitch: Win the post-LeBron James Eastern Conference to get to the N.B.A. finals and give Leonard ample reason to stay."
3639,2. Milwaukee Bucks (29-12)
3640,"Giannis Antetokounmpo supplanting James Harden as the league’s Most Valuable Player? Mike Budenholzer emerging from the usual deep field to win N.B.A. Coach of the Year? Milwaukee clinching the East’s No. 1 seed heading into the playoffs? Any of those would have been fairly wild claims back in September, but suddenly they all seem possible halfway through the regular-season schedule. The challenge now: Milwaukee is just beginning the toughest two months of its schedule."
3641,"3. Golden State Warriors (28-14) Maybe the Warriors do not inspire the fear they once did. Maybe their defensive woes (having slipped to 16th in defensive efficiency) are a sign of true vulnerability. Or maybe, with DeMarcus Cousins just days away from making his long-awaited debut, Golden State’s season is about to start for real. I tend to believe it is the latter, in Year 5 of a historic run, having seen firsthand how much this team can struggle with regular-season motivation."
3642,[Read: DeMarcus Cousins Eyes Return as Warriors Prepare for 5-All-Star Lineup]
3643,4. Denver Nuggets (28-13)
3644,"The regular season is just under 90 days old. The plucky Nuggets, despite numerous injuries, have held the top spot in the West — Golden State’s conference — for 44 of them. Yet you would not know it given the limited attention these guys get, as N.B.A. know-it-alls wrestle with billing Denver as a full-fledged contender — or dismissing them as a team that can only do pre-April damage. Book this either way: Nikola Jokic is a lock to snag his first All-Star berth."
3645,5. Oklahoma City (26-16)
3646,"Remember the Thunder’s 0-4 start? Neither do we. Despite the season-long absence of the ace defender Andre Roberson, Oklahoma City leads the league in defensive rating (allowing just 102.9 points per 100 possessions) and specializes in the physical style that has troubled Golden State in the past. The Thunder have undoubtedly benefited from what ranks as the league’s second-easiest schedule to date, but you would struggle to find a star duo meshing better than Russell Westbrook and Paul George."
3647,6. Houston Rockets (24-17)
3648,"Earlier this season, I responded to the Rockets’ disappointing start and Chris Paul’s ongoing hamstring issues by stopping just short of proclaiming the window to contention closed for James Harden and Co. Houston is 7-2 since Dec. 24 — with Harden averaging a mere 41.0 points (and 16.7 3-point attempts!) per game in that stretch. Write the Rockets off if you wish, but Harden’s brilliance, augmented by a resurgent Clint Capela and the newcomer Austin Rivers, should give you pause."
3649,7. Indiana Pacers (28-14)
3650,"Surprise No. 1: Only six teams in the league, according to Basketball-Reference.com’s projections, will finish the season with at least 50 wins. Surprise No. 2: Indiana is on that list, ahead of higher-profile teams like Philadelphia and Oklahoma City, despite the fact that the All-Star guard Victor Oladipo has missed 11 games with a knee problem. Coach Nate McMillan, continuity and a top-two defense have the unfashionable Pacers overachieving — again."
3651,8. San Antonio Spurs (25-19)
3652,"This season’s 11-14 start marked the first time Gregg Popovich has ever sported a sub-.500 record after 25 games and included a four-game stretch in which the Spurs unfathomably suffered three losses in excess of 30 points. The ensuing turnaround, though, has been no less remarkable. San Antonio is 14-5 and ranks No. 1 in offensive efficiency and No. 2 in defensive efficiency in that span, led by the midrange maestros DeMar DeRozan and LaMarcus Aldridge flat-out ignoring the league’s 3-point revolution."
3653,9. Boston Celtics (25-17)
3654,"The numbers continue to say that the Celtics are fine. They have a per-game average point differential (+6.4) that ranks second only to Milwaukee’s (+9.1). Boston is also one of just four teams (along with Milwaukee, Toronto and Denver) to rank in the top 10 in both offensive (ninth) and defensive (fourth) efficiency. The problem: Boston just followed up an impressive rout of Indiana with losses in Miami and Orlando that suggested yet again that things are not fine."
3655,10. Philadelphia 76ers (27-16)
3656,"For all the creative tension that has bubbled around the Sixers since they acquired Jimmy Butler on Nov. 10, they have the fourth-best overall record in that span (19-10) despite well-chronicled concerns about shooting and depth around Philadelphia’s star trio as well as the occasional squawking. Butler’s fit alongside Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons has been less than seamless, as predicted, but stockpiling as much talent as possible and then trying to solve the puzzle is the N.B.A. way."
3657,11. Utah Jazz (23-21)
3658,"The Jazz have risen to a more familiar No. 5 in defensive efficiency and contend that their road-heavy schedule, with 25 of the first 41 games away, has contributed mightily to keeping them out of the West’s top eight for much of the season. But to resemble the team most experts thought it would be, Utah needs Donovan Mitchell’s January resurgence to last, as well as a return to last season’s standards from Joe Ingles."
3659,12. Portland Trail Blazers (26-17)
3660,One of my faulty predictions from last year asserted that 2018 would be the year that the Trail Blazers finally broke up the Damian Lillard/C.J. McCollum partnership as a means to build a more balanced roster. Portland has instead clung to the hope that Jusuf Nurkic will keep inching closer to becoming the consistent third wheel it has needed for ages. It is a better team than last season’s version but only marginally — and still vulnerable to athletic opposition.
3661,13. Los Angeles Lakers (23-20)
3662,"Winning without LeBron James is hard. Who knew? The Lakers are 3-6 since James suffered a strained groin in a Christmas Day rout of Golden State. As a result, they have slid from a higher-than-expected No. 4 to an uncomfortable No. 8 in the West — thus resurrecting all the preseason questions about L.A.’s ability to make the playoffs with, shall we say, such an eclectic roster. James appears likely, at 34, to miss more than the 11 games Stephen Curry lost to a similar injury in November."
3663,14. Los Angeles Clippers (24-18)
3664,"I fear they are at high risk to slip out of the West’s top eight, but the Clippers would certainly slot in right at the top of the play-hard rankings if there were such an industry. The feisty likes of Montrezl Harrell and Patrick Beverley, flanking a better-than-ever Tobias Harris, continue to make the Clippers more bizarrely competitive than anyone imagined heading into a summer in which they appear well positioned to make the loudest free-agent noise in franchise history."
3665,15. Sacramento Kings (22-21)
3666,"A Bogdan Bogdanovic buzzer-beater to topple the Lakers on Dec. 27 hiked the fast-paced Kings’ record to 19-16 and seemed to announce the blossoming tandem of De’Aaron Fox and Buddy Hield as certifiable playoff material after a league-high 12 consecutive seasons of missing out. Sacramento then unraveled, enduring a 1-5 funk which included an embarrassing fall-from-ahead loss at Phoenix when the Suns were without Devin Booker. You cannot afford funks in the West."
3667,16. Miami Heat (21-20)
3668,"Little emanating from South Beach makes sense, whether it is Miami’s ability to play .500 basketball despite missing out on Butler via trade and having Goran Dragic healthy for just 14 games — or the fact this team is 0-3 against Atlanta. It is unclear how long it will take Miami to get back into the trade mix for a player of Butler’s caliber, but the retiring Dwyane Wade should have an opportunity to bid the game farewell from the playoff stage."
3669,17. Brooklyn Nets (21-23)
3670,"The drop-off from the East’s top five to teams trying to secure the last three playoff stops is as steep as pessimists feared. Not that the Nets intend to apologize after the barren half-decade they endured in the wake of their disastrous 2014 trade with Boston. While the Knicks tank their way to a shot at Zion Williamson, New Yorkers may get postseason games after all, thanks to success stories like Spencer Dinwiddie, D’Angelo Russell, Joe Harris and Jarrett Allen."
3671,18. New Orleans Pelicans (20-23)
3672,"It is a misnomer to say Anthony Davis has no help; Jrue Holiday, Nikola Mirotic and Julius Randle are all accomplished players. The Pelicans’ problems have been health (most notably injuries for Mirotic and the point guard Elfrid Payton) and difficulties in playing Davis, Mirotic and Randle together even when they are all available. New Orleans, as a result, is facing the biggest possible issue: Scenarios that force them to trade The Brow grow more plausible by the day."
3673,19. Washington Wizards (18-25)
3674,"Indiana has crashed the East’s upper crust to give the conference its own Fab Five, but we were not exaggerating the drop-off to the chasing pack. Look no further than the nation’s capital for proof, with the Wizards still firmly in the playoff chase despite losing John Wall to season-ending heel surgery. Recent wins over Oklahoma City, Philadelphia and Milwaukee should tell you that the Wiz are not heeding some fans’ calls to tank."
3675,20. Dallas Mavericks (20-22)
3676,"Luka Doncic has a real shot to become the first rookie to achieve All-Star status since Blake Griffin in 2011, which already makes this a more successful season in Dallas than many forecast. But the huge disparity between the Mavericks’ play at home (16-4) and on the road (4-18), Dirk Nowitzki’s health woes in what they hoped would be a heartwarming final season and J.J. Barea’s season-ending Achilles tear, have combined to snuff out some of the joy."
3677,[Read: The Mavericks’ Key to Keeping Players Fresh? Blood Samples]
3678,"21. Minnesota Timberwolves (21-22) As regular readers know, Glen Taylor’s passive ownership style is a frequent source of consternation for the Committee. But give Taylor this: Firing Tom Thibodeau when he did to replace him with the 32-year-old Ryan Saunders, bizarre as the timing seemed, meant eating an estimated $20 million left on Thibodeau’s contract. If only Taylor was that decisive back in June or July when the Wolves really needed to start dealing with Butler’s discontent."
3679,22. Charlotte Hornets (19-23)
3680,"The Michael Jordan-owned Hornets have All-Star Weekend hosting duties in a month to assure the franchise and city a measure of prominence this season. But what they, especially Jordan, really want is a playoff berth that is by no means certain given the limited scoring punch Charlotte can field beyond its do-everything guard Kemba Walker. It also does not help that the Hornets have already racked up a league-high eight costly losses in one-possession games."
3681,23. Detroit Pistons (18-23)
3682,"Since it hit my radar during an early season visit to Motown, it has been one of my favorite stats of the season: Blake Griffin leads the league in touches per game at 93.3. Nikola Jokic and Harden are the only others in 90s, but the number doubles as an illustration of the Pistons’ shortcomings as much as it spotlights Griffin’s special ability as a power player to handle the ball like a guard. He is clearly compensating for multiple holes in the roster."
3683,24. Memphis Grizzlies (19-23)
3684,"Memphis has nose-dived from a West-leading record of 12-5 on Thanksgiving, losing 18 of 25 games while the former All-Star center Marc Gasol has been submerged in a slump that has shown few signs of relenting. The fade may not only cost the Grizzlies a playoff berth but also threaten to extend Mike Conley’s career-long wait for an All-Star berth, since team success is bound to be factored in to the votes of the media panel and coaches given the glut of worthy guards in the West."
3685,25. Orlando Magic (18-24)
3686,"The Magic reeled off seven wins in a nine-game stretch in November under new coach Steve Clifford to spawn hopes that competing for a spot in the inviting lower reaches of the East’s playoff ladder was feasible. Two months later, apart from the career-best season assembled by the veteran big man Nikola Vucevic, Orlando is back on course for a ninth successive trip to the lottery and remains as desperate as Phoenix for an upgrade at point guard."
3687,26. Atlanta Hawks (13-29)
3688,"If the Hawks finish where they are as the so-called best of the worst, they will have a 10.5 percent shot at the No. 1 overall pick in June in the N.B.A.’s new lottery system, which flattens out the odds to 14 percent each for teams with the three-worst records. In the interim, Trae Young’s development is the overwhelming focus, which makes it difficult not to partake in obsessing over how Young is shooting from the field (.394) and 3-point range (.291)."
3689,27. Phoenix Suns (11-33)
3690,"Deandre Ayton’s Rookie of the Year campaign would appear to be the only pleasant diversion for one of the league’s longest-suffering fan bases amid Phoenix’s ninth straight non-playoff season, Booker’s various health woes and the owner Robert Sarver’s struggles to secure public financing for the renovation of the Suns’ downtown arena. Yet I cannot say I love Ayton’s chances after witnessing up close how badly he was outplayed by the R.O.Y. favorite Doncic last week."
3691,28. New York Knicks (10-32)
3692,Will the Knicks really hold Kristaps Porzingis out for the entire season? Will the Knicks trade Enes Kanter? Will the Knicks get lucky in the June draft? Those three questions have dominated Coach David Fizdale’s first season in New York while this franchise waits for its opportunity in July to see if it can really make the long-awaited splash in free agency that many league observers legitimately expect after two mostly hapless decades.
3693,29. Chicago Bulls (10-33)
3694,"Jim Boylen is still running some long practices, but things have mellowed (at least somewhat) between the Bulls and their feisty new coach after the initial wave of wind sprints, push-ups and disagreements. While Boylen works to secure a return next season, it is all about development for the rest of this season for the few keepers on the roster — most notably Lauri Markkanen, Zach LaVine and Wendell Carter Jr. — and finding new homes for Jabari Parker and Robin Lopez."
3695,30. Cleveland Cavaliers (8-35)
3696,"In the four years between James’s two stints with his home-state franchise, Cleveland somehow won the N.B.A. draft lottery three times: 2011 (Kyrie Irving), 2013 (Anthony Bennett) and 2014 (Andrew Wiggins). Dreams of getting lucky again and earning the right to select Zion Williamson may be the only source of comfort for Cavaliers fans to get through what surely must feel like the longest of winters watching such hopeless basketball."
3697,"New York has gone to the dogs, but the rabbits and rhinos aren’t far behind in their assault."
3698,"With little fanfare, Gillie and Marc Schattner, married Australian artists, have marshaled their brash bronze menagerie up and down Avenue of the Americas from Greenwich Village to Rockefeller Center, along Astor Place and over to Downtown Brooklyn. Their anthropomorphic statues — genteel Weimaraners, ladylike hares and gymnastic wildlife — are leaving behind indelible pawprints in the duo’s covert conquest of New York sidewalks. And in the process, the Schattners have become the most prolific creators of public art in the city’s history, to the dismay of leading art historians."
3699,"“Nothing we’ve done has ever really been planned,” Mr. Schattner, 57, said during a December Skype call from their studio in Sydney. Improvisation is a running theme for the couple, who first met on a shoot in Hong Kong (Gillie was the model and Marc the creative director) before eloping to the foothills of Mount Everest for a Hindu marriage just seven days later, jilting their respective fiancés."
3700,[Tell us how you feel about public art in your city]
3701,"Still, it’s a modest explanation for a pair who have received eight art commissions on the streets since 2016, half of them on public land. It’s an unprecedented pace for a city whose cultural programs come wrapped in streams of bureaucratic red tape. (It took Christo and Jeanne-Claude, by comparison, 30 years of efforts to win approval for “The Gates” in Central Park.) And in August, Gillie and Marc, as they are known, plan to unveil their most ambitious project yet, at Rockefeller Plaza: 10 “Statues for Equality” will depict powerful women, including Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie. The Schattners said that their project intends to highlight the gender gap in the city’s public statues, of which only 3 percent are of women."
3702,"Creating public art as a duo came years after the artists married in 1990. After living in Singapore and New York, the couple settled in Sydney, where they became weekend painters. Mr. Schattner was working in advertising, with long hair and a Porsche. Mrs. Schattner ran her own graphic design agency for 15 years. Their big break came in 2006 when they were finalists for Australia’s prestigious Archibald Prize for their portrait of former Australian Olympic swimmer John Konrads and his dog."
3703,"The Schattners are now full-time artists with a thriving studio enterprise employing 10 in the heart of Sydney’s Alexandria neighborhood, with revenues of $5 million, they said. Their daughter, Jessie, 26, a photographer, works alongside them; their son, Ben, 23, is a composer and musician. And although the Schattners still paint, they are engrossed in their bronze statuary business. Their most popular subjects are “Dogman” and “Rabbitgirl,” autobiographical ciphers that represent the couple’s personalities."
3704,"“I’m the Dogman and she’s the Rabbitgirl, and we’re riding the Vespa together,” Mr. Schattner told The Sydney Morning Herald. “I’m the person who will push to take more risks than Gillie. I’m the one who is always trying to make Dogman’s penis as big as possible.”"
3705,"Such candor has not endeared everyone to the Schattners’ art, even when it’s motivated by feel-good causes like gender equality and, in the case of the white rhinos, wildlife conservation. Gillie grew up in Africa, “watching an elephant being killed before my eyes,” she said by email. “I vowed to do everything in my power to never let that happen again.” Marc spent time in Tanzania in his early 20s studying chimps. “If we weren’t artists we would be running a conservation reserve in Africa.”"
3706,Who says they can’t do both?
3707,"Citing Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, the two define themselves as “popular artists.” “We’ve made terrible mistakes and have gone wrong in the past,” said Mrs. Schattner, 53, explaining the fresh-faced pair’s path to success. “We’ve lost money and learned from that experience, but we’ve also learned by trying things out, failing, and then trying something different.”"
3708,"“We want to make work that makes people smile,” said Mr. Schattner."
3709,"Critics are frowning, however. One of Australia’s most prominent art critics, John McDonald, called the couple’s sculptures “impossibly tedious” and “gimmicky.” New York magazine’s senior art critic, Jerry Saltz, lobbed “bathos-infused folly” at “The Last Three,” the Schattners’ depiction of endangered rhinos, arranged as a topsy-turvy column of Cirque du Soleil acrobats in Astor Place. The Schattners responded to his takedown with an open letter on their website defending kitschy art."
3710,"What has gone almost unnoticed is how the Australian couple conquered New York City by eschewing the traditional gatekeepers of public art, like the nonprofit Creative Time and Public Art Fund, in favor of some unlikely allies. Five of their commissions have come from Business Improvement Districts, or BIDs — public-private partnerships that oversee quality of life improvements and are funded primarily by assessments on property owners. From humbler beginnings as stewards of street sanitation, BIDs are evolving into cultural programmers, thanks, in part, to the pedestrianization of many New York streets in the late 2000s. While commissions by BIDs require city permits, critics point out that these new art presenters offer too few avenues for community feedback."
3711,"“This explosion of art, to my mind, is a lot of garbage,” said Michele H. Bogart, a professor of art history at Stony Brook University in New York, and the author of “Public Sculpture and the Civic Ideal in New York City, 1890-1930.” She considers the Schattners’ work “vapid” and “insignificant.”"
3712,"There are 75 BIDs across the five boroughs. The Times Square Alliance was the first BID to commission temporary public art exhibitions, but recently smaller BIDs have begun to recognize the correlation between public art and valuable foot traffic, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the alliance. “This is something happening on a huge scale, with the trimming of institutional and philanthropic funding for the arts nationwide,” he said."
3713,"Mr. Schattner, whose persuasive charm and brimming smile recall the gifted salesmanship of Jeff Koons, explained, “With public art, you find a location and go for it.” In 2016, the Australian couple approached the Dumbo, Brooklyn BID for their first project, “Paparazzi Dogs” — a pack of bronze camera-toting Dogmen exemplifying the artists’ spectacle-driven signature aesthetic. The sculpture had previously toured Melbourne, Sydney, Shanghai and Singapore. Success in Dumbo gave the Schattners experience they could leverage when courting other BIDs for commissions."
3714,"But it wasn’t their art alone that beguiled William Kelley, the Village Alliance’s executive director, when the two offered “Paparazzi Dogs” to Greenwich Village that fall. The Schattners volunteered to self-fund the project, as they have with every public art commission they’ve done in New York. Mr. Kelley said he jumped at the chance. Less than two years later, the BID would also exhibit “The Last Three” (2017), billed on the Schattners’ website as “the tallest rhino sculpture in the world.” (The 17-foot-high stack currently resides at MetroTech Commons, in Downtown Brooklyn.)"
3715,"It’s an open secret that very few public art organizations can afford what they commission. Costs are prohibitive because city officials demand work be weatherproof, graffiti-proof, damage-proof and accident-proof. Multiple permits are usually needed, and artworks must be approved by a city engineer. “The Last Three” cost $200,000, the Schattners said, which included fabrication, shipment, installation and de-installation. Even for a large BID like the Village Alliance, shouldering the costs of the single sculpture would eat 14 percent of its $1.4 million budget, which must also cover year-round expenses for street cleaning, public safety and business development for one of downtown’s busiest areas."
3716,"But art experts said the monetization of public art risks sequestering city space for only the wealthiest artists who can afford to bankroll their work — and saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of the field’s diversity. “Why is it that one pair of sculptors in a city of thousands of thoughtful artists get chosen over and over again, if not that they have accumulated a reputation that is not necessarily based on the artistic merit of their work?” Dr. Bogart said. She added, “The problem with the BIDs is that they go with what’s familiar or think is popular.”"
3717,"The boards of the BIDs that commissioned the Schattners are filled with real estate developers and business people. “It’s like asking someone who isn’t a brain surgeon to operate on a brain tumor,” said Anne Pasternak, who led Creative Time, the New York-based nonprofit, for almost 25 years before becoming director of the Brooklyn Museum. “Professional advising is critical.”"
3718,"Harriet F. Senie, a historian at the City College of New York specializing in public art, said the Schattners “would not be considered serious artists with a capital ‘A’ and yet they have eight commissions? That’s a severe imbalance.”"
3719,"Yet they could have had more. According to Mr. Tompkins, the Times Square Alliance declined multiple offers for sculptures from the Schattners. “My staff tells me they were very persistent,” he said."
3720,"Funding issues plague artists working within both the municipal and nonprofit worlds. Jennifer Lantzas, the deputy director of public art for the Department of Parks & Recreation, who worked on nearly 60 exhibitions in the last year, said that artists must often privately raise money or ask their galleries to cover part of the costs."
3721,"“When we do ask for funding from the city, they can point to a very long and healthy career of not providing funds and still getting a great program,” she added."
3722,"“Let’s just say that the budget is never enough,” said Arlene Shechet, a leading ceramics artist whose first public art exhibition, “Full Steam Ahead” is currently on view with the Madison Square Park Conservancy, a nonprofit whose commissions receives permits from the parks department."
3723,"Unwilling to go into debt herself, Ms. Shechet got creative; she entered a partnership with Kohler, which makes plumbing products, and worked for seven months at the company. She estimated that collaboration saved her $500,000 in labor and materials — all for a temporary project. (She would not reveal the exhibition’s final cost.)"
3724,"“Certainly, artists who have resources have a greater chance” making public art, Ms. Pasternak acknowledged, although she pointed out that artists without funding “make guerrilla actions all the time.” (Banksy is the best known example of this approach.)"
3725,"In 2016, the nonprofit Americans for the Arts convened its council of Public Art Network members from across the country to propose a list of 29 best practices for commissioning public art. One rule states that “any organization or entity commissioning artwork should pay artists for design proposals,” a stipulation that none of the four BIDs working with the Schattners followed."
3726,"By appealing to a BID’s bottom line, the Schattners may be setting a precedent for how BIDs work in the future, art experts say. After working with the couple, the Village Alliance created a public art program that requires artists to pay for their work’s “fabrication, installation, de-installation, and site restoration,” according to a policy memo sent to The New York Times."
3727,"Years of experience prompted the Australians to create their art loan program to woo interested organizations around the world. The artists’ website details their sculptures’ market value. They cite “Early Morning Coffee,” a 10-foot-tall sculpture of Dogman and Rabbitgirl at a Melbourne pier, as a case study of their success: one million impressions on social media, an increase in treasured foot traffic, 10,000 Instagram and Facebook posts."
3728,"RXR Realty, a private developer based in New York, is a happy customer. Michael Aisner, a vice president, says that the pair have been so “absolutely wonderful to work with” that the firm has greenlit five of their art projects over the last year, from the Financial District to Park Avenue. Come August, “Statues for Equality” will appear on its property at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, in full view of Radio City Music Hall. Mr. Aisner plans to wrap the Schattners’ female sculptures around the building’s colonnade like a gang of celebrity caryatids: a Meryl Streep here, a Michelle Obama there."
3729,"“I find art kind of off-putting and stodgy, but theirs is really friendly and engaging,” Mr. Aisner said. “You can sit down and have a coffee with their sculptures. You can’t do that with the Mona Lisa.”"
3730,"The couple says they invest returns from their studio operation into their public art commissions, breaking even. Still, the Schattners find the money to travel the world for research trips and site visits, to Kenya, India, Shanghai and New York. Their expansive online catalog provides a cushion, offering nearly 1,000 items for sale. It includes 349 sculptures, 308 paintings, 196 prints, and jewelry and scarves recycling images from their public artworks. Prices range from $5.50 for an illustrated card to $520 for a tiger painting to a life-size version of their “Vespa Riders” bronze sculpture for $60,000."
3731,"The Schattners have been known to sell public art once it leaves the streets, though they say the majority of sculptures are donated to permanent spaces. “The Last Three” is slated for the San Antonio Zoo in Texas this year after its run at MetroTech."
3732,"Dr. Bogart, whose three-decade career in public art includes a stint on the city’s Public Design Commission, sees the Australians’ self-financed investment plan as an evolution of an approach begun in the ’60s by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Responsible for monumental installations like London’s “Mastaba” (2018) floating in Hyde Park and Central Park’s critically acclaimed “The Gates” (2005), the artist-couple would spend decades fund-raising for a single project by selling smaller drawings and paintings."
3733,"The important difference between the pairs of artists, Dr. Bogart said, is the level of outreach involved. The Schattners consult with their BID partners while their predecessors consulted with entire communities. “Christo would come to everybody and do courtesy reviews with everyone,” she said."
3734,"Indeed, lack of public oversight may have fueled the Schattners’ first New York fiasco, last February. The artists approached the Chinatown Partnership BID to bring their 900-pound “Dogman With Apple” (2017) statue to a square dedicated to Chinese-American veterans. The public artwork was fast-tracked by Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the BID. But residents complained that the humanlike dog holding a red apple was “offensive in light of the long history of degrading caricatures of Chinese as dogeaters in American popular culture.” The artists were hit with a cease-and-desist petition signed by nearly 1,200 people and the project was scuttled."
3735,"The Schattners said they were blindsided by the criticism, pointing out that the sculpture had been exhibited in Shanghai previously without complaint."
3736,"“Seventy-five BIDs have sponsored some 147 artworks,” said Mr. Chen. “Some are horrible. Some are ugly. But do you hear about them? No.”"
3737,"Amy Chin, a community organizer in the neighborhood for 30 years who helped draft the petition, sees the issue differently. “Being public, art has to be responsive to its surrounding community,” she said in an interview. Ms. Chin added, “The BID had no public process installed because they thought the sculpture would be a gift to the community.”"
3738,"But is this gift actually intended for residents, or for businesses? “Merchants are bleeding,” Mr. Chen said. “Even if it was a Donald Trump sculpture, I would put it out there if it would increase foot traffic.”"
3739,"The majority of public art projects, including BID street art, must be approved by the Department of Transportation, the Parks Department, or both. These municipal agencies have boards and advisory committees that review submissions for permits, but Wendy Feuer, assistant commissioner for urban design and art at the transportation department, acknowledges that the agency had no formal art program until 2007. “We were sort of inventing it as we go,” she explained. One mission “is quite frankly to put art on the streets of New York City,” Ms. Feuer added. “While quality is important, people will always debate what’s good or bad art.” "
3740,"Tom Finkelpearl, the city’s commissioner of cultural affairs, conceded that “self-funding is an issue,” generally speaking, in the field of public art. But he added, “I don’t think the art ecosystem is broken, I think it’s quite healthy.” He pointed to his department’s $10 million commitment over the next four years for permanent public monuments, including a new statue of Shirley Chisholm in Prospect Park. They will be reviewed by a public design commission that includes artists, art historians and museum trustees."
3741,"“I haven’t seen a groundswell of opposition to what’s going on with the BIDs,” Mr. Finkelpearl said. “If I began to sense that people are upset, then we would look into it.” Such actions might include consulting the city’s Department of Small Business Services or commissioning a report."
3742,"For artists simply trying to bring joy into the streets, the Schattners feel like the art world is disproportionately set against them. “We want to put a lot more heart into public spaces, more soul and humanity,” Mr. Schattner said. Why should people be so opposed?"
3743,"“Critics don’t speak for everybody and certainly not for the populace,” he added."
3744,"“Even if we get slammed, that wouldn’t touch me if I knew that the public enjoyed it,’ Mrs. Schattner said."
3745,"Besides, the two Aussies have much more ambitious plans for New York. Recently the couple flew to Uganda to study the country’s endangered mountain gorilla population for their largest conservation sculpture yet. One day, they hope to install a gargantuan King Kong on the city’s skyline. Maybe their mega-sized ape will tower over Central Park. Maybe he’ll splay across Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Schattner, with ambition in her voice, said the sculpture is still in its early stages."
3746,“But wouldn’t it be amazing for New York to save the gorillas?”
3747,MOSCOW — A man wearing a black V-neck sweater walked up to a moody painting of a mountain range on display at the renowned Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.
3748,"He leaned forward as if to admire the artist’s brushwork. Then he reached up, lifted the painting off the wall, and sauntered out of the exhibition, swinging the painting from his right hand."
3749,"The work, titled “Ai Petri, Crimea” and painted by Arkhip Kuindzhi in 1908, had been insured for $182,000, according to a spokeswoman for the museum."
3750,"The painting, which was on loan from the Russian Museum in St. Petersburg, was not lost for long. On Monday, a day after it was taken, police recovered it undamaged in a construction site outside Moscow and arrested a 31-year-old man, according to the Russian news agency TASS."
3751,"But the brazen theft will still embarrass the Tretyakov, the museum with the most important collection of Russian art in Moscow, especially as it comes less than a year after another man attacked a revered Russian painting with a pole — piercing it in three places — after drinking vodka in the gallery’s cafe."
3752,"Zelfira Tregulova, director general of the Tretyakov, said the incident was a result of art exhibitions attracting a rougher clientele. “We’re losing the culture of visiting, of interacting with art,” she told a news conference on Monday."
3753,"The theft “is a result and consequence of today’s incredible accessibility of museums, of vast numbers of people visiting our exhibitions,” she said. “Universal accessibility increases risks.”"
3754,"Ms. Tregulova said that while some Western museums had added armed guards to exhibitions, Russia still tended to depend on grandmotherly types to keep an eye on visitors. The museum will add motion detectors and might consider inspecting departing visitors, she said."
3755,"The episode is the latest in a string of bold art thefts across Europe. Last weekend, thieves stole a door from the Bataclan concert hall in Paris that featured a mural attributed to the British street artist Banksy and thought to be a tribute to the victims of the 2015 terrorist attack at the venue."
3756,"In November, three men walked into the Dorotheum auction house in Vienna, cut a landscape painting by Renoir from its frame, and walked out. A 59-year-old Ukrainian man with a history of art theft was arrested in December over the crime, but the artwork has yet to be recovered, according to Harald Sörös, a spokesman for the Vienna police."
3757,"“It’s relatively rare to see someone go into a pretty significant gallery and just lift a painting off the wall,” James Ratcliffe, director of recoveries and general counsel at The Art Loss Register, which tracks and tries to solve art crime, said in a telephone interview of the Tretyakov theft. “There’s no doubt that security there is at a pretty low level to be able to do this without setting off an alarm, without any gallery staff stopping you, and to get out of the building too.”"
3758,"With his closely cropped haircut and black clothes, the thief appeared to many visitors to be a hip young member of the museum staff, Russian news reports said, although one visitor eventually raised the alarm. ."
3759,"“It’s amazing what you can achieve by acting confidently,” Mr. Ratcliffe said."
3760,Carlos Santana belted a walk-off solo homer with one out in the ninth inning as the Cleveland Indians beat the visiting Toronto Blue Jays 3-2 Friday.
3761,"After Jake Bauers flied out to begin the ninth inning, Santana deposited a 1-0 fastball from Joe Biagini (0-1) into the bleachers in left-center field. The blast was Santana's fifth career walk-off homer and Cleveland's first walk-off win of the season."
3762,"Kevin Plawecki launched a homer to lead off the third inning and Max Moroff had an RBI double in the fifth for the Indians. Freddy Galvis belted a two-run homer in the fifth inning for the Blue Jays, who mustered just three hits for the second straight night and have lost five of their past six games overall."
3763,Adam Cimber (1-0) picked up the win after pitching a scoreless top of the ninth.
3764,"Phillies 10, Twins 4"
3765,"Rhys Hoskins had three hits and drove in four runs, and Odubel Herrera also had three hits as host Philadelphia overcame a five-hit cycle by Minnesota's Jorge Polanco."
3766,"Polanco tripled in the first, singled in the third, lined a homer in the fifth and then doubled to left in the seventh for the 11th cycle in Twins' history and the first since Michael Cuddyer did it on May 22, 2009. Polanco also singled in the ninth to finish 5-for-5 for the second five-hit cycle in franchise history, joining Joe Cronin, who did it on Sept. 2, 1929, with the Washington Senators."
3767,"Maikel Franco doubled and drove in two runs, and Jean Segura had two hits, scored twice and also drove in a run for the Phillies, who also took advantage of nine walks and two hit batters by Minnesota pitchers."
3768,"Angels 3, Rangers 1"
3769,"Mike Trout's leadoff home run in the sixth inning snapped a tie, and two innings later he added another homer, lifting Los Angeles past Texas in Anaheim, Calif."
3770,"Trout's home runs, his third in the past two nights, marked the 15th multi-homer game of his career. The first came on a 2-0 fastball from Rangers starter Lance Lynn, who otherwise pitched a solid game. Lynn (0-1) gave up two runs on five hits in seven innings. He struck out five and walked one."
3771,Trout gave Angels closer Cody Allen a little extra cushion with his homer off Jesse Chavez in the eighth. Allen pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his first save. Angels reliever Justin Anderson (1-0) earned the victory with 1 1/3 scoreless innings.

3773,"Ryan Braun finished with four RBIs and was one of five Milwaukee batters to homer, and the Brewers held on for a win over visiting Chicago."
3774,"Hernan Perez, Yasmani Grandal, Orlando Arcia and Eric Thames also belted homers for the Brewers, who scored the first eight runs. Milwaukee increased its winning streak to six games."
3775,"Daniel Descalso, Willson Contreras and Jason Heyward homered for Chicago, which has dropped six in a row since winning its season opener. The Cubs have given up 55 runs during their skid -- an average of 9.2 runs per game."

3779,"The winning pitcher was Kevin Gausman (1-0), who made his season debut after dealing with some shoulder inflammation in spring training. He worked efficiently, throwing only 88 pitches in seven shutout innings and retiring 13 straight Marlins at one point."
3780,"Diamondbacks 15, Red Sox 8"
3781,"Ketel Marte hit two home runs, including a grand slam, and Adam Jones, Ildemaro Vargas and Alex Avila also belted homers in Arizona's win over Boston at Phoenix."
3782,Arizona thrilled its fans with five home runs in its home opener after going 3-4 in its first seven games at the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego. The Red Sox are 2-7 in their 11-game West Coast road trip to start the season.
3783,"Marte's home run in the fourth inning off Boston starter Rick Porcello (0-2) started a four-run rally, and his first career grand slam, off Brian Johnson, was part of a seven-run outburst in the sixth for the Diamondbacks."

3809,"LIVERPOOL, England — Friday morning, and Goodison Park is quiet. There are no fans milling around the streets outside, spilling out of the Winslow pub, eagerly rushing to their seats. There is no noise, no color, no riot of blue and white. There are only a handful of cars in the parking lot. It is spitting with rain."
3810,"A stadium is a home, but that is, in truth, only an occasional role. These are places that blossom only every other weekend, as Goodison will on Sunday when Liverpool arrives for the latest Merseyside Derby. For much of the rest of the time, though, a stadium is dormant, quiet: an empty, expectant shell."
3811,"The day-to-day life of a club — the parts of it that are dedicated to the business of soccer, and the parts of it dedicated to the soccer business — happens elsewhere. For Everton, the former is at Finch Farm, its training facility on the eastern fringes of Liverpool. The latter is in the Liver Buildings, on the city’s sparkling waterfront, where Everton relocated its offices last year, a new home for all those departments whose job it is to sell shirts and tickets and sponsorship deals. To most fans, a club is a team, hopefully to win games. To all owners, a club is a business, hopefully to make money."
3812,"A club is more than that, though; there is another side, one which does its work not on the field at Goodison Park or in the suite of offices in the city, but in the tight warren of terraced streets that surround the stadium, in schools across Liverpool, in some of the most underprivileged parts of Merseyside."
3813,"Across the street from Goodison Park, a group of children are playing on the Cruyff Court — a small, artificial soccer field surrounded by a metal cage, built in conjunction with the Johan Cruyff Foundation — behind Everton’s community hub. Inside, teenagers mill and mingle with teachers and coaches in Everton polo shirts."
3814,"Around the corner, in what was once a run-down working men’s club, a few dozen retirees are spending the morning cycling through their memories — of Everton, of the city — over tea and cake. Pat van den Hauwe, a tough-tackling defender who played for the team in the 1980s, is helping serve the coffee."
3815,"On Goodison Road, the club has bought three houses and converted them into drop-in centers, safe spaces for anyone who feels they need a place to go. Their doors are always open. There is always someone to talk to. There is always food in the fridge."
3816,"All clubs run outreach programs, of course, and employ staff members to work in the communities they call home. But few, if any, can match Everton’s for size and scope. The buildings that house Everton in the Community cost more than $10 million to develop; the program’s annual budget is around $4 million. It has 125 staff members and 145 volunteers. It works in more than 200 locations: schools, youth clubs, community centers."
3817,"There is barely a part of life in Liverpool — and particularly in the L4 postal code that is home to both Goodison Park and Anfield, Liverpool’s stadium, and among the most deprived areas in Britain — that the club does not touch."
3818,"It oversees more than 40 social programs, focused on issues as diffuse as mental health and serious organized crime; it reaches more than 20,000 people a year. Last year, Everton won a grant of 700,000 pounds, or about $925,000, to lead a government scheme on Merseyside to tackle gang culture. It has a presence in 150 schools. In September 2015, it became the first club to launch its own school."
3819,"Everton has, for more than a decade, styled itself as Liverpool’s People’s Club, a term popularized by David Moyes, its former manager, to distinguish it from its near neighbor. Banners bearing the phrase flutter from Goodison Park; scarves embossed with the slogan can be bought from stands around the stadium on match day."
3820,"“Our fans hold us up against that image,” Everton’s chief executive, Denise Barrett-Baxendale, said. “They expect us to live up to it. It is not a corporate social responsibility program. It is long-term, strategic work. It is a huge component of what Everton is.” So substantial, in fact, that before she was promoted to running Everton last year, Barrett-Baxendale ran not the commercial section of the club, or its merchandising arm, but its community department."
3821,"It is not just the scale of Everton’s work that marks it as different, though; it is the scope of it, too. Everton goes into areas other clubs — and other charities, even — might find “intimidating,” as Barrett-Baxendale put it. Sue Gregory, Everton in the Community’s director of youth engagement, recalls representatives of other teams marveling at the fact that Everton — in theory, just a soccer club — was prepared to work with convicted criminals, drug dealers, members of gangs. “You could see it as the club risking its brand,” she said."
3822,"Barrett-Baxendale does not. “We work on these issues because these issues exist on the streets of Merseyside,” she said. It is a view supported throughout the club. At the start of the season, Everton’s players signed a pledge that they would do their part to help with community work. A copy of it hangs on a wall in the Community’s hub. There have been times that players have had to be reminded to leave after sessions there: Tom Davies, the midfielder, once insisted he was happy to stay for as long as possible at one session because he was busy “coloring in unicorns.”"
3823,"Gregory, her staff and her volunteers know how much all of that matters. They hear all of the stories: the teenagers forced to work selling drugs for gangs to settle their parents’ debts, or chased through the streets for punishment beatings; the boys sent hundreds of miles from home as part of the “county lines” phenomenon, in which city gangs seek to control the drug market in smaller towns; the children who stock up on food at the sessions because there is not enough to eat at home."
3824,"Everton does not have a choice, in other words, but to confront those problems. Shying away from them would make all the work it does nothing but tokenism. “This is our community,” Gregory said, adding: “These are the issues our community faces. There is a culture of ‘let’s try.’”"
3825,"Wherever it can, it makes the most of the power of its crest: The white-on-blue depiction of Prince Rupert’s Tower, instantly recognizable, is part of the city’s civic scenery. It transcends tribal loyalty — many Liverpool fans are part of the Everton programs — and represents, instead, permanence."
3826,"“People trust the badge,” said Richard Kenyon, Everton in the Community’s chief executive. “They respond to it in a really powerful way. They’re drawn to it.”"
3827,"Those who would normally eschew authority figures, those who would not respond to local government or a school principal, respond to that crest. Everton, they know, is not going anywhere."
3828,"“We are a consistent presence,” Gregory said. “Kids might have a really good connection with a teacher in one year, but then they move on, and the kids lose that. We are always there, so that bond is not lost.”"
3829,"This, more than the team or the business, is what a club is, what a club can do. Not far from Goodison Park is one of Everton in the Community’s smallest projects: a little corner of scrap land that has been converted into an herb garden. The plot is little more than a postage stamp. When Everton started it, encouraging children from these streets to tend to it, some worried that it would be ruined, vandalized, maybe even in its first few days. That was months ago. It is still pristine."
3830,(Reuters) - Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola has urged Tottenham Hotspur full back Danny Rose not to let racism win by following through on his plan to walk away from football when his playing career ends.
3831,England international Rose said on Thursday that he could not wait to leave football because he had had enough of the racism in the game and was frustrated by the response of the authorities to the abuse.
3832,Rose was among several English players who were victims of offensive chanting in a Euro 2020 qualifier in Montenegro last month.
3833,"Guardiola, whose City team play Tottenham in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final on Tuesday, said Rose should stay in football and continue to fight racism from within the game. "
3834,"""The best way to fight and combat this kind of terrible situation is fighting and being there every day - and of course (Rose) is an extraordinary footballer,"" Guardiola told a news conference on Friday."
3835,"""I will tell him when I see him next Tuesday."""
3836,The chanting in Montenegro gave fresh impetus to the debate over whether the game's authorities are doing enough to tackle racism in soccer.
3837,"UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin said this month that referees should stop matches when players have been subjected to racial abuse, while Rose's England team mate Raheem Sterling called for stiffer sanctions for fans who racially abuse players."

3839,"The relentless string of teachers’ walkouts continued on Tuesday in West Virginia, where educators held the second statewide walkout in less than a year, denouncing a bill that they said was retaliatory toward educators."
3840,"Hours later, their action, which shut down schools in all but one of the state’s 55 counties, led to a victory. The State House of Delegates voted to indefinitely table the bill, which would have allowed tax dollars to pay for private school tuition and established charter schools in the state for the first time. Still, union leaders said the walkout would continue on Tuesday, to ensure Republicans in the State Senate would not attempt to revive the measure."
3841,"“Teachers have no trust,” said Jay O’Neal, a West Virginia teacher and walkout leader. “We want to make sure they don’t do something shady tomorrow morning.”"
3842,"West Virginia educators kicked off the teacher protest movement almost exactly a year ago, winning a raise from lawmakers after a nine-day walkout. This week, education unions in the state called for a walkout on Monday night and were able to immediately mobilize workers and extract concessions from lawmakers, pointing to their powerful and enduring influence as a political force — despite laws in the state that weaken labor unions."
3843,"The next battleground for educators will be in California, which is bracing for a districtwide strike in Oakland on Thursday."
3844,"The teachers’ movement started with cries for better pay and benefits for educators, and more funding for schools and classrooms. It has evolved into a revolt against the argument that has driven the bipartisan education reform agenda for the past two decades: that traditional public schools and the people who work in them are failing, and that they must be challenged by charter schools, private school vouchers, test-driven accountability and other forms of pressure to improve."
3845,Here’s the latest on the teacher walkouts:
3846,"The teacher protest movement began in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections. Educators in six conservative and swing states with weak unions — West Virginia, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina — thronged capitals to demand that politicians raise education budgets, sometimes by instituting new taxes."
3847,"Those protests won teachers a series of modest raises, but were less successful in pushing back against fiscal austerity more broadly. And though candidates who supported the walkouts won some state-level elections in November, the movement was not able to flip party control in red bastions like Arizona and West Virginia. That’s the major reason some of the same fights over local school funding, salaries and reform policies are still going on."
3848,"The movement has entered a second phase, which began at the end of last year. Teachers led by strong unions organized strikes in a series of liberal cities. Those actions took place in Chicago charter schools and in Los Angeles, Denver and now Oakland."
3849,"The protest is no longer solely against the types of policies, like tax cuts and trimming budgets, that Republicans tend to support. With teachers pushing back against charter schools and other forms of school choice and competition embraced by some Democrats, the movement has taken on new life and may continue to spread."
3850,"The bill that teachers pushed back against, championed by Republican State Senate leader Mitch Carmichael, would have established seven charter schools and 1,000 education savings accounts, which allow taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuition. It would have also given teachers and other school workers a 5 percent raise, in addition to the 5 percent raise they won with last year’s walkout."
3851,"But organizers said getting a raise was less important than taking a stance against what they call school privatization. (Charter schools are publicly funded but privately managed.) They saw the State Senate’s action as retaliatory against their movement, and expect to push for a separate teacher pay bill in the coming weeks."
3852,"Several thousand teachers in Oakland expect to strike Thursday. The district has about 36,000 students, and the teachers union is pushing back against a proposal to shut down dozens of schools that serve predominantly black and Latino students. They are also asking for a raise, more charter school accountability and more funding for guidance counselors and nurses."
3853,"The Oakland Unified School District says it may be necessary to close schools because of a budget shortfall and declining enrollment. Families are leaving Oakland for the same reason teachers are dissatisfied with their pay: the Bay Area’s staggering housing costs, driven by the growth of the technology sector and a lack of new construction."
3854,These issues are similar to those that prompted a weeklong strike in Los Angeles last month. That strike ended with the school board moving to slow the growth of the charter school sector.
3855,"Certainly — and not just among conservative budget-cutters. While many progressives applauded when some of the poorest-paid teachers in the country walked out of red-state classrooms last year, more recently, the strikes in Los Angeles and Denver revealed how deeply divisive education politics remain."
3856,"Many influential Democrats support the charter school sector and efforts to hold teachers accountable for students’ academic achievement. They see such policies as a civil rights imperative, since students of color and those from low-income families are the most likely to attend low-performing schools."
3857,They have been frustrated to see their party’s presidential hopefuls line up to state their support for striking teachers — an indication of Democrats’ leftward shift on a host of issues related to the economy and inequality.
3858,"It was just before 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Nov. 28 of last year when I walked into a bar called Paris Blues in Harlem and first met Ervin Lester Goodson, a member of the Columbia Class of 1973 profiled in my recent article about the history of affirmative action."
3859,"The bar was dark, and had an old-fashioned ambience. Mr. Goodson was the bandleader and saxophone player of the four-piece band, which had set up in a corner under a string of blue lights and a photograph of a smiling Malcolm X, opposite one of Barack Obama behind the bar. In the back, the owner Samuel Hargress, a fedora perched on his head, gazed out at the crowd through dark glasses."
3860,"His business card said the bar had been founded in 1969, the same year Les Goodson entered Columbia as part of a record-large cohort of black students."
3861,"I sat at the bar, had a beer and enjoyed the music, surrounded by neighborhood characters, foreign tourists and a few people who came for the free food."
3862,"The band was good. When the first set was over, I was tickled to hear Mr. Hargress introduce Mr. Goodson to two young men who were, Mr. Hargress said, “from Columbia.” Although Mr. Goodson had attended Columbia College decades ago, it was obviously still a strong part of his identity. I had come to the right place, and found the right person."
3863,"Mr. Goodson’s was one of many stories — some success stories, others bittersweet — that I heard while researching a project on college admissions during the early years of affirmative action."
3864,"I began the project a year ago, and worked on it off and on between other assignments. My job was not to decide whether affirmative action was a success or a failure. It was to put a human face on a policy that has dominated public discourse since at least the mid-1960s, to get beyond the rhetoric and the legal arguments."
3865,"I interviewed historians, read archival news stories and pored through college directories at the library before deciding on Columbia’s Class of 1973."
3866,"For a while, I considered writing about the Harvard/Radcliffe Class of 1977."
3867,"With that in mind, I interviewed Enrico Melson, now a doctor in Los Angeles. In the fall of 1973, his freshman year, he walked into Harvard Yard through a gate festooned with balloons and was greeted by students handing out an article about race on campus. “Everybody who’s got a big Afro gets one,” he said. It was, Dr. Melson recalled, a troubling article, by Harvard’s first African-American tenured professor, Martin Kilson, who criticized what he saw as racial separatism on campus, and asked for a reconsideration of the admissions process."
3868,"“That actually set the tone for my Harvard career,” said Dr. Melson, who had grown up poor in Compton, Calif., and was a National Merit scholar. “You don’t belong here and we don’t want you here. You only are worth staying here if you turn white and assimilate.”"
3869,"But the welcome from Harvard’s president, Derek Bok, cushioned the shock of the Kilson article. “He bangs his gavel two times and he says to us, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the top of the world,’ ” Dr. Melson recounted. “I looked around and my life changed. I saw the old-school blue bloods, the smug looks on their faces. I saw the new breed go get ’em types. I saw others who were, ‘All right, well, this is cool.’ And I saw these other kids who were scared.” He knew that he could make it."
3870,That sense of epiphany came up again and again as I searched out former Columbia students.
3871,"Gregory Peterson, one of the students I profiled — now a corporate lawyer and art collector — remembered learning to sing a Columbia fight song, “Who Owns New York?” and feeling that it was about him."
3872,"A classmate, Jeriel Heard, from Detroit, remembered the glow he felt when a dean announced that he was part of a record-large contingent of black students. “They thought we were going to be transformational in terms of the history of the college,” Mr. Heard said."
3873,"And so they were. The members of the Class of ’73 are now pushing 70 years old. Some of them had died before I tried to reach them. One early source died after I met him. It was even harder to find admissions officers from that time. I felt a sense of urgency, that this was a last chance to capture an important moment in history."
3874,"At the same time that I was working on the project, I covered a potentially landmark lawsuit accusing Harvard of discriminating against Asian-American applicants, a charge Harvard denies. In court, Harvard’s lawyers argued that the future of affirmative action was at stake."
3875,"On Saturday, soon after the affirmative action project went online, I got two emails. The first was from someone on the Asian-American side of the court dispute; the second was from someone on the Harvard side. Both of them recognized the complexity of the issues."
3876,"The market value of the industrial drone segment is likely to increase greatly, experts said."
3877,"Unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs, which are more popularly known as drones, are evolving from specialist gadgets to consumer electronics items on the one hand and industrial tools on the other."
3878,"In the process, they are spawning an industry that is promising huge revenues and global scale, redefining smart mobility and enhancing all walks of life."
3879,"In the consumer electronics sector, civilian drones are mainly used in aerial photography."
3880,"Their industrial applications are seeing huge demand in China as a range of sectors－agriculture, geological surveying and mapping, electricity, oil and petroleum pipeline inspection, transportation, construction, public security and disaster relief－are using them."
3881,"The consumer drone market took off in 2015, but grew slowly, and seemed to reach the saturation point last year. Media reports said drone makers such as EHang and Zerotech had cut jobs and other costs, and sought to diversify."
3882,"Data from the Shenzhen-based Qianzhan Industry Research Institute said the industrial drone segment is now growing rapidly, with total sales revenue in 2020 expected to reach 16.5 billion yuan ($2.5 billion)."
3883,"Experts said this segment is expected to see its market value surge in the future. Expectedly, major drone makers have ratcheted up efforts to develop a variety of drones, aspiring to take a lead amid fierce competition."
3884,"Shenzhen, Guangdong province-based DJI, which currently accounts for 70 percent of the global consumer drone market, is devoting a great deal of attention to farming sector drones."
3885,"DJI plans to further invest 10 million yuan in agricultural drones and on cultivating drone operators this year－it will open 1,000 brick-and-mortar retail stores, train over 20,000 professional drone operators and establish more than 600 training branches across the nation."
3886,"In December, it launched its latest agricultural drone, the T16, which features an upgraded loading capacity, as well as dynamic systems to increase working efficiency and accuracy."
3887,Drone operators who use such drones can spray pesticides on about 25 acres of farmland an hour.
3888,"“We don’t focus only on profits but also on training people to operate the agricultural drones in the short term, as well as helping them develop a business model, which is in accordance with our corporate culture and medium-and long-term strategies,” said Luo Zhenhua, president of DJI."
3889,The company is bullish about the prospects for agricultural drones as the demand for such gadgets is huge and the whole industry is still in exploration mode.
3890,"In November 2015, DJI launched its first agricultural drone, the MG-1, marking its diversification into the industrial segment. It unveiled an upgraded agricultural drone, the MG-1S, in 2016 and the MG-1S Advanced in 2017, with upgraded flight control system, radar and sensors."
3891,It also provided consumer loans so that buyers could afford drones; its financial services sought to enable operations and related training.
3892,"With the modernization of agriculture, the demand for advanced farming devices has been growing significantly. Qianzhan forecast that the value of the domestic agricultural drone market will exceed 12.8 billion yuan by 2021, at an annual compound growth rate of 38 percent."
3893,The government has also announced policies to promote the use of modern agricultural machinery. These include subsidies to encourage the use of drones in agriculture.
3894,"Apart from farm-sector drones, DJI has unveiled the Matrice 200 drone series, designed for professional use. Its applications are in aerial inspections and data collection from offshore oil rigs, wind turbines, power lines, telecommunication towers and bridges."
3895,"“Drones have quickly become a standard part of the enterprise toolkit for sophisticated tasks such as bridge inspections, land surveys and search-and-rescue missions,” said Paul Guo, director of Enterprise Solutions at DJI."
3896,"“Applications in industry are beneficial for DJI to improve its technology, and its success in the consumer drone market will help the company to further widen its industrial application fields,” said Pan Xuefei, a senior analyst at market research firm International Data Corp."
3897,"Xaircraft Technology Co. Ltd., a Guangzhou, Guangdong province-based company, launched its latest agricultural drones－the P20 and P30－in December. Peng Bin, CEO of Xaircraft, said China’s agricultural drone market will grow rapidly within two to three years, with the number of such drones reaching 500,000 to 1 million units."
3898,"Data from Qianzhan also showed the whole domestic civilian drone market will reach more than 96.8 billion yuan by 2023, at compound annual growth rate surpassing 60 percent."
3899,"A series of incidents involving low-flying drones in restricted areas around major Chinese airports in 2017 had led to tighter usage regulations, which had an adverse impact on product sales."
3900,"The Civil Aviation Administration of China said commercial UAVs weighing more than 250 grams had to be registered under the owner’s real name from June 1, 2017."
3901,"Other domestic drone manufacturers are investing heavily in industry drones. EHang impressed the world with its concept of a passenger drone already at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in 2016. The 184, which is the world’s first autonomous aerial vehicle, can fly for up to 30 minutes at a maximum cruising speed of 100 miles an hour, and has an average cruise speed of 62 miles an hour."
3902,"In 2017, the company announced a partnership with Dubai’s government to use its EHang 184 passenger-carrying drone in the city’s smart transportation system."
3903,"Derrick Xiong, co-founder of EHang, said with the rise in labor costs and rapid growth of smart delivery systems, EHang is poised to empower companies across industrial segments like courier services, logistics, retail and e-commerce, with its smart drones that offer safe and efficient functionality."
3904,"In 2018, it teamed up with supermarket chain Yonghui Superstores Co. in smart retail and aerial drone food delivery. With the help of drones, the delivery time was reduced from at least 30 minutes to about 15 minutes, which ensures freshness of food and efficiency in delivery."
3905,"EHang said its automatic, intelligent and networked drone technology provides an integrated drone delivery solution for Super Species, Yonghui’s fresh food store."
3906,"EHang has also partnered with the government of Shaoguan city in Guangdong province, to build a smart city with a UAV command center and systems."
3907,"Hu Huazhi, EHang’s founder and CEO, said: “In the future, the real value of UAVs will lie in intelligence, integration, digitalization and networking, which are exactly the core technical advantages of EHang.”"
3908,"Based in Guangzhou, EHang announced last year it would establish its first European research center in Lyon, France. In November, the company inked a strategic partnership with Austrian aerospace group FACC to jointly develop new solutions for autonomous flying."
3909,"Pan from IDC said the exploration of application scenarios for drone products has encountered a bottleneck, and at present, the application of industrial drones is still at an initial stage and “we still need time to see large-scale application of drones in various sectors”."
3910,"Jason Low, an analyst from market intelligence firm Canalys, said large drone companies are focusing on professional and industry-level drones, spending a large part of their investment on developing their software and hardware platforms, and in attracting developers to create apps and new use cases for their drones."

3913,The term in the travel industry is “walked.”
3914,"That’s when a hotel tells a traveler with a confirmed reservation that it does not, in fact, have an available room and instead books a room for the guest at another hotel."
3915,"“Walking” is not new. According to hotel industry experts, however, it has been on the rise as the strong economy drives up hotel occupancy rates. At the same time, hotels have been under pressure to maximize their revenues, experts say. To do that, hotels, much as airlines do, try to predict who will not show up or cancel at the last minute. Sometimes, they guess wrong."
3916,"While hotels are not under any legal obligation to the guests they walk, it is industry policy to book guests a room in a comparable property and pay for that room, according to Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University."
3917,"Still, some travelers, like Paul Lanyi, a marketing contractor from Los Angeles, argue that a free night’s stay may not be worth the hassle. Mr. Lanyi said he had a confirmed reservation at the Waterfront hotel in Oakland, Calif., a couple of years ago. But when he tried to check in close to midnight, the front desk employee told him that the property was oversold and no more rooms were available."
3918,"To make matters worse, he recalled, the employee said that he hadn’t yet been able to find alternative accommodations. Luckily, the employee was able to secure a room at a nearby hotel, but Mr. Lanyi, who was on a business trip, said he didn’t end up going to bed until 2 a.m. “I had to wake up for an 8:30 a.m. meeting,” he said. “It was not fun.”"
3919,"The hotel’s general manager, Chris Offutt, said that “during oversold situations, which are infrequent and largely due to high demand in the area, the hotel works to ensure guests are comfortably accommodated at a nearby comparable hotel.” She added, “Waterfront is committed to caring for our guests.”"
3920,"Ms. McCarthy said, “If you’re a leisure traveler, you might be O.K. staying at another property that you don’t have to pay for. But, she added, “Business travelers aren’t paying for their room anyway, so they don’t care as much.”"
3921,"While there are no official statistics on how many travelers get walked, and individual hotels are generally mum on the subject for fear of hurting their reputation and business, Bjorn Hanson, an adjunct professor at the Tisch Center of Hospitality at New York University, said a big reason walking was increasingly problematic was that hotel occupancy was at a high."
3922,"He said his research showed that 2019 was expected to have the highest hotel occupancy percentage since 1981 — more than 66 percent of the available rooms in the United States were expected to be occupied on an average night. In 2009, by comparison, 54.6 percent of rooms were occupied, according to the travel research company STR. On weekdays this year in business travel markets, Dr. Hanson said, he expected occupancy percentages in the 90s."
3923,"“In periods of high occupancy, hotels overbook more hotel rooms, which results in more guests getting walked,” Dr. Hanson said."
3924,"Walking is also growing because hotels are under increasing pressure to make as much money as they can, said Rummy Pandit, the executive director of the Lloyd D. Levenson Institute of Gaming, Hospitality and Tourism at Stockton University in New Jersey. “The supply side is growing faster than the demand side so hotels have more competition,” he said. “And they’re also getting competition from home rental companies like Airbnb.”"
3925,"STR and Tourism Economics’ forecast for this year projects a 2.3 percent increase in revenue per available room, to $87.94. This would be the lowest year-over-year percentage change in that metric since the end of the financial crisis in 2009."
3926,"“In the current climate, hotels will overbook by 10 to 15 percent of their room capacity, which will result in more guests being walked,” Dr. Pandit said. “Properties use revenue management systems that estimate no-shows and cancellations, in additional to several other parameters, but these are only estimates.”"
3927,Dr. Pandit estimated that a 500- to 700-room property is likely to walk five guests on high occupancy days.
3928,"As to determining which hotels in which city are most likely to “walk” a traveler, Dr. Pandit said: “The probability of being walked is not necessarily dependent on the size of city. It would generally depend on demand and supply of hotel rooms at any particular time, and the specific policy of the operator in terms of overbooking in order to maximize occupancy.”"
3929,"But, he added, “If you have to pick cities, I would say the chances of being walked are greater in large cities with higher number of year-round peak occupancy days.”"
3930,Some hotels try to assuage guests they have “walked” by giving them gifts.
3931,"Katie Perkins, who is a front officer manager at the Four Seasons Hotel Westlake Village near Los Angeles, said that when she had to walk a business traveler, she tried to offer something meaningful. “Sometimes, it’s a massage, or, if they want to come back on a personal trip, I offer them an upgrade to a suite,” she said. “The next day, I call them to apologize again.”"
3932,Ms. Perkins added some companies that have a contract with the hotel for a negotiated rate include a clause that states that none of its employees can be walked.
3933,"How properties decide who gets walked depends on a number of factors. Ms. McCarthy said that men have a higher chance of being walked than women, solo travelers are more at risk than a couple or a family, and travelers with a reservation for one night have a higher chance than those staying multiple nights."
3934,Travelers checking in late in the day also have a greater likelihood of being walked.
3935,"Dr. Hanson advised guests with confirmed reservations to arrive at their hotel at or soon after the official check-in time when more rooms are available. “If you’re going to be getting there late, call the property, reconfirm your reservation with a live person whose name you get and tell them when you’ll be arriving,” he said."
3936,"Being part of a hotel’s loyalty program, if it offers one, can also protect travelers, and if they are walked, the loyalty program may give them added benefits."
3937,"Marriott International, for example, has six tiers as part of its Marriott Bonvoy loyalty program and offers a cash gift card and loyalty points to walked members at all tiers, except the entry level basic. The amounts vary based on the Marriott brand. Walked travelers who are part of the second tier, called Silver Elite, with a reservation at a JW Marriott or W Hotels receive $200 and 90,000 points. If they’re staying at a Ritz-Carlton or St. Regis, they get $200 and 140,000 points."
3938,"And, according to a Marriott spokesman, John Wolf, the company always tries to ensure a member’s reservation is honored at the hotel of their choice."
3939,"Nonetheless, being a member of Marriott’s top tier didn’t help Zach Honig, the editor at large of the travel site the Points Guy. Mr. Honig said he was walked in October when he checked in for a two-night stay at the Courtyard Santa Monica. “The hotel was willing to put me up at a Le Meridien for one night but wanted me to come back there for the second night, which would have been a pain,” he said."
3940,"Following a lengthy back-and-forth with the front desk employee, Mr. Honig managed to get the property to approve a second night’s stay at Le Meridien. “It took a lot of my time and energy, but I have to admit, the compensation Marriott offered helped make the situation better,” he said."
3941,By Sebastian Modak
3942,"Our columnist, Sebastian Modak, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2019 list. He arrived in New York City from Williamsburg, Va., where the complexities of American history are on full display."
3943,"Give yourself more than eight hours to walk the length of Manhattan. I learned this on a recent crisp Sunday when my partner, Maggie, and I set off on a hike from Battery Park on Manhattan’s southern tip, with the goal of reaching Fort Tryon Park, about 12 miles away, by sunset. I’d write about the walk, I thought, and take some photos along the way that showed all the different New Yorks that exist within just one of the city’s five boroughs."
3944,"A little stunty? Sure. But the inclusion of New York City, a place where I’ve lived for five years, on the 52 Places to Go list posed a number of challenges. For starters, there was the timing. New York was my last stop in the United States for a while, before I headed off to the Middle East and beyond, and unfortunately I would have to miss some of the events that put New York City on the list — namely, World Pride, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising. But I knew the biggest struggle would be balancing recovery — I’ve been averaging five hours of sleep a night on this trip — with reconnaissance. A hike across Manhattan felt like one way to neatly package a narrative (even if “Broad City” did it first) while doing something I’ve always thought of doing, but never made time for. "
3945,"Having grown up on the move, feeling like a visitor is, for me, status quo, even in my current home. Still, approaching the city you live in as a tourist allows you to see the place in a new light — and I don’t mean finally making it to the American Museum of Natural History or Katz’s Deli. I mean the little things: How, when the sun is high, the shadow that consumes Trinity Church is the perfect respite for eyes strained by the glare of the Financial District’s office towers right behind it. Or how the food cart proprietors, fishing for hungry customers, often tie a single pretzel from their yellow-and-blue Sabrett signs."
3946,"Spending more than a few minutes in Washington Square Park, or even Union Square, can reveal only-in-New York moments, like watching two passers-by step into a bucket drummer’s busking session and spend the next 30 minutes freestyle rap-battling, or seeing a man with a snow-white beard on a lawn chair, holding an oversize sheet of aluminum foil to maximize a tan — in March."
3947,"After two solid months of traveling, in which I was constantly soaking in every detail around me, I found myself hyperaware of changes in New York. Why, for instance, had the arcade machine at my favorite bar, the divey Sophie’s in Alphabet City, been swapped out? How dare they make such a momentous decision in my absence? "
3948,"Nowhere was change more shocking than at Hudson Yards, the long-planned $25 billion development on Manhattan’s West Side that was seemingly conjured out of the ground in the months I’d been gone. I arrived in time for the opening of the Shops, the development’s ritzy indoor mall. The event was bizarre, and not just because I had come straight from Colonial Williamsburg. Servers passed out flutes of Champagne to the overdressed crowd while taiko drummers in branded happi coats put on a show in front of Uniqlo. Break dancers took over one elevated hallway and lines formed to enter Snark Park, the immersive art space that was promoting a collaboration with a “cereal-infused ice cream” brand, as one of the employees told me. I didn’t inquire further."
3949,"I needed another chance to see Hudson Yards for it to make sense. So I returned during my walk through Manhattan. The High Line, the elevated park that winds past the midsections of Chelsea’s luxury apartment buildings, was even more packed than usual, given its new role as a conduit into Hudson Yards. A small courtyard separates the mall from the development’s centerpiece, a sculpture for now known as “Vessel,” a $200 million gleaming stairway to nowhere that you need a free, but timed, ticket to climb. Entering the mall felt like a respite, if only for a second, from the selfie-stick-waving hordes in front of the installation."
3950,"“I’m from New Jersey so I know shopping malls,” Maggie said, as we tried to keep track of each other in a crowd pressed onward, like automatons, by the blaring techno music. “I’d say this is definitely one of the clubbier ones I’ve been to.”"
3951,"My parents live in Dubai and the only way I’ve learned to like that superlative-obsessed, chrome-and-glass city is by gravitating toward the polyglot migrant communities that built the city, and the scant traces of the pearl-diving beginnings that haven’t been swallowed up by the drive to build, build, build. To me, Hudson Yards is New York City trying to be the Dubai I’ve always avoided. It’s a vision of the future seven years ago, when ground was broken, that already felt outdated on opening day."
3952,"If there’s a silver lining, it’s that Hudson Yards made me feel more like a tourist in my own city. Getting back on the Hudson River Greenway was a relief, and entering Central Park made me ecstatic. By the time the sun started setting, we had only reached Harlem, conveniently where our apartment is. Strolling through Hamilton Heights, where dusk looks like light streaming through a million coffee filters, I took comfort in the familiarity of it all. We called it a day over subtly spiced stews at Tsion Cafe, a neighborhood favorite. "
3953,"I can already hear the seasoned travelers scoffing at how late to the game I am, but Holy Merino wool! On the first leg of my trip, I had brought a couple of shirts and socks made out of the miracle wool to try it out on the road. But I took the opportunity of being back to stock up on the stuff at REI. Merino wool really does keeps you warm when it’s cold out and cools you down when it’s hot. Best of all, the wool has anti-bacterial properties that keep your clothes smelling fresh. "
3954,"Knowing the ice caves of Ontario were on my itinerary I had packed serious performance gear, including snow boots that took up a third of my suitcase. Those were left behind this time, not just because I won’t be dealing with such harsh weather, but because I’ve realized it’s not worth bringing anything that I’m only going to use once or twice. "
3955,"When traveling alone, your cellphone can become a lifeline. There’s no such thing as too many portable power banks. I’m now traveling with three. I may not have been organized enough to keep two fully charged, but I think I’ll have better luck with three semi-charged. "
3956,"The impressions that stayed with me as I packed up to leave again weren’t about Hudson Yards or anything new. I was just happy that some of my favorite meals — the anesthetizing bowls of Sichuan-spiced meats and vegetables at Málà Project; the bang-for-your-buck pan-Indian fare at the West Village’s Mint Masala; the perfect whole fish at one of Harlem’s West African outposts, La Savane — were still good. I was relieved that my cat climbed into my lap, for the second time ever, soon after I sat down on the evening I arrived. And then did so a third, fourth, fifth and sixth time over the next two weeks. I found myself looking for reasons to stay in my apartment, or at least in my neighborhood. I had to rest up, organize my files, catch up with expenses, call my mom. With the exception of a quick trip to the Bronx for lunch, I didn’t leave the island of Manhattan — a travesty for a tourist, as any New Yorker would assert."
3957,"It had been less than two months since I had left New York for the 52 Places adventure. In the past I’ve repeatedly found myself away from the city, as a reporter or as a touring musician — it often felt like I was just pretending to live here. This time felt different. All of a sudden, this megacity, one that can be so elusive to so many — even me — felt a whole lot like home."

3959,"• President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea, failed to reach a deal on denuclearization during their second summit meeting in eight months. “Sometimes you have to walk,” Mr. Trump said after the talks broke down."
3960,• Mr. Trump said Mr. Kim was willing to close some but not all nuclear sites in North Korea in exchange for the lifting of all international sanctions.
3961,"• The leaders were scheduled to have lunch together and sign a joint agreement, but those plans were abruptly called off. After a news conference, Mr. Trump boarded Air Force One to return to Washington."
3962,[Read about why the talks collapsed.  Learn who was at the negotiating table. And see the summit meeting unfold in pictures.]
3963,"A day that started with the promise of a denuclearization deal and talk of an official declaration to end the Korean War ended abruptly, without an accord."
3964,"“Sometimes you have to walk,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference after the talks fell apart."
3965,"[When it came to negotiating, the North Koreans were more experienced. Here’s a look at who was on either side of the table.]"
3966,"Mr. Trump said the major sticking point was the lifting of economic sanctions against North Korea. Mr. Kim, the president said, wanted sanctions fully lifted in exchange for dismantling some — but not all — of the North’s nuclear weapons program."
3967,"“Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn’t do that,” Mr. Trump said. “They were willing to denuke a large portion of the areas that we want, but we couldn’t give up all of the sanctions for that.”"
3968,"Lifting punishing international sanctions that limit North Korea’s ability to import oil, and to export lucrative goods including coal and seafood, is the North’s primary goal in any negotiation. As a result, the United States sees the sanctions as a critical bargaining chip."
3969,"Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim discussed the closure of North Korea’s main nuclear complex in Yongbyon, and Mr. Kim expressed a willingness to allow the facility to be dismantled."
3970,"“He would do that but he wants the sanctions for that,” Mr. Trump said. “As you know, there’s plenty left after that. I just felt it wasn’t good.”"
3971,"Yongbyon is the North’s largest facility, but not its only one. At his news conference, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country had another uranium enrichment plant. North Korea has long been suspected of having uranium enrichment capabilities beyond Yongbyon."
3972,"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan fully backed President Trump’s decision to walk from his summit meeting with Kim Jong-un, North Korea’s leader, without an agreement, while South Korea called the move regrettable."
3973,"“With the strong determination to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, President Trump did not make an easy compromise,” Mr. Abe said, speaking to reporters after a phone call with the American president. “I fully support Mr. Trump’s decision.”"
3974,"Mr. Abe reiterated his desire to meet the North Korean leader and discuss the issue of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korea’s agents decades ago. But he has been hawkish on North Korea, championing strong enforcement of sanctions against Pyongyang."
3975,"In Seoul, the government of President Moon Jae-in, an outspoken supporter of engagement with North Korea, expressed dismay at the breakdown of the Hanoi talks. Mr. Moon spoke with Mr. Trump after the meeting ended."
3976,"“It is regrettable that they could not reach a complete agreement,” said Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman of Mr. Moon. “But it also seems clear that both sides have made more significant progress than ever.”"
3977,"Although the meeting failed to produce an agreement, it has helped Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump “expand the width and depth of understanding what each side needed,” Mr. Moon said. “The prospects for a next meeting are bright given President Trump’s will to continue dialogue and his optimistic views.”"
3978,"China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, struck a cautious tone at a meeting in Beijing with a senior North Korean diplomat. Chinese state television reported that Mr. Wang said that while difficulties in Trump-Kim talks were unavoidable, China hoped that the dialogue would continue."

3980,"Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim discussed the case of Otto Warmbier, the American college student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea."
3981,"The president defended Mr. Kim, saying he believed the North Korean leader was unaware of the gravity of Mr. Warmbier’s medical condition."
3982,"“He tells me that he didn’t know about it, and I will take him at his word,” Mr. Trump said on Thursday."
3983,"Mr. Warmbier, a student at the University of Virginia, was arrested while on a trip to North Korea for stealing a propaganda poster. In 2016 he was sentenced to 15 years hard labor."
3984,"More than a year later he was released and returned to the United States gravely ill, with doctors saying he suffered a catastrophic brain injury. He died in June 2017."
3985,"Mr. Trump has taken credit for the return of Mr. Warmbier and a handful of other Americans held in North Korea. In the past, the president has pointed to Mr. Warmbier’s injuries as an example of the Kim regime’s brutality."
3986,"But on Thursday, Mr. Trump refused to place any blame on Mr. Kim."
3987,"“I don’t believe that he would have allowed that to happen, it just wasn’t to his advantage to happen,” Mr. Trump said. “Those prisons are rough, they’re rough places, and bad things happened. But I really don’t believe that he, I don’t believe that he knew about it.”"

3989,Thursday began without any outward sign that talks were about to break down.
3990,"President Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, complimented each other in opening remarks at the Metropole Hotel in Hanoi. Neither predicted any imminent breakthroughs, but their comments did not suggest a summit meeting that would end early, abruptly, and without anything to show for it."
3991,"“I can’t speak necessarily for today, but I can say a little bit longer term and over a period of time I know we are going to have a fantastic success with respect to chairman Kim and North Korea,” Mr. he said."
3992,"Mr. Kim was more circumspect. “It’s too early to say,” he said. “I would not say I’m pessimistic.”"
3993,"The two went into a meeting with only their translators present, and were later joined by other officials."
3994,The first public sign of trouble was the cancellation of a working lunch. Then the planned signing of a joint agreement was scratched. A closing news conference that was scheduled for 4 p.m. was moved to 2 p.m.
3995,"The White House officially acknowledged that the meeting had ended without a formal agreement, but offered no explanation, leaving that to the president at his news conference."
3996,"First came word that Mr. Kim and Mr. Trump’s lunch would be canceled. Then the scheduled signing of a joint agreement was called off. By midday Thursday, it was clear the talks had collapsed."
3997,Confusion reigned in the international media center. What was happening? Hundreds of reporters frantically looked for an explanation or a statement from the White House.
3998,"Once Mr. Trump’s motorcade left the Metropole Hotel, it was clear that the deal was off."
3999,"At the press center, mild mayhem broke out when reporters from a Japanese news network started interviewing a reporter from Voice of America, a news agency funded by the United States government."
4000,"A crowd of journalists swarmed the V.O.A. reporter, assuming that she was an official government spokesman. At one point, a reporter who joined the scrum realized that it was just a case of journalists interviewing each other."
4001,"“You’re just journalists?” she said in disgust. “Oh my god, why did I run over here?” And stormed off."

4003,Mr. Kim said that his presence at the summit meeting was a sign of his willingness to denuclearize his country.
4004,"“If I’m not willing to do that, I won’t be here right now,” he said in response to a reporter’s question on Thursday morning."
4005,"“That might be the best answer you’ve ever heard,” Mr. Trump replied."
4006,"“We’ve had very, very productive discussions,” Mr. Trump said before the talks would collapse later that afternoon. “The relationship is as good as it’s ever been, I think better.”"
4007,"When a reporter asked Mr. Kim whether he was willing to take concrete steps toward denuclearization, he said, “That’s what we are discussing right now.”"
4008,"After Mr. Kim said the United States would be welcome to open a liaison office in North Korea, Mr. Trump signaled his interest in the idea. “I actually think it’s a good idea, both ways,” Mr. Trump said."
4009,"The two countries do not have formal diplomatic relations. United States consular interests in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, are represented by Sweden. North Korea likewise has no embassy in Washington, but its mission at the United Nations in New York is often a channel for diplomacy with the United States."

4011,"WASHINGTON — If Zack Wheeler, the Mets’ third starter, needed any reminder that his 10-1 record during the second half of last season meant nothing in the new campaign, the Nationals were happy to provide one on Sunday."
4012,"With the Mets on the verge of collecting a series sweep, Wheeler surrendered a single on his first pitch. By the bottom of the third inning, he gave up a three-run homer to Nationals shortstop Trea Turner. Wheeler, whose fastball topped out at 98 miles per hour, was removed from the game after the fifth, having given up four earned runs."
4013,"“I think I just got a little fastball-happy,” he said."
4014,"It was a mistake that Mets reliever Justin Wilson repeated in the ninth. While the Mets had rallied to tie the game at 5-5 in the eighth, it was another fastball, this time from Wilson in a full count, that Turner rerouted into the stands for a walk-off win, 6-5."
4015,The Mets (2-1) lost the game but won the series. Manager Mickey Callaway maintained that his team’s late rally left the Nationals (1-2) a message.
4016,"“They have no doubt that no matter what the score is, we’re not going to lay down,” Callaway said."
4017,"In defeat, the Mets posted 13 hits, but they left nine runners on base."
4018,"It took until the eighth for Mets to find a rhythm on offense, with a series of productive singles. To start the rally, Robinson Cano, Michael Conforto and Amed Rosario all singled, with the only out coming on a pop-out by J. D. Davis."
4019,"Rosario’s single drove in Cano, Wilson Ramos, pinch-hitting for Tomas Nido, drove in Conforto, and Juan Lagares drove in Rosario. In all, the Mets had five singles in the inning."
4020,"“Everybody’s contributing, and we feel that’s going to continue to happen,” Callaway said."
4021,"One Met remained hot at the plate throughout. For the second straight day, Pete Alonso, the rookie first baseman, singled in his first at bat and doubled in his second. He also collected another walk and drove in a run, further establishing himself as the No. 2 hitter in a lineup that lacked power and consistency last season."
4022,"“This guy is playing with everything he’s got,” Callaway said."
4023,"Plenty of Mets found a way to affect the game. If it wasn’t Davis striding in to second for a stand-up double, it was center fielder Keon Broxton stealing two bases. Left fielder Brandon Nimmo collected his first hit after starting the season 0 for 7."
4024,"There were changes to the lineup before the game, too. Jeff McNeil, who was 4 for 5 in Saturday’s win, did not start. Ramos, an All Star catcher, was also on the bench. His absence was noticeable in the first inning when his replacement, Nido, was charged with an error on a throw to second."
4025,The Mets made mistakes they avoided committing in their first two games.
4026,"Wheeler and Wilson insisted they learned from theirs, and vowed not to repeat them."
4027,"“I’m just beating myself up for falling into that little groove of fastball happiness,” Wheeler said."

4029,"The horseman of Central Park stopped on a grassy plateau to survey the terrain, from the North Meadow to his left, the Great Lawn ahead and Strawberry Fields due south."
4030,"As cyclists and joggers plied the winding park drives, a nonstop stream of tourists approached the hard-to-miss horseman. They sought directions or a photograph of him and Trooper, his stately horse."
4031,The horseman’s name is Detective John Reilly and for the past decade he and Trooper have had the rare distinction of being the New York Police Department’s only mounted team dedicated to patrolling Central Park.
4032,"“When people ask me, ‘How come you don’t have a partner?’ I say, ‘I do — he’s right here,’” he said, gesturing toward Trooper and the oversize police shield strapped to his broad chest."
4033,But their days of patrolling the urban range are ending.
4034,"Detective Reilly is retiring this week — and not by choice. On Thursday, he turns 63, the department’s mandatory retirement age."
4035,"Trooper, 15, is also being put out to pasture, having logged 10 years on patrol, the typical limit for a city police horse."
4036,"Many officers leave the job after 20 years, when they become eligible for a pension. Very few stay long enough to “age out” — department parlance for hitting 63."
4037,"But Detective Reilly has always wanted to keep working, especially in recent years with a job that is literally a walk in the park as a “10-foot cop,” as mounted officers are sometimes called. (And one that has not required the detective to make many arrests or ever draw his gun.)"
4038,"“I love it,” he said. “Where else can you get paid to ride a horse in Central Park?”"
4039,"And so, he and Trooper have patrolled the park year-round Sunday through Thursday, rain or shine, for up to six hours a day."
4040,"“He’s put up with my singing and my bad jokes,” Detective Reilly said of Trooper."
4041,"No singular officer, or horse, will replace them, said Deputy Inspector Barry Gelbman, commander of the department’s mounted unit. Instead, the Central Park spot will likely be shared among several mounted officers, he said, so the odds are slim that another mounted officer will replicate Detective Reilly’s decade-long run."
4042,"In his 34 years with the department, Detective Reilly has become one of its most visible members, mostly because of his last 24 years with its mounted unit, an unusually long tenure."
4043,"Trooper, who is part Belgian, part quarter horse, was Detective Reilly’s favorite and longest-running of the six department horses he was paired with over the years, he said."
4044,He even inquired about adopting Trooper.
4045,"“I’d like to keep him myself,” he said, before conceding that, living in an apartment in Glendale, Queens, he is really not in a position to own a horse."
4046,"He is comforted by the knowledge that the department’s police horses are treated well, receiving lifelong care on farms outside the city, where police officials are welcome to check on them."
4047,The detective has been so reluctant to retire that he had to be reminded repeatedly by his boss to file the required paperwork.
4048,"“He’s fighting the inevitable to the last minute,” Deputy Inspector Gelbman said. “Him and the horse, they’re both creatures of habit.”"
4049,"“It’s an emotional time,” Inspector Gelbman added. “He loves being a mounted cop and he connects to people on a personal level. It’s something he enjoys doing, to the point of, ‘I don’t want to leave.’”"
4050,"While an enviable assignment, the detail can get dicey in bad weather, when even the middle of Manhattan can take on a high lonesome feel. Once, in a torrential downpour, Detective Reilly slipped clean off Trooper."
4051,"Largely, the mounted officer’s role in the park is to be a visible presence, to deter crime and to offer a friendly face. He also would relay calls to other officers in cars or on scooters, as in the case of a man who had exposed himself to people lounging on the Great Lawn."
4052,"“Our presence alone prevents crime and makes people feel safer,” he said, clip-clopping through the park the other day. “People can see you from far away and are less likely to commit a crime.’’"
4053,"This, in a nutshell, is largely the role of the department’s mounted unit, which patrols large gatherings and crowded areas of the city. Formed in 1858, it has 55 horses and 100 members, split between officers and civilian workers."
4054,"Detective Reilly grew up in Jamaica, Queens, the second of eight children, and went from Jamaica High School to the Army, where he was stationed in Germany."
4055,"Shortly after joining the department in 1985, he was assigned to the 44th Precinct in the Bronx. He worked the overnight shift for nine years in one of the roughest parts of a city plagued with much higher crime levels than today."
4056,"The radical shift from that detail to his more placid Central Park post partly parallels the city’s decline in crime and its soaring tourism, especially in Central Park."
4057,"“Even in my 10 years here, the increase in the volume of tourists is just unreal,” said the detective, who often wears a cowboy hat while commuting by subway from Queens to the unit’s Manhattan headquarters on the ground floor of Mercedes House, a luxury residential building on West 53rd Street that houses a Mercedes dealership next to the stable."
4058,"While saddling up Trooper, Detective Reilly slipped him his favorite treat, jelly beans."
4059,"“The other horses hate that he gets this stuff,” he said as he laid a blue police department blanket on Trooper’s back and then an English saddle equipped with an old-fashioned night stick."
4060,"Then he put on his cavalry-style uniform, with a heavy leather coat, his blue police helmet and his 9-millimeter pistol, and rode Trooper to Central Park along their daily route."
4061,"Heading along a busy stretch of West End Avenue, the horse passed double-parked cars, aromatic food trucks, dumpsters and garbage trucks without reacting. Even a construction crew jackhammering the street failed to break his stride."
4062,"“Some horses would go bananas at that,” said the detective before entering the park and stopping on a rise so that Trooper could graze."
4063,"“He loves Central Park grass,” said Detective Reilly, who knows many of the bird watchers and dog walkers in the park and always asks tourists where they are from."
4064,"When two tourists from Ottawa told him it was their first visit to Central Park, he pointed out Tanner’s Spring, a fresh spring just west of the Great Lawn."
4065,"Two mounted officers with the city’s Parks Department, which also patrols the park, approached and said they heard he was retiring."
4066,“Are you excited?” one asked.
4067,"Detective Reilly shrugged, and finally said tersely, “I’ll miss it.”"
4068,"Then the horseman of Central Park prodded his equine pal into his daily run, a full gallop down a park pathway with the detective whooping with joy."
4069,"Before the hacking of Sony Pictures and the Democratic National Committee, before the News of the World tabloid broke into voice-mail messages and before the first WikiLeak, there was Anthony Pellicano."
4070,"Mr. Pellicano was a private investigator in Hollywood, a man who drove around town with a baseball bat in his trunk and who was very good at uncovering people’s secrets. He ran a vast surveillance operation out of his office with a sprawling network of wiretaps. If you needed an unpleasant issue to go away, or a nasty tidbit to improve your standing in a divorce or business dispute, he was the go-to guy."
4071,"He wiretapped the actors Sylvester Stallone and Keith Carradine, and did work on behalf of Chris Rock and Courtney Love, among many others. He conducted an illegal criminal background check on Garry Shandling, threatened a journalist and, according to testimony at his trial, even offered to have a producer murdered, his body buried in the desert. He had been behind bars since 2003."
4072,"On Friday, the private eye who intimately knew Hollywood’s underbelly — and, some would say, was its leading man — walked out of a Los Angeles federal prison at the end of his sentence and was free for the first time in more than 15 years."
4073,"Though it has been a long time since Hollywood last heard much from the man who heard its private conversations, he is hardly forgotten, and some of those he investigated were dreading this day."
4074,"“It’s certainly not comforting,” said Jude Green, who testified that Mr. Pellicano threatened her during her divorce. “I’m looking for peace and harmony — I’ve had enough excitement.”"
4075,"Friends and former employers have not forgotten him, either. Some have contributed to a trust fund worth “in the tens of thousands” to help Mr. Pellicano get by, according to a person familiar with the fund who declined to be identified because it was a private effort. Requests for an interview with Mr. Pellicano, placed through a lawyer, went unanswered."
4076,"Mr. Pellicano, who turned 75 on Friday, was originally known as an audio expert from Chicago. He was used as an expert witness by prosecutors and hired by The New York Times in 1979 to determine if the voice on a recording belonged to the former shah of Iran."
4077,"By the 1990s, he had set up shop as a private investigator in Los Angeles who wouldn’t open a case without a $25,000 retainer and could charge clients hundreds of thousands of dollars. A former employee testified that in his offices on Sunset Boulevard, a Los Angeles police officer on the take would swing by to pick up stacks of hundred dollar bills, and a half-dozen iMacs sat recording phone calls in his “war room.” As recently as last year, he teased in an interview with the The Hollywood Reporter that he might — just might — have Mafia connections."
4078,"“If you tried to connect me to organized crime, you probably could get close — but no cigar,” he said."
4079,"In 2002, his career began to unravel spectacularly. A reporter named Anita Busch, who had written for The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times, had recently published articles about the waning career of Michael Ovitz, one of the founders of the Creative Artists Agency and a former president of the Walt Disney Company. That summer, she found what appeared to be a bullet hole in her windshield, along with a dead fish and a rose on a tin tray on the hood of her car. A note was taped to her car that said, “Stop.”"
4080,"She later sued Mr. Ovitz for hiring Mr. Pellicano. According to court documents, she said that her phone had been tapped, her computer hacked and her hard drive erased. She said that two men in a Mercedes had tried to run her over and that she had been warned that someone planned to blow up her car. Mr. Ovitz planned to argue that the fish was Steven Seagal’s fault — Ms. Busch had been reporting about Mr. Seagal as well — though the F.B.I. found no persuasive evidence that the actor was involved, according to The Hollywood Reporter."
4081,She and Mr. Ovitz settled out of court. He did not respond to a request for comment.
4082,"While investigating the threat against Ms. Busch, the authorities found grenades and C-4 explosives in a safe in Mr. Pellicano’s office. He was sentenced to 30 months on weapons charges. In 2008, he was convicted again, this time on more than 70 charges including racketeering, wire fraud and wiretapping, and he had been in prison until this day."
4083,"“My code word when I would call the F.B.I.,” Ms. Green said, “was C-4.”"
4084,"Ms. Green said that Mr. Pellicano cornered her outside a Santa Monica, Calif., dog groomer where she had taken her Shih Tzu for a haircut. He blocked her car and got in her face, then followed her to a Peet’s Coffee, where he boxed her in again and then shoved her inside the store. She said that she yelled to make a scene and fled."
4085,"Mr. Pellicano often represented himself in various cases, preferring to refer to himself in the third person. This sometimes created a difficult situation for witnesses and a variety of odd scenes."
4086,"Neville Johnson represented the plaintiffs in several lawsuits against Mr. Pellicano and other organizations, including the Los Angeles and Beverly Hills police departments, where Mr. Pellicano had officers feeding him confidential information."
4087,"Mr. Johnson recalled that during a deposition at a federal prison in Big Spring, Tex., Mr. Pellicano would say things like “I hereby instruct myself not to answer.”"
4088,"That deposition got off to an inauspicious beginning. As Mr. Pellicano sat in the prison cafeteria in his jailhouse uniform, the court reporter instructed him to raise his right hand and asked if he swore to tell the truth."
4089,"“He said ‘no,’” Mr. Johnson recalled."
4090,"In addition to his other recordings, Mr. Pellicano was fond of taping his own phone calls — including incriminating ones — and many of those were recovered by investigators. But the F.B.I. suspected there were even more recordings, because on the tapes they did find, Mr. Pellicano spoke about storing some audio files outside his office."
4091,"Or so said an F.B.I. agent, Jonathan Mosser, when he was cross-examined by Mr. Pellicano at his trial:"
4092,Mr. Pellicano: Who was the person that told you that Mr. Pellicano took audio files and stored them off site?
4093,Agent Mosser: Mr. Pellicano.
4094,Mr. Pellicano: Mr. Pellicano?
4095,Mr. Mosser: Yes. 
4096,Mr. Pellicano: When did Mr. Pellicano tell you that he stored information off site?
4097,Mr. Mosser: In the audio recordings.
4098,Those tapes were never recovered.
4099,"Mr. Pellicano very likely could have faced less time in prison if he had cooperated with the authorities, but he never talked. In his interview last year with The Hollywood Reporter, he discussed “omerta,” the Mafia code of silence, and the value of keeping secrets. Among them, he said, were Michael Jackson’s. Mr. Pellicano worked for Mr. Jackson in the 1990s but said he quit when he learned what The Hollywood Reporter described as “truths even darker than those alleged in Jackson’s molestation scandal.” The Jackson family and estate have denied all allegations of sexual misconduct against him."
4100,"Mr. Pellicano emerges into a world of technology and surveillance vastly different from the one he left behind. With the landscape so changed, and his private investigator license revoked, it is not clear how he will make money now. Lawyers who sued Mr. Pellicano usually gave up because he had no money to pay any judgments."
4101,"He does, however, emerge with his secrets, and whatever value they possess. In a Newsweek interview in 2011, he claimed that he had offers to publish an autobiography, but that he could not write it because the clamor of prison was too distracting."
4102,"Bert Fields, a prominent entertainment lawyer in Los Angeles who had worked with Mr. Pellicano over many years, recalled him as doing “superb work.” (Mr. Fields was investigated in connection with Mr. Pellicano’s activities but said he had not used any wiretaps in any of his cases, and he was not charged.)"
4103,Mr. Fields said he made a “minor contribution” to Mr. Pellicano’s post-release trust fund.
4104,"“He served his time and paid his dues, and I felt it was appropriate to make a contribution,” he said. “It had absolutely nothing with trying to keep him quiet or anything like that, and if anyone were to say that, I would probably sue them.”"
4105,"In “Non Solus,” a dancer becomes an acrobat, and an acrobat becomes a dancer. Recirquel Company Budapest may be a circus company, but its meditative, evening-length production is no circus spectacle. It’s more like ballet in the air."
4106,"“It’s not a story of two men,” said Bence Vagi, the work’s choreographer and director. “It’s a story of the body and the soul, or the mirrored image of ourselves.”"
4107,"“Non Solus” (“Not Alone”), which comes to the Brooklyn Academy of Music beginning Thursday, brings to life a dreamlike world that evokes, with aerial feats of daring, the cycle from birth to death. In the show, set to a score that includes electronic music and Bach, the acrobat Renato Illes sees himself as the soul to the body of the dancer Gabor Zsiros. “But at the end,” Mr. Illes said in an email interview, “just like in life, the body perishes and the soul keeps on wandering alone in ethereal space.”"
4108,"Working on this piece has changed him. “It has strengthened me in my belief that you do not always have to do very dangerous tricks,” he said. “They might make you an outstanding acrobat, but will not make you a great performer.”"
4109,"By taking two types of performers and two traditions and melding them together, Mr. Vagi has given dance a powerful athleticism and circus movement a subtle and supple fluidity. But beyond the piece itself, “Non Solus” asks a bigger question: What can the dance and circus worlds teach each other?"
4110,"“When we look at ballet from the 1920s to today, we see huge progress,” Mr. Vagi said. “This is happening now in circus because schools in Montreal, in Belgium or even in Budapest have started to give more dance and movement classes to circus artists. So they start to find the freedom of movement, which enables abstraction, and abstraction can form more story.”"
4111,"There is a loose narrative in “Non Solus,” which Mr. Vagi sees as more than an ordinary duet. “It’s a show with only two people, but actually the set multiplies everything,” he said. “It is constructed with mirrored walls that face or tilt toward the audience. So it always reflects an image of the choreography.”"
4112,"And that creates something familiar to anyone who’s experienced the circus: a 360-degree vantage point, which carries with it the sensation of a ring."
4113,"Mr. Vagi, 38, grew up dancing and choreographing — he studied ballet and was also influenced by Bob Fosse — but as he grew older, he immersed himself in the artistry and history of circus and cabaret theater. He never was a member of a circus company, but he spent time researching circus freak shows, and was particularly drawn to the work of Tod Browning, who directed the 1932 film “Freaks.”"
4114,"Mr. Vagi directed dance shows that were inspired by circus themes, but he said “I never had circus artists — I just created scenes that had the atmosphere of circus.”"
4115,"Gradually, he began to incorporate circus artists in his pieces and made his way — his own way — to the ring. Recirquel, his dance-circus company based in Budapest, is now in its seventh year."
4116,"In a phone interview, Mr. Vagi, in Budapest, spoke about the thrill of live danger, the importance of grip and what dance and the circus have in common. Sadly, but unsurprisingly, one thing is the backstage misery. “The suffering is the same,” Mr. Vagi said. “The amount of hours. Your understanding of the body, the respect of the body. The life.”"
4117,Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.
4118,"For a dancer, what is the main challenge in acrobatic and aerial work?"
4119,"It’s the grip. You have somebody’s life in your hands. You can’t fail. You can’t let go of that person. Of course, there is a period where you have big mats, but then they are removed and in that moment you take responsibility for that other person’s life."
4120,"This art form is so dazzling for audiences because it always carries this live danger. In opera or in dance, how can you feel such fear? In circus, you see performers doing things that you think are not possible to do. They are superheroes."
4121,"What is the difference between dance and circus, and what do you find similar?"
4122,"I feel the answer, but to describe it is not easy. From my perspective, both are theater genres, and the beauty of theater is communication. Circuses are becoming more and more an art form that can speak like dance, and this is very beautiful because it’s opening a new perspective."
4123,How so?
4124,"The vocabulary of dance is much more broad because there are so many different dance styles, and the variation of movement is endless. When you look at circus and you are on a tightrope 10 meters high, your vocabulary is much more limited. You can’t let go, you can’t close your eyes, you can’t just spin: You need to keep your balance aligned because your life is at stake. That never happens in dance. You can get injured, but your life is not really at stake."
4125,How did “Non Solus” come to you?
4126,I was in Chile at the Atacama Desert watching this really incredible sunset. Deserts are really similar to theaters — it’s a huge empty place. You’re left alone with your thoughts. You see this red sand turn even redder by the sun and suddenly there is no one around you. It brings you back to some sort of ancient feelings of humans. “Non Solus” is this.
4127,What was the working process like for you and the performers?
4128,"A lot of crying. In the end, it’s like, “I’m not a dancer, I know I look stupid, I don’t want to become a dancer!” [Laughs] There was a lot of insecurity. In a way, the whole piece is about letting go of your ego and finding your own faith. Only when they let go does the show start to work its magic."
4129,How difficult is the partnering? 
4130,"When you partner in a show for 10 minutes, it’s fine, but when you partner for 60 minutes, it’s very hard. From the viewpoint of circus art, 60 minutes by two people is like the Olympics."
4131,What turns you off in terms of circus?
4132,"When I see productions that say they’re doing contemporary circus and deny liking classical circus, but in the end that’s what they do. They just put a new piece of music or change the costume."
4133,Do you like traditional circus? 
4134,"It’s beautiful. I love it. It’s a very ancient art form and you have to understand all of it in order to be able to think about it differently. Honestly, I don’t like the tag “contemporary circus.” When people ask me, “What do you do?” I always respond, “We do circus.” Even in this show, we have the mirrors and this 360-degree perspective, so the ancient magic of circus comes back to us."
4135,"Yes, you can do something new, but you can’t let go of everything that is there: You need to respect it."
4136,"Several hundred thousand federal workers keep showing up at their jobs every day — screening luggage for explosives, policing prisons, preparing to open tax filing season — even though they aren’t getting paid. You wouldn’t expect that at a private company or, say, in almost any European country. But they keep reporting for work, in the midst of what is now the longest federal shutdown in United States history."
4137,Which raises the question: Why do they keep showing up? 
4138,Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps they shouldn’t and that some sort of coordinated absence by federal workers might be the quickest way to persuade President Trump and congressional Democrats to find a deal to end the shutdown:
4139,"Couple senior Republican lawmakers tell me the only way this breaks open is if TSA employees stay home and Americans get furious about their flights. That’s the only out, they say. And they’re close to the WH."
4140,"Workers understand the power they have; a walkout of Transportation Security Administration employees would effectively cripple air travel in the United States, for example. "
4141,"But they do not appear close to wielding that leverage. On Wednesday, T.S.A. reported its national rate of unscheduled absences was 6.1 percent, up from 3.7 percent a year ago, but not high enough to significantly worsen wait times in most major airports. "
4142,Here are the reasons more federal workers are still showing up for work despite not getting paid. 
4143,"The National Labor Relations Act extends a right to strike to American workers — but it specifically does not give that right to government workers. A law passed during President Jimmy Carter’s administration bars federal workers from striking. When air traffic controllers walked off the job in 1981, demanding better pay and working conditions, President Ronald Reagan ordered them to return to work. When they did not, he fired them. "
4144,"For an employee deemed “excepted” from furlough during a shutdown — which is to say, forced to work without pay — walking off the job could carry a similar penalty. Guidance from the federal Office of Personnel Management prohibits excepted employees from taking any sort of leave, including vacation or sick days, during a shutdown. "
4145,"“If an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so,” the guidance says, “he or she will be considered to be absent without leave (AWOL) and will be subject to any consequences that may follow from being AWOL.”"
4146,"Union leaders and federal workers frequently stress that furloughed employees want to be allowed to return to their jobs — and that employees working without pay are doing so largely because they care about their work, be it protecting public lands, inspecting food for safety or catching drug smugglers at the border."
4147,"“It sounds corny, I know,” said Jacqueline Simon, the director of public policy for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers’ union. But “federal employees are extremely devoted to the mission of their agencies,” she said. “They don’t just fall into these jobs. They believe in public service; they believe in what they do. They’re not just going to walk away. There may come a point when some of them have to, to feed their families, but no one wants to do that.”"
4148,"The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has seen “no unusual increase” in controllers missing work, the union’s executive vice president, Trish Gilbert, said on Friday. Asked if the controllers’ association would consider organizing a strike, a walkout or another job action if the shutdown continued in the long run, Ms. Gilbert said the union “would not condone or endorse any kind of activity like that.”"
4149,"“We have taken an oath,” she said. “We know we’re important to the United States economy, and we are going to work. We’re just not getting paid. So even if this drags on, people will come to work.”"
4150,"At least five lawsuits have been filed against the federal government by groups including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union and the air traffic controllers’ association."
4151,"A United States District Court judge ruled on Tuesday against issuing any temporary restraining order that would allow workers to stop coming to work or order them to be paid. But those cases will continue to work their way through the judiciary, with another court date set at the end of the month."
4152,"The average federal worker has lost about $5,000 since the shutdown took hold in late December. On Wednesday, the president was expected to sign a bill promising that those workers would receive retroactive pay."
4153,"Loyalty does not make workers immune to economic reality; they still need to make mortgage and car payments. In the high-cost Washington area, Ms. Simon said, a T.S.A. employee’s salary starts at $28,000 a year, which “doesn’t give you any cushion for absorbing any interruption in your pay.” "
4154,"Reporting the agency’s elevated rate of unscheduled leave on Wednesday, T.S.A. officials said that “many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations.” "
4155,"Furloughed employees can work other jobs to make ends meet: A staff member with the White House Council of Economic Advisers has begun driving for Uber to pay the bills, the council’s director said this week. But moonlighting is a lot harder for excepted employees, who still must show up at their regular job every day."
4156,"With a strong labor market and an unemployment rate hovering around 4 percent, many of those employees might eventually quit to take a job that brings an immediate paycheck. "
4157,"An analysis from the online jobs site Indeed suggests that might already be brewing. It looked at job search behavior from mid-December through mid-January for workers at some affected federal agencies, including the I.R.S. and the T.S.A. "
4158,"Indeed researchers found that clicks on job listings rose at least 17 percent for each of those worker groups over that period, a sign that employees affected by the shutdown “are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year,” said Martha Gimbel, Indeed’s director of economic research."
4159,"Ms. Simon said that some workers might eventually be forced to take other jobs if the shutdown stretches on. For now, she said, there is no talk about a coordinated “sickout” or other walkout from work. Federal employees, she said, are “sharing their heartache” with one another — and their indignation."
4160,"“They don’t like being treated as hostages,” she said. "
4161,Katie Rogers contributed reporting.
4162,"For years, office architects and designers have been bringing nature into the workplace, incorporating materials like wood and stone and strategically deploying plants and botanical artwork."
4163,"Now, companies are inviting employees to step outside for a taste of the real thing."
4164,"Employers with suburban campuses have long turned swaths of blank lawn into furnished outdoor areas where workers can meet with colleagues, work alone or simply take a break from their computer screens."
4165,"Now, developers and owners of urban office buildings are adding terraces and transforming once-barren rooftops into parklike settings, where workers can plant vegetables, unfurl yoga mats or swing in a hammock."
4166,"“There’s not a developer or forward-thinking building owner today that doesn’t have this top of mind,” said Paul J. Amrich, a vice chairman for the New York area at CBRE, a real estate services company."
4167,"Fueling this trend is growing awareness of the health and wellness benefits from contact with nature, a concept known as biophilia. Exposure to nature has been shown to lower levels of cortisol, the human stress hormone, as well as stimulate creativity. Employers competing for the best workers are using outdoor amenities to show they care about their staff’s well-being."
4168,"CookFox Architects, a firm in Manhattan that focuses on sustainability, makes green outdoor space a prerequisite when agreeing to design a building. The firm, which grows kale and tends an apiary on the terraces of its own office, recently completed 512W22, an office building in Chelsea, for Vornado Realty Trust and the Albanese Organization. The 172,700-square-foot building has an additional 16,920 square feet of terraces and a common roof, all planted with native grasses and trees selected by MKM Landscape Architecture."
4169,"“Every floor in the building has an outdoor space attached to it,” said David R. Greenbaum, president of Vornado’s New York division."
4170,"Nature aside, outdoor work areas are a logical next step in the evolution of flexible offices. Many companies already offer lounge areas and communal tables for employees to work without feeling chained to their desks. A terrace or rooftop, equipped with Wi-Fi and electrical outlets, can be another option."
4171,"“Employees respond to additional places to touch down,” said John Mooz, a senior managing director for the developer Hines who oversees projects in Houston and Austin, Tex."
4172,"Hines’s 609 Main, a 48-story office tower in downtown Houston, has landscaped outdoor space off the 12th floor, atop a podium that rises from the base of the tower. The podium houses stores and indoor parking, but instead of putting an outdoor parking lot on the roof, as is common in this business district, the developer hired OJB Landscape Architecture to add trees, trellises and pergolas."
4173,"The space has become a desirable asset for a lower-floor office that might otherwise have been a hard sell because it did not offer superior views, Mr. Mooz said."
4174,"United Airlines leased the 12th floor and the seven floors above it, and Gensler, which outfitted United’s offices, furnished the terrace, too."
4175,"It’s “a great social gathering place,” said Gavin Molloy, United’s vice president for corporate real estate, adding that employees use it daily for relaxing, eating lunch and meeting with co-workers."
4176,"Like many interior office innovations, the trend in outdoor spaces has roots in the workplaces of technology giants."
4177,"Facebook has a nine-acre park, with meandering paths for walking meetings, atop its flagship building in Menlo Park, Calif. Microsoft built tree houses in Redmond, Wash."
4178,"At Samsung’s new North American headquarters, in San Jose, Calif., designed by the architecture firm NBBJ, every third floor of the 10-story building offers outdoor space. Some terraces are devoted to quiet contemplation and yoga, while others have active features such as a putting green where employees can practice their golf swing. On the ground level, the landscape architecture firm SWA laid out a series of spaces as varied as tennis courts and a “reflection garden.”"
4179,"Companies that hire SWA want to know what the competition is doing, in part because they are all angling for the same work force, said Gerdo P. Aquino, the firm’s chief executive."
4180,"“Every time I start a program, they say, ‘Check out what Apple did, what Facebook did, what Google did,’” he said."
4181,Companies are also asking workers what they want in outdoor spaces.
4182,"A survey commissioned by L. L. Bean found that 86 percent of indoor workers would like to spend more time outdoors during the workday. The retailer, based in Freeport, Me., teamed up with the co-working firm Industrious to create a pop-up outdoor office with individual and group work areas — and then took the show on the road. Started in New York’s Madison Square Park last summer, the “Be an Outsider at Work” demonstration project also traveled to Boston, Philadelphia and Madison, Wis."
4183,"LinkedIn has a workplace design lab at the main campus of its headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., for tinkering with ideas for outfitting its 32 offices around the globe. Shade is essential for outdoor work spaces, the lab has found, in part to prevent glare on phone and laptop screens. The lab created a mobile meeting room that can be rolled out onto a terrace and is designing an in-place roofed space with desks and indoor-outdoor computer monitors, according to Brett Hautop, LinkedIn’s senior director for global design and build."
4184,"Of course, it’s one thing to introduce an outdoor work space at a sprawling, low-rise campus; it’s another to squeeze it into a project in a built-up urban environment where every square foot, if not square inch, matters. And some parts of the country have to contend with inclement weather."
4185,"In New York, developers are incorporating outdoor spaces in new projects."
4186,"When Tavros Holdings, Charney Construction & Development and 1 Oak Contracting began a mixed-use complex centered on the historic Dime Savings Bank building in the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn, outdoor space was “a must,” said Nicholas Silvers, a founding partner of Tavros Holdings."
4187,"Their architect, Fogarty Finger in New York, added terraces to a five-story structure for retailing and offices; office tenants will furnish the terraces as they see fit. Grain Collective will landscape the roof, which tenants will share with renters in the complex’s residential tower, with flower beds, a boardwalk and a lawn."
4188,"With existing buildings, the roof is often the only place to create an outdoor amenity. When Fogarty Finger works on conversions of old manufacturing buildings, the project involves adding a roof deck nine times out of 10, according to Chris Fogarty, one of the firm’s founders. Furniture may need to be anchored so that everything stays put when the wind blows, and covered up in the winter."
4189,"Vornado plans to add a lush landscape atop the 1913 James A. Farley Building in Midtown Manhattan, the columned post office that in its next incarnation will house a train hall as well as retail and office tenants. According to renderings from the Future Green Studio in Brooklyn, the perimeter of the roof will be planted with flowers and grasses interspersed with benches and picnic tables."
4190,"Such investments add significantly to construction costs, according to developers, architects and landscape architects. Among other things, roofs must be properly sealed and lightweight soils used to minimize added weight loads."
4191,"But according to Mr. Amrich of CBRE, a landlord can charge 10 to 15 percent more for a Manhattan office space with an outdoor area."
4192,"Typically, he said, landlords do not charge per square foot for terraces and usable roofs, but they are able to secure a higher overall rent because of such amenities."
4193,"“In a market with 450 million square feet of office space to choose from,” he added, “it’s a way of creating differentiation.”"
4194,"If there is a way to write about Kristine Haruna Lee’s vivid, haunted “Suicide Forest” without mentioning the ending, I don’t know what it is. Because when the fourth wall breaks, this nightmare-vision play about Japanese-American identity cracks wide open, and what’s underneath is so heart-stingingly tender and explicitly personal that the whole work shifts."
4195,"Here, then, is an emphatic piece of advice: Go see it at the Bushwick Starr, where Aya Ogawa has directed a wild ride of a production. And here is a warning: spoilers dead ahead."
4196,"The first figure we see in “Suicide Forest,” moving slowly around the edge of the proscenium, is a god in scarlet silk. White-faced and raven-haired, with soft red pigment at the corners of her eyes, this is Mad Mad. Her presence stalks this play."
4197,"Ms. Lee is also an actor in it, portraying a teenage Japanese schoolgirl named Azusa. But deep in the performance, after the vibrant pink-and-white interior of Jian Jung’s set has given way to the eerie abstractness of the woods, Ms. Lee drops the mask of her role. She becomes, disarmingly, her Seattle-raised self, speaking directly to the audience, taking ownership of the issues of heritage that fuel her play."
4198,"“I want to confess,” she says, “I grew up with a mother who I can never fully communicate with. Language barrier.” Her mother, she explains, is “100 percent Japanese.”"
4199,"“So I guess that technically makes me 50 percent Japanese,” Ms. Lee adds. “But that percentage is a lie. Sometimes I feel like I’m only 33 percent? Other times, as high as 70 percent. I am also, usually, a high percentage of American too.”"
4200,"Presented with Ma-Yi Theater Company, “Suicide Forest” is a tussle between those parts of her. You can feel Ms. Lee resisting any sort of conformity."
4201,"Performed mostly in English with some supertitled Japanese, the play is made up of short, sharp vignettes set in 1990s Tokyo and in a forest like the infamous Aokigahara, where many people have gone to kill themselves."
4202,"Ms. Lee leans hard and deliberately into stereotypes, her central figures versions of stock characters: a salaryman (Eddy Toru Ohno) in his 60s tempted by suicide, and the plaid-skirted Azusa (costumes are by Alice Tavener), who is preyed on by the salaryman. His own teenage daughters (Akiko Aizawa and Dawn Akemi Saito), with pigtailed hair in cotton-candy colors, are alarming manifestations of femininity, at once hypersexualized and infantilized."
4203,"Spectators without any Japanese heritage might not know quite what to make of it, at least not until Ms. Lee breaks that fourth wall."
4204,"Then, very close to the end, another actor joins her onstage: Aoi Lee, who plays Mad Mad."
4205,"“This is my mom,” the playwright tells us, protectively. “She dances Butoh.”"
4206,"As she asks her mother questions in English, and translates the answers that the elder Ms. Lee speaks in Japanese, the gorgeously conflicted complexity of “Suicide Forest” is movingly on display."
4207,"For a haunted daughter, this play is an exorcism. But it is also an embrace."
4208,"The Moon will be on 15th Street, and the Earth will be on 16th  Street, starting on Jan. 24, in a new public installation created by the artist Oliver Jeffers in partnership with the High Line."
4209,"The two large globes will be displayed on the Chelsea Market Passage of the High Line, separated by roughly the length of a city block, through Feb. 7. The Moon will be two feet in diameter and Earth will be about eight feet; both will be mounted at a height of 10 feet. (They are made from Hard-coated foam, steel and acrylic.) The installation, called “The Moon, the Earth and Us,” will explore the vastness of the universe, the fragility of artificial borders, and the relationship between the two celestial bodies."
4210,"“We are excited to bring the creative world of Oliver Jeffers to New York City,” Robert Hammond, co-founder and executive director of Friends of the High Line, said in an email. “His books and illustrations are beautiful and connect with a broad range of audiences — just like the High Line. And there is no better place in the city than the High Line to view the sky. With this installation Jeffers is providing our visitors and neighbors with a unique chance to see a scaled model of the Moon and the Earth up close.”"
4211,"Mr. Jeffers is an artist, illustrator and author, and the cosmos has featured prominently in his work. He also has a show of oil paintings opening Jan. 10 at Bryce Wolkowitz gallery that deals more abstractly with the connections between Earth and the universe."
4212,[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
4213,"Mr. Jeffers, who is based in Brooklyn, said that having a young son reignited his interest in outer space, and that the two of them had traveled to Tennessee during the 2017 solar eclipse. They took a flight to the “path of totality,” an experience that informed “The Moon, the Earth and Us.”"
4214,"“It was awe-inspiring, terrifying, eerie, but completely uplifting; you get this sense of perspective pinned to two objects instead of one,” Mr. Jeffers said."
4215,"He said he is interested in the concept of viewing places and things from different vantage points; the Earth from the Moon, the Moon from the Earth, the Earth from distant space. He said that his experience growing up in Northern Ireland, and viewing the country from a distance, also factored into the making of the piece."
4216,"“The way I was explaining Northern Irish conflicts from the other side of the ocean was part of the piece too,” he said. Northern Ireland fueled his interest in maps and globes, he said, but also his “disinterest in nationalism or patriotism of any kind.”"
4217,"Both globes will feature text. The Moon will read, “No One Lives Here.” On the Earth, in the places where country names might typically go, it will repeatedly read, “People Live Here.”"

4219,"A woman was trapped for three days in the elevator of a Manhattan townhouse, where she worked, while the house’s owners spent a weekend away, officials said."
4220,"The woman, Marites Fortaliza, 53, of Queens, was rescued Monday morning only after a person attempting to deliver something to the building contacted the home’s owners. The owners sent a family member, who saw that Ms. Fortaliza was trapped inside the broken lift and called 911, police and fire department officials said."
4221,"After she was rescued Monday, Ms. Fortaliza appeared to be in good condition but was taken to a hospital for treatment, James Long, a Fire Department spokesman, said. She had been alone in the elevator since Friday evening, he added."
4222,"Firefighters reported to the home at 48 East 65th Street, a five-story building on the Upper East Side, just after 10 a.m. Monday, Mr. Long said. The firefighters forced open the doors of the elevator, which was stuck between the house’s second and third floors."
4223,"Hugo Martinez, 50, who works next door, said Ms. Fortaliza appeared conscious and calm when firefighters removed her from the building on a stretcher."
4224,"The homeowners, Warren and Harriet Stephens, said in a statement released Monday that Ms. Fortaliza has worked for them for 18 years. They also said a member of their family accompanied Ms. Fortaliza to the hospital, where she was “doing well.”"
4225,"The elevator had most recently been inspected in July and no violations were filed, according to city records."
4226,"The city Department of Buildings said it was investigating the incident, though an inspector, Devon Simmons, who knocked on the front door Monday was not let into the building."
4227,"Mr. Simmons said he would need to do tests to determine what led to the elevator’s malfunction. Until he was given access to the building, he said, the homeowners would be flagged with a violation. The Department of Buildings issued one later that day, a spokeswoman said."
4228,"Mr. Simmons did not know whether the elevator had a phone or emergency button in it. According to the Department of Buildings, buildings that do not have people continuously monitoring them are required to have buttons or phones in their elevators that can signal a service capable of taking action in an emergency."
4229,"“The cause of this unfortunate incident is being investigated,” the Stephens family said in its statement, “and appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that something like this never happens again.”"
4230,"After Mr. Simmons’s visit, a mechanic for Schindler Elevator, an elevator manufacturer, walked out of the townhouse and said his company was working to determine the source of the problem."
4231,"The Stephenses purchased their townhouse, near Madison Avenue and down the block from the fine-dining stalwart Daniel, in 1999. The couple spent nearly $8 million on the home, The New York Times reported later that year. The elevator was installed before they purchased the house, which was built in 1920, property records show."
4232,"Mr. Stephens, a billionaire investor originally from Arkansas, is the chairman and chief executive of the investment firm Stephens Inc., which is based in Little Rock, Ark., but also has an office in New York. In 2018, Forbes, which ranked him 302nd on its list of the 400 wealthiest Americans, estimated his net worth at $2.7 billion."
4233,"In 1999, The Times described him as “understated,” and said he and his wife “zealously guarded” their family’s privacy."
4234,"The incident was not the first time in recent memory that someone in New York City had been trapped in an elevator for an extended period. In 2005, a deliveryman for a Chinese restaurant was stuck in an elevator in the Bronx for roughly 81 hours."
4235,"In 1999, a man who was returning to his desk from a cigarette break was stuck in an elevator in a Midtown office building for 40 hours. He was freed after a building employee saw him on a security camera. The New Yorker later published video showing how he spent the time."
4236,"A new round of labor upheaval hit the classical music world on Sunday night, when the musicians of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, one of the finest ensembles in the nation, went on strike in an effort to preserve their defined-benefit pension plan."
4237,"The players — who are among the best-paid in the field, earning a minimum annual salary of $159,000 last season, and often more — began walking a picket line outside Orchestra Hall on Monday morning."
4238,"In recent years, ticket sales have covered an ever-smaller portion of the cost of putting on classical performances. That has put pressure on orchestras to raise more money from donors — but also to try to cut expenses, leading to tensions with their unions. This fall, the Lyric Opera of Chicago’s orchestra went on a brief strike and wound up agreeing to a contract guaranteeing fewer weeks of work. Two seasons ago, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Pittsburgh Symphony and the Fort Worth Symphony found themselves on strike simultaneously."
4239,"There are several areas of dispute in the negotiations in Chicago, which have gone on for 11 months without an agreement, but the pension is the main sticking point. The orchestra’s management and board have warned that the growing expense of the current pension plan, which guarantees a set benefit for life after retirement, is unsustainable. They said in a statement that the orchestra contributed $3.8 million into the musicians’ pension fund this year — up from $803,000 just two years ago because of new federal requirements — and that those annual contributions were projected to continue rising sharply."
4240,"Management’s proposal has called for switching the musicians into a defined-contribution plan, similar to a 401(k), in which the orchestra would put a set amount of money into individual retirement accounts for the players, who could invest it as they chose."
4241,"Cynthia Yeh, a percussionist on the players’ negotiating committee, said in a statement that the defined-benefit plan “has been the hallmark of the orchestra’s benefits package (and those of other leading orchestras) for over 50 years.” She said the board’s proposal “strips the membership of that guaranteed benefit and shifts the investment risk to the individual member.”"
4242,"Helen Zell, the chairwoman of the orchestra’s board, said in a statement that “it would be irresponsible for the board to continue to authorize a pension program that jeopardizes the orchestra’s future.”"
4243,"While many other industries have shifted to cheaper defined-contribution plans in recent decades, defined-benefit plans remain the norm at the nation’s largest orchestras — and players around the country have made preserving them a priority. But many are underfunded. The American Federation of Musicians and Employers’ Pension Fund, a large multiemployer plan covering thousands of musicians, is currently considered “in critical status,” and if its condition worsens, it could trigger a rare move to cut the benefit payments for those already retired."
4244,"Last week, as the deadline the Chicago players set for an agreement neared, the orchestra’s eminent music director, Riccardo Muti, wrote a letter supporting the musicians to Ms. Zell and Jeff Alexander, the orchestra’s president. “As music director and a musician of this orchestra, I am with the musicians,” Mr. Muti wrote, urging the management to “remember that theirs is not a job but a mission” and speaking of the performers’ need for “tranquillity and serenity.”"
4245,"Mr. Muti is scheduled to lead the orchestra in a program of Rossini, Vivaldi, Beethoven and Wagner on Thursday."
4246,"MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C. — From a couch on the back deck of a dockside restaurant, the Beatles playing in the background and a breeze blowing off the water, Joe Cunningham gestured to Shem Creek."
4247,"“This could be the reality here, of oil rigs and oil spills off the beach,” Mr. Cunningham said. “An oil spill could just decimate the area, and all of a sudden instead of people coming to Charleston, South Carolina, they high-tail it down to Florida or somewhere else.”"
4248,"Offshore drilling might not captivate voters in most parts of the country, but it did here. For months, Mr. Cunningham called for the restoration of a federal ban as his Republican opponent, Katie Arrington, talked about immigration and warned that a vote for him would be a vote for Nancy Pelosi’s “San Francisco values.” And in November, Mr. Cunningham, 36, defeated Ms. Arrington in a House district that last elected a Democrat four years before he was born."
4249,"It was one of the biggest upsets of the midterms, and it turned on an ideal issue for a candidate who, before he became a lawyer, was an ocean engineer."
4250,"“‘We believe in science’ — that line always drew applause,” he said in an interview. “I think it’s a sad state of affairs when you have to actually say that. Imagine someone saying that about any other subject, like, ‘I believe in history’ — topics that are proven with evidence and facts and numbers.”"
4251,"Mr. Cunningham is one of at least 11 freshman representatives with a background in science, medicine or technology. Eight of them are Democrats, and they are some of the first victors of a trend that began soon after President Trump was elected: Alarmed by inaction on climate change and the administration’s marginalization of experts, many more scientists have been entering politics."
4252,"“There is this growing consensus among the scientific community that they need to go beyond advocacy and signing polite letters and actually get involved in electoral politics,” said Shaughnessy Naughton, a chemist and the president of 314 Action, a two-year-old organization that supports candidates with scientific and medical backgrounds. The group — which raised $4 million for the 2018 elections — trained about 1,500 prospective candidates and supported the eight winning Democrats, as well as Senator Jacky Rosen and more than 30 successful state-level candidates. (While members of any party can attend trainings, the group doesn’t endorse Republicans for federal offices because, Ms. Naughton said, “we can’t justify supporting Republicans when the G.O.P. platform is aligned against scientific consensus on issues like climate change.”)"
4253,"Elaine Luria, an engineer who operated nuclear reactors in the Navy, flipped Virginia’s Second Congressional District, which had been represented by a Republican for 16 of the last 20 years. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician, won Washington’s Eighth District, which had never elected a Democrat. Sean Casten, a biochemist, defeated a six-term Republican incumbent in the Sixth District of Illinois. T.J. Cox, a chemical engineer, won in California; Chrissy Houlahan, also an engineer, in Pennsylvania; Lauren Underwood, a registered nurse, in Illinois; and Jeff Van Drew, a dentist, in New Jersey."
4254,"At least three Republicans with science or medical backgrounds, and starkly different views, also won House seats: Mark Green of Tennessee, a former Army physician; Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, a businessman with a degree in aerospace engineering; and John Joyce of Pennsylvania, a dermatologist."
4255,"In several of the districts that flipped, science was at the very center of the campaign. 314 Action spent $500,000 on advertising in Mr. Cunningham’s race, hammering the offshore drilling issue, and it was largely based on that issue that Mr. Cunningham received endorsements from several local Republican officials. The same issue resonated in coastal Virginia, where Ms. Luria said she “did not meet a single person on the campaign trail, regardless of political affiliation, who wants offshore drilling off of our coast.”"
4256,"For Mr. Casten — a former cancer researcher with degrees in molecular biology, biochemistry and biochemical engineering — the big issue involved Sterigenics, a company that sterilizes medical equipment at a facility in Willowbrook, Ill. The plant uses a carcinogenic chemical called ethylene oxide, and a Department of Health and Human Services report released in August found a high risk of cancer in nearby communities. (Sterigenics said the report had “purposefully relied upon a worst-case scenario for assessing risk.”)"
4257,"The report became a liability for the incumbent Republican, Peter Roskam, who had received campaign contributions from the American Chemistry Council. The council and Sterigenics had been lobbying the E.P.A. for several years not to classify ethylene oxide as a known human carcinogen, and Mr. Roskam — whose spokeswoman declined to make him available for an interview — had supported legislation to put industry representatives on the E.P.A. boards that make such decisions."
4258,"Now that they are in Washington, the Democratic scientists-turned-representatives face a new challenge. Many of them said that, beyond addressing climate change and other science-related issues, they wanted to bring a more scientific mind-set to Congress."
4259,"For the last six years, the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology was led by Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican with no scientific background. Under him, the committee investigated the debunked idea that global warming had “paused,” subpoenaed organizations whose research affirmed the reality of climate change, and promoted rules that reduced the number of scientists and increased the number of industry representatives on E.P.A. advisory panels. At times, committee members showed a basic lack of scientific knowledge: During a hearing in 2014, Steve Stockman, another Texas Republican, said it was nonsensical to think melting glaciers and ice sheets would increase sea levels because glasses don’t overflow when the ice cubes in them melt."
4260,"Mr. Smith has now retired, and four other Republicans on the committee were not re-elected. The new chairwoman, Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat and former psychiatric nurse, is the first person with a scientific background to hold that position since the 1990s. Ms. Johnson said in an interview that she had invited the new scientists to join, though committee assignments may not be finalized for several weeks."
4261,But the old dynamics are not going to disappear.
4262,"There will continue to be tension even with some of the scientists on the other side of the aisle: Mr. Hern, the aerospace engineer elected in Oklahoma, has questioned whether human activity is the primary cause of climate change, and Mr. Green, the doctor from Tennessee, repeated the debunked claim that vaccines can cause autism. (He later backtracked, telling HuffPost that children should be vaccinated.) They, too, feel their experience gives them a more authoritative voice and, in Mr. Hern’s words, “an understanding of many of the issues that others might not have.”"
4263,"Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, a Democrat on the science committee, acknowledged that eight people could not “change the entire culture.” But, he said, they could change Congress’s perspective."
4264,"“So often, our perspective of politicians is lawyers and people with the gift of gab,” Mr. Beyer said. “Now we’re getting people that have a deep knowledge of mathematics and physics and chemistry and biology, and that’s a really important perspective in an increasingly scientific world.”"
4265,"Mr. Cunningham is already preparing a bill that would ban drilling off the Atlantic coast for 10 years. Mr. Beyer and Bill Foster — an Illinois Democrat and physicist who is the only member of Congress with a doctorate in a scientific field — described several other legislative priorities for the committee, including more oversight of the E.P.A. and other science-related government bodies; regulation of developing technologies like human genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies and mobile payments; and, of course, measures to combat climate change. One of the first may be carbon pricing legislation — which would charge corporations for their carbon emissions — because unlike more aggressive measures, Mr. Foster said he believed that might get through the Republican-led Senate."
4266,"Mr. Foster said he believed Mr. Casten would be particularly helpful on carbon pricing. With experience in both biochemistry and business, Mr. Casten can “really talk about the nuts and bolts about what it means,” he said, “and how different industry sectors will react to that, and how that’s going to affect the carbon footprint of different industries, in a quantitative way.”"
4267,"Ultimately, that sort of subject expertise, more than the Sisyphean task of changing the congressional approach to science, may be the new members’ most immediate contribution."
4268,"While talking about Ms. Luria, a nuclear engineer, Mr. Foster recalled the congressional discussion of the Iran nuclear agreement, which included a page describing the technical changes Iran needed to make to its reactor cores to ensure that the reactors could not produce large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium."
4269,"“Democrats and Republicans were coming to me in this period saying, ‘Bill, what does this mean and how should I vote on it?’” he said. “With Elaine there, at least that will cut my workload in half. We’ll have two competent members who can talk about reactor cores.”"
4270,Lilly Smartelli dreams of marrying her best friend on Valentine’s Day.
4271,"“Bernie and I have been looking for just the right wedding venue to stage our big Italian wedding,” said Ms. Smartelli, 55, who lives in Phoenix."
4272,"Ms. Smartelli marks Feb. 14 on her calendar, not as a romantic holiday, but as a day defined by comfort, happiness and a different sort of true love."
4273,"She found all of those things in Bernie, who happens to be one of the main characters in a book she self-published last October called, “The $5 Dog Wedding.” "
4274,He also happens to be a dog.
4275,"“I love Bernie to death and I know he’s going to make quite a handsome groom,” Ms. Smartelli said. “But there is one problem where our wedding is concerned.”"
4276,The fact that Bernie is a dog?
4277,"“No,” she said, laughing. “The fact that we simply cannot afford the wedding we have planned.”"
4278,"Ms. Smartelli, a former travel nurse, is terminally ill, suffering from a form of pulmonary fibrosis, a respiratory disease in which scars are formed in the lung tissues, leading to serious breathing problems that worsen over time."
4279,"“My doctors tell me I have maybe one or two good years left,” she said, “so Bernie and I are racing against the clock.”"
4280,"Two years ago, Ms. Smartelli was enjoying life in San Diego aboard her two-bedroom boat, a 47-foot, 1980 Hatteras long-range cruiser, with Bernie, a hazel-eyed, sandy-haired, 9-year-old mixed breed cocker spaniel poodle; and her other dog, Spinner, a cream-colored, 8-year-old Maltese-Shih Tzu mix who will serve as Bernie’s best man. She had rescued Bernie and Spinner a week apart in October 2011, from the annual Riverside County adoption fair hosted by the Humane Society of the Desert in Palm Springs, Calif."
4281,"She eventually began suffering from shortness of breath, dizziness and fainting spells, which led to a diagnosis of pulmonary diffusion defect, a subcategory of pulmonary fibrosis. She sold the boat and moved to Phoenix, where she began evaluating her life, not knowing how much of it she had left, and came away with one final wish: to know the joy of a wedding day."
4282,"“By marrying Bernie in a symbolic way, I could draw attention to organ-donor groups and local animal welfare shelters that lack proper funding,” Ms. Smartelli said between labored breaths."
4283,"So her potential big day will serve as a fund-raising awareness moment for the two causes close to her heart. “It’s all in good fun,” she said."
4284,"“I know I will never be married, but I would still love to experience the kind of wedding, even if it’s a fake wedding, that I’ve been dreaming about since I was a little girl.”"
4285,"Ms. Smartelli chuckled when she said, “I’ve been involved in just one-and-a-half relationships my entire life,” and sighed when she added, “I’ve been single for quite a while.” She needed a significant other to make her a bucket-list item a reality, so she turned to Bernie, her best friend, to play the role of groom."
4286,"“I can’t think of anyone in the entire world who loves me more than Bernie does, anyhow,” said Ms. Smartelli, who said she dated a man in Palm Springs for two years before the relationship ended in 2007. (She refers to that experience as “only half of a relationship,” she said, “because he wasn’t half the man I expected him to be.”)"
4287,"Ms. Smartelli grew up in Detroit, where 12 years ago she spread some serious love of her own, coming to the rescue of a childhood friend by donating a kidney to him."
4288,"“I thought, if I could do something to help this person extend his life, then why not do it,” she said. “He’s doing pretty well today, and he sends me a card once a year thanking me for what I did for him.”"
4289,"Chris Stewart, the manager of the Sun City Pet Market in Sun City, Ariz., has seen her kindness and unselfishness in his store. “She’s really no different than anyone else who comes in here and treats their dogs like members of their family,” he said. “When she’s with Bernie and Spinner, I can see the love she has for them just pouring out of her.”"
4290,"Ms. Smartelli graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit, and holds a doctorate of chiropractic medicine from Cleveland Chiropractic College in Kansas City, Mo., as well as a nursing degree from Excelsior College in Albany. She says the experience of sacrificing a kidney “really, truly highlights the importance of donor organizations.”"
4291,"Before her illness, Ms. Smartelli was working as a travel nurse throughout the country, taking eight-week assignments in such cities as San Antonio, Dallas, Albuquerque, Palm Springs, Los Angeles and Denver."
4292,"Though there is no cure for her condition and no sacrifice that will put time back on her earthly clock, Ms. Smartelli said she still hopes to help save the lives of human beings and dogs by raising awareness, and money. She has already been donating a portion of her book’s proceeds to Donate Life America, a nonprofit organization working to increase the number of donated organs, eyes and tissue."
4293,"“Any ‘wedding gifts’ I receive,” she said, “would go straight to both of those causes.”"
4294,"She began considering a faux marriage to Bernie in October 2017, when she brought him to a dog groomer in Phoenix and mused, “I may as well marry Bernie. He’s always there for me. He listens, and he loves me no matter what. What more could a woman want?”"
4295,"The groomer took note. When Ms. Smartelli returned later that day, she found Bernie wagging his tail, freshly blow-dried and fluffy, and sharply dressed in a sequined blue bow tie, with a blue ribbon on his collar and a plastic wedding ring and engagement band attached, along with a note that said “Marry Me.”"
4296,"The moment inspired her. “Just because I didn’t have a fiancé didn’t mean there couldn’t still be a groom,” she wrote in her book. “It might be a little unorthodox, but so had many other choices in my adventurous life. I don’t need to find a man, not when I have Bernie.”"
4297,"“It was the perfect plan,” she wrote. “How could I have been so blind?”"
4298,"The reality, however, is that there will be no actual event, as Ms. Smartelli is barely able to keep up with the costs of her own medical bills."
4299,"With her parents deceased and no family members or friends to turn to for financial support, she has managed to keep a sense of humor as she copes with her debilitating disease."
4300,"“People who see only a headline that says I want to marry Bernie will think I’m totally insane,” she said, laughing. “So I hope they take the time to learn more about my whole story, and the reason I want to do it.”"
4301,"In the meantime, Ms. Smartelli said, she will continue to dream of actually walking Bernie down the aisle, with Spinner as best man, and celebrating with virtual family and friends."
4302,"But no matter how the reality of her Valentine’s Day unfolds, Ms. Smartelli will ultimately find the true meaning of the day in the company of Bernie and Spinner, just as others who do not necessarily mark Feb. 14 as a romantic holiday on their calendars might instead choose to spend the day in the company of a good book, or by watching a sunrise, or visiting loved ones at a cemetery."
4303,"“It’s kind of ironic, but Bernie and Spinner, who are just a couple of rescue dogs, have actually rescued me from a life of loneliness,” said Ms. Smartelli, who began to cry."
4304,"“I really love those two guys,” she said. “It wouldn’t be Valentine’s Day without them.”"
4305,"Loyalty programs weren’t around when the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus opined that the only constant in life is change. But the shifting earn-and-burn point levels established by hotel, airline and credit card programs add head-spinning haste to his thesis, especially in the past year."
4306,"In short, there are more ways to earn and spend as both sides of the loyalty equation — awards and rewards — inflate."
4307,"“Every loyalty point you hold today will be less valuable in two to five years,” said Leigh Rowan, the special projects director at UpgradedPoints.com, a website covering loyalty rewards strategies. “That’s the way airlines, hotels and private equity companies earn money, and they’re getting creative in how you can spend them.”"
4308,"Some estimates put the value of unredeemed points in the United States and Canada at $100 billion. If you’re sitting on piles of points, now is the time to consider using them, as programs offer new incentives in travel and beyond."
4309,"From Marriott International’s acquisition of Starwood Hotels & Resorts in 2016 to Hyatt Hotels’ recent purchase of Two Roads Hospitality, hotel companies are consolidating, dragging their membership programs into the unions. These marriages offer more places for members to redeem their points and new encouragement to do so."
4310,"“In general, the programs are rewarding people who stay at hotels more than ever before, the ‘heads in beds’ as they call it,” said Brian Kelly, founder of ThePointsGuy.com site, which is devoted to maximizing travel points."
4311,"In April, Wyndham Rewards from Wyndham Hotels & Resorts will incorporate the points program from its formerly separate La Quinta brand, and lower the entry-level redemption price for a hotel room from 15,000 points to 7,500. The program continues to reward 10 points per dollar spent or a minimum of 1,000 points, whichever is greater, at more than 8,000 hotels. It will also offer points-plus-cash plans, called Go Fast, starting at 1,500 points."
4312,"“Our core tenet is simplicity,” said Eliot Hamlisch, the senior vice president of global loyalty and partnerships at Wyndham, noting that the new plan moves from flat-rate redemption to one that disperses rewards more quickly. “Now members may only stay one night and have enough for a discounted stay on the next day.”"
4313,"Marriott International just rolled out its new Marriott Bonvoy  loyalty program, replacing three previous programs: Marriott Rewards, Starwood Preferred Guest and Ritz-Carlton Rewards. The company says 70 percent of stays are at the same cost or less and members are now given elite status more quickly. Members now have access to rooms at 6,900 hotels across 29 brands."
4314,"“Loyalty programs have only increased over the last five to 10 years in the industry and certainly at Marriott. We now fill half of our rooms with guests in the loyalty program,” said David Flueck, the senior vice president of global loyalty at Marriott."
4315,"In a give-and-take move, the company has banished blackout dates for point redemption, but has announced it will introduce peak and off-peak pricing this year."
4316,"In November, Hyatt Hotels forged an alliance with Small Luxury Hotels of the World, allowing members of its World of Hyatt loyalty program to earn and redeem points at participating S.L.H. properties, now at 110. Last fall, it added Exhale, the spa and fitness brand that Hyatt acquired in 2017, to its World of Hyatt loyalty program, offering 10 points for every dollar spent at Exhale."
4317,"Hyatt also recently acquired Two Roads Hospitality and its five brands including Alila, Joie de Vivre and Thompson, which are expected to join the loyalty program in the future."
4318,"Instead of redeeming 360,000 Hilton Honors points for a few nights in the Maldives, Mr. Kelly, the Points Guy, recently spent them to take a friend to a private event honoring Dolly Parton."
4319,"“I’m officially the best friend ever,” he joked."
4320,"Hilton isn’t in the music business, but like other hotel chains it has started offering unique and often priceless experiences to spend points on in addition to free stays. The company says it increased the number of these experiences by 166 percent last year over 2017."
4321,"“Airlines and hotels have issued a lot of these currencies and want to find creative ways to get them off their books,” Mr. Rowan of UpgradedPoints said, noting that travel companies can leverage the sponsorships they have with sports teams and stars to offer V.I.P. access to loyalty members. “It’s the experience of meeting a chef or rock star that they’re banking you’ll pay for and won’t have a chance to do again.” "
4322,"In addition to aspirational options for the point-rich — like driving a Formula 1 racecar in Singapore for 1.3 million points or a four-night stay in Lake Como for 2 million — Hilton Honors launched Lawn Days last summer. The concert program, designed to appeal to more casual travelers, offers a pair of lawn tickets to dozens of concerts throughout the country for 10,000 points. Last year, 95 percent of redeemers were first-time users of their points, according to Hilton."
4323,"Starwood Preferred Guest is credited with pioneering the practice of offering experiences for points, a legacy Marriott has expanded on with its auction platform, Marriott Bonvoy Moments. Members can bid on the chance to stand in the player’s tunnel with Manchester United soccer players before a match or rub elbows with members of Maroon 5, among other experiences."
4324,"World of Hyatt introduced its experience platform, Find, last summer, now offering more than 100 options such as hiking with wolves in California (21,429 points), a bonsai class with a professional bonsai designer (10,714 points) and a noodle tour in Cambodia with the chef of the Park Hyatt Siem Reap (7,071 points)."
4325,"Airlines are also adding experience rewards. United MileagePlus is offering tickets to an Ariana Grande concert (about 16,300 miles) and “Wicked” on Broadway (from 14,000 miles). At Delta SkyMiles Experiences, members could recently use SkyMiles to attend Yankees spring training games (5,000 miles) or bid on a kitchen tour and dinner for two at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, Calif. (starting at 40,000 miles)."
4326,"Loyalty programs, of course, favor the most frequent travelers. But entry-level perks, including discounted rates and free internet access, make them worthwhile for occasional travelers as well."
4327,"“We’re making sure the program is relevant for elite travelers with the richest benefits, but we’re also offering free Wi-Fi and special member rates on our website and those are things that appeal to infrequent travelers,” Marriott’s Mr. Flueck said."
4328,"Entry-level perks represent early steps in cultivating loyalty. IHG Hotels & Resorts, parent of InterContinental and Holiday Inn brands, says it now has more than 100 million members in its IHG Rewards Club and that loyalty members are seven times more likely to book directly with the hotel company — saving fees that otherwise go to middlemen — and stay 20 percent longer than nonmembers."
4329,"At its basic membership level, guests get free Wi-Fi and rates up to 5 percent off when booked at the hotel’s website, as well as access to special sales."
4330,"For the past two years, Hilton Honors has offered points pooling to its nearly 82 million members, allowing family or friends to combine their points and put them toward a trip. Basic membership includes lower rates when booked directly and the use of the Hilton Honors app to check in, choose a room or order extra pillows."
4331,Airline programs are notorious for raising thresholds for redemptions and in some cases inflating membership minimums.
4332,"“Airlines have led the pack in increasing the amount of miles needed for rewards,” Mr. Kelly said. “There’s a constantly moving goal-post.”"
4333,"This year, American’s AAdvantage program and United’s MileagePlus announced they will raise the threshold for top-tier status to $15,000 spent in qualifying dollars from $12,000 (qualifying dollars depend on the fare paid; some sale fares may earn fewer points than full-priced fares)."
4334,American’s mixed bag of changes includes now offering a point per mile spent on tickets with its foreign partners such as British Airways and Japan Airlines. But the carrier is also reducing points earned for many of its own economy flights from 1.5 per mile to one per mile. 
4335,"In 2019, United is also knocking back its reward rate on some economy tickets, to 1.5 per mile from two per mile."
4336,"For elite Delta SkyMiles holders, one key benefit was just yanked. Delta limited access to its Delta Sky Club airport lounges to qualifying members flying Delta that day; previously elite level fliers could use the lounges even if they were flying on a competitor. "
4337,"Last spring, Southwest Airlines announced that the cheapest fares redeemed with its Rapid Rewards points would cost about 6 percent more in points, but that its more expensive refundable Anytime fares would cost about 22 percent less. "
4338,"As these points usually lose value each year, experts warn against hoarding."
4339,"“Don’t hold onto these points,” Mr. Rowan said. “Spend how it makes sense to you, feel good about it and don’t look back.”"
4340,"Most hotels and airlines also have branded credit cards that can offer entry level perks, like a free night or early boarding on flights. Many competing bank cards also reward points that can be transferred to travel partners for free nights and flights."
4341,"“There’s this massive rewards race with credit cards,” Mr. Kelly said. “If you’re paying with cash, you’re leaving money on the table.”"
4342,"New credit card offers are rampant, including aboard American Airlines flights where flight attendants recently passed out credit card applications offering 50,000 points — enough for a round-trip ticket to Europe — after spending $2,500 within three months."
4343,"Hotels.com, an online travel agency that offers discount hotel bookings, recently launched a credit card partnership with Capitol One Venture and VentureOne cards that gives 10 points per dollar spent on bookings through the website."
4344,"Still, most points hawks recommend using a credit card that allows points transfers as a hedge against redemption inflation."
4345,"“Points that are transferable are resistant to devaluation,” said Alex Miller, the chief executive and founder of UpgradedPoints.com. “If you only have American miles, they can devalue overnight. If you’re collecting Chase points and can use one of 13 airline and hotel transfer partners, you have more options and when one devalues, you can transfer to others.”"
4346,"Join the program of any hotel you may book. There is no fee, and basic membership usually offers rate discounts and freebies like Wi-Fi to members."
4347,"When it comes to redeeming hotel points, even if you have a low balance, look for cash-plus-points offers or programs like Hilton Honors that allow you to pool points with friends or family."
4348,"Join the frequent-flier programs of every airline you fly, whether frequently or not. Even low-points balances can be used for shopping programs. For free flights faster, consider an airline-branded credit card to add to the point balance and to gain perks like early boarding."
4349,"If you do accrue a balance that’s the equivalent of a free ticket, spend those points before they lose value."
4350,"For most flexibility in travel, look for credit cards with travel rewards that allow holders to transfer their balances to many airlines and hotel companies."

4352,"Airport food has long conjured images of limp, overpriced Caesar salads and refrigerator-case turkey wraps. But as terminals across the country modernize, and the demand for local food grows, the number of destination-worthy airport outposts offering food you’ll want to eat has been steadily growing."
4353,"The most recent example opened in January. The Manufactory Food Hall at San Francisco International Airport now offers fast-casual representations of cuisine from four notable local chefs and bakers: Pim Techamuanvivit of Thai restaurant Kin Khao, Gabriela Camara of Cala, and Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson of Tartine Bakery. Instead of soggy french fries and overcooked burgers, travelers in the International Terminal can order sandwiches on Tartine bread, gluten-free Thai fried chicken boxes and curry soups, and Mexico City-style tacos. The hall also features freshly baked pastries, Tartine’s coffee and a full bar."
4354,"“When we were first approached about this, my knee-jerk reaction was, ‘Never!’” said Ms. Prueitt, citing concerns about quality control. “But I started thinking about who we could collaborate with, how we could effectively translate our food to this environment. That made it a much more interesting venture.”"
4355,"Opening a restaurant anywhere is difficult. Opening in the airport is a whole new level of hard: Unfamiliar security systems and supply chains, concern over operational control and the fear of brand misrepresentation are just the immediate hurdles. But the potential for such exposure — from a captive and hungry audience, no less — along with a new willingness of airport food service operators to meet chefs’ demands has made the prospect more appealing."
4356,"For Ms. Prueitt, the chance to work with other local chefs made the proposition realistic and exciting. All of the chefs operate out of Tartine’s San Francisco commissary kitchen, butchering, slow-roasting and fermenting their goods before delivering them to the airport. Ms. Prueitt makes weekly visits to catch up with staff and personally taste everything."
4357,"When Rick Bayless opened Tortas Frontera in Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport in 2011, it meant giving up a good amount of control. The vast majority of airport restaurants domestically are run by third-party operators and staffed by their employees; the Manufactory is run by SSP, while Tortas Frontera’s three O’Hare locations are under the purview HMSHost. For chefs, that means a different kind of oversight is required."
4358,"“We have two full-time employees in our organization that go to every one of the places in the airport, twice a week, and make sure that everything is up to our standards,” says Mr. Bayless. “That’s how we’re successful — we commit the labor to it.”"
4359,"That commitment, and willingness to work with airport-specific challenges, is necessary. Employees require security badges to get to work. Deliveries follow a tight schedule; chefs can’t decide, on a whim, that they’d like a certain product."
4360,"However, operators have become more agile to chef demands (Mr. Bayless, for example, wanted to use ingredients from his favorite purveyors), and have built up their own infrastructures as this demand and interest has grown. HMSHost established a partnership with the James Beard Foundation and has built out its own chef staff, said Stephanie Havard, executive vice president of restaurant development."
4361,"“We’ve been hiring people from streetside restaurants that are very connected to the culinary world,” Ms. Havard says of their expansion. “We now have an operations team of more than 30 chefs who have worked with everyone from Todd English to Bobby Flay. It’s given us the ability to speak ‘chef’s speak,’ and to really connect with these local chefs.”"
4362,"The new food destinations in San Francisco and Chicago are far from alone. A Denver favorite, Root Down, opened a location at Denver International Airport in 2013; an outpost of the Denver Central Market opened there last November. Minneapolis–Saint Paul has locations of Black Sheep Pizza, Salty Tart and Angel Food Bakery. Phoenix, along with Seattle-Tacoma and New Orleans, have terminal modernization projects underway, with new local food options planned."
4363,"Portland International Airport, in addition to hosting locations of Blue Star Donuts, Kenny and Zuke’s, and The Country Cat, also provides travelers a tasting room for a local distillery, Westward Whiskey, which sells tasting flights and cocktails alongside bottles for sale."
4364,"“It’s been one of the most successful things we’ve ever done,” says Thomas Mooney, the distillery’s chief executive and co-owner. “We have the opportunity to connect with more than 40,000 people in a really immersive way.”"
4365,"And some food-minded travelers will adjust their itineraries for the sake of visiting a certain restaurant. April Oed Hamilton, a food educator and writer based in Baton Rouge, La., says she flies into San Francisco, instead of the more convenient San Jose Airport, when visiting a sister who lives in Santa Cruz."
4366,“Anything for that Tartine morning bun!” she said.
4367,"In fact, Mr. Bayless says that Tortas Frontera at O’Hare has more regular customers than his downtown restaurants."
4368,"“I swear, my tombstone is going to read, ‘He Made Good Food at the Airport!’” he said. “People are just so happy to have good food when traveling.”"

4370,"WASHINGTON — John R. Bolton found himself last weekend in a familiar but dangerous spot: cleaning up after his boss announced the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria — a decision that rattled allies and threw America’s Middle East policy into turmoil."
4371,But Mr. Bolton is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to President Trump’s sudden move.
4372,"As the president’s national security adviser, Mr. Bolton has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could have fleshed out the troop decision with timetables, conditions and a counterterrorism strategy for after the troops leave. Under Mr. Bolton’s management, senior administration officials said, the National Security Council staff had “zero” role in brokering a debate over America’s future in Syria."
4373,"Mr. Bolton, officials said, was surprised by the timing of Mr. Trump’s announcement, which contradicted his own pledge in September to keep American troops in Syria. Faced with the president’s abrupt declaration, which drew howls of protest from Congress and concerned phone calls from allies like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Bolton felt compelled to talk his boss into slowing down the process, these officials said."
4374,Then Mr. Bolton had to cobble together a withdrawal strategy that would normally have taken shape over weeks or months and laid the groundwork for Mr. Trump’s decision — not hastily followed it.
4375,"After Mr. Bolton presented the details in Israel on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed back on reports that he and his adviser were out of sync. “We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!” he said in a tweet on Monday, firing at a report in The New York Times rather than at Mr. Bolton."
4376,"If Mr. Trump did not repudiate his adviser, the daylight between their words captured the tricky path that Mr. Bolton, 70, a former official in the George W. Bush administration who long occupied the hawkish fringe of the Republican Party, has walked since entering the White House last April."
4377,"Mr. Bolton himself famously battled with the bureaucracy in Mr. Bush’s State Department. But the discordant messages laid bare a national security process that, officials say, has shrunk to little more than the instincts of an impulsive president."
4378,"There is not much Mr. Bolton can do to temper his boss. Mr. Trump’s erratic style and habit of undermining his advisers has already driven out the secretaries of state and defense, as well as Mr. Bolton’s predecessor, H. R. McMaster. Mr. McMaster held many more meetings than Mr. Bolton and was still routinely blindsided by Mr. Trump’s tweets."
4379,"“Bolton is trying to salvage the situation, but he’s unable to do so, because everyone in the region will question whether he is speaking for himself or for the president,” said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel now at the Council on Foreign Relations."
4380,"Mr. Bolton, officials said, has put his energy into keeping the ear of the president. His strategy has worked on some issues, like withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, but less so on others, like maintaining a presence in Syria to counter Iranian influence — something Mr. Bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president decided to pull out."
4381,"Mr. Bolton was not the only official to urge Mr. Trump to slow down on Syria. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the same argument, as did Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and American military commanders who met with Mr. Trump during his holiday visit to the troops in Iraq. Mr. Netanyahu called Mr. Trump to pass along the view that it is in Israel’s interest for the United States to maintain a presence in the region, according to an Israeli official."
4382,"Mr. Trump’s aides “have created on the back end the process that you would normally have on the front end,” said Derek H. Chollet, a Pentagon official under President Barack Obama."
4383,"“In normal times,” Mr. Chollet said, “you would have a discussion on a proposed decision that would lead to the decision, and you would discuss how to implement one. But now, the process is such that once you get policy guidance from the president in the form of a tweet, you reverse-engineer a process.”"
4384,"Another example of this was North Korea, where Mr. Trump decided to halt military exercises and informed the Pentagon afterward. Defense Department officials quietly continued the exercises but just did not refer to them as exercises."
4385,"White House officials said Mr. Bolton came into his job determined to streamline the National Security Council, which they said had become bloated during the Obama administration, with functions that often overlapped those of the agencies. They insist his approach was welcomed: During his first breakfast with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, one official said, Mr. Mattis asked Mr. Bolton to hold fewer meetings."
4386,"But there is a long distance between standard-issue jokes about too many meetings and eliminating them completely. Pentagon officials said Mr. Bolton did away with much of the process put in place by Mr. McMaster, a retired three-star Army general, who placed great emphasis on meetings, where everyone got a say."
4387,"Mr. Bolton’s preference, one official said, is to have one-on-one conversations with cabinet members or other senior officials directly, rather than in a group or on a conference call. He maintains more control of the process that way, this person said."
4388,"Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, has taken advantage of this channel, according to another Pentagon official. He has not hesitated to call Mr. Bolton directly, something that Mr. Mattis apparently did not do as much. He tended to relay questions through his recently departed chief of staff, Kevin Sweeney."
4389,"The National Security Council engaged in “reverse engineering” under Mr. McMaster as well. But officials said the trend had gotten worse under Mr. Bolton, in part because he did not trust the national-security bureaucracy and saw no reason to include it in policymaking."
4390,"Mr. Bolton is also handicapped by not having a deputy, who traditionally coordinates policy debates. He has yet to replace Mira Ricardel, an official who was forced out of the White House after she clashed with the first lady, Melania Trump."
4391,"Unlike in the past, when the National Security Council was the president’s clearing ground for security policy, one official said that the N.S.C. under Mr. Bolton was best described as another voice at a table crowded with advisers vying for influence with Mr. Trump."
4392,"By all accounts, Mr. Bolton has a better relationship with the president than Mr. McMaster did. He also gets along with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and with Mr. Pompeo, though officials said the secretary acted as a “buzz saw” toward some of his harder-edged ideas about Iran."
4393,"Mr. Bolton stumbled early in his tenure when he almost derailed a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, by suggesting that Libya would be a good model for nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea (the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, was ousted and killed a decade after he agreed to give up his weapons)."
4394,"With Mr. Pompeo taking the lead on North Korea, Mr. Bolton has carved out a sideline on issues relating to American sovereignty — an issue he has championed for decades as a fixture in conservative foreign policy circles. He spoke recently about the need to overhaul the nation’s foreign assistance programs and threatened judges on the International Criminal Court with sanctions if they investigated American troops in Afghanistan."
4395,"That policy had not even fully cleared the review process when Mr. Bolton announced it at the Federalist Society, an N.S.C. official said. But he felt so confident that his views were in sync with Mr. Trump’s that he went ahead and called the court “ineffective, unaccountable, and indeed, outright dangerous.”"
4396,"Mr. Bolton sometimes gestures to a photo in his office that shows President George H.W. Bush huddling in the Oval Office with a small circle of national security aides, as an example of the ideal way to manage foreign policy."
4397,"Despite being a contemporary of Mr. Trump’s, however, Mr. Bolton is not a member of his inner circle. He does not have the same relationship with Mr. Trump that he had with Mr. Bush. Sometimes, with aides, the president refers to him as “Mike Bolton.”"
4398,"WASHINGTON — President Trump stormed out of a White House meeting with congressional leaders on Wednesday after Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not fund a border wall even if he agreed to reopen the government, escalating a confrontation that has shuttered large portions of the government for 19 days and counting."
4399,Stunned Democrats emerged from the meeting in the White House Situation Room declaring that the president had thrown a “temper tantrum” and slammed his hands on the table before leaving with an abrupt “bye-bye.” Republicans disputed the hand slam and blamed Democratic intransigence for prolonging the standoff.
4400,"When the meeting was over, talks to reopen the government appeared to be in disarray. The contentious, brief and futile session underscored an impasse that is looking each day like an insurmountable gulf between the two sides. Mr. Trump will visit the border on Thursday in McAllen, Tex., leaving little hope of a resolution for a shutdown that will tie the longest in the nation’s history on Friday."
4401,"“It wasn’t even a high-stakes negotiation; it was a petulant president of the United States,” Ms. Pelosi said as she returned to the Capitol. “A person who would say, ‘I’ll keep government shut down for weeks, months or years unless I get my way.’”"
4402,Mr. Trump called the exercise “a total waste of time.”
4403,[View our story on the longest government shutdowns ever.]
4404,"“I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye,” he posted on Twitter."
4405,"The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected."
4406,"Day 19 had begun with what looked like signs of splintering support within the president’s own party. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, pledged to confront Mr. Trump in a closed-door lunch at the Capitol, while more mainline conservatives like Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, expressed misgivings about the president’s strategy."
4407,"Though Senate Republicans had not yet reached a breaking point, Mr. Roberts said, “We’re getting pretty close.”"
4408,"But those differences largely had been papered over by day’s end. The House voted 240 to 188 to fund the Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies, including White House operations. The eight Republican defections exceeded last week’s vote to fund the government by only a single vote."
4409,"Mr. Trump, for his part, held out the possibility that he might declare a national emergency to build his promised border wall and circumvent Congress altogether — a deeply divisive option even within his own party that could allow him to use money allocated for the military and one that would almost certainly be challenged in court."
4410,"“There was no discussion about anything other than solidarity,” Mr. Trump said after his lunch with Senate Republicans and before the White House negotiating session."
4411,"As the sides feuded, 800,000 federal workers were going without pay, and government agencies continued to reduce services, part of the cascading effect of a partial shutdown now possibly headed for a fourth week."
4412,"So frayed were feelings after a frantic 24-hour period of accusations and recriminations, including dueling nationally televised addresses, that Republicans and Democrats emerged from the White House meeting unable to agree on what had happened in the room."
4413,"On this they did: Mr. Trump insisted again on $5.7 billion in border wall funding, and asked Democrats, who he pointed out have supported money for physical barriers in the past, if they would capitulate if he agreed to reopen the government. Democrats told him again that they support increased funding for border security, but refused to commit additional money for a physical barrier that they believe is a waste of money. They laid out what they said was unnecessary damage being done to federal workers."
4414,"“You are using people as leverage; why won’t you open the government and stop hurting people?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, asked Mr. Trump at one point during the meeting, according to Democratic congressional officials and a White House official familiar with the exchange."
4415,"“Then you won’t give me what I want,” Mr. Trump replied, the congressional officials said. The White House official said that Mr. Trump added, “I am trying to do the right thing for the country. This isn’t about politics.”"
4416,"But there are signs of strain. After his lunch with Senate Republicans, Mr. Trump declared that the party was “totally unified,” even if he faced some questions about “strategy.”"
4417,"Leading up to it, though, the number of Republicans uneasy about the president’s tactics appeared to be growing. Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia and the chairwoman of the appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, had warned on Tuesday that she could potentially support reopening the government as talks continued on border security — the Democratic position."
4418,How the number of people affected compares to different American companies and industries.
4419,"“I mean, I think I could live with that,” Ms. Capito said. She said she expected pressure from federal employees and voters in her state would only mount the longer the impasse drags on. “I’ve expressed more than a few times the frustrations with a government shutdown and how useless it is, so that pressure’s going to build,” she said."
4420,"Ms. Murkowski had vowed to confront the president on the shutdown’s effect on her state. She and other moderate Republicans entered the lunch confident that senators were coalescing around the idea that the government should be reopened, but they left disappointed, convinced that for now, the party would follow Mr. Trump perilously further into a shutdown with an uncertain end."
4421,"A handful of them, including Ms. Murkowski and Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine and James Lankford of Oklahoma, pressed Mr. Trump on the mounting burden on federal workers and related industries in their states. His response was consistent."
4422,"“I was able to raise the issues that I have with using a shutdown,” Ms. Murkowski said. “He listened and urged that we all stick together.”"
4423,"Several senators, including Ms. Collins, sought to find a way out of the impasse through a broader deal. In the meeting, she urged the president to reconsider an earlier deal that would have given him $25 billion for a wall in exchange for permanent protections for young undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children, according to Republicans familiar with the exchange."
4424,"The president dismissed the idea. A handful of senators huddled Wednesday evening with the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, to hash over possible ways out of the impasse. But no apparent progress was made."
4425,"For now, at least, the president seems to have maintained support for his uncompromising position."
4426,"“He’s like the Missouri mule who sits down in the mud and says, ‘I’m not moving,’” said Senator John Kennedy, Republican of Louisiana."
4427,"Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, said Mr. Trump had made the case that Republicans had a much better chance of prevailing if they remained united in opposition to spending bills to get the government funded again."
4428,“What did Benjamin Franklin say at the constitutional convention?” Mr. Cornyn told reporters. “We need to hang together or we’ll hang separately. That’s what it reminded me of.”
4429,"Democrats, who are confident Mr. Trump is taking the brunt of the blame for the impasse, showed little sign of capitulation. The House vote to fund financial agencies and the White House was the first of several this week on individual spending bills that are intended to pick off uneasy Republicans. But in the end, it drew only one more Republican than a vote last week to reopen the government. A White House official said Wednesday that Mr. Trump would veto any such bill."
4430,"In the Senate, Democrats had managed to grind to a stop unrelated foreign policy legislation to increase pressure on Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, to relent on his insistence that he will not put any bill to reopen the government up for a vote there without Mr. Trump’s support."
4431,"Democrats offered other warnings to the White House. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, said he had warned Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, in a private meeting that a national emergency declaration by Mr. Trump would constitute a “major breach” of relations between the Pentagon and Congress."
4432,"Mr. McConnell continued publicly to insist that the dispute was for Democrats and the president to solve. He has largely absented himself from negotiations, and did not speak during Wednesday’s White House session, a position that appeared to be validated on Tuesday by a Politico and Morning Consult poll that found only 5 percent of respondents blamed congressional Republicans for the impasse, compared with 47 percent who blamed Mr. Trump and 33 percent who blamed congressional Democrats."
4433,"“I cannot urge my Democratic colleagues more strongly to get past this purely partisan spite, rediscover their own past positions on border security and negotiate a fair solution with our president to secure our nation and reopen all of the federal government,” Mr. McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor."
4434,"WALK THIS WAY Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever By Geoff Edgers"
4435,"In 2017 Nielsen Music reported that hip-hop and R & B had officially surpassed rock as America’s most-consumed genre. The news elicited international headlines, but for many of us it elicited a yawn. Who didn’t know by then that hip-hop was not just — to cite the rapper Nas, the comedian Katt Williams and countless pundits of the past decade — “as American as apple pie,” but one of America’s greatest exports: a music, culture and ethos that lives and breathes from California to Cape Town, New York to New Delhi?"
4436,"It wasn’t always so, of course. Such is the premise of Geoff Edgers’ “Walk This Way: Run-DMC, Aerosmith, and the Song That Changed American Music Forever,” which argues that before the July 4, 1986, release of the hit in his title — one of the first rap songs played on mainstream radio, the genre’s first in the Billboard Top 10 — almighty hip-hop was merely “a small underground community of independent labels and scrappy promoters.” As Edgers, the national arts reporter for The Washington Post, tells it, the crossover rap-rock tune “made it safe to be black and mainstream,” “proved that hip-hop, dismissed by many as a fad, had legs” and became “so many things to so many different people, from bar mitzvah boys in Westchester County to Ice-T.” It accomplished that, essentially, by being “hip-hop’s Trojan horse, the music camouflaged enough to give timid programmers permission to play”; this fomented a movement like the Harlem Renaissance and San Francisco’s Summer of Love, one that “crossed geographical, economic and, most important, racial lines.”"
4437,"All of this is well-trod territory. There has been no dearth of ink spilled about Run-DMC, Aerosmith or hip-hop’s rise to cultural domination. So in a book that is occasionally hyperbolic yet fastidiously thorough — sometimes too thorough: “Walk This Way” grew from a long-form article and often feels better suited as one, unless you’re enthralled by the nitty-gritty of industry insider-ness — Edgers carves out a niche by creating in narrative fashion the very mash-up he’s documenting, merging two racial and spatial histories just as Run-DMC and Aerosmith’s hit fused disparate sounds and scenes."
4438,"On the one hand, there’s the sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll story of Bronx-raised Steven Tallarico, joining forces with Joe Perry in ’70s-era Boston to become Steven Tyler of Aerosmith. Edgers pegs the two as polar opposites: While “Perry has his personality knob set on permanent mumble,” Tyler “blasts into a conversation. He makes up words and phrases and draws on entire waiting rooms of personalities. He dances across decades, cities and relationships.” They made an electrifying onstage duo — until they fell victim to the clichés of rock stardom, battling addiction and going from filling stadiums to grasping at straws for a hit."
4439,"Meanwhile, over in early-’80s New York — Hollis, Queens, to be exact: far from the white college bars of Boston but still “an urban oasis compared to the burned-out brick buildings of the Bronx” — Joseph Simmons (Run) and Darryl McDaniels (DMC) joined forces with Jason Mizell, a.k.a. Jam Master Jay, to garner fame as Run-DMC. Hip-hop was still, as the music mogul Lyor Cohen says, “a powerful little secret running through America,” but it was bubbling to the surface — Blondie’s 1981 hit “Rapture” name-checked the hip-hop pioneer Fab 5 Freddy and featured him in its video; a popular trio of white kids called the Beastie Boys endearingly wedded hip-hop mettle with adolescent impishness; and Run-DMC released the first rap album to go gold — before falling prey to internal battles incited by the myriad hustles of an underground industry."
4440,"Into this mix — “a pair of pale-faced rockers itching for a fix, a trio of black kids still trying to figure out why they were there” — enters the producer Rick Rubin: hip-hop’s unlikely poster child. The Long Island-raised Rubin was a proud suburbanite blithe about street cred; “his drug of choice,” Edgers writes, “was the General Tso’s chicken that flowed into his dorm room” at N.Y.U. Thinking of hip-hop as black punk rock, Rubin partnered with Russell Simmons (Run’s brother) to form the iconic label Def Jam. The mission was to capture the genre’s live-show energy on record, and also to transform a hit rock song released by Aerosmith in 1975 into a strange-bedfellows crossover duet."
4441,"Edgers gives us the hyper-amusing blow-by-blow of just how this duet came alive, from the back-and-forth of lyrical expletives in the studio — Run called Tyler’s lyrics “hillbilly gibberish” — to the recording of a music video that is both harbinger and metaphor for the song’s legacy: Here were the two groups literally breaking down the wall between them so they could rock out — rap out? — together. And the rest is hip-hop history."
4442,"Or is it? After “Walk This Way,” Aerosmith’s ninth studio album sold five million copies and returned them to stadium-show status. Rubin was crowned “King of Rap” on the cover of The Village Voice. Run-DMC, however, found themselves embroiled in more in-house battles and lawsuits, and though their legacy as hip-hop godfathers is well enshrined, their 1988 “Tougher Than Leather” album was not the commercial smash that Aerosmith’s release was."
4443,"There is an elephant in the room here, one that Edgers signals toward but ought to face squarely. What does it say about American culture that for an African-American art form to receive its due it had to not just seek white validation but cloak itself in the trappings of whiteness? How is it that the biggest immediate winners in the story were not the black rappers but the white rockers and the white producer?"
4444,"These are rhetorical questions; anyone mildly familiar with American cultural history knows the dynamics at play here. When Edgers casually compares “Walk This Way” to the “historic” moment when “Elvis thrust his pelvis on ‘The Milton Berle Show’ 30 years earlier,” there’s that elephant again: Is anyone more representative of the long legacy of white appropriation of black art forms than Elvis? In rock ’n’ roll it was a shameless, easy process: white artists covering songs by black artists, then earning the money and credit."
4445,"But wait, you say. In hip-hop it has not been so shameless and easy. Scores of black originators in the genre then and now continue to earn their due. And anyway, hip-hop is not simply “black” but creole: Latinos were vital to its inception; broadly speaking, hip-hop culture was, as Fab 5 Freddy says to Edgers, akin to American pop culture itself: “a collaborative effort between blacks, Jews and Italians, particularly in New York.”"
4446,"This is true. But it is also why hip-hop narratives, like the “Walk This Way” saga, continue to hold so much appeal, almost as America’s national fable: They reinforce the myth of the American dream. The myth that an empire of wealth can grow from dorm rooms (but never mind the price tag on those dorm rooms and thus the color and class of most people inhabiting them). The myth that America is a melting pot of hybrid peoples coming together to produce beautiful cultures (but never mind that such a process has been governed by racist, capitalist-driven power dynamics that continue to benefit some more than others)."
4447,"There is something anachronistic, especially in a Black Lives Matter era, about recounting hip-hop history without more than a nod to these realities. Edgers tells the story with incredulity — behold how one song changed American music! — but in the context of American history the ending is actually an inevitability: If it hadn’t been hip-hop it would have been something else, because as Ralph Ellison pointed out in his famed Time magazine essay “What America Would Be Like Without Blacks,” American culture is African-American culture and vice versa. How this process has played out and for whose benefit, how its reality has been negated by whole swaths of America — including a current president who omits hip-hop from his inauguration because it’s not right for the “typically and traditionally American event” — these are the issues demanding the attention of hip-hop historians of the here and now."
4448,Ethel Ennis was in bed one night in the mid-1950s when Billie Holiday called.
4449,"Ms. Ennis was in her mid-20s at the time, a jazz vocalist on the rise and, like Holiday, a product of Baltimore. At first she figured it was a prank call. But she quickly recognized Holiday’s dusty voice."
4450,"“You have a great voice; you don’t fake it,” she later remembered Holiday saying. “Keep it up and you’ll be famous.”"
4451,"Ms. Ennis soon fulfilled Holiday’s prophecy — but only for a short time. She recorded for major labels in the late 1950s and the ’60s; toured Europe with Benny Goodman; performed onstage alongside Miles Davis, John Coltrane and Louis Armstrong; and appeared on television with Duke Ellington. She became a regular on Arthur Godfrey’s TV show and headlined the Newport Jazz Festival. In 1961 she won the Playboy jazz poll for best female singer."
4452,"But she soon grew disillusioned with the demands placed on young divas, and she eschewed national celebrity for a quieter life in her hometown. She became a beloved performer and jazz advocate there, earning the unofficial title of Baltimore’s “First Lady of Jazz.”"
4453,"“They had it all planned out for me,” she told  The Washington Post in 1979, referring to the music executives in charge of her career. “I’d ask, ‘When do I sing?’ and they’d say, ‘Shut up and have a drink. You should sit like this and look like that and play the game of bed partners.’ You really had to do things that go against your grain for gain. I wouldn’t.”"
4454,She added: “I want to do it my way. I have no regrets.”
4455,"Ms. Ennis’s performances reflected her convictions. She sang in a sturdy, beaming voice that was quite different from Holiday’s tattered-silk purr."
4456,"She drew inspiration from crooners like Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, but her vocals were a touch less stagy, more direct. Her readings of popular songs and standards had as much in common with Etta James’s effulgent soul singing as with Fitzgerald’s elegant diction."
4457,"Ms. Ennis died on Feb. 17 at her home in Baltimore at 86. Gary Ellerbe, a Baltimore radio host and friend of Ms. Ennis’s, said the cause was complications of a stroke."
4458,"She is survived by her husband, Earl Arnett, and her younger brother, the saxophonist Andy Ennis, who played in Ray Charles’s band for 10 years before settling down, like her, in Baltimore. A previous marriage ended in divorce."
4459,"Ethel Llewellyn Ennis was born in Baltimore on Nov. 28, 1932, and grew up in the Gilmor Homes, a newly constructed public housing project in the West Baltimore neighborhood. She was raised primarily by her mother, Arabell, who played piano and organ in storefront churches, and by her maternal grandmother. Both caretakers were strict Methodists who refused to play jazz and blues in the house. But the music came thumping through the floor from the apartment below, and Ethel grew to love it."
4460,"She learned piano and began playing at the Ames United Methodist Church. At age 15, she started playing in nightclubs around town with an otherwise all-male band. When an audience member one night requested a blues song that required a female singer, she stepped up and sang it. It was a turning point."
4461,"“I sang and got the applause,” she told The Post. “I said, ‘Oh my,’ because I couldn’t sing that at home.”"
4462,"Ms. Ennis became a mainstay of the Red Fox, a club on Baltimore’s main black entertainment strip along Pennsylvania Avenue. She was just 22 when she recorded her debut album, “Lullabies for Losers,” featuring the pianist Hank Jones and the drummer Kenny Clarke, for the Jubilee label."
4463,"That recording prompted the call from Holiday and a deal with Capitol Records. Ella Fitzgerald soon stated that Ms. Ennis was her favorite young vocalist, and Frank Sinatra called her “my kind of singer.”"
4464,"Capitol released her album “Change of Scenery” in 1957 and followed it with “Have You Forgotten” a year later. In the mid-’60s Ms. Ennis put out four LPs on RCA. But rather than lean into her stardom, she decided to marry Mr. Arnett in 1967 (violating Maryland’s anti-miscegenation laws) and buy a house in central Baltimore."
4465,"She briefly landed back in the spotlight in 1973, when she sang the national anthem at President Richard M. Nixon’s second inaugural. A blizzard of media opportunities followed. Within days, she was invited onto the “Today” show and the nationally syndicated radio program “Monitor.” Her album “The 10 Sides of Ethel Ennis” was rushed into release."
4466,"But she continued to focus on the home front. In the 1970s she appeared on a children’s show on Maryland Public Television. From 1984 to 1988 she and Mr. Arnett ran Ethel’s Place, a jazz club in central Baltimore."
4467,In her final decades Ms. Ennis played about a dozen shows a year around the Mid-Atlantic region and released a few albums. She never stopped expanding her repertoire.
4468,"“If Women Ruled the World,” released in 1998 on the Savoy Jazz label, found her performing songs by Joan Armatrading, Joni Mitchell, Tracy Chapman and others."
4469,"That album’s final track, “Hey You,” is an original composition with a chorus that amounts to a statement of beliefs:"
4470,"Hey you, are you doing what you want to do? "
4471,"Yes you, are you doing what you want to do? "
4472,"‘Cause life’s a treasure, time’s a measure "

4475,"WASHINGTON — When Andrew Wheeler, President Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, testified before Senators on Wednesday at his confirmation hearing, he found himself walking a tightrope on the issue of climate change."
4476,"One of the most pointed moments came shortly after he told senators that climate change was not “the greatest crisis” facing our planet. Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, then asked Mr. Wheeler, a former coal-industry lobbyist, to rate his level of concern on a scale of one to 10. "
4477,"After a pause, Mr. Wheeler said, “about eight or nine.”"
4478,“Really?” Mr. Merkley responded.
4479,Senator Merkley and other Democrats on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works took pains to focus in on Mr. Wheeler’s efforts to roll back environmental protections and undo Obama-era regulations designed to fight climate change as indicators that he is unsuitable to lead the E.P.A.
4480,"President Trump formally nominated Mr. Wheeler last week to lead the agency but he has been on the job in an acting capacity since his predecessor, Scott Pruitt, resigned in July amid ethics scandals. If Mr. Wheeler is confirmed, a strong likelihood with Republicans holding a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate, he will formally become one of the top soldiers in Mr. Trump’s battle to undo regulations."
4481,"“There is no more important responsibility than protecting human health and the environment,” Mr. Wheeler told lawmakers. “It is a responsibility I take very seriously.” At the same time, he said, the E.P.A. under his leadership has pushed forward with Mr. Trump’s agenda of deregulation."
4482,"“Through our deregulatory actions, the Trump Administration has proven that burdensome federal regulations are not necessary to drive environmental progress,” he said."
4483,"Since July, Mr. Wheeler has replaced of a broad plan to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, known as the Clean Power Plan, with weaker rules. He has proposed to relax federal protections for streams and wetlands, ease controls of mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, and eliminate restrictions on new coal plants, a move that would make it easier to bring more coal power online."
4484,"Under Mr. Wheeler’s leadership the E.P.A. also has proposed reversing Mr. Obama’s clean car standards, one of the most important federal government tools for reducing planet-warming emissions. The plan also challenges the right of California and other states to set their own, more restrictive standards. "
4485,"Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works panel, said he expected the committee to vote on Mr. Wheeler’s confirmation in February and, soon after, bring the vote to the Senate floor. "
4486,"But if the hearing itself is any indication, Mr. Wheeler could be in for a rocky tenure. His opening remarks, given as the government entered its 26th day of a partial shutdown, were nearly drowned out by demonstrators shouting “Shut down Wheeler, not the E.P.A.” The protesters were escorted out of the hearing room by Capitol Police officers as Mr. Wheeler began speaking."
4487,"“Mr. Wheeler is certainly not the ethically bereft embarrassment that Scott Pruitt proved to be,” Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, said in his opening remarks. At the same time, he and other lawmakers pressed Mr. Wheeler on the string of regulatory rollbacks as well as his and Mr. Trump’s positions on climate change."
4488,"“The scientific community has said the threat of climate change is one of the great crises facing our planet,” Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said. “Do you agree?”"
4489,"Mr. Wheeler said he believed that climate change is occurring, and that humans have an effect. But he told the committee: “I would not call it the greatest crisis, no sir. I would call it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally.”"
4490,It was after that exchange that he made his remark to Mr. Merkley putting his level of concern at “eight or nine.”
4491,"Mr. Wheeler was asked several times by Democrats if he would denounce Mr. Trump’s statement that climate change is a “hoax.” Mr. Wheeler responded, “I have not used the hoax word myself.”"
4492,"He said that the planet is warming and that mankind plays a role, making Mr. Wheeler one of the few members of the Trump administration to openly acknowledge the basics of established climate science. But he also said he had not familiarized himself with major scientific reports, including one conducted by 13 United States agencies, that warned rising global emissions are an urgent crisis."
4493,He said that the E.P.A. under his leadership was addressing the challenge of rising carbon emissions. Mr. Wheeler repeated the Trump administration’s finding that its plan to revise the Clean Power Plan would still reduce planet-warming emissions by 34 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. 
4494,"However, a Harvard University study published Tuesday disputed that, finding that the Trump administration’s plan would be worse for the planet than doing nothing at all. The study found that greenhouse gas emissions would “rebound” under the new policy by delaying the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Carbon emissions could rise in 18 states by as much as 8.7 percent by 2030, compared to having no carbon policy at all, the study found."
4495,"Mr. Wheeler pushed back against those numbers, saying, “That is not what the career people at the agency are telling me.” Later in the hearing he said. “I believe we are moving forward on a proactive basis.”"
4496,"He also addressed recent findings that carbon dioxide emissions have spiked in the United States over the past year. According to the findings, by the research firm Rhodium Group, emissions rose 3.4 percent in 2018. That’s the largest uptick in United States emissions in eight years."
4497,Mr. Wheeler has frequently pointed to the fact that greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 2.7 percent between 2016 and 2017 as proof that the Trump administration is protecting the environment while deregulating. Yet that dip occurred before Mr. Trump officially took office and it was largely driven by market forces.
4498,"On Wednesday, Mr. Wheeler said he attributed the recent surge to an exceptionally hot summer and cold winter but said he believed the larger downward trend would continue."
4499,"By day’s end, the environmental activists who filled the Senate hearing room said nothing had allayed their concerns that Mr. Wheeler would fail to protect clean air and water laws."
4500,"“I did not hear anything that makes me think anything different about his track record, which is that his actions at E.P.A. so far have been to undermine an scrap and kill protections,” said Molly Rauch, public health policy director at Moms Clean Air Force."
4501,"Mr. Wheeler won high praise, though, from Republicans for rolling back the so-called Waters of the United States rule, which many farmers opposed on the grounds that it would result in overly burdensome regulations. Senator Barrasso, the committee chairman, said Mr. Wheeler had done an “outstanding” job leading the E.P.A. over the past six months and praised him for “common sense regulatory proposals.”"

4503,"The double doors of the surgical intensive care unit opened into a hallway crowded with dozens of hospital employees. A hospital bed emerged, and we all fell silent."
4504,"Most beds roll out of the I.C.U. briskly, en route to radiology or an operating room, whirring with the beeps and blinks of monitors and the quick conversation of busy nurses."
4505,"This bed was different. It moved at a stately pace, and the team that accompanied it was changed as well. Nurses steered, but there was no chitchat this time. A tall anesthesiologist leaned over the head of the bed to squeeze a bag valve oxygen mask with clocklike regularity."
4506,"People in street clothes trailed close behind the bed, unsure of where to look. These were the parents of the young woman in the bed, the one we had all come to honor."
4507,This was an “honor walk” for a dying patient about to donate her organs to others.
4508,"Whether in Idaho or Tennessee or Oregon, hospitals across the United States are holding honor walks as dignified ways to honor each patient’s final contribution."
4509,"With the consent of loved ones, and with the operating room ready for organ donation to begin, hospital leadership invites all staff members to participate. In my hospital, the University of Vermont Medical Center, the clothing in the crowd reflected the different jobs we’d been pulled away from: There were white coats and ties, crumpled blue scrubs, bouffant surgical hats and expensive pinstripe suits. A priest who wore a neon pink Hawaiian shirt over his clerical collar looked up and down the hallway and smiled."
4510,"The honor walk takes place at an odd pause between life and death: Either brain death has been declared already in a donor whose heart still beats, or the donor’s heart will soon stop beating."
4511,"I looked at the woman in the bed. Her eyes were closed. Her skin was sallow. She wore the usual hospital gown and identity bracelet. IV tubing and telemetry wires still snaked onto the bed. It all looked so superfluous, there in the final minutes of a life whose exact end was already known."
4512,"An honor walk is a powerful act of community. Something solemn, even sacred, happens in those 15 minutes in the hallway. We wait and talk with people from all professions and all walks of life. Together, we honor a great sacrifice. We give thanks. We hope to help a grieving family in a moment of fathomless loss."
4513,"Jennifer DeMaroney is an organ donation coordinator who brought the honor walk to my hospital in an unconventional way. Instead of working the byzantine committees of a billion-dollar hospital bureaucracy, Ms. DeMaroney says she stormed in unannounced to the office of Eileen Whalen, the hospital’s president, with a photograph of another state’s honor walk, asking if we could do the same thing."
4514,"Ms. Whalen, a former trauma nurse and governing board chair of the Center for Donation and Transplant of New York and Vermont, approved our first honor walk on the spot."
4515,"Ms. Whalen said it was an easy decision. She wanted to provide grieving families with a way to give back, and for everyone to help those families endure their loss. She agreed with Ms. DeMaroney that the honor walk lets families know “we think the people who donate to save a life are heroes.”"
4516,"We need those heroes — desperately. The United Network for Organ Sharing estimates that more than 113,000 people are waiting to receive organ transplants. More people donate organs each year, but still, in 2017 over 6,500 people died while on the waiting list."
4517,"I spoke with Missy Holliday, organ operations director at LifeCenter in Cincinnati, where an honor walk garnered national social media attention. Ms. Holliday said LifeCenter began honor walks in December 2017 in response, in part, to intensive care unit nurses who wanted a way to honor former patients who donated. The staff has learned to place a chair in the hallway the day of an honor walk in case a family member needs a moment to sit and cry and receive support."
4518,And the ritual has entered the popular culture as well: Last week an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” adapted the hallway ceremony for a powerful scene involving a victim of sexual assault. 
4519,"Back in my hospital, as the young woman’s bed rolled out of sight, we knew a private ritual would soon begin. Somehow, her parents would say their final farewells. Then in a brightly lit operating room with all the high-tech tools of modern surgery at the ready, a masked surgeon would reach into a young woman’s still-warm body in order to turn one family’s devastating loss into new hope for numberless strangers."

4643,"Of the 103 pitches that Mets starter Zack Wheeler threw against the Nationals at Citi Field Sunday afternoon, only 51 of them were strikes."
4644,"He walked the first batter he faced on four pitches, and left the game with two outs in the fifth inning, having walked in a run and left the bases loaded. In all, he walked seven and was charged with just as many earned runs in a 12-9 loss."
4645,"“Embarrassing day for me,” said Wheeler, whose earned run average is now 10.24 after two starts. “That’s one of those that you just forget.”"
4646,"Wheeler will have to figure out what went wrong before moving forward, as will reliever Tim Peterson, who replaced Wheeler. Peterson threw a wild pitch to allow a run on his first throw. He went on to walk five Nationals in 1⅓ innings."
4647,"“We’ve got to throw the ball over the plate,” Manager Mickey Callaway said after his team dropped two of three over the weekend."
4648,"Wheeler, who went 10-1 in his final 12 starts last season, maintained that he felt fine physically, but his timing and mechanics were off. Callaway noted that Wheeler’s arm was “a tad late,” and that Wheeler needed to work on finding a consistent arm slot and release point during his bullpen session between starts."
4649,"“The command, the control, just too many walks,” Callaway said. “He’s a better strike thrower than that.”"
4650,"The Mets trailed 6-1 when Wheeler left the game, but the offense picked up in the late innings. While the Nationals roughed up Wheeler for five runs in the second, the Mets managed to break out with five runs of their own in the seventh."
4651,"Nationals starter Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, was unable to finish the seventh, and was charged with four runs. Still, he picked up the win to improve to 1-2 on the season."
4652,"Mets rookie Pete Alonso continued his hot start. With two runners on base, Alonso, who had doubled off Scherzer in the sixth, belted a three-run shot over the fence in left-center two batters after Scherzer left the game."
4653,"“We did a really good job of fighting in the later innings,” Alonso said. “Just us coming back from that deficit, I think that’s a special characteristic in a team.”"
4654,"While Wheeler struggled early on last year, he figured it all out in the second half. Callaway insisted the solution could be a familiar one."
4655,"“The good thing is we fixed it before,” Callaway said. “We’ll be able to fix it again.”"

4657,"Catcher Travis d’Arnaud was activated from the injured list, and reserve catcher Tomas Nido was optioned to Class AAA Syracuse."
4658,"D’Arnaud, who entered the game as a pinch-hitter in the seventh, returned to the majors less than a year after undergoing Tommy John surgery."
4659,"“It feels good,” said d’Arnaud, who grounded out to third in his first at-bat. “It was a long road. I’m very grateful to be back, and be back in the big leagues.”"
4660,"In this era of new and complex baseball statistics, a venerable one still pops up frequently in conversations among even the geekiest of stat-heads: batting average."
4661,"It’s one of the easiest to understand: .300 is good.; .200 is the Mendoza line — you don’t want to drop below that. If you want to praise a player, you’re likely to get more mileage with most fans by saying, “He’s hitting .280” than by citing his WAR or BABIP."
4662,"But as even some statistical Neanderthals know, batting average is a seriously flawed measure of offensive performance. It is great for evaluating a player’s ability to hit singles, but batters get no credit for their power, speed or batting eye."
4663,What if there were a statistic as easy to understand as batting average that accounted for the things that batting average does not?
4664,"Well, there is: It’s called secondary average, and it was invented by the influential statistician Bill James in the 1970s. Unlike many of James’s innovations, it has not caught on heavily with fans — you can’t find it in most stats websites or on the back of baseball cards."
4665,"But secondary average is a useful tool to quickly evaluate a player’s offense, identifying players who are underrated or overrated by batting average."
4666,"Secondary average looks and works a lot like batting average does. But rather than focusing on hit totals, it adds up the batter’s other offensive skills — extra bases, walks and stolen bases — and then divides by at-bats. (Some formulas for secondary average also include hit-by-pitch, and others reduce the total for being caught stealing. We’re using the simplest formula here.)"
4667,"Let’s use Dee Gordon of the Seattle Mariners as an example. He had a .268 batting average last season, 20 points higher than the league average (.248). But his secondary average was a mere .151 because he had very few extra-base hits and even fewer walks."

4723,"You don’t really have to learn a new scale to understand secondary average. It looks and works a lot like batting average: .300 is good, and .200 is not. Major leaguers collectively had a .248 batting average last season, and their overall secondary average was .271."
4724,"One difference is that the spectrum is much wider. While almost every player falls into the .200s or .300s in batting average, there are plenty of regular major leaguers with secondary averages in the .100s, and others over .400 or even .500."
4725,Here are the players who had the largest increase from their traditional batting average to their secondary average last season:
4726,"Of the players who qualified for the batting title last season, the leader in secondary average was Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels, with an eye-opening .626. Trout had a solid .312 batting average, but that hardly summed up his offense. He had a healthy number of extra-base hits, including 39 home runs; led the league in walks with 122; and stole 24 bases. Jose Ramirez of Cleveland (.524), and Mookie Betts of Boston (.508) were just behind him at the top of the secondary average list."
4727,Some historical context makes Trout’s season look even more impressive: Babe Ruth’s career secondary average was .608; Barry Bonds’s was .621.
4728,"At the other end, it reveals how some players, like Gordon, bring little beyond an ability to hit singles:"
4729,"The Chicago White Sox’ Jon Jay, who spent last season with Kansas City and Arizona, had only three home runs, drew only 33 walks and stole four bases. These rather anemic extra contributions led to a sad .150 secondary average — compared with a .268 batting average — one point behind Gordon. Miguel Rojas of Miami was at .156."
4730,"Unsurprisingly, Bryce Harper’s .249 batting average from last season sells his contributions short. He hit 34 home runs and led the majors with 130 walks, for a secondary average of .507. Mention that the next time someone dismisses him as “just a .250 hitter.”"
4731,"A less heralded example is Joey Gallo of Texas. His .206 batting average might make it seem as if he is ready for a demotion to Class AAA Nashville. But his 40 home runs, and his doubles (24) and walks (74) gave him a robust secondary average of .446, keeping his slot in the Rangers’ outfield secure."
4732,"While the Phillies landed one high-secondary-average player in Harper this off-season, the rest of their winter haul didn’t necessarily follow that trend. Philadelphia also traded with the Mariners for Jean Segura, whose .304 batting average seemed to plant him among the game’s best shortstops. But secondary average reveals it to be something of an empty .304: Although Segura hit 29 doubles and 10 home runs, his walk total was a shaky 32. That adds up to a secondary average of .200."
4733,"Mario Mendoza (career batting average .215, career secondary average .095) might approve."
4734,"By the time Mets outfielder Keon Broxton came to the plate in the bottom of the eighth inning on Saturday afternoon, his team had hit five home runs, blown a two-run lead and rallied to tie it again at Citi Field."
4735,"It was 5-5. His lone contribution had been drawing a walk, and he had also been caught stealing. With runners on first and second, and two outs, he readied for redemption."
4736,"After taking a ball, he tried to pull a slider. He fouled it off, then looked toward the dugout. His teammate Robinson Cano, who had just stroked a home run to right field, shouted: “Go to right field! Go to right field!”"
4737,"Broxton obliged, staying inside a 2-2 splitter that stayed up in the zone and driving it to right-center field. In came Michael Conforto from second to score the go-ahead run in the Mets’ 6-5 victory over the Washington Nationals."
4738,"“I was just sitting pretty,” Broxton said. “Got good wood on it.”"
4739,"Baffled by Nationals starter Patrick Corbin early, the Mets blasted Washington’s bullpen late to improve their record to 6-2. Besides Cano, Conforto, J. D. Davis (twice) and Pete Alonso also homered. Each blast was needed after Mets reliever Jeurys Familia surrendered two home runs in a game for the first time in his career."
4740,"“They put pretty good swings on me today,” said Familia (2-0), who blew a save opportunity but picked up the win. “Sometimes, that is going to happen.”"
4741,"Corbin was confounding at times, but one Met refused to take the bait."
4742,"It was Davis, who batted cleanup. In his first at-bat, he drew a walk. In his second, he drove Corbin’s fastball more than 400 feet for a home run to center. It left the ballpark with an exit velocity of 114.7 miles per hour, which made it the hardest-hit home run in the majors this season."
4743,"“Off the bat, I knew this ballpark plays deep, so I was busting my butt,” Davis said. “I was thinking a double or triple. I didn’t think it was going to go out.”"
4744,"The Nationals knotted the game at 1-1 in the top of the sixth when Anthony Rendon doubled to left and scored two batters later on a groundout. But in the bottom of the inning, Davis hit another home run, this time to left."
4745,"“He likes to get bad swings,” Davis, who was 3 for 3 with a walk, said of Corbin. “So I did my best to lay off them, and got pitches to hit.”"
4746,"After sleepwalking through the home opener on Thursday, the Mets looked listless in the first inning again. Steven Matz, the Mets’ starter, walked the leadoff hitter, Adam Eaton, on four pitches in the first, and Brandon Nimmo, the Mets’ left fielder, struck out on three pitches in the bottom of the inning."
4747,"Matz straightened out to go five innings. He allowed two hits, recorded eight strikeouts and kept the Nationals scoreless. He credited his ability to keep his changeup down in the zone."
4748,"“That’s where it’s most effective,” he said. “It’s been working real well for me.”"
4749,"Nimmo continued to struggle, though. He struck out three times before Juan Lagares came in to play center and Broxton moved over to left after the fifth inning."
4750,"For Manager Mickey Callaway, Broxton’s willingness to play wherever and adjust his approach at the plate was another example of his team playing to win."
4751,"“This game was everything we talked about all spring training,” Callaway said. “You’ve got to pick your guys up in front of you. If he didn’t get it done, you got to get it done.”"

4758,A woman in Los Angeles was sentenced to 15 years in prison this past week for what the authorities said was an unprovoked attack on an elderly man last year.
4759,"The woman, Laquisha Jones, 30, was accused of beating the man with a brick and telling him to “go back to your country,” the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office said."
4760,"Ms. Jones was sentenced Thursday after pleading no contest to an elder abuse charge, as part of a plea agreement in December. She had previously been charged with attempted murder and elder abuse, including a “hate crime allegation,” a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said Friday. The plea agreement did not include the hate crime component, the spokesman said."
4761,"The case drew widespread attention after the man, Rodolfo Rodriguez, now 92, was left bloodied, bruised and bewildered on the sidewalk in Willowbrook, an unincorporated area of the county about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, while going for a walk on the evening of July 4."
4762,"He  told CNN last year that he had passed a woman and a child on his walk, and without warning, the woman began hitting him with a concrete brick. He also said a group of men came over and began kicking him on the ground after the woman told them that he had tried to take away her daughter."
4763,"Prosecutors said Ms. Jones attacked Mr. Rodriguez “without provocation,” and that she acknowledged using a brick to injure the man."
4764,"Mr. Rodriguez sustained a broken jaw, broken cheekbones, two broken ribs and bruises on his face, back and abdomen, his grandson Erik Mendoza, told CNN last year. He said Mr. Rodriguez traveled from Michoacán, Mexico, to visit family in California about twice a year and walked through the neighborhood every day."
4765,"A witness, Misbel Borjas, posted a video of the aftermath and told CNN then that she had heard a female attacker saying, “Go back to your country. Go back to Mexico.” (She gave similar accounts to The Los Angeles Times and other news organizations.)

4770,"Trevor Bauer tossed seven no-hit innings, and two relievers combined to finish a three-hit gem as the host Cleveland Indians posted a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Thursday."
4771,"Bauer (1-0) finished with a flourish, striking out Lourdes Gurriel Jr., Alen Hanson and Brandon Drury to end the seventh inning. The 28-year-old fanned eight on the night, but six walks drove up his pitch count to 117."
4772,"Jon Edwards sandwiched a pair of walks around a hit batter to load the bases in the eighth before Brad Hand induced Gurriel to pop out to second to end the threat. Hand, however, allowed a single to Freddy Galvis to lead off the ninth, ending the Indians' bid for their first no-hitter since Len Barker threw a perfect game against Toronto on May 15, 1981."
4773,"Tyler Naquin had two hits and scored a run, and Jose Ramirez and Roberto Perez each had sacrifice flies for the Indians, who have alternated losses and wins to even their record after six games despite mustering just 17 runs.

He helped the Yankees overcome a 4-1 deficit, driving a 0-2 fastball by Mike Wright Jr. (0-1) over the left field fence to put New York up 5-4. Gary Sanchez and Luke Voit also homered for the Yankees."
4781,Jonathan Villar homered on the second pitch of the bottom of the first inning from James Paxton (1-1).

4826,"Nancy Fire, 57, is the co-owner of Design Works International and the creative director of StudioNYCDesign. She is also the design director for the website HGTV HOME. For the past two years, she and her husband, Neil Breslau, 60, the co-owner of Design Works, have lived on Central Park West on the 17th floor of a prewar, two bedroom apartment that overlooks the park. “The sunrises and sunsets are amazing,” Ms. Fire said. “I get a different perspective of the city. It looks like an impressionistic painting.” Ms. Fire and Mr. Breslau, who have been married for 30 years, both grew up in the Bronx. They have two children; Jessie, 25 and William, 23."
4827,"HERBS, LEAVES I don’t sleep in because I love the mornings, so I’m up before my husband by 6:30ish. I check on the plants and sometimes cut the herbs, which makes me feel like an urban farmer. I put on workout clothes and steep a pot of tea; Earl Grey or jasmine. I’m not a coffee drinker."
4828,"FORAGING At 7:30 I’m on the street walking to Absolute Bagels near 108th Street. There’s usually a line so the earlier I can get there the better. They have the best mini everything bagels, which I get with scallion cream cheese. I make my own green juice so on the way home I’ll pick up parsley, carrots, kale, and apples. I like to walk there and back because it makes me think that I’m walking off the calories."
4829,"PLANNING BREAKFAST I’m home by 9. Neil is up and dressed. We decide the day while we eat. Sometimes, if the weather is good, we sit outside on the terrace."
4830,"NATURE WALK From 10:30 to noon we go for walk in the park and head into the North Woods, which has eight or nine trails and waterfalls. I get a lot of inspiration here. It’s home to rare birds, which you can see along the trails. It’s like an urban renewal."
4831,"AFTERNOON TEA I’m a subway girl, and by 12:30 we’re on the C or B. I used to go to Ato Tea Room on Wooster. Buying tea there felt ceremonial. They just closed, which is sad. Now I go to Cha-an, east 9th Street. It’s a beautifully crafted teahouse on the second floor, which makes you feel like you’re in Japan. Their tea boxes are works of art."
4832,"FOR INSPIRATION As a designer, I like to see what’s happening in the galleries and what direction the art world is taking. Many galleries are trend forward. They’re more for your imagination, versus collecting. From 1 to 2:30 we walk in and out of a handful of different places. We might walk uptown and hit the Robin Rice Gallery."
4833,"BRING PLASTIC By 3, we’ll meet our daughter, Jessie, at Two Hands in TriBeCa. She turned me onto this restaurant a year ago. The first time I went was eye-opening because they didn’t take cash. I remember thinking, ‘What? I can’t pay cash? Who doesn’t take cash?’ It’s young and hip. The food is really good — they have grain bowls and ricotta hot cakes with pickled shallots — so I keep going back."
4834,"GOODS If we don’t go to Chinatown to look around, we usually walk to ABC Carpet & Home. I’m inspired by the store and variety. They were first to conquer the eclectic mix of curated home design under one roof. They have good sales and amazing trays that I use on ottomans."
4835,"TAILORED ACTIVITIES We’re home by 6. We’re big nerds so we may watch a movie or go to one. Neil likes “Billions.” He’s also a car collector so he watches “Classic Cars” or “Bitchin’ Rides.” He’s on his own for that. I might read some magazines, the pile of which seems to grow. I don’t know how. It just does. Or I’ll move furniture around the apartment. I’m really good at that. I’ll put on a face mask, something with stem cells in it."
4836,"CASUAL DINNER Sometimes we have a few friends over around 8. If we do, we cook stir-fry or make pasta with mushroom sauce. If not, we’ll go to a restaurant near us. We like the Mermaid Inn. They have great sliders and a happy hour. Sometimes we can be found there as early as 5 so we can catch it."
4837,DRIFT AWAY I’m in bed by 11:15. Neil might be back to watching TV; he likes to chill. I’ll put on Netflix for a little bit and then I fall asleep. At some point Neil comes in and joins me.
4838,"Lucas was 5 before his parents, Bill and Marci Barton of Grand Haven, Mich., finally got an explanation for his difficulties standing up or climbing stairs. The diagnosis: muscular dystrophy. "
4839,Mr. Barton turned to Google. 
4840,"“The first thing I read was, ‘no cure, in a wheelchair in their teens, pass in their 20s,” Mr. Barton said. “I stopped. I couldn’t read any more. I couldn’t handle it.”"
4841,"Then he found a reason to hope. For the first time ever, there are clinical trials — nearly two dozen — testing treatments that might actually stop the disease. "
4842,"The problem, as Mr. Barton soon discovered, is that the enrollment criteria are so restrictive that very few children qualify. As a result, families like the Bartons often are turned away."
4843,"“There is so much hope, but it’s not for them,” said Kristin Stephenson, vice president of policy and advocacy at the Muscular Dystrophy Association in Chicago."
4844,"Even for the parents whose lucky child qualifies, good news may be followed by agonizing, life-or-death choices. What treatments seem most promising? Should he be enrolled in a trial with a placebo arm? "
4845,"Should he be placed in a less risky study that aims to slow the progress of the disease but will not stop it? Should the parents take their chances with a trial now — or wait a year or two, as their child’s condition worsens, until something better comes along? "
4846,Often there is no easy way to decide. 
4847,"“We talk to families every day,” said Debra Miller who founded the advocacy group, Cure Duchenne, after her son was diagnosed with the disease. “So many times they are looking at us and saying, ‘What do I do?’” "
4848,"To help, her group has constructed detailed decision trees and leads families through them. Ms. Miller’s own son, who is 22, does not qualify for the new clinical trials."
4849,"Ryan and Brooke Saalman know how hard it can be to know what to do. “We did a lot of praying,” said Ms. Saalman, mother of two boys with Duchenne in Columbus, Ga. "
4850,"They decided to enroll their oldest son, Jacob, 6, in a trial of a highly experimental drug. The trial requires weekly infusions at a site 100 miles from their home. He is one of the first boys to be treated. "
4851,"The investigators are testing a strategy called exon skipping: putting a molecular bandage over a tiny mutation in a large gene. The Saalmans also considered a gene-therapy trial, in which scientists were attempting to insert a new gene that makes dystrophin."
4852,"But they discovered that gene therapy may be irreversible. And if it didn’t work, Jacob would be ineligible for an even more promising approach in the future: gene editing, to snip out the deadly mutation that causes Duchenne, an effort now in preclinical development."
4853,"Gene therapy and gene editing both depend on a disabled cold virus to deliver the treatment. Once exposed to that virus, the body makes antibodies to it. Essentially, patients like Jacob get one shot at genetic modification."
4854,"The Saalmans made a different decision for their younger son, Hudson, 2. He was offered a spot in two trials by companies that will accept younger boys."
4855,The Saalmans could not decide what to do. Hudson’s disease is steadily progressing; muscle that he loses now is gone forever. 
4856,But they finally made the difficult decision to wait. 
4857,"Hudson is still very young. If they wait, the Saalmans concluded, researchers will have learned more. Other trials are bound to begin."
4858,"About 15 out of every 100,000 males aged 5 to 24 have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common kind. They all lack a functioning dystrophin gene, which is on the X chromosome, transmitted to boys by their mothers. "
4859,"Without dystrophin — a protein that is important for maintaining the membrane of muscle cells — muscles atrophy. Patients usually lose the ability to walk by age 12, and die in their 20s. "
4860,"“It’s a heavy thing,” said Leslie Porter of Blanchard, Okla., whose 8-year-old son has Duchenne. He does not qualify for any trials, and she dreads watching him deteriorate. "
4861,"“I just want time to slow down,” she said."
4862,"According to Ms. Stephenson, of the M.D.A., drug trials are seeking 2,500 patients. But most only want to enroll boys between the ages of 4 and 7 who are affected by the disease but not yet too debilitated, and who meet other clinical criteria, such as having a mutation in the right place in the dystrophin gene."
4863,"The trials usually require functional tests, including one that measures how far a boy can walk in six minutes or how quickly he can get up from lying flat. "
4864,"For many, the criteria are just too stringent. “There are not enough patients,” Ms. Miller said. “It will be difficult to fill all these clinical trials.”"
4865,"The Bartons found out about a gene-therapy trial at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, testing a treatment by Sarepta Therapeutics."
4866,They watched a miraculous video of a little boy struggling to walk up a flight of stairs before treatment — and then doing it easily afterward. 
4867,"“This was what we were hoping for,” Mr. Barton said. "
4868,"Lucas was the right age, and he seemed to qualify. But testing showed that he carries antibodies to the virus used to deliver the treatment. It would not work for him."
4869,"The Bartons were drained, devastated. And for now, there is no other trial that Lucas qualifies for."
4870,"“I had my put my hopes into this,” Mr. Barton said. “It was the miracle.”"
4871,"Dr. Jeffrey Bigelow, a neurologist, and his wife, Alexis Bigelow, of Millcreek, Utah, hoped against hope that their son Henri, 8, would qualify for the only gene therapy trial that will accept boys his age. "
4872,Then the Bigelows found out that enrollees of Henri’s age have to be able to lie down and then stand up with their hands at their sides in less than 10 seconds. 
4873,"It took Henri 10 seconds to do that last spring, when he was evaluated for another trial. Now it would probably take him 20 seconds, his father said."
4874,"“It feels like Henri is being punished for losing the ability to stand up from the ground too soon,” Dr. Bigelow said."
4875,He also worries about older boys with Duchenne who are lucky enough to still walk. They are shut out from the trial because they are not yet in wheelchairs. And other trials won’t accept boys that old.
4876,"“These are boys who, like Henri, desperately need the treatment, and if they don’t get it in the next one to two years, likely will be confined to a wheelchair, to never walk again,” Dr. Bigelow said."
4877,“This just feels unjust.”

4887,"LONDON — Three years ago, as Britons were preparing to vote in a referendum on whether to leave the European Union, the Conservative lawmaker John Redwood put forward a proposal: Rather than bet on negotiating a favorable trade deal with its former club, Britain should get ready to simply walk away."
4888,"But Mr. Redwood was an outlier, part of the Conservative Party’s euroskeptic fringe."
4889,"The mainstream Brexiteers, who led the campaign for leaving the European Union to victory, assured the public that all necessary agreements would be in place in time for Brexit."
4890,"Britain would still have “access to the single market,” promised Boris Johnson, who became the foreign secretary. Even Nigel Farage, Brexit’s ideological godfather, had said that “on day plus one, we will find ourselves part of the European Economic Area and with a free-trade deal.”"
4891,"One of the mysteries of Brexit — one that will be studied by political scientists for generations — is how, for much of the country, a gradualist goal of achieving a less-restrictive relationship with Europe was replaced by an extreme and risky one: walking away with no deal at all."
4892,"Many in Britain are deeply alarmed by this prospect, including a majority in Parliament. It would leave most of the country’s imports and exports — including a large part of its food supply and much of its medicine — subject to new controls overnight without the infrastructure or people to implement them."
4893,The central bank has said it could cause the country’s worst recession since the 1920s. It would also throw into question the status of an international border that was central to a 30-year armed conflict.
4894,"But a large part of the population has shrugged off those warnings. A poll released by Opinium on Thursday found that if Parliament rejects Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal for a third time, 46 percent of respondents would prefer a no-deal exit over 39 percent who preferred delaying to allow for a public vote. Mr. Johnson declared in January that a no-deal exit “is closest to what people actually voted for.” Mr. Farage rolled out the slogan “No deal, no problem.”"
4895,"A lot of this shift comes down to frustration. Even now, on the surface, life seems normal in much of Britain. But the psychological state of the country is more fragile after being held hostage for two years by a political process that never progresses, drowns out everything else and has only deepened the divisions exposed by the 2016 referendum. Many people here just want the noise to stop."
4896,"Gisela Stuart, a former Labour lawmaker who was one of the leaders of the Vote Leave campaign, said she didn’t even consider embracing a no-deal exit until four or five months ago."
4897,"“People like me wouldn’t have stood up and said, ‘Please, vote so that, after 40 years of a political and economic relationship, we just walk out,’ ” she said. “But can you say that, if after two years we cannot manage to negotiate an agreement, we should walk out? Well, maybe.”"
4898,"Her frustration, she said, had become almost existential."
4899,"“I’ve spent 40 years of my life not needing a watch in the morning because I listen to the ‘Today’ program,” the BBC’s flagship radio news show, she said, reeling off the exact times, to the minute, of her favorite segments. “In the last couple of months I have not been able to bear to listen to it anymore. I switch to classical music. It is relentless speculation. It is no longer news. It is water torture. I can’t bear it anymore.”"
4900,"The same sentiment has emerged in her constituents, she said. “Earlier, they said, ‘We want a trade deal,’ ” she said. “Now, they say, ‘We just want out.’ ”"
4901,"Henry Newman, who campaigned for Vote Leave and is director of Open Europe, a policy group that focuses on Brexit, said he has seen “revisionism” from Brexit-supporting politicians who previously recommended more moderate outcomes, such as Norway-style close links to the bloc."
4902,"In recent months, he said, “there’s now almost an idea that any of these relationships will be a national humiliation.” For many ordinary voters, frustration with the process has “led to a sense, ‘Why can’t we just walk away?’ ” he said. “That’s in danger of becoming an identity pole, a center of gravity. It’s in danger of crystallizing into an identity.”"
4903,"Back when Britain voted to leave, “no one was talking about no deal as an outcome,” said Asa Bennett, who covered the referendum for The Telegraph, the daily British newspaper. “The consensus was that of course we’d have a deal. It would be patently obvious. It didn’t even come on the radar.”"
4904,"The notion that a no-deal exit was an option was powerfully normalized by Mrs. May herself, as negotiations with Brussels bogged down, and the complexities of removal became more obvious. In a tough-talking January 2017 speech at Lancaster House, she adopted a warning that had been used only by a small group of hard-line euroskeptic campaigners. She warned that Europe should not try to corner Britain into accepting a “punitive” deal, because Britain would walk away. It represented Britain’s main point of leverage, since Europe would suffer severely from a chaotic separation."
4905,"“While I am confident that this scenario need never arise — while I am sure a positive agreement can be reached — I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain,” she said. She followed this up by articulating a series of “red lines,” promising to exit the customs union, single market and European Court of Justice."
4906,"Mr. Redwood, an anti-Europe voice in Parliament for decades, said the Lancaster House speech marked the moment when his group’s thinking became fully mainstream."
4907,"“That was the point of the slogan that we got her to adopt,” Mr. Redwood said. “It was very important, and it wasn’t one speech; she said it consistently.” He added, “In those days, she was advised by Nick Timothy, who was very much on our side.”"
4908,"Ms. Stuart, the Vote Leave leader, said that phrase, which was later included in the Conservative Party manifesto, set off a significant shift in public perception. “It did mean suddenly that talk of no deal was no longer seen as an extreme position,” she said."
4909,"It was one of Mrs. May’s most resonant speeches, casting her in the mold of the Iron Lady, Margaret Thatcher, who famously “handbagged” opponents by digging out briefing papers from her purse, a gesture that typically signaled the approach of a political knockout blow."
4910,"Only as the negotiations reached their end point in Mrs. May’s withdrawal agreement, though, did the notion of a no-deal exit begin to gain currency as a positive outcome. Ms. Stuart said she came to the point reluctantly, out of disappointment with Mrs. May’s failure as a negotiator."
4911,"“If you would in your wildest dreams imagine a Tory P.M. would put us into this position — no, no my skills as a scriptwriter would have completely failed me,” she said."
4912,"Mr. Redwood also said she had failed, giving the European Union the impression that she was bluffing and would not go through with it."
4913,"“You needed to say it to provide leverage, but we also understood that she meant it,” he said. “Her more recent advisers didn’t mean it. The E.U. decided we were weak, weak, weak and wouldn’t walk away.”"
4914,"For the public, said Tom McTague, who reports on Brexit for Politico, the talks have taken on the sting of a national humiliation, “and the natural reaction is to say, ‘Well, screw you.’ ”"
4915,"“You set up these unachievable and conflicting goals, of a perfect trade deal with the E.U., pure sovereignty at home and no border with Ireland, and when you are forced to make a choice between them, you resent that choice,” said Mr. McTague, author of “Betting the House,” a chronicle of Mrs. May’s effort to build leverage in the Brexit negotiations by calling a snap election."
4916,"“The inherent complexity of Brexit is causing people to think, ‘Just rip the Band-Aid off, I can’t think about this anymore. Just rip the Band-Aid off, and let’s start again. We’ll take a little pain.’ ”"

4929,"Indoors: The house has a wide front porch whose roof is supported by columns probably milled from trees cleared from the property at the time it was built. In the foyer, with its coffered ceiling, are floors and moldings of tiger oak, a wood found throughout the first two levels of the house. To the left of the foyer is a parlor with a bay window. A pair of wooden Doric columns marks the entrance to the wide living room, which has a corner fireplace. From there, you enter a family room with decorative wood molding, a marble fireplace and a media center; this room overlooks a sunken, three-season solarium at the back of the home, originally built as a greenhouse."
4930,"Straight ahead from the foyer is a dining room with a beamed ceiling. Following a short hallway past a powder room, you reach a kitchen with a granite-topped central island and a breakfast niche with three walls of windows. A butler’s pantry lined in cabinets connects the kitchen to the living room. A door within the pantry leads to a laundry room."
4931,"Two staircases, front and back, ascend to the second floor, where there are four bedrooms and three bathrooms. The master suite has its own sitting room and fireplace, as well as three closets (one walk-in) and two bathrooms."

4936,"Known as the Herbert Draper house, after its first owner, a real estate developer, this property was one of the first large homes built on the elite Davis Islands in Hillsborough Bay. Situated on a 0.15-acre corner lot near the northern tip, it is convenient to Marjorie Park Yacht Basin and Tampa General Hospital.

4945,"After buying the property, where a 1914 house in need of repair stood, and investigating the possibility of restoring it, the owners decided to raze it and start fresh. The new house, designed by Gerry Copeland, a Washington architect, retained the earlier home’s Craftsman style and incorporated some of its materials. The property is on the Spokane River, less than two miles west of the central business district of Spokane and about five minutes by car from Kendall Yards, a popular mixed-use development with artisanal shops and restaurants and a supermarket."

4959,"My first journalism job was at the Queens Tribune, a local weekly newspaper. My second was at The New York Press, an alt-weekly that competed with The Village Voice. My third was at The New York Sun, a plucky daily broadsheet."
4960,"The Sun closed in 2008, The Press in 2011 and The Voice in 2018. (The Tribune has not been online since late 2018.)"
4961,New York City used to be awash in newspapers.
4962,"At one point, there were at least seven dailies, including The Herald Tribune (closed in 1966) and New York Newsday (closed in 1995)."
4963,"The internet was supposed to help news outlets find audiences, but sustainable business models remain elusive. The websites Gothamist and DNA Info were shuttered in 2017 after their staffs voted to unionize. (Gothamist later resurfaced at WNYC.)"
4964,The Daily News  laid off half its staff last year.
4965,It can feel like daunting times for the local news business.
4966,Now comes The City. It’s a new nonprofit newsroom whose website debuted yesterday.
4967,"The founding editor in chief is Jere Hester, a former Daily News editor. Its chairman is Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News."
4968,“Reporting for New Yorkers” is The City’s slogan. (“Reporting to you” is BuzzFeed News’s slogan.) The City’s logo is a pigeon. Its ethos is unapologetically local.
4969,The site is funded by philanthropies and foundations. Soon it expects to add revenue from live events and readers.
4970,The results?
4971,"An article about the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, spending $250,000 on travel and lodging over five years, far more than other local district attorneys."
4972,A piece on a little-noticed deal struck by Mayor de Blasio that may lead taxpayers to pay more than $300 million for a fleet of ferry boats.
4973,"And a story about a fatal construction accident in Brooklyn last year, and the penalties imposed on a subcontractor, with the headline “The Price of a Laborer’s Life: A $63,647 Fine.”"
4974,"To help grab attention, The City’s first newsletter was written as an open (and friendly) letter to Mr. de Blasio, urging him to look into the ferry deal."
4975,"“We want people to know that we’re here to do the kind of stories that reflect the concerns of New Yorkers, and are designed to hold decision makers accountable,” Mr. Hester said in an interview."
4976,"“We’re here to fill some of the gaps that have been lost as local coverage has diminished,” he added. “We’re not looking to replace any other news outlet that’s out there.”"
4977,"I’ve spoken to Mr. Hester previously about The City, and, in 2005, I interned for Mr. Smith. I’ll be rooting for their success, because we all benefit from a healthy news landscape."
4978,"I’m not the only one who is glad to see The City. “This is great for local news and great for New York City,” Clifford Levy, The Times’s Metro editor, wrote on Twitter."

4998,"The day is meant to encourage people to get a little more exercise. If helps make buses or trains less crowded, even better."
4999,"According to a 2007 study, New Yorkers are among the fastest walkers in the world. On average, it takes only 12 seconds for New Yorkers to walk 60 feet; that’s about 3.4 miles per hour, and slightly faster than sitting on the M42 bus.

5008,"At one point, the cab picked up speed as it turned left off a southbound avenue onto a crosstown street."
5009,The cabby said another cab seemed to be following us. He said the driver of the other cab was waving in our direction and had an angry look on his face.
5010,"Our cab continued on, swerving in and out of lanes in an effort to stay ahead of the other cab. We were perplexed and somewhat nervous. Had we annoyed the driver of the other cab in some way?"
5011,"After several blocks, we thought we were clear of the other cab, when suddenly it was right alongside us."
5012,"The driver reached out his open window, grabbed the passenger door of our cab and slammed it shut."
5013,"“I saw the door wasn’t shut and your son was leaning on it,” he said. “I didn’t want him falling out.”"
5014,And then he was gone.

5018,"President Trump was right to walk away from his summit with Kim Jong-un rather than accept a bad nuclear agreement, but the outcome underscores that he was bamboozled last year at his first summit with Kim. Whatever genius Trump sees in the mirror, “the art of the deal” is not his thing."
5019,"At this meeting, Kim apparently sought a full end to sanctions on North Korea in exchange for closing only some nuclear sites. That was not a good deal, and Trump was right to walk rather than accept it."
5020,"“Basically they wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety, but we couldn’t do that,” Trump said, adding: “Sometimes you have to walk.”"
5021,"President Reagan famously marched out of a 1986 summit in Reykjavik, Iceland, rather than accept an arms control agreement with Russia that he regarded as flawed. A year later the Russians returned with better terms and a deal was made — and we can all hope that something similar will happen this time."
5022,"[Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]"
5023,"Still, there are significant risks ahead. The most important is that North Korea may return to testing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles, for that would mark a huge escalation of tensions and renewed concerns about brinkmanship and war."
5024,"Unfortunately, North Korea is an otherwise unimportant country that gets attention only when it behaves provocatively. So its leaders have learned that their best leverage is to fire missiles, detonate warheads, or start up nuclear complexes."
5025,"While Trump was right to walk in this case, he also seems to have played his hand poorly in the run-up to the summit. In particular, he signaled that he eagerly wanted a deal and that “fantastic success” was likely, all of which probably led Kim to raise demands in the belief that Trump would fold."
5026,"With normal presidents, summit deals are largely agreed upon ahead of time. As one veteran diplomat put it, presidents pull rabbits out of hats, after diplomats have worked diligently ahead of time to stuff the rabbits into the hats. But Trump has never had much patience for that meticulous diplomatic process, instead placing excessive faith in breakthroughs arising from personal relationships — and his faith was clearly misplaced this time."
5027,"The North Korean side had refused to hash out the summit outcome in advance with the highly regarded U.S. special envoy, Stephen Biegun, presumably because Kim thought that he could outfox Trump in person in Hanoi the way he had in Singapore nine months ago."
5028,"The collapse of the latest talks also underscores how misguided Trump was at that earlier meeting. He didn’t understand that Kim uses “denuclearization” to mean something different than the meaning in the United States, and he gave Kim the enormous gift of legitimacy that comes with a summit, without getting anything comparable in return."
5029,"It is also distasteful to see Trump praising Kim and referring to him as “my friend” and a “great leader,” and, last year, asserting that Kim had sent him “beautiful letters” and that “we fell in love.” It’s perfectly appropriate to engage with ruthless dictators, but fawning over them is a betrayal of our values."
5030,"In Vietnam, Trump might also have shown Kim what freedom of the press looks like. Instead, the White House barred four American reporters from a dinner after two of them had shouted questions for Trump."
5031,"Still, if the risk is of a return to high tensions ahead, it’s also possible to foresee a path that over time does make progress with North Korea. I tend to agree with skeptics who believe that Kim has zero intention of ever giving up his nuclear weapons stockpile — that’s what North Koreans told me on my last visit to the country in 2017 — but there is still room for diplomacy that leaves the world better off."
5032,"In particular, Kim seems willing to reach a bargain on continuing his moratorium on testing warheads and missiles and on freezing production of nuclear fuel at his complex on Yongbyon, and those are worthy goals if the price is not too high. A reasonable price would be relaxation of sanctions on inter-Korean projects, such as South Korean manufacturing, tourism and rail projects in North Korea."
5033,"Those inter-Korean initiatives also have value in that they may over time help normalize North Korea, give it a stake in the outside world, and undermine the regime’s authority."
5034,"That kind of limited deal should be an aim of diplomacy going forward, and South Korean President Moon Jae-in — who helped start the peace process between North Korea and the West — is well placed to pursue it, with American backing."
5035,The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here’s our email: letters@nytimes.com.
5036,"Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram."
5037,"The back flap of Thomas Page McBee’s most recent memoir, “Amateur: A True Story About What Makes a Man a Man,” notes that he was the first transgender man to ever box in Madison Square Garden. But Mr. McBee, 37, is known less for his skills in the ring than for his determination to unravel the mysteries of manhood. “Amateur” is a follow-up to his 2014 memoir, “Man Alive.” Both books take an unflinching look at gender and masculinity. Mr. McBee lives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with his wife, Jessica Bloom, 33, the director of development at a nonprofit. They live with two rescue dogs, Bruno and Henry, and a cat named Olive."
5038,"FOCUS The dogs wake us up around 7:30. Jess walks the dogs while I make the coffee. It’s the only time of the entire day I’m in the house by myself, so I try to do something meditative. Like I’ll pull a tarot card to give me my thing to think about for the day. Or I’ll use the notes app on my phone to write down things I’m thinking about. Usually I start the day thinking, What am I struggling with? What’s a barrier I need to get around?"
5039,"HEART-TO-HEART Then Jess gets home and she makes breakfast, usually some kind of crazy egg thing or pancakes. Jess is my BFF, the person I talk to the most. We don’t get a lot of time to talk during the week, so we spend a lot of time just talking on Sunday mornings."
5040,"CHALK IT UP Around 10 I go to the gym around the corner, Chalk. This is actually kind of funny, I think — it’s the gym “Broad City” is filmed in. It’s very classic Williamsburg. Fighting helped me get really in touch with my body. You learn so much about your own anatomy. Since I’ve stopped fighting I’ve gotten really into strength training. I lift weights on my own now. I work out four times a week."
5041,"SINGLE MINDED After I shower I like going to movies by myself or going to a museum by myself. I just love the way stories get told visually. There’s something about the immediacy of a movie that sometimes helps me solve problems in my work. It helps me pinpoint things. I like going with other people, too, but it’s like when I saw “BlacKkKlansman” — I didn’t want to discuss it with anyone after. I didn’t want to walk out of the theater with someone else’s thoughts in my mind."
5042,"WALK AROUND If I’m going to a movie usually I’ll go to the Nitehawk or the Williamsburg Cinemas. If it’s a museum I really like the Whitney. If I don’t do either of those things, I’ll just go to Greenpoint and walk around. I love Greenpoint because it looks a lot like Pittsburgh, where I’m from. I’m also a bookstore fiend and they have Word bookstore there."
5043,"TREAT In the afternoon we’ll walk the dogs at the dog park right next to our house. They love that, when we all go out together. Right after the dogs we do a special thing: we go get ice cream at Mister Dips, around the corner from us at the top of a hotel. It’s soft serve, and they put coatings on it and looks absolutely beautiful. It’s an insane amount to eat and it’s very filling and disgusting. I love it."
5044,"HIT THE STACKS Then we’ll usually walk to McNally Jackson, which is another bookstore. I can spend hours in McNally Jackson. It’s got this nice, clean aesthetic. We just pick something up and hang out."
5045,"HIS TURN IN THE KITCHEN By the time we get home it’s early evening. This is where I pick up most of the labor, because I had my free time in the morning. I make Sunday dinner. I like doing it because my mom was a big cook. She passed away, so in her memory I’m learning. I’m on a risotto kick."
5046,"AVID LISTENER While I’m making dinner I listen to podcasts. I have my favorites, like “This American Life,” obviously. But I also love “Still Processing,” “Savage Lovecast,” “Fresh Air,” “Dear Prudence” and “Call Your Girlfriend.” Another one I really love is “You Must Remember This,” about Hollywood history. But lately I’ve been obsessed with “30 for 30” from ESPN. It’s sports stories told narratively. I continue to think that sports are an interesting way to reach a different audience and to tell social stories."
5047,"MENTAL NOTES After dinner we’ll spend some time talking, mostly creative or professional troubleshooting. Then we’ll watch TV, either “Insecure,” the third season, or “BoJack Horseman.” We have different tastes, so those are the shows in the overlapping part of our Venn diagram. Jess gets in bed at 10, and I’ll walk the dogs and then organize the notes I’ve been taking all day. By the end of the day, I’ve written down a million things. I arrange them in the hopes it might help my unconscious work some magic in bed."

5057,To the Editor:
5058,"Re “Your ‘Dream Home’ Should Be a Condo” (Sunday Review, March 3):"
5059,Thanks to Allison Arieff for this important article highlighting the wastefulness of McMansion-style homes. Her article underscores the thoughtlessness that for decades has characterized urban and suburban design.
5060,"If we are to leave a livable planet to our children and grandchildren, we need new thinking and bold moves that nurture Green New Deal lifestyles. Scaling down our ideas of what we “must have” won’t result in onerous changes to the way we live. "
5061,"In fact, a green perspective can refresh our thinking about what “lifestyle” means, and help us focus on what is truly important to each of us. "
5062,"I’ll take breathable air, clean water, less stress, family, friends, time and beauty over a lumbering big home any day."

5064,To the Editor:
5065,"Allison Arieff sheds light on housing industry practices that are out of sync with progressive design goals for density, proximity to public transportation and other services, walkability and energy efficiency. "
5066,Ms. Arieff describes the National Association of Home Builders’ influence as a top-down system that foists its retrograde and mercenary self-interests on us. But we are equally responsible as a culture that can seemingly never get enough and that equates more with better. 
5067,"Whether the objective is prestige or tax revenue to fill city coffers, no one can deny that unbridled luxury development has radically altered major American cities over the last decade. Displacement and an affordable housing crisis have followed this development frenzy. "
5068,"As with the home builders association’s values, the lopsided proliferation of luxury housing is at odds with the needs of the majority and not representative of universal ideals for diversity, efficiency, inclusiveness and sustainability."
5069,"At the moment it appears as if big money has won, although it may prove a hollow victory. When the folks who made the neighborhood are driven out, what is left?"
5070,Deborah HoltBoston
5071,To the Editor:
5072,Allison Arieff has articulated the central quandary of my retirement! 
5073,"I’m an American living (temporarily) in London. Here, the walkability of London’s many “villages,” the welcome sense of neighborhood and community and, yes, even our smallish home — all have great appeal."
5074,"Yet my husband and I constantly wonder where in the United States we can find an interesting city (of any size) with affordable housing, practicalities of daily living and a vibrant cultural life."
5075,"When we retire, we won’t be able to afford a large house, even if we want one. No doubt we are not alone ... sigh."
5076,Elizabeth BredinLondon
5077,"ACROSTIC —  Today’s acrostic is a passage from a book by Constance Hale called “Sin and Syntax: How to Craft Wicked Good Prose” (or “How to Craft Wickedly Effective Prose,” the subtitle of an earlier edition). Much of the excerpt concerns prominent visual artists, though, referring to the style evolution of Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso to their ultimate, more streamlined maturity. "
5078,"I like both painters, and I confess that I don’t often think about artists’ timelines, the way I do with a lot of book writers that I discover in midcareer or after their careers have ended. Bibliographies are usually arranged chronologically; museum exhibits are often works from a particular era of an artist’s life, yes, but I don’t walk from painting to painting in the order they were created. But the argument made in the passage is interesting and valid, and it sounds like another good read for would-be writers (and writers resolved to improve in the coming year)."
5079,"I thought the clues today were pretty tough. I was confident enough to get started with NEAR MISS, NIACIN, AGITATE and SESAME. I then went a bit astray with “benny” instead of TRANQ (that “Q” was vital to figuring out the beginning of this quotation, too); I also put “Connick” instead of NILSSON. Thrown off by the “Harry,” I guess, and not remembering this song, which played at the start of “Midnight Cowboy.”"
5080,"I picked up on ORGANISM, TIPTOES, LUKEWARM and YEAR ROUND at around the same time, and once those were sorted into the grid the rest fell into place. I did not know what COWLING was, and it has never been in the puzzle before. The clue for NICOTINE was funny: I was positive that Team Cox/Rathvon was channeling Senator Ted Stevens when he called the internet, another addictive substance, “a series of tubes.”"

5082,Clayton Kershaw was upbeat Thursday night despite producing a mediocre pitching line during a minor league rehab start.
5083,"The Los Angeles Dodgers ace, on the injured list due to left shoulder inflammation, tossed 4 1/3 innings while pitching for the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers. He allowed two runs on four hits, including a home run, and two walks while striking out six."

5097,"The word upstage has appeared in 100 articles on NYTimes.com in the past year, including on Oct. 11 in “‘The Haunting of Hill House,’ on Netflix, Is a Family Drama With Scares” by Jason Zinoman:"
5098,"Shirley Jackson was a writer who understood that good scares come to those who wait, but she also knew how to get to the point."
5099,"Her classic 1959 novella “The Haunting of Hill House” begins with the greatest opening paragraph in the history of horror, describing the doomed mansion from the title, curiously, as insane, before ending with this ominous phrase: “whatever walked there, walked alone.”"
5100,".... Jan De Bont’s 1999 remake, also titled “The Haunting,” indulged in computer-generated effects, which partly accounts for its critically reviled reputation. But the movie makes a credible argument for the scariest element of Jackson’s story: Hill House itself. De Bont painstakingly lingers on its creepy statues, iron gates and precarious spiral staircase, and the ornate and wonderfully eccentric design upstages the actors in almost every scene."

5103,"Juli Jakab, the star of “Sunset,” has remarkable eyes. The way she holds a gaze suggests not just defiance but potentially supernatural powers of perception."
5104,"Her character, Irisz Leiter, gazes at many grand and grave things in this film set in 1913 Budapest. It’s the second feature from the director Laszlo Nemes. And as in his first film, the scarily accomplished and provocative “Son of Saul” (2015), which took place in a German death camp (and which Jakab also acted in), the camera most frequently follows its lead character around from behind. These shots are the longest, and they are always elaborately choreographed; the reverse angle reaction shots are mostly static. It’s the cinematic equivalent of what fiction writers call close third-person: not entirely subjective, but substantively immersive."
5105,"That style applied to the endless horrors depicted in “Son of Saul” made it sometimes unbearable to watch, which was the point. Here, the technique is applied to an allegory of nearly suffocating self-seriousness, to much less powerful effect. (The screenplay is by Nemes along with Clara Royer and Matthieu Taponier.)"
5106,"Irisz is the daughter of the founders of Leiter, a high-end millinery. But she never knew her parents; the store had burned down years before, and the girl was raised in an orphanage. Now an adult, she goes to the store seeking a job."
5107,"Oszkar Brill (Vlad Ivanov), the new owner who revived the store’s fortunes after tragedy, rebuffs her gently but firmly, sending her to spend the night in the seedy house where other store employees live. Before her first night is through, she’ll hear of a brother she never knew she had. He is described to her as a radical, a killer, a mystery man who has not been seen publicly in years. She is told not to seek him out, so of course she does. She finds him at the end of a tram line, in a compound full of hostile, angry men. As happened at Leiter, she is told this is not a place for her, and the warning is not hollow."
5108,"Irisz is advised not to do something and then does it anyway so frequently in this film that it almost generates dark comedy. But no humor is intended here. And while Nemes’s near-subjective technique can generate genuine tension, it more often yields anxious tedium. In one scene, a character walks away from Irisz to speak to someone about 30 feet away, and he goes out of focus. The shot holds as the man speaks to the other person. He then walks back to Irisz — that’s 10 seconds there — and in so doing comes back into focus. He tells Irisz what he was just told. This is, in part, why the movie is a good chunk over two hours."
5109,"The final shot, taking place some time after the main action, seeks a character rather than follows one and is shamelessly on the nose in the allegory department."

5145,"The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu, if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick’s, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin’s and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside."
5146,"The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu’s collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana. The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia."
5147,"The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that’s repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian."
5148,"Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. (Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go."
5149,"The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania’s Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani."
5150,"In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it."
5151,"Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak, which our server described as “like butter for bread” and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.)"
5152,"I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as “cream with polenta,” the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes."
5153,"Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don’t expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant’s version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table."
5154,"The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect."
5155,"Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant’s qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.)"
5156,"Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania’s national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is — please rise and face Hughes Avenue — a creamy white sauce."
5157,"Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu’s several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you’d be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety."
5158,"Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat."

5160,"Walk up 10th Avenue toward 30th Street and you may notice someone — or rather, something — gazing down at you. Look up and you will see “Brick House,” a towering bronze bust by the artist Simone Leigh and the first sculpture to be displayed on a plinth at the spur, a new section of the High Line."
5161,[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]
5162,"At 16 feet tall, the figure is a black woman with cornrows and a dome-shaped torso that resembles a skirtlike house. It is by far the largest sculpture Ms. Leigh has created; even among the sea of skyscrapers and industrial-era brick buildings near the High Line, “Brick House” stands out. In an interview with The New York Times last summer, Ms. Leigh said she thought the commission “would be a great opportunity to have something about black beauty right in the middle of that environment.”"
5163,[Read more about the artist Simone Leigh and her recent work.]
5164,"The spur will open to the public on June 5, but until then, park-goers can see “Brick House” from street level or nearby buildings. It will be on display until September 2020."
5165,"RICHMOND, New South Wales — I thought I would come to Australia and learn to surf. Instead, I learned to walk."
5166,"More precisely, I lumbered, jogged, waddled and generally humiliated my way around a track as I tried — and failed — to keep up with the world’s most exceptional race walker. "
5167,"That walker, Heather Lee, is 92 years old. She holds five world records and eight Australian ones for racewalking. She is the New South Wales Senior Australian of the Year. And she has big plans for 2019 — namely, breaking her own best times — so she does not kid around when it comes to working out. "
5168,"Ms. Lee trains at least three days a week. Wednesdays are reserved for interval training with her coach, Liz de Vries. “I never know what horrors she has in store for me,” Ms. Lee said. “But I’m turning back the clock as far as speed’s concerned.”"
5169,"On a typical day, Ms. Lee walks at least 10,000 steps — a benefit, she said, of giving up driving. In 2018, she walked 3,057,374 steps, according to her fitness watch."
5170,"The athlete was already stretching with Ms. de Vries, a fit mother of three, when I met them at a park in Richmond, an hour outside Sydney, at 7:30 a.m. “I’m 55,” Ms. de Vries told me. “And I’m one of the few people in Richmond who can keep up with Heather.”"
5171,"Many older people I know are focused on the past. When they talk about the future, they are, quite understandably, preoccupied with the hassles and obstacles of their increasing age. Ms. Lee is different. When she looks ahead, it is with optimism and determination. She credits that to her sport. “I’m always looking to compete again,” she said. "
5172,Race walking is hard. Trying to do it while maintaining a conversation is much harder. Fortunately Ms. Lee was less winded than me.
5173,"Before we had even made it around the first loop, she had told me about some of her favorite walks in the country (the Warrumbungle and Bungle Bungle ranges), her most recent records (she completed 10 kilometers in 84 minutes 21 seconds), World War II (“The day previous to Normandy I knew something was going on. The atmosphere was electric.”) and the queen."
5174,"[Never be uninteresting. Read the most thought-provoking, funny, delightful and raw stories from The New York Times Opinion section.]"
5175,"Ms. Lee was born on the Isle of Wight, off southern England, in 1926, the same year as Elizabeth II. “The queen’s like me a bit: She’s learned to change with the times,” she said. “I’ve gone from being a snobbish Pommy to an Australian.” "
5176,"Ms. Lee, the younger of two sisters, played hockey and tennis, rode horses, swam and biked. She wasn’t particularly academic. “My schooling was a bit interrupted by air raids and things like that,” she said."
5177,"She married her first husband, whom she doesn’t like to talk about, on the Isle of Wight and had a daughter. They separated in the early 1960s, when Ms. Lee was 35. She and her daughter moved to Australia a few years later. “I wanted to start a new life for myself,” she said."
5178,"What about her career? “I’ve never been anything really special. In my latter years I worked at the post office, which I loved, by the way.” "
5179,What was special was her second marriage. 
5180,"Two years after arriving on the continent, she married an Australian named Leonard Lee, and by the early 1980s they’d moved to Queensland, which Ms. Lee remembers as “wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, a perfect life.” They lived by the sea and had “two or three mango trees and about 23 pawpaw trees of our own.” The couple would barter their fruit for fresh fish caught by their friends. For fun, they played their electric organs."
5181,"“We were two halves of a whole,” Ms. Lee said of their marriage more than once during the morning."
5182,"Mr. Lee died of lung cancer in 1996, and as his wife tells it, his final words to her changed the course of her life: “Now is the time to show your mettle,” he said."
5183,"“I wanted to live up to what he wanted me to be,” Ms. Lee said. “It’s been my creed for all these years.”"
5184,"She says she had always been focused on wellness and fitness — as far back as the 1970s the Lees did cleanses, brewed their own kombucha and put lecithin on their cereal. But after her husband died, Ms. Lee said, “I had a compulsion to walk. The faster I walked, the better I felt.”"
5185,"Her athletic career began in earnest a few weeks before she turned 85. In 2011, on the advice of her physiotherapist, she competed in the Australian Masters Games and ended up winning four gold medals. "
5186,"“I was thrilled to bits with the times that I’d done and I found myself comparing myself to my competitors who were younger than me,” she said. “When I came home, a local magazine writer contacted me and asked me how I went. And I gave him my times for the four different events. He said I was within world record times. And I sort of thought, ‘Wow, this is something.’”"
5187,"From there, she was off. "
5188,"Ms. Lee now holds the world records for the 3K, the 5K and the 10K for her age group (90 to 94). The competition is not exactly fierce. There is a 92-year-old Romanian named Elena Pagu. And that’s about it."
5189,"But Heather Lee sets out every day to beat Heather Lee. “I have become very competitive with myself,” she said. “All there’s left now is for me to break my own world records.”"
5190,"By 8:30 a.m., according to Ms. Lee’s Fitbit watch, we had walked 9,206 steps in temperatures nearing 100 degrees. She was ready for a flat white. I was ready for air-conditioning."
5191,"In a nearby cafe we spoke about what she sees as her life’s purpose: conveying to younger people the importance of living right — a healthy diet and plenty of exercise. Oh, and stairs: “One of my mottos is take the stairs, not the lift. Always.”"
5192,"“I’d like to be a role model for women in their middle years who are putting on a few pounds or thinking of slowing down,” she told me. Age, she argued, “is no barrier to anything, really.”"
5193,"Perhaps, I thought, the fact that she began race walking so late in life was a gift: Her future triumphs promise to outpace her past accomplishments."
5194,I asked Ms. Lee how she felt about the beginning of 2019.
5195,“This year’s a big one because — is it going to be better than last year? Twenty-eighteen was an amazing year for me.”
5196,"I laughed, thinking of the people I know, myself included, who are dreading what this year could bring. Yet here was a 92-year-old widow who introduced me to her friends by showing me a drawer of memorial booklets from their funerals. And she is full of nothing but good cheer."
5197,"“If you push me to the limit and I drop,” she said she tells her trainer, “do not resuscitate me.” Would she, I asked, like to die while walking? "
5198,She didn’t skip a beat. “Wouldn’t that be lovely?”

5201,"WASHINGTON — When Pete Alonso, the Mets’ first baseman, collected his first hit as a major leaguer on opening day, his general manager, Brodie Van Wagenen, congratulated him, and encouraged him to do better than a soft single to center."
5202,"“For your next hit, make sure you get it on the barrel,” Van Wagenen said."
5203,"Alonso quickly complied, helping the Mets to an 11-8 victory against the Washington Nationals on Saturday in his second major league game."
5204,"Alonso, who won the starting job after spraying hits all over Florida during spring training, stroked a single to right field in his first at bat Saturday. He then blasted a Stephen Strasburg pitch over the center fielder’s head for a double. Mets fans in the left-field stands at Nationals Park started their traditional “Let’s Go Mets!” chant. Others added a new salute."
5205,“Pete A-lon-so!” they said. “Pete A-lon-so!”
5206,"The chants continued in the eighth inning when Alonso launched another double, this time off the wall in right-center. His onslaught — 3 for 4 at the plate with two R.B.I. and another run scored — powered the Mets, who staved off a late rally."
5207,"Though the bullpen surrendered four unearned runs in the ninth inning, the Mets’ 14 hits proved the difference as they improved to 2-0."
5208,"“Our offense was fantastic today,” Mets Manager Mickey Callaway said. “It ended up we needed those last two innings of runs.”"
5209,"Noah Syndergaard, the Mets’ starter, who pitched six innings but did not figure in the decision, found Alonso’s support welcome."
5210,"“Pistol Pete, the Polar Bear, trying to knock down outfield walls out there,” Syndergaard said. “Just a lot of fun to watch out there.”"
5211,"Even when he walked in the seventh inning, Alonso eventually made contact. With Alonso on first, second baseman Robinson Cano pulled a pitch down the first-base line, where Nationals first baseman Ryan Zimmerman caught the sharp grounder, stepped on first and fired the ball to shortstop Trea Turner, who caught it and tried to apply a tag to Alonso. Sliding in hard, Alonso broke up the double play."
5212,"“He was doing it all over the place,” third baseman J. D. Davis said."
5213,"Alonso was replaced by Dominic Smith in the bottom of the eighth, but his contributions were twofold. Though the Mets cited his defense as the reason he was not called up to Queens last September, he has proved adept at picking balls and applying tags. Against the Nationals, he handled a one-hop throw from shortstop Amed Rosario with aplomb and tagged out Victor Robles on a pickoff play from Syndergaard. He also managed to stay on the bag while stretching to receive a wide throw from Davis."
5214,"“Just trying to make a play for my pitcher,” Alonso said."
5215,"Callaway pointed to Alonso’s patient approach at the plate as the reason he was able to rip the ball to all fields. While left fielder Jeff McNeil continued to hit the ball well, catcher Wilson Ramos beat out an infield single and Rosario drew a timely walk, it was clear that the most effective Met on Saturday was Alonso."
5216,"“I’m living the dream right now,” he said. “Just having a blast.”"
5217,"Q: My apartment building in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, shares the block with a large high school. Teenagers frequently congregate out front, leaving litter on my stoop from snacks they buy at the corner deli, even though there’s a trash can 50 feet away. I’ve thought about calling the high school or asking the city for more trash cans, but neither seems likely to help. Short of scolding a crowd of kids (which wouldn’t work anyway), how can I get this trash cleaned up?"
5218,"A: Anyone who has spent time in a teenager’s bedroom knows they don’t have a reputation for neatness. But that doesn’t mean they can’t improve, with some prodding from the adults around them."
5219,Call the high school. Introduce yourself as a member of the community and ask that the school educate its students about cleaning up when they hang out in the neighborhood after class.
5220,"“When we’ve done group conversations with kids, it does trigger some empathy response,” said Brad Heckman, a professor at New York University’s Center for Global Affairs who specializes in mediation."
5221,"Requesting extra trash cans from the city is also a great idea. We could all use more places to put our garbage. The teens may not be willing to walk 50 feet, but maybe they’d walk 25 feet, or 10.

5250,"The streets of Park City, Utah, were again crackling this weekend with the energy of filmmakers, producers, critics, celebrities, reporters, publicists and film-loving tourists as they all converged on the city for the 2019 Sundance Film Festival."
5251,"Moviemakers come to Park City to show (and sell) their latest creations, which frequently become some of the most popular films of the year. Reporters and critics from The New York Times fly in to see the newest batch of films and make a note of what to follow in the coming year."
5252,"Manohla Dargis, the co-chief film critic for The Times, has gone to Sundance for the last two decades. What brings her back every year? When does she get excited? What does she eat? Read a lightly edited and condensed conversation with her below."
5253,How long have you been going to Sundance? 
5254,"I’ve been going for more than 20 years. I first went to Sundance when I was a regular freelancer for The Village Voice. It remains a really important festival to go to because there are always surprises, always new films that will come up and are kind of a shock to the system."
5255,How long do you stay in Park City? 
5256,"I’m there usually for the first week; it peters out at the end. Some film festivals have separate markets with buyers and sellers who are buying and selling rights for movies across the world. Sundance is a festival where you’re going in, press and industry together, so you’re going in and sitting next to the guys from Sony Classics."
5257,"In the old days, more so than today, you’d see buyers leaping up after 10 minutes and you knew they were starting to deal and haggle in the lobby. I stay at least half an hour but I will walk out of movies, because there is always another movie. If that one didn’t work, I’m going to go see if there is something else. The festival is the only place I allow myself to walk out of a movie."
5258,Where does it fit into film coverage at The Times?
5259,"It is the most important American film festival. It is one of the major world film festivals. The biggies are Cannes, Berlin and Venice, and then maybe Sundance — others might disagree. There was one year when I didn’t go and I was just so anxious about not going, like I was missing out on some discovery."
5260,"You are seeing people who are not always young, but sometimes are young, and are just going to take everyone by storm. I was there last year for the premiere of Boots Riley’s “Sorry to Bother You.” That was just a fabulous premiere. It was held at an auditorium at the town’s library. It is actually a library, with uncomfortable seats. It was exciting. It was electric to be in that kind of room."
5261,"There is so much oversaturation with coverage. I feel like, as a movie critic, I like to be able to see things before everyone else has seen them. I feel like I’m allowed to have a discovery. That is really important. When I write about them, I’m reporting back, not just to the readers but to the film section and alerting them as to what we need to look for in the coming year as things slowly are released into theaters."
5262,What is your Sundance routine? You said it involves the health food store?
5263,"Usually it is very boring. The life of a film critic at a festival is not at all glamorous. And my routine really is, basically, you dump your luggage; you run and grab your pass; do a little bit of quick food shopping because it is very difficult, at least during the first week, to eat out. Restaurants are booked. But also if you’re seeing four to five movies, there is just not a lot of time. The theaters are scattered across town. So you’re either walking long distances or taking buses to go from one theater to the next. It really becomes the survival of the savviest — sneaking food into your bag, and pockets, and everything. My friend Kenneth Turan, a film critic for The Los Angeles Times, is always eating nuts and berries out of his pockets."
5264,What do you have in your pockets?
5265,"I’m a vegetarian, but there is a really fabulous health food store there. They have sandwiches, and so I usually have a sandwich and a couple of little cookies that tide me over."
5266,How do you decide which movies you’ll see?
5267,"It is a certain amount of investigation. First you start by just reading what is there. You’re checking to see: Is there a familiar name? Who are those names? There is a certain amount of buzz. But buzz is manufactured. Movies are being talked up by the people who are handling them. Virtually every movie has a publicist, or a team — my inbox is flooded with public relations notices for the movies. I have friends who are festival programmers. They will alert me. Sometimes you’re just stumbling into things, and that can be really exciting."
5268,What do you hope readers take away from the film coverage out of Sundance?
5269,"I hope that they’re inspired. I always see things every single year that I find inspiring and exciting. That really kind of affirms that I’m right to love movies and there is a reason to love movies. Right now, there is a lot of talk about Netflix and streaming, but the theatrical experience is really important. When I’m going to Sundance, I’m sitting in a movie theater with a lot of people watching a movie and having a real theatrical experience. There is something really special about that and I really try to convey that. Movies are still something to get excited about."
5270,Which parties will you go to?
5271,"The one party I do try to go to is Cinetic Media. They are a big player in the independent film world. It is always overcrowded, and it is always too noisy, which I always complain about. It is one of those parties where you have to basically yell at the person who is five inches from your head. But if you haven’t seen someone all week, because you can be on a completely different schedule than other people, you might see them at the Cinetic party. But mainly I’m just watching movies."
5272,Are there any other things you do to prepare for the week? 
5273,"I try to walk as much as possible. I have really good snow boots — they’re ugly as sin — and I just walk everywhere. I’m sitting for so many hours a day, sometimes 10 hours a day. If I have enough time, I try to walk. It clears my head and gets me ready for the next movie. And the health food store."
5274,"Two years ago, Aidan Sleeper needed to find an apartment."
5275,"Sleeper, the locations manager for “Billions,” returning Sunday for its fourth season on Showtime, scouted more than 100 places that list for tens of millions of dollars, but he couldn’t find the right one. “It was impossible,” he said."
5276,"The apartment wasn’t for his own use — he and his wife rent in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn. No, he had to lock down a Manhattan residence for Bobby Axelrod, the “Billions” hedge fund phenom played by Damian Lewis. The space couldn’t be comfortable or cozy. It needed to intimidate, astound, overwhelm, gut punch your breath away."
5277,"“We always joke, ‘billionaire, not millionaire,’” Sleeper said on a January morning at the “Billions” production office in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, as he scrolled through a desktop folder of photos. He clicked for a moment on a $65 million triplex that hadn’t impressed him when he toured it: “You walk in there and it’s like, really?” He shrugged and scrolled on."
5278,"Months after his initial deadline had passed, as he was viewing a ho-hum TriBeCa penthouse, he saw, from its terrace, another penthouse blocks away. A glass box plunked on top of an old print factory, it had a double-height living room, a wraparound terrace, 270° views of the Hudson and the East River, too. It was urban, masculine, almost stark in its poured concrete floors and severe lines — it said billionaire, not millionaire. He rented it."
5279,"Shows like “Billions” and HBO’s “Succession,” a prickly drama about a Murdoch-like media dynasty that returns for its second season this summer, have to offer a convincing visual representation of the ultrawealthy, the 1 percent of the 1 percent. Jesse Armstrong, who created “Succession,” described a governing principle: “Let’s just be as truthful as we can.”"
5280,"Truth isn’t always flattering. Unlike the wealth-porn TV of earlier decades — “Dynasty,” “Dallas,” “Gossip Girl” — these shows address a cultural moment in which many of us are infatuated with extreme wealth and also disturbed by it. Dramas with glints of dark comedy, “Succession” and “Billions” aren’t exactly aspirational. The camera finds every under-eye circle, amplifies each impersonal office. Even that penthouse looks almost ugly from certain angles."
5281,"The design of these shows implies, more and less subtly, a critique of wealth itself. Come for the private jets, stay for the inevitable dehumanization."
5282,"To illustrate a billionaire lifestyle, the designers of each show researched the wealthy online and combed through magazines like “Architectural Digest” and “Vogue.” But extremely rich people don’t always want their homes photographed and they may not wear couture."
5283,"“When they hit the billion and above number, they’re no longer in a place where they have to impress anybody by their outward trappings,” said David Levien, one of the creators of “Billions.”"
5284,So each show retains a number of wealth consultants — some of them billionaires and some of them vendors who cater to billionaires — who advise on what uniforms household staff might wear or which artworks should adorn a corporate office.
5285,"Occasionally volunteer consultants also chime in. One hedge funder emailed the “Billions” creators (who declined to identify him) to complain about Axelrod’s dinky private plane. “I wouldn’t be caught dead in that sardine can,” he wrote. (Said sardine can retails for around $40 million.) Sometimes outward trappings do matter."
5286,"For the “Succession” pilot, the production team wanted to create an apartment for Logan Roy, the paterfamilias played by Brian Cox, that would suggest power, not magazine cover ostentation. Kevin Thompson, the pilot’s production designer, borrowed two floors of the Council on Foreign Relations, dressing it as a penthouse duplex."
5287,"When the show was ordered to series, that space was re-created on a small Queens soundstage. To walk into that apartment — assuming you aren’t a billionaire — is to feel overawed and even a little giddy at its reckless proportions. But the furnishings, though extremely tasteful, are subdued, the palette dull."
5288,"“You can hear the money, but it’s not screaming at you,” Thompson said."
5289,"Still, the various design departments have to put across billionaire style on a thousandaire budget. (O.K., tens or hundreds of thousands, but still.) On each set calculations are made as to what to pay top dollar for and what to beg, borrow or fake."
5290,"In Logan Roy’s apartment, the furniture is real as are a few of the antiques. But the paintings are scanned copies or pastiche — even HBO money doesn’t run to real Gauguins — and the tapestries are not exactly priceless. “The audience will never know,” Stephen Carter, the current production designer, said as he walked through the soundstage on a February afternoon."
5291,"On another “Succession” soundstage, workers were building a private jet. On television it would look luxurious and the oversized seats were authentic, donated by the aerospace company Embraer. But the opulent interior? Contact paper pasted to plywood."
5292,"“Expensive Japanese contact paper,” Carter clarified. “But essentially it’s a sticker.”"
5293,"One department where you can’t really fake it: Wardrobe. On the same day I met Sleeper, Eric Daman, the “Billions” costume designer, walked me through the labyrinth of clothes. He stopped in front of Bobby Axelrod’s rack, mostly jeans, T-shirts and hoodies. Several of the hoodies come from Loro Piana, an Italian ready-to-wear brand, and retail for around $2,000. But they are cashmere, and anyone acquainted with babies’ bottoms can confirm that these absurdly priced hoodies are, in fact, softer. (The Los Angeles-based designer Vince is another hoodie go-to.) Somehow the camera notices."
5294,"Yet there are limits. A few weeks before, Daman had ordered an $1,800 cashmere T-shirt from The Row. He’d felt a little nauseous about it, but “I thought it was going to be something special,” he said. It wasn’t, so he sent it back."
5295,"“I’m glad we could all experience it and then [expletive] about it,” he said."
5296,"Some of the more expensive items have been gifted or lent to the production. Daman pointed to a wall of what he described as “promo bags,” accessories sent from Stella McCartney and Phillip Lim that the show might use. Michelle Matland, the costume designer on “Succession,” also receives promotional items and isn’t above shopping on resale sites like The Real Real to save money. “I’m very popular at the outlet malls,” she said."
5297,"Cost aside, one way these shows suggest wealth is less about the items themselves than how the characters react to them. In the second season of “Billions,” Bobby and Lara Axelrod board his-and-her private jets with no more fanfare than a quick goodbye kiss. The characters aren’t awed, so the camera isn’t either."
5298,"“Succession” mostly steers clear of beauty shots. Armstrong told his team, “Let’s never try to persuade anyone or sell anyone on an element of this lifestyle.” The characters tend to treat wealth casually, even disdainfully, regifting a Patek-Philippe, stepping into a Sikorsky helicopter as if it’s one more town car."
5299,"“Part of the fun of the way our audience experiences this wealth is by feeling how unimportant it is to these people,” Carter said."
5300,"But is that fun? Much of what made shows like “Dynasty” and “Dallas” so successful was how they fetishized the externals of wealth. The “Dynasty” reboot on CW continues that tradition, letting the camera linger on the shoes (the shoes!), the jewels, the fountains."
5301,"Sallie Patrick, the “Dynasty” showrunner, said that she felt an obligation to continue the extravagance of the original. But even a network guilty pleasure like “Dynasty” resists offering what she called “true pure wish fulfillment.”"
5302,"“It’s a little more satirical, it’s a little more tongue in cheek and we’re commenting on how ludicrous it is,” she said. There’s a running joke about $1,000 fanny packs."
5303,"When even “Dynasty” unleashes a socioeconomic critique, it suggests suspicion of the very rich, an anxiety that they may not be like the rest of us. That anxiety might have merit. The 1980s — the era of the first “Dynasty” — and the present are periods associated with huge increases in wealth inequality."
5304,"“Rich people have become so different from the average person,” said Shamus Khan, a Columbia University sociology professor who researches the political influence of economic elites. “They’re of interest in the way that a zoo animal is of interest.”"
5305,"These shows may even provide a perverse comfort to the rest of us, reflecting how great wealth can often produce feelings of alienation, a phenomenon Khan has studied."
5306,"“People imagine that it’s going to bring some meaning to them or satisfy some need,” he said. However, “rich people often describe themselves as feeling dead inside.”"
5307,"The wealthy characters in these shows often choose money over family, community or moral integrity. The design — luxurious, but sometimes cold and unbeautiful — reflects that."
5308,"Still, alienation, on the billionaire scale, may have its upsides. On an afternoon in early March, Sleeper walked me through the Bobby Axelrod penthouse. Wood gleamed, metal shone, the winter sun flamed through the living room’s 18-foot windows and Manhattan arrayed itself below."
5309,"Sleeper stepped out onto the terrace. “I know I will never have this, and that’s something that doesn’t bother me,” he said."
5310,"“But at same time, could I imagine, like, would it be amazing to live in this space?” he added. “Absolutely.”"
5311,"From Downtown East in Minneapolis, it’s only a four-block walk to the U.S. Bank Stadium, the glass-sheathed building that opened in 2016 and is host of the NCAA Final Four basketball tournament from April 6 to 8. The neighborhood is seeing action of its own lately. Beautiful warehouses converted into condos, along with tasteful shops and restaurants, are filling in the once-industrial area. Brenda Langton, the chef and owner of the organic and locally focused Spoonriver restaurant and the founder of the Mill City Farmers Market, both in Downtown East, has seen it all. “It’s a very diverse neighborhood and people come from all over to walk the riverfront in the evening when the lights really make it shine,” she said.

5323,"School districts that predominantly serve students of color received $23 billion less in funding than mostly white school districts in the United States in 2016, despite serving the same number of students, a new report found."
5324,"The report, released this week by the nonprofit EdBuild, put a dollar amount on the problem of school segregation, which has persisted long after Brown v. Board of Education and was targeted in recent lawsuits in states from New Jersey to Minnesota. The estimate also came as teachers across the country have protested and gone on strike to demand more funding for public schools."
5325,"“You can tell these dollars make a difference,” said Rebecca Sibilia, the chief executive of EdBuild, a nonpartisan organization focused on improving the way states fund public education."
5326,"“Walk into a rural nonwhite community,” she said. “Walk into an urban nonwhite school district. You can see what that means in terms of how much that has added up over time.”"
5327,"The report took aim at school district borders, which it said can chop up communities and wall off wealthier districts to fund their schools with local property tax revenue, while poorer districts are unable to generate the same revenue."
5328,"“Because schools rely heavily on local taxes, drawing borders around small, wealthy communities benefits the few at the detriment of the many,” the report said."
5329,"The report, which looked at state and local funding for school districts in the 2015-16 school year, found that more than half of the nation’s schoolchildren are in racially concentrated districts, where over 75 percent of students are either white or nonwhite."
5330,"On average, nonwhite districts received about $2,200 less per student than districts that were predominantly white, according to the report."
5331,"School districts are generally funded locally, but states are supposed to “fill in the gaps” so communities are evenly funded despite wealth disparities, Ms. Sibilia said. The report showed that in many states, “they are not keeping up with their own obligation,” she said."
5332,"Differences in funding translate to the classroom, where underfunded communities often use older, worn textbooks and have less access to computers, said Francesca López, associate dean of the College of Education at the University of Arizona."
5333,"“I can tell you as a parent and as a researcher, when I walk into a school district that is in one of these low-funded areas, it is a stark contrast,” Dr. López said. “They are basic rights to education, but look like amenities in comparison. It’s dramatic.”"
5334,"The report identified certain states, like New Jersey, as among the “worst offenders.” In New Jersey, which divides students up into more than 500 districts, predominantly nonwhite districts received about $3,400 less per student than mostly white districts, the report said."
5335,A spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Education said he had not seen the report and could not immediately comment.
5336,"Arizona also had one of the most drastic differences in funding among states listed in the report. Dr. López said that in her state, “boundary lines are a huge contributor because of gerrymandering, segregation and zoning.”"
5337,"But she said the situation in Arizona was exacerbated by a new kind of “white flight” because of the popularity of charter schools and open enrollment, a policy that allows parents to request that their children attend schools outside the district. In Arizona, funding generally follows the student, rather than staying in the district."
5338,"“It’s depleting even more funding from these districts that were already at a disadvantage to begin with,” Dr. López said."
5339,"Richie Taylor, a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Education, said the department was aware of disparities in the state but did not believe the gap was “as egregious” as the report suggested."
5340,"“Equity and fairness are a major concern for us and we are open to exploring a variety of options to address these problems,” he said in a statement."
5341,"But he said the State Legislature would need to take action to consolidate school districts, something school boards generally oppose."
5342,"“It is far from certain that consolidation would help here,” he said. “What will help is more funding for education across the board,” with a focus on addressing inequities."
5343,"But Ms. Sibilia said that larger, more inclusive school district borders could help “smooth out” some of the wealth disparities in many places in the United States."
5344,"“If you have a wealthy suburb or subdivision that happens to have very high-value homes, that is a subdivision that is going to be able to raise a significant amount of money from their property taxes,” she said. “If you have a huge shopping mall in a suburb and you have a school district where they can keep their sales taxes, that’s also going to play a role in the ability to spread out that money.”"
5345,"But right now, Ms. Sibilia said, about 180 school districts nationwide exist entirely within a larger school district — a figure she said showed how some school districts have become their own enclaves."
5346,"“When it comes to education,” she said, “it is a public good and people need to share their wealth with their neighbors.”"
5347,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lashed out at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in a wide-ranging speech last week, criticizing the agency he effectively controls for its inefficiency and outdated technology."
5348,"Though the thrust of Mr. Cuomo’s speech pushed for congestion pricing, he took particular aim at the transit authority for its decision-making related to cleaning subway stations."
5349,"“My favorite M.T.A. decision — because you have to laugh, otherwise you cry — is the one they made to pick a product to clean the subway stations,” Mr. Cuomo said Thursday, accompanied by a photoshopped image of a man cleaning the floor of a subway station. “What product did they pick? Tide. Yes, the same Tide detergent you use at home to wash your clothes. If it’s got to be clean, it’s got to be Tide.”"
5350,"Mr. Cuomo’s criticism, however, did not seem to register with some riders. The New York Times spoke to nearly two dozen riders on Sunday, none of whom were aware of Mr. Cuomo’s comments."
5351,"But most agreed about the state of the subways: They are filthy, and it does not matter how they are cleaned. Riders just want to see improvements."
5352,"“It’s pretty gross,” William Sit, 32, said. “It’s not uncommon to have puke on the floor or even on the train as a smell.”"
5353,"[Track fires, crowded platforms and delays: Read more tales from subway hell.]"
5354,"Standing on the platform for the Q train at the 72nd Street Station, Mr. Sit, a Brooklyn resident, said the cleanliness of stations varies drastically. The newer stations, like one at 72nd Street that opened two years ago, are cleaner."
5355,"“It’s not getting better,” said Cynthia Morgan, a 66-year-old from New Rochelle, N.Y., who was waiting for the shuttle at Times Square. “It’s a daily experience.”"
5356,"While M.T.A. officials did not directly address Mr. Cuomo’s criticism, they did acknowledge that too many stations are “unacceptably dirty,” and said the M.T.A. is taking steps to address it."
5357,"“It was clear that the old methods simply weren’t working, and this new, different and urgent approach will provide our customers with the service and experience they deserve,” Maxwell Young, a spokesman for the M.T.A., said in a statement."
5358,"In January, the M.T.A., as part of the Subway Action Plan to improve the system, allocated funds for a one-time effort to clean and refurbish 100 stations and up to 3,000 cars. The M.T.A spent $9.5 million on outside contractors to perform the work."
5359,"“The fact that the M.T.A. is using Tide to clean the subways punctuates the point that a fundamental overhaul in approach and management is needed,” Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said in a statement."
5360,A spokesman for the M.T.A said Tide was used before the new cleaning initiatives.
5361,Riders seemed concerned whether the subways could be kept clean as a result of the large number of homeless riders.
5362,Several said they have noticed an increase in the number of people sleeping on the trains. The subway has long been a refuge for homeless people looking to stay warm during the winter months.
5363,"“The smell of the homeless — it’s very sad,” said Martha Carrillo, a 66-year-old resident of Jackson Heights, Queens, who expressed sympathy for their condition but said people who sleep on the subway often bring unpleasant odors."
5364,"Richie Johnstone, a 26-year-old Manhattan resident, said he has had to switch train cars because of the smell."
5365,"“I had one experience where I walked on the car with my girlfriend and there was a homeless man sleeping there, and the subway car smelled so bad that there was literally not a single person on the car,” Mr. Johnstone said. “Everyone walked on and walked back off and got on the next one.”"
5366,"Kathryn Katz, a frequent visitor to New York City from New Haven, Conn., was one of the few riders who said she had seen improvements in subway cleanliness over the past few decades."
5367,"“I remember the subways back in the 50s and 60s with rats and everything,” Ms. Katz, 70, said. “It’s significantly cleaner."
5368,"She added: “Considering the amount of volume of people going through, it’s just amazing that it’s as clean as it is. You think there’d be trash all over the place.”"
5369,"The Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles occupy different ends of the competition spectrum. The Yankees possess a far more talented roster, World Series expectations and a payroll that is around $130 million larger. The Orioles lost 115 games last season, and some analysts believe they could lose more this year with a pared-down roster."
5370,"Three games into the season, the Yankees have now lost to the Orioles twice, including a clunky 7-5 defeat on a chilly, wet Sunday."
5371,"“Not ideal,” the Yankees’ starting pitcher, J. A. Happ, said after Sunday’s game, which was delayed 3 hours 17 minutes because of rain. Happ took his first Yankee Stadium loss since August 2013; he had won seven consecutive decisions there."
5372,"A day after the star right fielder Aaron Judge said the Yankees needed to learn from the mistakes of last year and capitalize on opportunities regardless of opponent, the Yankees featured uneven pitching and sputtering hitting."
5373,"Over their two losses, the Yankees stranded 25 runners and went 5 for 21 with runners in scoring position."
5374,"Part of the difference between the Yankees, who won 100 games and earned a wild-card berth last year, and the Boston Red Sox, who won 108 and claimed the American League East crown and eventually the World Series, was how they fared against the Orioles. The Red Sox won 16 of 19 games; the Yankees won 12."
5375,"“We had them on the ropes and weren’t able to get the job done,” Judge said of the Orioles. “Like I said, we’ve got to play like our backs are against the wall.”"
5376,"Much like their performance the day before, the Yankees’ hitters sputtered. They could not turn five walks by the Orioles’ starter, Dylan Bundy, over three and two-thirds innings into more than three runs."
5377,"Most of the Yankees’ runs came in the fourth inning when Brett Gardner drew a bases-loaded walk and Judge delivered a two-run single. But Judge finished the game with four strikeouts and left six men on base. Luke Voit, the designated hitter, stranded seven."
5378,"“Disappointed with the start we’ve gotten off to,” Gardner said. “We’ve got a lot of baseball left.”"
5379,"Among the problems for the Yankees, besides the uneven offense, was catcher Gary Sanchez, who has been hoping to rebound from the worst all-around season of his career. For a second straight game, he had a throwing error on a stolen base attempt, with this one contributing to an Orioles run in the fifth inning."
5380,He somewhat atoned for his defensive mistake — and strikeouts in his three previous at-bats — with a solo home run in the seventh inning off John Means.
5381,"The Yankees’ pitching did not help, either. Making his season debut after re-signing in the off-season, Happ allowed four runs over four innings. All of the scoring off Happ, who is a fly-ball pitcher, came on home runs: a three-run blast in the first inning by Renato Nunez and a bases-empty homer in the fourth by Trey Mancini."
5382,"Although Happ settled in after a jagged first inning, his high pitch count and coming matchups prompted Manager Aaron Boone to turn the game over to Luis Cessa and the bullpen."
5383,"Any chance of a comeback was lowered when Stephen Tarpley allowed a two-run homer to Joey Rickard in the eighth inning that pushed the Orioles’ lead to 7-4. And when the Yankees again threatened in the ninth, they squandered another opportunity with runners on base."
5384,"“That’s one part I feel good about: We’re creating opportunities,” Boone said. “Up and down the lineup, we’re getting those chances. Now we’ve got to break through.”"
5385,"In this series, Emily Spivack, the author of “Worn Stories,” interviews creative people about their most prized possessions. Here, the actress Chloë Sevigny describes her longtime interest in Damien Echols, one of the West Memphis Three — the teenagers who were wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for murdering three boys in West Memphis, Ark., in 1993 — and an artwork he made while on death row that she now keeps on a bookshelf in her Manhattan apartment. Sevigny stars in the new Hulu show “The Act,” which premieres on March 20, 2019."
5386,"I had been following the West Memphis Three case since I got out of high school in 1993. It exposed me to the injustices of the criminal justice system, and I was particularly smitten with Damien Echols’s personality, his intensity and his intellect. I came from a generation that grew up on the West Memphis Three documentaries and identified with those kids. When it’s somebody like the kids you know and hang out with, it hits you on a personal level. "
5387,"I was getting off the N or R train at Eighth Street, walking up the steps, and I see this guy walking down Broadway with these dark sunglasses and a long black leather trench coat. I yell, “Damien!” I stop and he stops. He looks at me, and I just start crying. It was Damien."
5388,"[Coming later this spring: the T List newsletter, a weekly roundup of what T Magazine editors are noticing and coveting. Sign up here.]"
5389,"It was 2011 and Damien had just gotten out of prison after serving over 18 years. He and the two other boys, the West Memphis Three, were on death row for many years after they were wrongfully accused. He must have only been out for a few weeks when I saw him."
5390,"I was like, “I don’t know what to say. I’m so happy you’re out.” Damien hugged me and said, “Hi, I’m Damien.” I said, “Hi, I’m Chloë.” We talked for about 15 minutes. He told me he liked to walk around Manhattan. I mean, can you imagine the sensory overload of Manhattan after being in prison, in solitary? He gave me his business card that had an ankh on one side and it said Damien and his phone number on the other. I didn’t ask for a picture with him or anything. I just wanted to be there, show him love, somehow communicate what a powerful force he was for me and for the universe in general. Then I walked away totally shook."
5391,"I started texting him, and then Instagram happened and I found him there. We sparked up a friendship. I was buying his books and going to his readings. He started showing his art, and I saw this bird on Instagram, which he was showing at a gallery in Los Angeles. He’d made it out of paper, soap, glue, acrylic and paper clips while he was on death row. I wondered how he got this piece out of prison because I knew from the books he had written that they would destroy his papers and art. I called the gallery and asked how I could purchase it. I wanted to support him — and also it’s such a profound piece."
5392,This interview has been edited and condensed.
5393,Dr. Regina Maree Myers and Joshua Alexander Kulick were married March 30 at the Loews Hotel in Philadelphia. Rabbi Stacy Rigler officiated.
5394,"The bride, 32, is a fellow in pediatric hematology/oncology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. In July, she is to receive a master’s degree in clinical epidemiology from the University of Pennsylvania. She graduated from Cornell with honors, and received a medical degree from Yale."
5395,"She is a daughter of Beatrice Myers and Alexander Myers of Bayside, Queens. The bride’s father is a manager for a Walgreens Pharmacy in Manhattan and is the former president and chief executive of Alexander Pharmacy, which was also in Manhattan. Her mother, a former senior producer of the NBC “Today” show in New York, is now a freelance television producer."
5396,"The groom, 35, is the director of software systems at Independence Realty Trust, a real estate investment trust in Philadelphia. He also serves as board president of Allens Lane Art Center, a Philadelphia-based nonprofit arts organization. He graduated magna cum laude from Lehigh."
5397,"He is the son of Anita Kellerman Kulick and Joel David Kulick of Dresher, Pa. The groom’s mother is the president and chief executive of Educating Communities for Parenting, a social service nonprofit organization in Philadelphia. His father is an independent commercial real estate appraiser and investment broker, also in Philadelphia."
5398,"Ms. Myers and Mr. Kulick met through a dating app Sept. 24, 2016 — shortly after each had moved to Philadelphia from New York — and went on a first date to a bar later that evening. He said he knew the first date would be different when she crossed the street and walked toward him."
5399,"“I remember the voice in my head telling me that I needed to do everything in my power to ensure that this first date led to a second,” he said."
5400,"Long before the bar and their conversation had shut down for the evening, Mr. Kulick had indeed secured his second date with Ms. Myers. He mentioned that Beyoncé would be performing in Philadelphia the following week, and slyly asked if she would go with him if he had tickets."
5401,"Ms. Myers said yes, and a short while later, when she excused herself to go to the restroom, Mr. Kulick quickly bought tickets for the Beyoncé concert on StubHub. He showed them to Ms. Myers when she returned. “I was like, ‘What!’ Ms. Myers recalled. “I was just incredulous.”"
5402,"They began dating almost immediately. Their first few months were filled with a dizzying blitz of concerts, sports events and long walks exploring Philadelphia’s food scene."
5403,"Ms. Myers was not as certain as Mr. Kulick about a future together. But on their third date, he brought along a bouquet of flowers and he told her why: “Because I like you and it’s a nice thing to do.”"
5404,"“I was a jaded New Yorker when it came to the dating scene,” she said. “I always seemed to go for the life-of-the-party guys, the loudest guys in the room. Then Joshua comes along and though he’s sort of quiet and a bit introverted, he’s the sweetest, most thoughtful and generous person I had ever met. My family loved him and so did my friends.”"
5405,"And so did she, a fact she could no longer ignore."
5406,"“Within a few months, our connection was undeniable,” she said. “We had the best time together and seamlessly fit into each other’s lives, but also were not afraid to challenge each other and support each other through personal and professional obstacles.”"
5407,"WASHINGTON — President Trump and his top economic advisers have sent a series of conflicting messages about the status of trade talks with China: A deal is either imminent, still out of reach or somewhere in between."
5408,"Or, as Mr. Trump suggested on Thursday, “We are well on our way to doing something special” with China or the United States could decide to “walk from a deal.”"
5409,"The Trump administration this week halted plans to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports as the two countries try to agree on terms that would end a monthslong trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The move was seen as a good-will gesture by Mr. Trump, who is eager to reach an agreement and has begun talking about a signing meeting with President Xi Jinping of China, perhaps in late March, at the president’s Florida resort."
5410,"“I think we’re heading for a historic deal,” Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on CNBC on Thursday. “The outlook for a deal is very positive.”"
5411,"But other top advisers, including Mr. Trump’s chief negotiator, have played down the prospect for a deal, outlining a tough road ahead as the United States tries to secure lasting promises from the Chinese."
5412,"Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on CNBC that the United States and China were working off a 150-page document and that he hoped enough progress could be made so that the two presidents could appear at a summit meeting."
5413,"“This is a very, very detailed agreement for some very significant commitments,” said Mr. Mnuchin, who was traveling in London. “And these are structural commitments, but we still have more work to do.”"
5414,"Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, was decidedly more cautious on Wednesday, saying both sides were making “real progress,” but it was still an open question as to whether an enforceable deal could be reached."
5415,"“Let me be clear: Much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more important, after it is reached, if one is reached,” he told House lawmakers during a Ways and Means Committee hearing."
5416,"The Trump administration has been trying to put a positive spin on the talks, in part to help mollify jittery investors who have sent financial markets tumbling in response to any signs of negative news on the trade front. Mr. Trump has publicly claimed that the tariffs have been helpful to the United States economy, but most economists say the tariffs are a drag on growth. Big multinational companies have begun attributing weaker profits to the trade dispute and the tariffs are beginning to affect consumer prices in the United States, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco."
5417,"A report released this week by the Institute for International Finance found that China’s retaliatory tariffs on American goods have more than offset Mr. Trump’s tariffs. China’s tariffs have depressed United States exports, causing America’s trade deficit with China to expand last year. The biggest beneficiaries from the trade war, according to the report, are Brazil and Russia, which have increased both exports and imports with China."
5418,"Mr. Kudlow acknowledged that the talks had not been seamless, including last week, when a delegation of Chinese officials came to Washington to try to hash out details. He said that the second day of midlevel negotiations was canceled because of a lack of progress. Mr. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top negotiator, “read them the riot act” to get things moving, Mr. Kudlow said."
5419,"He added that progress has been made on the “structural” changes that the United States wants China to make, but he suggested it is now up to Mr. Xi to finalize the terms of an agreement."
5420,"People familiar with the negotiations, who declined to be named because the talks were not public, said the Chinese had made offers to strengthen their laws around patents and copyrights, open their markets to foreign financial services firms and carmakers and bolster laws around the coerced transfer of technology."
5421,"But the Chinese have not made substantive commitments to overhaul state-owned enterprises, stop cybertheft or relax their tight restrictions on the movement of data that hamstring foreign technology firms, they said."
5422,"Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, said Mr. Lighthizer had clearly been working hard to improve Chinese behavior in a substantive sense. “But have we moved the bar since the beginning of the Trump administration? The answer is no,” he said."
5423,"“We don’t look at all close to meaningful enforced provisions on intellectual property,” Mr. Scissors said. “We are nowhere close to a good deal.”"
5424,"Mr. Lighthizer defended his progress on the structural issues on Wednesday, but he cautioned that “there’s no agreement on anything until there is an agreement on everything.”"
5425,"Mr. Mnuchin played down any disagreements among Mr. Trump’s economic team, proclaiming that everyone had a “common vision” for an agreement."
5426,"There are also looming questions about how any deal would be enforced. Mr. Lighthizer said Wednesday that the Chinese had agreed to periodic meetings at the levels of office director, vice minister and minister that would allow the United States to keep tabs on China’s behavior and air complaints from companies about unfair business practices. If China fails to keep its agreement, the United States would respond “proportionally but unilaterally.”"
5427,But enforcement remains a sticky subject among China’s leaders. Details remain scarce about how such complaints would be adjudicated and whether China would agree to an arrangement that would force it to accept punishment from the United States without recourse.
5428,"Trump administration officials have supported a unilateral enforcement mechanism that would make the United States the sole judge of China’s behavior. They do not appear to be considering a mechanism that would refer violations to the World Trade Organization, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Lighthizer have fiercely criticized for treating the United States unfairly."
5429,"Some White House officials privately expressed frustration on Thursday following comments made by Cui Tiankai, the Chinese ambassador to the United States, to The South China Morning Post. Mr. Cui said that some of the changes that the United States was asking the Chinese to make would take five to 10 years to accomplish."
5430,"The fallout from the latest round of negotiations with North Korea over its nuclear program also represents a new wild card. In the past, Mr. Trump has expressed frustration with China when problems with North Korea arose and the collapse of negotiations this week could exacerbate that."
5431,"During a news conference in Vietnam on Thursday, after walking away from an agreement with North Korea, Mr. Trump said that he was also prepared to walk away from the China talks if necessary."
5432,"“I mean, I am always prepared to walk. I’m never afraid to walk from a deal,” he said. “And I would do that with China, too, if it didn’t work out.”"
5433,"Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the poet, publisher, painter, social activist and bookstore owner, has been San Francisco’s de facto poet laureate and literary Pied Piper for seven decades. He turns 100 this month, and the city is making preparations to celebrate him in style. The mayor’s office has proclaimed March 24, his birthday, Lawrence Ferlinghetti Day. Readings and performances and an open house will take place at City Lights, the venerable bookstore he co-founded in 1953. Parties and happenings and the screening of documentaries are planned at many other locations as well."
5434,"The most unlikely celebration will be the release party this month for “Little Boy,” Mr. Ferlinghetti’s slim new autobiographical novel, which is also a love song to his adopted hometown, a place with “endless street movies passing in cars and trams of desire.” "
5435,"Any reader’s trip to San Francisco should start with a visit to City Lights. On a cool, damp late morning in February, my wife and I walked the mile from the downtown Union Square area to the store, which sits near the border of Chinatown and its raffish North Beach neighborhood, and is within a stone’s throw of more than one faded, gloomy topless joint. "
5436,"Pound for pound, City Lights is almost certainly the best bookstore in the United States. It’s not as sprawling as the Strand, in Manhattan, or Moe’s Books, in Berkeley. But it’s so dense with serious world literature of every stripe, and so absent trinkets and elaborate bookmarks and candles and other foofaraw, that it’s a Platonic ideal. It can inspire, even in jaded bookstore-goers, something close to religious awe."
5437,"Mr. Ferlinghetti opened City Lights in 1953 when he was in his early 30s, with a business partner who soon departed. The store survived an obscenity trial in 1957 after its publishing arm issued Allen Ginsberg’s revolutionary “Howl and Other Poems.” The trial made Ginsberg and Mr. Ferlinghetti internationally famous almost overnight."
5438,"City Lights became a nerve center for the Beats and other writers. Allen Ginsberg wrote “Howl” while living in an apartment at 1010 Montgomery Street, a few blocks from the bookstore. Jack Kerouac often blew in. In the original scroll of “On the Road,” he wrote: “once again I wanted to get to San Francisco, everybody wants to get to San Francisco and what for? In God’s name and under the stars what for? For joy, for kicks, for something burning in the night.”"
5439,"Not everyone loved the Beats, even in wide-open San Francisco. The columnist Herb Caen, nonplused, invented the term “Beatnik” in 1958, which made the Beats sound like something you’d want to flick off, like fleas."
5440,"Ginsberg, Kerouac and other writers from that era were Easterners who dropped into San Francisco for a spell. But San Francisco’s mid-20th-century literary reputation extends far beyond the Beats. Richard Brautigan, the author of “Trout Fishing in America,” arrived in 1956 and stayed nearly 20 years. Among the more intensely local writers were the poet Kenneth Rexroth, a father figure to some of the Beats, as well as the poets Gary Snyder, who was born in the city, Michael McClure and Diane di Prima, who moved to San Francisco in 1968 after leaving Timothy Leary’s intentional community in upstate New York. Today, writers like R.O. Kwon, the author of “The Incendiaries,” the poet D.A. Powell, and Dave Eggers make San Francisco their home."
5441,"In the 1950s and until recently, with the slow demise of snail mail, City Lights was the post office that kept writers’ mail while they traveled. The store carried early gay and lesbian publications. Its bulletin boards were the unruly alternative press of their time. They were where you’d announce a political rally or seek a ride, a roommate, a job, a scene or a sex partner."
5442,"For many years the store was open until 2 a.m. It remains open until midnight seven days a week, a fact that should humble New York’s bookshops, which tuck in much earlier. City Lights was known, back in the day, as the place to go if you wanted to stick a book down your pants and walk out with it. (Security has improved.) Over the years, it has become an institution, so much so that in 2001 it was made an official historic landmark."
5443,"If City Lights is a San Francisco institution, Mr. Ferlinghetti himself is as much of one. Tall, shy, mischievous, blue-eyed, gray-bearded and balding (he’s looked old since he was young), sometimes seen in Nehru jackets or on tatami mats during the 1960s and 70s, he has loomed over the city’s literary life."
5444,"As a poet, he has rarely been a critical favorite. But his flexible and plain-spoken and often lusty work — he has published more than 50 volumes — has found a wide audience. His collection “A Coney Island of the Mind” (1958) has sold more than a million copies, making it one of the best-selling American poetry books ever published."
5445,"Mr. Ferlinghetti has become part of San Francisco’s civic furniture, speaking out when something needs to be saved — for example the Gold Dust Lounge, where Janis Joplin and Tony Bennett hung out, and which once upon a time was a burlesque bar owned in part by Bing Crosby. In 2013 the bar moved into the heavily touristed Fisherman's Wharf area, where its gritty dive-bar ambience makes it a welcome morsel of authenticity."
5446,"Mr. Ferlinghetti’s gadfly goal has often been, simply, to keep the city weird. At other moments he has spoken up in moments of crisis. In 1978, after the assassinations of George Moscone, the city’s mayor, and Harvey Milk, the city supervisor who was one of the first openly gay elected officials in the United States, Mr. Ferlinghetti wrote a poem that was published two days later in The San Francisco Examiner. It was titled “An Elegy to Dispel Gloom,” and it began: “Let us not sit upon the ground / and tell sad stories / of the death of sanity.” It ended: “such men as these do rise above / our worst imaginings.”"
5447,"According to Barry Silesky, in his biography of Mr. Ferlinghetti, the city thanked him personally for the poem, which “helped maintain calm in the city in the face of tragedy.” "
5448,"A few weeks ago, I reached out to Mr. Ferlinghetti, explaining that I was coming out to the city to write about him and about his San Francisco — that is, about the places that have meant something to him. I hoped to pay him a visit, I said, and to glean some thoughts about my itinerary."
5449,"At 99, Mr. Ferlinghetti is largely blind. He was not, I was told, quite up to receiving visitors. But we had two lively telephone conversations. In advance, I’d told both his publisher and his assistant that I planned to ask about his favorite places in the “cool, grey city of love,” as the poet George Sterling called it."
5450,"Yet when I rang, Mr. Ferlinghetti barked at me. “This is just the kind of interview I don’t like to do,” he said. “These sort of questions just leave me blank.” He condemned “travel section stuff.” I didn’t have the heart to tell him I was writing this article for the Travel section. I changed the subject to books and culture. Soon we were getting along like great old friends."
5451,"William S. Burroughs, the author of “Naked Lunch,” is the most undervalued Beat-era writer, Mr. Ferlinghetti told me. (Burroughs did not visit the city until the 1970s, and after that only passed through on occasion.) “His vision of the future was as profound as any writer of his generation, and that includes George Orwell.” He was cheered that Bob Dylan received the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature. “Dylan was first of all a poet,” Mr. Ferlinghetti said. “His early songs were all long surrealist poems.”"
5452,"I asked him how he managed to score a performance in “The Last Waltz,” Martin Scorsese’s documentary about The Band’s “farewell concert appearance.” It was filmed in San Francisco at the Winterland Ballroom on Thanksgiving Day in 1976. Less than a decade later, the Winterland was demolished to make room for apartment buildings. Other poets also read poems onstage before the concert began, but he was one of the few to appear in the film, he told me, because he spoke into the correct microphone."
5453,"With no advice from Mr. Ferlinghetti to guide us, we decided to simply walk a great deal, paying attention to Beat and other literary sites, restaurants from the era, San Francisco’s many bookstores, and just the vibe of this most beautiful of major American cities."

5495,"Walking the city was what Mr. Ferlinghetti, who was born in Yonkers, did when he arrived here on January 5, 1951. He’d crossed the country by train and taken a ferry from Oakland. “I had a seabag, I got off the ferry,” he once said in an interview. “I put the seabag on my shoulder and started walking up Market Street.” "
5496,"He never stopped walking, in those early days. “San Francisco had a Mediterranean feeling about it,” he said. “I felt it was a little like Dublin when Joyce was there. You could walk down Sackville Street and see everyone of any importance in one walk.” "
5497,"I am not the world’s most enthusiastic long-distance walker, believing with Christopher Hitchens that “this walking business is overrated: I mastered the art of doing it when I was quite small, and in any case, what are taxis for?” But San Francisco coaxed out my inner perambulator."
5498,"We stayed in the Hotel Nikko (clean, hip, teeny-tiny rooms) in Union Square. On our first day in the city, we walked the mile or so to City Lights, moving past, in the light rain, the stately mansions of Nob Hill."
5499,"From City Lights we hit The Beat Museum a block or so away. It’s a bit rundown and seedy. But it’s a place to marinate for a while in 50s-era literary nostalgia. For an $8 admission fee, you can ogle things like Jack Kerouac’s tweed jacket and Ginsberg’s typewriter."
5500,"Nearby is Jack Kerouac Alley, which connects Grant Avenue in Chinatown with Columbus Avenue, North Beach’s main drag. Kerouac liked to hang out at City Lights and at Vesuvio Cafe, a famous bar across the street. The Alley is packed with murals and stone-and-metal plaques inscribed with poetry by Kerouac, Ferlinghetti, John Steinbeck and others."
5501,"San Francisco is proud of its long literary history, and it’s impossible to ramble for long here without coming upon bookish landmarks: Mark Twain Plaza, Alice B. Toklas Place, Frank Norris Street, Jack London’s birthplace, Robert Frost Plaza, Bob Kaufman Alley, the Robert Louis Stevenson Memorial."
5502,A starter kit for escaping into the world.
5503,"We popped into Caffe Trieste, the oldest coffee house in San Francisco, a block away from City Lights. This one-time Beat hangout has maintained its old vibe and is still going strong. Mr. Ferlinghetti often wrote here. So did others, including Francis Ford Coppola. There’s a photograph of Mr. Coppola, on the memorabilia-cluttered walls, working here on the script for “The Godfather.”"
5504,"In his new book, Mr. Ferlinghetti writes about Caffe Trieste: “nothing ever changes decade after decade, the faces change but it’s the same characters drawn from the population of the world, and where I am with my constant companion my lonely self and the only plot of this book of my life being my constant aging.” "
5505," Amy Tan’s 1989 novel “The Joy Luck Club” was largely set in our next stop: Chinatown. We made a beeline for the venerable bar Li Po Cocktail Lounge, named after a hard-living Chinese poet. Li Po was a popular Beat after-hours joint and Anthony Bourdain popped in when he was in town"
5506,"Inside, Li Po has battered red leather booths and a wraparound bar. We drank our Chinese mai tais (which, like the hurricanes at Pat O’Brien’s in New Orleans, will lay you out) in near darkness. I was reminded of one of The New Yorker editor Harold Ross’s story ideas. He asked, “How dark is it legally permissible for a bar to be?”"
5507," Outside, the bar has an intricate, six-sided, 70-year-old neon Chinese lantern, one that appears in Orson Welles’s 1947 film “Lady from Shanghai.” San Francisco has more beautiful and expansive neon signs than any other city in the United States, some of them in front of bars that seem to have emerged from an Edward Hopper painting. These signs, happily, have their own preservation society. It’s possible to book walking tours to see the best of them. For me, that’s a must for next time."
5508,"For a late lunch we went to Tadich Grill (another long walk) in the Financial District. Like Mr. Ferlinghetti, it’s a survivor, the oldest continuously run restaurant in San Francisco. (It opened as a coffee stand in 1849.) It is believed to be the third-oldest continuously run restaurant in the United States, after the Union Oyster House in Boston (1826) and Antoine’s in New Orleans (1840). We ate oysters and the Petrale sole, a Pacific coast fish, both first-rate. Also first-rate is the décor, dark wood with brass accents and a long, long wooden bar. It feels a bit like you’ve walked into a great old steakhouse, or the Saloon at the Grand Central Oyster Bar."
5509,"City Lights is far from the only bookstore in town. In the Mission District, we picked off several, including Dog Eared Books and Borderlands Books, both on Valencia. Dog Eared Books is perfectly cluttered, with a mix of new, used and remaindered books. Borderlands is a geek paradise — it specializes in new, used and rare science fiction, horror and fantasy. Then we sidled into the 826 Pirate Supply Store, which is part of 826 Valencia, the educational nonprofit founded in 2002 by Dave Eggers and Ninive Calegari. We’d have loved the pirate supply store if we’d been 7 years old again."
5510,"Taking a break from book shopping, we got in line at Swan Oyster Depot, which has been around for more than 100 years. This small joint has 18 seats at its counter. We arrived a half-hour before opening, but the line was already long. (Bourdain has sung Swan’s praises; it’s now a serious tourist destination.) We waited an hour and a half for our seats, wondering if we were lemmings. We weren't. The oysters, the crab backs in butter and their version of crudo, washed down with an Anchor Steam, were good beyond measure. All restaurants should keep their white wine selection so unpretentiously on display, with cluttered bottles placed on ice in a stainless steel pan. "
5511,"That evening we took BART to Berkeley, because we had to visit two bookstores there. First Moe’s, a revered indie which opened in 1959. You can get lost for an entire day in Moe’s, where some 150,000 new and used books are spread over four floors. Pegasus Books is smaller, but expertly curated. The night we were there, the cashier was spinning old jazz records on a turntable. We flew home with heavy luggage."
5512,"On our final day, we woke late and had an early lunch, at Sam Wo, perhaps the oldest restaurant in Chinatown. Its first iteration was built shortly after the San Francisco earthquake of 1906. This, too, was an unpretentious Beat-era hangout; Charles Bukowski, Ginsberg and many others dined here. The restaurant, now on Clay Street, is still unpretentious, but the food (eggs with shrimp and duck jook, which is a kind of porridge) was fresh and very good."
5513,"My favorite San Francisco poet these days is August Kleinzahler, who often writes about bellying up to a bar. But, we asked ourselves, what would Mr. Ferlinghetti do now? We took a Lyft to the Presidio and walked the mile or two to the entrance of the Golden Gate Bridge. Then we walked across. In “Travels with Charley: In Search of America” (1962), Steinbeck recounts driving across the bridge as “the afternoon sun painted her white and gold.” The span seemed to him like an “acropolis rising wave on wave against the blue of the Pacific sky,” a “stunning thing, a painted thing like a picture of a medieval Italian city which can never have existed.”"
5514,"I would like to report that walking across was a Zen activity, one that brought me closer to why so many gifted writers have been drawn to this city. But with traffic roaring past nearby and the cold wind whipping and my latent vertigo threatening to kick in, I was glad to get to the other side."
5515,"We had no idea how to get from the far side of the bridge back to our hotel, so we climbed on a tour bus that was idling in a parking lot. This was a bad call. The guide, who was driving, was as blustering and half-baked as a used car commercial. We were his captive audience and, though we'd only been in the city a handful of times, knew more about its landmarks than he did. We debouched from the bus feeling shaken but freshly energized, like we’d busted out of a hostage situation."
5516,"“San Francisco has only one drawback,” Rudyard Kipling once wrote. “’Tis hard to leave.” And so it was for us. Even though more than a few essential Beat-era locations may have vanished — including The Six Gallery on Fillmore Street, where Ginsberg read a full-length version of “Howl” on October 7, 1955 (all that remains is a plaque) — enough remains that it doesn’t take much imagination to conjure up their world during a visit."
5517,"Late that night, I dipped into a new book, called “Ferlinghetti’s Greatest Poems.” In “I Am Waiting,” he writes, in words that speak to San Francisco’s ever-changing moods: "
5518,I am waiting 
5519, for the Last Supper to be served again 
5520, with a strange new appetizer
5521, and I am perpetually awaiting
5522, a rebirth of wonder.
5523,"“Little Boy: A Novel,” by Lawrence Ferlinghetti (Doubleday). Out this month, this loosely autobiographical novel is a summing-up near the end of a big, wide, productive life. It’s the story of how, Ferlinghetti writes in the book, he “came into his own voice and let loose his word-hoard pent up within him.”"
5524,"“Ferlinghetti’s Greatest Poems,” by Lawrence Ferlinghetti (New Directions). This is a chronological and sprightly overview of Ferlinghetti’s six-decade-long career, filled with poems about everything from lust and politics to baseball and the author’s love for San Francisco and its vicissitudes. Another possible title might have been: “Just Enough Ferlinghetti.”"
5525,"“I Greet You at the Beginning of a Great Career: The Selected Correspondence of Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg, 1955-1997 (City Lights Publishers). One was the publisher of “Howl,” the other its writer. Their fond early correspondence shows them negotiating fame, scandal and friendship."
5526,"“Writing Across the Landscape: Travel Journals 1960-2010,” by Lawrence Ferlinghetti (Liveright). Ferlinghetti was a committed traveler, and these selections of his journals, selected from his handwritten, mostly unpublished notebooks, step with grace and good humor across many worlds."
5527,"“Ferlinghetti: The Artist in his Time,” by Barry Silesky (Warner). This 1990 biography of Ferlinghetti is out of print, but not hard to find online. It’s a well-researched and fundamentally sympathetic account of Mr. Ferlinghetti’s yea-saying life and times."

5529,"When Nina Compton first drew national attention by competing in a 2013 season of Bravo’s “Top Chef,” she fell just short of victory. Last May, she secured a far more prestigious prize: She was named best chef in the American South by the James Beard Foundation, the culinary world’s Oscars. Ms. Compton, 40, won for her work at Compère Lapin, her New Orleans restaurant, where the menu is inspired by the Caribbean comfort food of her youth in St. Lucia, and prepared with the technical expertise and mastery of Italian cuisine that she honed in the kitchens of Daniel Boulud, Scott Conant and Norman Van Aken over the past two decades. "
5530,"Ms. Compton lives full time in New Orleans and oversees both Compère Lapin and a newer restaurant, Bywater American Bistro. In her professional life, she juggles two main men. Larry Miller, her husband of nine years, oversees the front of house at both restaurants. Levi Raines, her onetime sous chef, manages the kitchen at Bywater American Bistro, under her supervision, as she focuses on Compère Lapin. "
5531,"Recently, I tracked Ms. Compton during a week that had her jetting from one high-profile culinary event to the next — while also sweating the small plates in her restaurants."
5532,"5:30 a.m. I am trying to get into the habit of taking 15 minutes to stretch, have coffee, watch the sunrise — but it’s hard to remind myself that those little things are important. Instead I check my email in bed, focusing on last night’s closing report and today’s incoming orders, which dictate my day. I don’t really eat breakfast, just coffee and a large bottle of sparkling water. I don’t often eat regular meals, actually. As a chef you’re always kind of tasting along the way."
5533,"6:30 a.m. I spend most days at Compère Lapin, our restaurant in the Warehouse district. It’s about a mile away, and I ride my Vespa."
5534,"7 a.m. We have people working various shifts from 4 a.m. until midnight every day, so pretty much as soon as I arrive each morning, I’m managing and delegating. I review the daily prep list and assign tasks, whether it’s breading coquettes or roasting chicken bones for the stock. When produce arrives, the first big order of the day, I triple-check it and start sauce production — a simple shellfish sauce, a cauliflower purée for the pasta. When the protein order arrives, I get to work butchering."
5535,"7:45 a.m. A cook calls and says she can’t come in — back problems. That means I’m now both butcher and line cook, too, not to mention kitchen expediter once lunch gets busy."
5536,11:30 a.m. Lunch service begins and quickly gets busy. No one ever makes a reservation for lunch.
5537,"1:30 p.m. My dear friend Lee Schrager invited me to appear as part of a guest chef series at Hotel Faena in Miami Beach on Friday, and I have tons to do. For events like this, it’s always easier to bring some mise en place with you."
5538,"As lunch service winds down, I break away to check email, run a preshift meeting for the next day and then start prepping for Friday. I make a guava curry, which I’ll cryovac, and I also start the braised oxtail."
5539,"2:30 p.m. Time to start pasta production. My sous chefs know how, but I’ve been making it for years and it’s just faster if I do it; it’s not worth having someone spend four hours on one task if I can do it in 90 minutes. Before dinner I make 20 pounds of butternut squash ravioli, 80 pounds of sweet potato gnocchi and 40 pounds of scialatielli."
5540,"5:30 p.m. Tonight it’s busy off the bat, and we’re still short-handed. When you run a kitchen, no matter how crazy and chaotic it gets, you have to be the calm one. You cannot show any sign of fear — the guests pick up on it. The beauty of this kitchen, though, is that everybody helps everybody. We break down what needs to be done step by step, reassuring one another."
5541,10:30 p.m. Service finally winds down. I go back to prepping more for Miami.
5542,"1 a.m. I head home and respond to emails. I like doing email late at night — not many people are up this late, which buys me time."
5543,"7 a.m. Sometimes the next morning just feels like the continuation of the previous day. I commute to Compère Lapin, do emails, start checking in orders."
5544,"11 a.m. I visit my purveyor, Michelle Posey, at Pelican Produce. She provides beautiful produce to every chef in the city, all of it grown right here in the Ninth Ward, and I like to go in person to see what’s coming. I almost want to cry when she comes in with these beautiful baskets of vegetables. Her radishes are so petite and round and clean. I love her produce."
5545,"3 p.m. Lunch service winds down, and after an hour of paperwork — setting staff schedules, reviewing protein, produce and dairy orders, more email — I head to Bywater American Bistro for a photo shoot for Nola.com. I like these photo shoots — I get to make a nice dish, and it’s a nice opportunity to build my repertoire with a professional photo. But personally I’m still awkward in front of the camera. I’m like: Really, just take a picture of the food."
5546,5:30 p.m. I head upstairs to do laundry and start packing for Miami.
5547,"7 p.m. My chef partner, Levi Raines, joins me for dinner down the street at a place called Pizza Delicious. Yesterday was my birthday, and now we have a chance to celebrate. We get our usual: pepperoni, a Caesar salad, pitcher of beer. There’s bad pizza everywhere, but this place is pretty close to New York."
5548,"7 a.m. Wake up, pick up Levi, head to the airport."
5549,"1 p.m. After we land and check into the hotel, we eat lunch outside at Francis Mallmann’s Argentine restaurant, Los Fuegos, in Miami Beach. As a chef, I can never fully turn off when I eat at other restaurants — I’m always critiquing, always tasting stuff, checking stuff. And when I travel with Levi, we’re constantly bouncing ideas off each other. But today we’re starving. We get a lot of grilled meat, and it really hits the spot."
5550,3 p.m. We tour the event space at Hotel Faena. Thankfully this one has its own fully equipped kitchen; often at hotel events you’re crammed in the same kitchen as the regular room service and dinner service.
5551,"7:30 p.m. We head to South Beach for dinner at Macchialina, the restaurant of my best friend from my days as a chef in Miami, Mike Pirolo. We always play jokes on each other — this time I didn’t tell him I was coming and just walked in. But we always pick up right where we left off."
5552,"9 a.m. Heavy prep day: We receive all the product, start portioning fish and make items like pasta, sauces and stocks."
5553,4 p.m. We finish prepping for the day. Time for a break.
5554,"5:30 p.m. Cocktails with my publicist. We’ve worked together since my days as the chef at the Fontainebleau in Miami. Our relationship now spans 10 years, and our goals have changed a lot since then: We are no longer the new kid on the block; we have to reconfigure things so we stay fresh in people’s minds. You can’t tell the same story over and over."
5555,10:30 p.m. We call it a night and head back to the hotel to rest up for tomorrow’s event.
5556,9 a.m. I wake up and have an espresso on the hotel balcony and read my emails in silence. Sometimes a different setting allows me to focus a little better.
5557,"10 a.m. I check in with my sous chef back at Compère Lapin, Phil, to see how everything’s going: All staff have shown up, deliveries are on time and correct. I also follow up with the sous chef and general manager at Bywater American Bistro to go over any notes from the night before about guest satisfaction, food consistency training, staff morale. When a restaurant is only six months old, every small detail must be analyzed."
5558,"Noon As I’ve gotten older, I try to include some time to slow down and reset. (I’m also an island girl at heart, so any chance to go to the beach, I’m there.) I walk along the beach, relax in a lounge chair by the water and call my brother, whose birthday is today."
5559,"3 p.m. Final walk-through with the staff and a review of logistics — start time, guest count, special dietary needs."
5560,"8:30 p.m. Guests arrive. I give a welcome speech discussing the format: seven courses on the theme of “New Orleans meets Miami,” with a Caribbean twist. The guests got the true Nola feeling — Mardi Gras centerpieces, even a brass band. Dinner service flows nicely — having someone from your team there makes life so much easier. "
5561,"11:30 p.m. We meet up with Mike for cocktails at a place called Sweet Liberty — he insists on continuing my birthday celebrations with some champagne. We dance the night away with an amazing band, Patrick and the Swayzees. I love dancing and letting loose, and before I know it, it’s 2:30 a.m."
5562,5:30 a.m. Time to head to the airport. Thankfully last night I didn’t get too crazy. I actually feel great.
5563,"9:30 a.m. I stop at home, change and head back to Compère Lapin."
5564,"10:30 a.m. After a trip I like to go through the walk-in cooler and get my hands on everything to make sure everything is up to par. This roughly takes two hours. (During the day you have 20 people in and out of the walk-in, and things can get messy — I tell staff to keep it looking like a Dean and Deluca, not a Save-a-Lot store.) Next I taste all the mise en place on the line. I spend time with the cooks to make sure everything is correct, and crack a joke or two."
5565,3 p.m. I start making the night’s pasta.
5566,"5 p.m. Another line check before dinner service, then back to pasta production. Dinner service ramps up quickly, so I switch to expediting service, while my sous chefs on the line help the cooks get through the push."
5567,"11 p.m. I take a moment to walk into the dining room. I love doing this when I can — I love feeling the vibe of people eating, laughing, listening to music, the mood of a restaurant. I always make eye contact and smile at guests when I walk through. Their smiles are contagious."
5568,"Midnight I end the night at the new restaurant. Then head home, shower, drink a glass of wine, double-check for any emails I may have missed and call it a night. In a few hours I’ll be back at Compère, going through the daily prep list, checking with the pastry cook to make sure the pastries are displayed at the coffee shop and setting up for the rest of breakfast."
5569,"Interviews are conducted by email, text and phone, then condensed and edited."
5570,"R. Kelly stood above her in his gray suit, screaming. He jumped out of his chair and pounded his chest, yelling into the camera. Gayle King sat in front of him, just inches away, emanating nothing but calm."
5571,"In his first interview since he was charged with sexually abusing four women, three of them underage, the R&B singer spoke with Ms. King of CBS This Morning at the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago — and he completely lost hold of his composure."
5572,"In the interview, which aired in segments last week, they spoke about his finances, his crumbling reputation in the music industry and whether he has ever had sex with minors."
5573,We asked Ms. King what it was like to be on the other side of that interview. This conversation has been edited and condensed.
5574,[Read our critic’s review of Gayle King’s full primetime interview of R. Kelly on CBS.]
5575,How did the interview come about?
5576,"Somebody on his team reached out to me on Thursday [Feb. 28] and asked if I would be interested in talking to him, and I’m like, uh, R. Kelly himself? Yes, I’d be very interested. They said, when would you like to do it? I said, is he available tomorrow? The earliest he could do it would be Tuesday, would you be able to fly to Chicago on Tuesday? I said, count me present. [Mr. Kelly was free on bail, but went back to jail the day after the interview for failure to pay child support. He was released again on Saturday.]"
5577,What ground rules did you set up?
5578,"They didn’t want any questions about Aaliyah, which I was fine with. I feel we have heard the Aaliyah story. Really, this interview was about R. Kelly’s reaction to the “Surviving R. Kelly” documentary and the latest charges, and they said he cannot discuss the latest charges because those are still in court. O.K., fine. I still feel we had a lot of information to get from R. Kelly."
5579,What was going through your mind when he got hysterical?
5580,"I could see it escalating, but I didn’t think he was going to jump out of his chair. Even when he jumped out of the chair, I have to say, I didn’t think he was going to do anything to me. It’s just that he was extremely emotional and extremely worked up."
5581,"The problem is when you get that out of control — the way he was hitting his fist and the way that he was cursing, the intensity of his voice — sometimes you can’t control yourself, so I just didn’t want to get hit accidentally. So I just decided, let me just sit here very quietly, and I would look at him to let him know, I’m not getting up. I worried that if I got up, that would say to him, this is over, this interview is over, even on a subliminal level, it’s O.K. to leave."
5582,"The worst thing you can do when someone is that emotional is to say, “calm down.” You know what it’s like, if you’re really worked up and somebody tells you to calm down, it’s like, “I AM calm!” So I knew I didn’t want to do that. So I thought, let me just sit here quietly and let him know that I’m not going anywhere. When you’re finished, we’ll continue. That was really my attitude."
5583,"In my head, if there was a thought bubble, it would have been: Please don’t walk out, please don’t walk out, please don’t walk out! Because I’ve seen him walk out of interviews. And I’m sitting here thinking, we’re not even halfway done! I was just thinking, I want to salvage this, I want to save this."
5584,Did you feel any sympathy for him during or after his outburst?
5585,"I felt sympathy for a human being that I could see was coming unglued. I don’t have sympathy for the charges or the allegations. And I don’t ever want to witness something like that. And I do think that he needs help. After, I told him, I hope you do get therapy, I think it could be helpful."
5586,You have two children. What was going through your mind when the two women who are living with R. Kelly spoke about their devotion to him and their disdain for their parents? 
5587,"[The parents of the two women, Azriel Clary, 21, and Joycelyn Savage, 23, accuse Mr. Kelly of brainwashing them.]"
5588,"I just thought, you girls have no idea. I think one day they’re going to look back on this and go, what the hell was I thinking? At the end of the day, you’re going to need your family. I believe your family is going to be there long after R. Kelly is not. Because we don’t know how the R. Kelly story is going to end."
5589,Have you ever had an interview subject respond with such an outburst before?
5590,"I’ve had people get irritated, but no, I’ve never had that happen to me before. I can’t say that I know how to handle this kind of thing or that I was prepared for this kind of thing because I wasn’t expecting it. I just knew that I wanted to save that interview, and I wanted to do whatever I could to save it without getting out of my chair."
5591,"[Read more: R. Kelly, Michael Jackson and the Lingering Questions About Child Sex Abuse Cases]"
5592,"Some of his answers are difficult to believe, like the idea that he had never had sex with an underage girl even though he was married to Aaliyah when she was 15. Do you think he hurt himself with those answers? "
5593,"I don’t think he helped himself, because I think 99.9 percent of people who have been following this story believe that he was married and had sex with Aaliyah, she was certainly underage. That’s at least one that we do know about. And we’ve seen interviews with other women who told us that they had sex with him when they were underage. Listen, I knew going into it he was going to deny. I expected that. I didn’t expect him to say that he had done nothing wrong. But there was no sign of acknowledgment or contrition about anything."
5594,You mentioned on “CBS This Morning” that your children called you and Oprah called you to see if you had been afraid. Were they worried about you?
5595,"They were worried. They thought that maybe I might have been frightened. If you look at the pictures and the video, it does look frightening. I guess nobody wants to see your mom get yelled at, but I didn’t necessarily feel that he was yelling at me. I thought that he was having a rant, and I was just in the path of his anger."
5596,"When it was over and R. Kelly was out of earshot, what did you and your colleagues say to each other? "
5597,We were all a little stunned by what had happened. No one acted like that was no big deal. We all said we’ve never seen anything like that.
5598,"A dozen years ago, the University of Washington barred athletic coaches from having contact with anyone in the admissions department."
5599,"With a move that now seems prescient, two new administrators supervising athletics sought to allay any concerns that coaches could put undue pressure on admissions personnel. The change also brought more oversight to athletics, in this case through a committee of senior faculty members, deans and other university representatives."
5600,"The previous arrangement, said Philip Ballinger, an associate vice provost now overseeing admissions, “didn’t have sufficient transparency; it didn’t have enough eyes on it.”"
5601,"The leeway coaches get in recruiting has long been a point of discussion in higher education circles. But after federal investigators last week revealed a broad admissions cheating scandal, a number of colleges began asking hard questions about how they evaluate athletic applicants and oversee the chosen few whom coaches recommend for admission."
5602,"In what prosecutors described as the biggest case of admissions fraud they had investigated, 50 people were accused in a scheme that involved paying bribes to coaches and to people who monitor admissions tests in order to fraudulently get the children of wealthy patrons into some of the nation’s most elite colleges."
5603,Some students were accepted as recruited athletes even though they did not play the sports described in their applications. They gained an advantage through the widespread practice of allocating a certain number of admissions spots to athletes who might not get in otherwise.
5604,"This process has been followed for decades in the pursuit of competitive teams, which burnish a university’s reputation, inspire alumni loyalty and often help with fund-raising."
5605,"Now, the fraud case has sent a thunderbolt through the higher education community."
5606,"“Every college president in America called his athletic director the morning after that admissions fraud story broke and asked: How do we make sure this doesn’t happen at our school?” said Bill Martin, the athletic director at the University of Michigan from 2000 until his retirement in 2010. “And certain athletic directors were smart enough to call their presidents first to insist that they were going to start verifying the status of every admitted recruited athlete.”"
5607,"Indeed, at Yale University, where F.B.I. investigators say the longtime women’s soccer coach accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars to facilitate the admission of a recruit who did not actually play soccer, the university president, Peter Salovey, announced late last week that new oversight policies had already been put in place. The Yale athletic director will begin reviewing every proposed recruit’s credentials before admission, and recruited athletes who fail to make a team after they arrive will receive “close scrutiny,” a university statement said."
5608,"A broad overhaul of athletic admissions systems in Division I, the highest level of N.C.A.A. competition and the level the colleges in the scheme compete in, has been overdue, according to several athletic administrators interviewed in recent days."
5609,"Battles over blue-chip recruits in football and basketball already tend to be heavily scrutinized. In those upper echelon sports, if there is money changing hands, it is from coaches to recruits, not the other way around."
5610,"But in the lower-profile sports like crew, volleyball, tennis and soccer — often called the Olympic sports — there has been more room for bribes and exploitation. And the most common route in such a fraud is to designate a phony athletic prospect as a “recruited walk-on.” In nearly every case of counterfeit athletic credentials cited in last week’s indictments, from Stanford to Texas to Yale, the prospective athlete appeared to be filling the nebulous role of recruited walk-on."
5611,Such applicants are not even assured a spot on the team. But they are often on a list of five to 20 athletes — it varies from sport to sport — that a coach is permitted to submit to the admissions department.
5612,"The two daughters of the actress Lori Loughlin, who was charged in connection with the fraud case last week, were passed off as crew recruits despite never having competed in the sport, according to federal prosecutors."
5613,"That choice of sport may not have been an accident. In a sport like women’s crew, where rosters can balloon to 125 athletes, many teams have scores of recruited walk-ons. (Such large rosters can help a college comply with federal equality laws, balancing out the number of male athletes in football.)"
5614,"“When the rosters are that big, like they are in women’s crew, I could see where it would be possible for a coach to slip in an unqualified person as a recruited walk-on,” said Martin, who added that Michigan annually audited team rosters."
5615,"The recruitment of athletes in such sports may be an even bigger factor in the admissions process at colleges in the N.C.A.A.’s lowest tier, Division III, where athletic scholarships are forbidden."
5616,"Division III is also the largest tier, with nearly 450 institutions, including many of the country’s most selective small liberal arts colleges, where acceptance rates can be as low as 15 percent. These colleges might field as many as 30 teams from enrollments as small as 2,000, with varsity athletes, many of them afforded an advantage in admissions, making up 30 percent to 45 percent of the student body."
5617,"These small colleges, like the largest ones, also give preferential treatment to applicants who excel in music, the arts and a host of other skills. There are also allowances for students from the least-populated states."
5618,"“Admissions is filling all the different buckets,” said Wendy Smith, the athletic director at Haverford College, a highly rated institution near Philadelphia. “And our athletes are right in there. We are not in any way gaming the system. They are absolutely on par academically.”"
5619,The cost of fielding a successful sports team in the ultracompetitive college athletic landscape often leads to other troubling conflicts of interest.
5620,"In the Ivy League, for example, most coaches are responsible for fund-raising that bridges the gap between support from the college and the true price tag of competing successfully. That can lead to uncomfortable decisions about composing a team, especially since athletes’ families often become the leading donors."
5621,"“You have a family who will give you $25,000, but then you are not going to play their daughter?” said Paul Wardlaw, who was the women’s tennis coach at Brown University for 14 years."
5622,"“The whole scandal is interesting, and it’s human nature to take the easy route,” he said, “but there are some systematic issues that are contributing to this.”"
5623,"At many elite institutions, the notion that recruited athletes have been granted an unfair advantage is palpable."
5624,"Cameron Green, a tight end on the football team at Northwestern University, which accepts about 13 percent of applicants, conceded that several of his high school classmates who did not play sports had applied to Northwestern and been rejected."
5625,"“It’s easier for athletes to get in, so I know that’s hard for regular students,” said Green, a senior who does not plan to play football in his final year of eligibility. “A lot of kids I knew were confused when I got in and they didn’t, but you know, at the end of the day, the school looks at your demographics on a piece of paper and decides to admit you before they even meet you.”"
5626,"The high percentage of recruited athletes at some colleges, particularly smaller ones, has other consequences, some of them at odds with institutional ambitions for a diverse student body."
5627,"Because success in youth sports today often comes more easily to affluent families who spend copiously on private instruction, the rosters of college teams have become predominantly white — nearly 80 percent at some small schools."
5628,"In the end, some in the higher education community believe that last week’s admissions fraud scandal, while an embarrassing lesson in what policy changes need to be made, is nevertheless creating a false impression of the state of admissions procedures at American colleges."
5629,"“There is now this notion that admissions is a competitive cesspool, and it’s not,” said Michael Reilly, the executive director of the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers. “In fact,” Reilly added, “most campuses nationwide fail to meet their enrollment goals. But then we have this segment that’s highly competitive and has created a completely different dynamic. If I were on those campuses, I’d be sitting down and saying, ‘Let’s rethink how we’re doing this.’”"
5630,"Good morning. When the children were little and the dog was barky and the nights seemed to last forever in fits of colic and long walks down chilly streets to calm them, the closest thing to respite we had was Peruvian chicken from the place two blocks away, rotisserie-cooked birds perfumed with wood smoke and sent home with small tubs of spicy cilantro sauce. We’d eat standing in a tiny kitchen or sitting on a couch, thrilling to the flavor, fingers stained with grease, as Dan Zanes kept everyone tiny copacetic for the moment, as the song went, from Albany to Buffalo."
5631,"I miss those days and that restaurant, but I can bring them back soon enough by cooking Melissa Clark’s recipe for Peruvian roasted chicken with spicy cilantro sauce (above) and flipping through old photographs, from when we still printed photographs. You don’t need to join me in my nostalgia trip, my dad-life sentimentality, but you ought to cook that chicken. Because that is one seriously delicious dish, and three cheers to Melissa for it. (I like these baked sweet potato fries on the side.)"
5632,"But perhaps you’d prefer slow cooker creamy kale with fontina and bread crumbs? It’s like millennial Moosewood cookery, the sort of thing you’d serve in a yurt and be happy you did, before reading the internet before bed. Or pasta with green beans and almond gremolata? It relies on celery leaves as a secret ingredient! Or cold kimchi noodles? It’s a Monday in January. You don’t need to eat meat."

5634,"Now, it’s maybe more to do with culture than it is with cooking, but a friend turned me on to Tom Holland’s genial popular history work, “Rubicon: The Triumph and Tragedy of the Roman Republic,” and this amazing sentence about the rise of Roman culinary culture: “Scallops, fatted hares, the vulvas of sows, all came suddenly and wildly into vogue, and all for the same reason: for in the softness of a flesh that threatened rapid putrescence yet still retained its succulence the Roman food snob took an ecstatic joy.” And there I was about to complain about oat milk and air fryers!"

5637,"Finally, John Dos Passos was born on this day in 1896, and that’s enough to bring out this passage from the beginning of “The 42nd Parallel” that I’ve always thought describes the writer’s life:"
5638,"The young man walks by himself, fast but not fast enough, far but not far enough (faces slide out of sight, talk trails into tattered scraps, footsteps tap fainter in alleys); he must catch the last subway, the streetcar, the bus, run up the gangplanks of all the steamboats, register at all the hotels, work in the cities, answer the want ads, learn the trades, take up the jobs, live in all the boarding houses, sleep in all the beds. One bed is not enough, one job is not enough, one life is not enough. At night, head swimming with wants, he walks by himself alone."

5665,"In New York, almost every living situation involves a trade-off of some kind. As Joseph Boudin discovered during his first few years in the city, figuring out how to balance the pros and cons of various locations, rents, roommates and apartments is a difficult art to master."
5666,"Since moving from Alabama four years ago, Mr. Boudin, 25, has lived in five apartments, each a brief attempt to find a long-term home. After a year in Manhattan, he moved to Staten Island to save on rent, although he was working in Midtown East. When he discovered the commute was miserable, he overcorrected by moving into a Hell’s Kitchen room-share where his rent, at $1,875, rivaled that of a studio apartment. And he still had to travel across town to work. "
5667,"Then he found a $1,200-a-month bedroom in an Upper East Side walk-up that turned out to be his worst calculation of all. Going in, he knew the accommodations wouldn’t be deluxe. The two-bedroom apartment was small, shabby and on the sixth floor."
5668,"“When my best friend moved me in, she said, ‘Joseph, are you sure you want to live here?’” Mr. Boudin recalled. “There was a hole around the bathroom pipe that was the size of a dinner plate.”"
5669,"What he didn’t know was that his roommate’s brother would go from temporarily sleeping on the living-room futon to permanently living there. Or that his roommate would frequently rent his own room through Airbnb to make money, during which time he would also sleep in the living room. "
5670,"Making the cramped conditions even more unpleasant, Mr. Boudin also had to contend with the brothers’ Labrador retriever. Contrary to the breed’s reputation, it was anything but friendly."
5671,"“The dog was huge and vicious — it really didn’t like me,” Mr. Boudin said. “I’d come home and the dog would be barking. And I couldn’t ever be in the living room because there was always a dog or a person in there.”"
5672,"Everyone, including the brothers, agreed that the setup was less than ideal. They were on good enough terms, however, to decide that finding a larger apartment together was the answer. The three were moving forward with plans to rent a three-bedroom in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, when Mr. Boudin reconsidered."
5673,"“All the red flags were up: First of all, it was too small. Second, we’d still have the dog and the brother with us. The brother also wasn’t employed, so we would have had to pay his fee. And then there was the L train shutting down,” said Mr. Boudin, an account executive for a furniture company in Midtown. "
5674,"Earlier in the search, Mr. Boudin and his roommate had found a place through Rezi, a company that leases apartments wholesale from landlords and rents them to tenants at market rate. There is no broker’s fee, and once tenants are approved they can rent any Rezi apartment their income qualifies them for — in Mr. Boudin’s case, up to $2,300 a month."
5675,"But the roommate hadn’t met Rezi’s qualifications, so they looked elsewhere. Now, browsing the company’s listings, Mr. Boudin found several East Harlem studios for under $2,000 a month. If he could afford to live alone in Manhattan, he thought, he wasn’t going to live with roommates in Brooklyn."
5676,"$1,725 | EAST HARLEM"
5677,"Occupation: Account executive at Walters, a furniture company.He immediately liked the apartment’s location: “There’s a park, a church and a school nearby — those all seemed like good signs to me. There’s also a Target, Costco, Marshalls and Aldi. And one of the No. 1 restaurants in the city is right down the street from me, Rao’s, although I’ve never been there. I asked how long it takes to get a reservation, and they said two years.”Still, it’s fun to live near Rao’s: “You’ll walk down the street at 5 or 6 p.m. and see Maseratis, limos coming down the street.”Except for the smaller-than-average refrigerator, Mr. Boudin loves the apartment’s renovation: “All the fixtures are so nice, there’s a washer-dryer, and I think the layout is great.”Friends in the neighborhood: Mr. Boudin convinced a friend from Alabama to take an apartment a short walk away — also a Rezi listing — and now they frequently cook for one another. He has also started volunteering at the Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue and 90th Street."
5678,"In September, he signed a lease for a newly renovated, first-floor apartment on 114th Street, for $1,725 a month."
5679,"“I feel like I finally found my home. This place is a palace compared to the last place,” Mr. Boudin said, marveling that he had gone from a bathroom with broken tiles and a gaping hole in the floor to one with black marble and a waterfall shower head."
5680,"Although his new living situation is more expensive than the previous one, it is still less than he was paying for the Hell’s Kitchen apartment. And his commute, on the Second Avenue bus, takes about 25 minutes."
5681,"He also loves living on the first floor. “The building is a walk-up, but I don’t have to walk up, so it’s like living in a luxury building,” he said. "
5682,"And despite facing the street, he added, the noisiest thing in the apartment is usually the steam pipe."
5683,"“One time people were talking outside — it was late — so I opened the curtains and said, ‘Boo! Can you please be quiet? I’m trying to sleep,’” Mr. Boudin said. “They said, ‘Oh, sorry,’ and left.”"
5684,"Even the difficulty of making it to an Equinox gym, where he had a membership, turned out to be a blessing in disguise: He joined a nearby Planet Fitness for $10 a month, a fraction of what he had been paying."
5685,Living alone has also meant being able to his use his Ralph Lauren china and Tiffany crystalware — packed away after several mishaps at the last apartment — on a daily basis.
5686,"“I’m definitely happy to be without roommates,” he said. “I’ve had some great ones, but I never want to go back to the burden of roommates again.”"
5687,"At his new apartment, he added, he is the only one sleeping on the sofa, an Ikea model he reupholstered in Ralph Lauren fabric using a sewing machine and a hot-glue gun."
5688,"“I bought a fold-up bed when I moved in, but I never use it,” he said. “The couch is as large as a twin-size bed, and I sleep fine.”"

5697,"The only surprising thing about finding out that I had a stress fracture was that it hadn’t happened before. For nearly 13 years of running, I had avoided the dreaded walking boot. That streak ended last week."
5698,Spring races: canceled. Spirits: deflated. Dog who likes to go on walks five times a day: annoyed.
5699,"You may be reading this and thinking — ugh, why run, Jen? This sounds so painful. And let me tell you: Cracking your tibia is quite painful. It’s annoying too. I don’t enjoy walking like a penguin, or how difficult it is to drive a stick shift car right now (when I drive at all). And as nice as it sounds to work from bed, I’d prefer to be writing from my usual spot at the dining room table, where my dog can’t try to jump on my laptop while I tell you how miserable I am."
5700,"But if I step back and look back over my time running, three injuries in 13 years doesn’t seem like all that terrible of a trade. In the grand scheme of potential catastrophes, four weeks in a walking boot isn’t so bad. It’s not as if one of my organs doesn’t want to work anymore or even that my tibia cracked all the way through. I can still walk the dog, although it’s slower than usual. Considering everything that could go wrong, being annoyed because I hurt my leg is one of the least bad things."
5701,"But already a longing to run free has set in. I’m trying to look at it this way: If I hadn’t spent more than a decade doing this one physical thing that brings me so much joy — and has kept me healthy, happy and strong — I wouldn’t know what I was missing, and what I’ll be getting back to, sometime later this year."
5702,"I know a lot of you have been through this, and have probably been stuck in the clunky black walking boot, too. Have you figured out a way to make it less ugly? Did you bedazzle it with all the free time you suddenly had because you couldn’t run? Show me your boots! I’m on Twitter @byjenamiller."

5766,"Zoe and Spencer Pepper met in preschool while growing up in neighboring Long Island towns. Years later, they reconnected as undergraduates at Cornell University."
5767,"After graduation in 2008, Mrs. Pepper (then Zoe Cohen) moved to Manhattan and roomed with a friend in Murray Hill. Mr. Pepper headed to law school in Philadelphia at the University of Pennsylvania. As a summer associate at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, in the Financial District, he watched from his office window as the undulating New York by Gehry building (then known as Beekman Tower) rose on Spruce Street. "
5768,"So when he finished law school and went to work full time at the firm, he and Mrs. Pepper moved into a one-bedroom rental there. They liked its distinctive architectural qualities and its many amenities. And the location couldn’t be beat."
5769,"“I had been told the long hours that a big law firm would entail, particularly as a junior associate, so I thought it made sense to live close to the office,” Mr. Pepper said."
5770,"His walk to work took five minutes. Mrs. Pepper rode the subway to Midtown, where she now is the director of rooms operations at the Westin New York at Times Square."
5771,"Last year, Mr. Pepper’s firm announced its plan to move to Hudson Yards. It was good news for the couple: They could move to a location where both could walk to work."
5772,"“We both work crazy hours, but Spencer’s hours are super unpredictable,” Mrs. Pepper said. “He could be on a deal where he doesn’t come home for two straight days. So having that flexibility to come home and take a quick shower or quick nap, that is super critical for him.”"
5773,"Although her work hours are more stable, “I get called in a lot,” she said. “I will run there in a heartbeat for anything.”"
5774,"The Peppers, both 32, were also up for exploring a developing neighborhood, as they had done when they moved to the Financial District in 2011. At the time, Mrs. Pepper said, “there weren’t any good restaurants. We had to go to TriBeCa to get a salad.”"
5775,"The couple went on the hunt for a rental in late spring, intending to line up a one-bedroom before their July wedding so they could move in post-honeymoon. They wanted a new, amenity-filled building for themselves and Andiamo, their Italian greyhound. "
5776,"“We kind of get this high on new buildings,” Mrs. Pepper said. “They are so exciting. It’s so fun being the first person to live in your apartment. No one has sat on your toilet seat.” "
5777,"Their budget was $5,000 to $7,000 a month. With some research on StreetEasy, Mr. Pepper narrowed down the options to a handful of possibilities in and north of Hudson Yards. "
5778,"“I have a lot less patience for that stuff, and Spencer is super organized and detailed,” Mrs. Pepper said. “I am extremely decisive, whereas he will crunch numbers and weigh all the pros and cons.”"
5779,"MiMA, an eight-year-old rental building on 42nd Street east of 10th Avenue, fit their criteria. But, Mr. Pepper said, “It didn’t have that brand-spanking-new feeling that we really wanted.” "
5780,"The Eugene, on West 31st Street, was closer to his office but farther from hers. They weren’t keen on the interior finishes or the location next to Dyer Avenue, the Lincoln Tunnel entrance and exit ramp, where impatient traffic seemed hazardous."
5781,"Then there was Oskar, on 11th Avenue near 43d Street, with just 164 apartments. The Peppers found the small size more appealing than a massive building with hundreds of units. It felt to them like a boutique hotel."
5782,"When they visited, it wasn’t quite finished. “It seems like the apartment is being built for you,” Mr. Pepper said."
5783,"They saw several iterations of one-bedrooms, some with balconies and many with interesting hallways and curves. The building also offers access to most of the amenities at Sky, across the street, the largest rental building in New York, with nearly 1,200 units. (Both were developed by the Moinian Group.)"
5784,"The Peppers were able to sign the lease nearly two months in advance. They chose a one-bedroom with no balcony but with an extra half bathroom for $6,200 a month, and received three free months on a 27-month lease, with the monthly rent netting out to $5,511. They also received six free months at Life Time Athletic at Sky, a gym and spa that normally costs $199 per person per month. The one-time pet fee for Andiamo was $750. "
5785,"The Peppers, who arrived in late summer, faced some construction-related issues, like a sporadic lack of hot water and workers coming and going from their apartment. "
5786,"“It was certificate-of-occupancy ready, but not our-crazy-attention-to-detail ready,” Mrs. Pepper said."
5787,"Now, she strives to take a fitness class every day, usually on her walk home from work. Mr. Pepper goes in the morning."
5788,"In their sunny one-bedroom, which looks straight down 11th Avenue, “I feel like I am floating in the middle of New York City,” Mrs. Pepper said. Being on an avenue in Midtown, however, is proving louder than being on a small street downtown. Late on weekday nights, “there is a honking contest outside,” she said."
5789,"They enjoy the small details, like a hidden refrigerator and dishwasher, closet lights that turn on when the door opens, and a walk-in shower rather than a tub. Their entry door uses a key fob. "
5790,"Plans call for the building to go even more high tech. “Eventually, people will be able to open their doors with their smartphones,” said Toby Gingold, Oskar’s leasing manager."
5791,"The Peppers especially appreciate having that second half bath across the hall, so when Mrs. Pepper rises extra early for work, she won’t wake her husband. She also loves walking to work. “Getting that extra hour of sleep is truly life-changing,” she said."
5792,"As for Mr. Pepper, his office move won’t happen until February, so he has temporarily assumed a subway commute. “I cannot wait to be able to walk to work again,” he said."

5795,THE WHITE BOOK By Han Kang
5796,"“The Vegetarian” and “Human Acts” introduced English-language readers to the explosive fiction of the South Korean writer Han Kang. Although her new novel, “The White Book,” occupies a somewhat quieter register, it too is formally daring, emotionally devastating and deeply political. Its relative smallness of scale — a scant 157 pages, cut to fit in the palm of the hand — is deceptive, itself the mark of a supremely confident writer."
5797,"All three novels have been translated into English by Deborah Smith, whose work has garnered great acclaim: Her translation of “The Vegetarian” won the 2016 Man Booker International Prize, and “The White Book” was a finalist for the prize in 2016. However, the earlier books have not been without controversy, as several critics noted both errors in the translation of “The Vegetarian” and liberties taken with its original phrasing."
5798,"The parameters of a translator’s task are by no means fixed, and can range from word-for-word renderings — one thinks of Nabokov’s famously literal, and famously controversial, translation of “Eugene Onegin” — to something more akin to interpretation. It’s fair to say that Smith’s previous translations of Han’s fiction veer toward the interpretive. In an interview, she has described “faithfulness” as “an outmoded, misleading and unhelpful concept when it comes to translation.” Numerous articles have been published about this dispute, and some have argued that the amplified register of Smith’s work — the addition of copious adjectives and embellishments — successfully rendered Han’s fiction more palatable to a Western readership. Whether a more conventionally faithful translation would have won Han the international audience she now enjoys is a moot point. But the controversy raises a pertinent question: whether the task of translation is simply to bridge the divide between cultures or to somehow also represent that divide. This question is also germane to “The White Book,” which is narrated by a South Korean writer newly arrived in Warsaw."
5799,"The narrator travels through a cityscape that bears visible traces of World War II: “The boundaries that separate old from new, the seams bearing witness to destruction, lie conspicuously exposed. It was on that day, as I walked through the park, that she first came into my mind.” That “she” is the narrator’s older sister, who died “less than two hours into life.” “They lay there on the kitchen floor, my mother on her side with the dead baby clutched to her chest, feeling the cold gradually enter into the flesh, sinking through to the bone.” The confluence of the resurrected city and the lost sister becomes the through-line for a novel told in flashes and fragments, as an act of memory and incantation."
5800,"Smith’s rendering of “The White Book” cannot be accused of prolixity. The novel is composed of short entries centered on a word or phrase having to do with the color white, opening with a list that includes “salt,” “shroud” and “blank paper.” From this, the narrator constructs the novel: “Now, in this moment, I feel that vertiginous thrill course through me. As I step recklessly into time I have not yet lived, into this book I have not yet written.”"
5801,"What follows is a text shot through with “vertiginous thrill.” The dead sister haunts the narrator: “For there are moments, lying in the darkened room, when the chill in the air is a palpable presence. Don’t die. For God’s sake don’t die. … Perhaps I, too, have opened my eyes in the darkness, as she did, and gazed out.”"
5802,"The novel moves fluidly between the “I” and the “she,” in shifts between first and third person, but also in the slow collapse of the boundary between the narrator and the sister, the living and the dead. This culminates in the forging of an alternate history of the sister’s birth: “And yet, before dawn, when the first milk finally came from her mother’s breasts and she pressed her nipple between the tiny lips, she found that, despite everything, the baby was still breathing. Though she had, by now, slipped from consciousness, the nipple in her mouth encouraged a soft swallowing, gradually growing stronger.”"
5803,"Resurrection is a theme throughout Han’s work, one that is tied up in political and collective memory. In “Human Acts,” a writer observes an illegal police raid on a group of activists. In it, she sees the specter of the 1980 Gwangju Uprising, a sustained protest against South Korea’s military government that resulted in hundreds of civilian deaths: “I remember being glued to the television … and surprising myself with the words that sprang from my mouth: But that’s Gwangju. … The radioactive spread is ongoing. Gwangju had been reborn only to be butchered again in an endless cycle. It was razed to the ground, and raised up anew in a bloodied rebirth.”"
5804,"Among other things, “The White Book” is an urgent plea for the ritual power of mourning — for its significance in terms of both personal and historical restitution. “She thought of certain incidents in her own country’s history,” Han writes, “the country she had left in order to come here, of the dead that had been insufficiently mourned. Trying to imagine those souls being thus eulogized, in the very heart of the city streets, she realized that her country had never once done this properly.”"
5805,"Han explores occupation in multiple forms and contexts, from the Japanese occupation to political demonstrations, always tracing the “radioactive spread” of trauma. But she also makes a case for empathy, one that recognizes both its power and its limitations: “I saw differently when I looked with your eyes. I walked differently when I walked with your body. … But it didn’t come off as I intended. Again and again I peered into your eyes, as though searching for form in a deep, black mirror.” In this subtle and searching novel, Han, through Smith, proposes a model of genuine empathy, one that insists on the power of shared experience but is not predicated on the erasure of difference."
5806,"PAMPLONA, Colombia — The walking began before dawn: before the clouds broke against the mountaintops, before the trucks took over the highway, even before anyone in the town woke up to check the vacant lot where scores of Venezuelan refugees had been huddling through the night."
5807,"Children, grandmothers, teachers, nurses, oil workers and the jobless had all sprawled there together — bound by a collective will to put as many miles as possible between themselves and the collapsing country they had fled."
5808,All but Yoxalida Pimentel. She could not take another step.
5809,"“After so many hours of walking, after days, nights, sun, cold, rain — I lost my baby,” she said, crying alone the morning after her miscarriage."
5810,"The economic crisis that has engulfed Venezuela under President Nicolás Maduro has set off a staggering exodus. The economic damage is among the worst in Latin American history, researchers say, with more than three million people leaving the country in recent years — largely on foot."
5811,"They are fleeing dangerous shortages of food, water, electricity and medicine, as well as the government’s political crackdowns, in which more than 40 people have been killed in the last few weeks alone."
5812,"Rolling suitcases behind them, some walk along highways, their salaries so obliterated by Venezuela’s hyperinflation that bus tickets are out of reach. Others try to hitchhike for thousands of miles until they reach Ecuador or Peru."
5813,"But no matter their destination, the vast majority come through these treacherous roads in Colombia: a 125-mile journey over a 12,000-foot pass here in the Andes Mountains."
5814,"“It’s the coldest place I’ve known in my life,” said Fredy Rondón, who had come from Venezuela’s capital, Caracas, with a single bag of belongings. Now, he was breathless at 10,500 feet, with a treeless steppe before him."
5815,"“I thought I could take the cold, but this is too, too much,” he said."
5816,"His willingness to travel these twisting mountain roads speaks to the desperation in Venezuela. The country is experiencing its deepest political unrest in a generation, with two men claiming the presidency simultaneously."
5817,"Here in the Colombian mountains, Venezuelan refugees now murmur about Juan Guaidó, the opposition leader who declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate leader last month, inspiring many Venezuelans to rally to his side. The opposition and Mr. Maduro are at loggerheads over the delivery of humanitarian aid, which Mr. Maduro’s government has blockaded at the border with Colombia, a short distance from where their journey begins."
5818,"“We are all scared it will get ugly between Maduro and Guaidó,” said Norma López, who walked with her five children and 6-day-old infant. Her neighbors, she said, told her the government was “going to take away their teenagers to defend Maduro.”"
5819,"On hearing the rumor, Ms. López said, she moved up her plans to leave the country."
5820,"For most Venezuelans, the exodus first takes them to Cúcuta, a sprawling Colombian border city where thousands arrive by footbridge every day."
5821,"On the outskirts of the city is a parking lot where volunteers gather around 6 a.m. to offer the migrants a place to shower, a bowl of oatmeal and jackets for the children, if they don’t have any."
5822,"“I’m lost, disoriented,” said Edwin Villareal, 25, who said he would walk to the Colombian city of Medellín with his wife and three children, one of whom had asthma. The five had only 10,000 Colombian pesos among them, about $3."
5823,"“Perhaps someone gives us a ride,” he said. “We have no money for the bus.”"
5824,"Few people were offering rides on Route 55, a two-lane highway that weaves into the eastern mountain range known as the Cordillera Oriental. Instead, scores of Venezuelans ascended the road on foot, at a snail’s pace."
5825,"At 7,700 feet above sea level, Martha Socorro Duque has spent months watching the migrants file past her living room in the Colombian town of Pamplona. They search for food and shelter in a town with little to offer."
5826,"“People came arriving with their shoes totally broken and destroyed,” she said. “But the hardest wasn’t seeing their shoes, it was seeing their feet: the lacerations, the blisters that were filled with blood.”"
5827,"So Ms. Duque decided to improvise a shelter of her own. She opened up the lot across the street to the strangers who came, and collected donations from neighbors to offer them food. Sixty now camp here on a given night, the men in blankets on the floor outside, the women and children on makeshift bedding in a shed beside a stream."
5828,She offered Ms. Pimentel a place to stay before the young woman gave birth to her stillborn child.
5829,"Heartbroken, Ms. Pimentel explained that her mother had already left Venezuela, walking and hitching rides to Chile with hopes of sending money home. But when no jobs could be found there, Ms. Pimentel crossed the border too, leaving behind three children she had been unable to feed."
5830,"“Out of sheer desperation I’ve decided to walk,” she said, “so I can take care of my children back there who are still alive.”"
5831,"The road continued on from Pamplona, past an abandoned home where the roof had caved in. Above 10,000 feet, Alexis Ron and his brother-in-law walked with backpacks slung over their shoulders, a mile ahead of their wives, who carried more suitcases and supplies. They had left Venezuela months before, but they said it was the miserable life they had encountered in Colombia that had spurred them to keep walking."
5832,"Mr. Ron, 40, said he used to fix high-end cars in Caracas. “I could take apart a car from front to back,” he said. “And I could give it back to you assembled again without a screw missing.”"
5833,"But most of those cars had been off the roads for ages in Venezuela, where even car tires can be hard to find, so he left. In Cúcuta, he washed cars instead of repairing them, earning a few dollars a day."
5834,"His boss stiffed him on his pay. Colombians spat on him and others in the street, saying Venezuelans were stealing their jobs, he said. But his breaking point came when a man offered to pay to sleep with his wife — and in desperation she took the man’s cellphone number to make the arrangements."
5835,"“He would give her 20,000 pesos,” said Mr. Ron, the equivalent of $6."
5836,He decided it was time to leave.
5837,"His wife caught up with the men an hour later and confirmed the story, looking at the ground. Her brother put an arm over her shoulder and, for a while, no one spoke."
5838,"Miles ahead, the road flattened out at 11,000 feet, revealing a vast plateau where only sedges grew. Génesis Zambrano, 20 years old and eight months pregnant, stood holding her infant daughter and caught her breath."
5839,"“My back,” she said, pointing to where her pain was."
5840,"She had wanted to rest in Cúcuta before making the journey to the capital, Bogotá, to find her father there. But instead, she spent the days watching her infant daughter, Yeanis, slowly fade: There was food to buy in Colombia, but no money to feed her daughter anything other than a bottle filled with water and rice."
5841,"“The girl cried, but she had no tears,” she said."
5842,"Yeanis spent nine days in a hospital in Cúcuta being treated for anemia and a respiratory infection. But when her daughter’s vitals returned to normal, Ms. Zambrano said she decided it was time to leave, setting out for Bogotá on foot."
5843,"The road seemed endless. But not far from the summit, a miracle happened: A giant, empty truck pulled over."
5844,"“When you have no load, you have to take them,” said the driver, who asked not to be named. “But the truth is you risk your livelihood too, if the company finds out or the police stop you.”"
5845,"With a sudden whoosh, the truck picked up speed and the tundra landscape — which had seemed unchanging at a walker’s pace — suddenly transformed as cow pastures, creeks and road signs flashed by."
5846,"Inside, the masses huddled for warmth. There was Marian Jiménez, who had sprained her foot. Jeremy Hidalgo, who had been walking four days."
5847,"Roberto Javier Tovar, who had left his wife and child behind in Venezuela, pulled in his jacket and praised the driver loudly, even though no one knew where the vehicle would take them."
5848,"“Almost no one has helped us but this man,” he said."
5849,The sun began to settle and the back of the flatbed grew crowded as the driver took on dozens more migrants.
5850,"By evening, more than 100 adults and children were packed inside, leaving a silent, empty road behind."
5851,"“We must give praise to God Almighty for this blessing,” someone shouted when the vehicle stopped."
5852,"Night fell and stars came out. The temperature fell, too, but the truck was at last descending and the lights of Bucaramanga were visible, still thousands of feet below."
5853,"Daniel Bermúdez, who had left his family behind and had been walking for the last five days, looked out at the unknown city."
5854,"“My 6-year-old son, he saw me with my suitcase, and he said, ‘You’re not coming back,’” Mr. Bermúdez said as he began to cry in the icy wind."
5855,"He paused. “Yes, I’ll come back. But look at me now, I am so far from home.”"
5856,"This week Rebecca Dinerstein writes about Michael Downing’s “Still in Love,” the belated sequel to the novel “Perfect Agreement,” which David Willis McCullough reviewed for the Book Review in 1997."
5857,"The major trial-balloon subplot — and by far the most successful — is a long historical flashback interwoven with the contemporary goings-on. Here we are taken to a Shaker settlement in Kentucky and a young girl who sees a dark-skinned man that the community wants to believe is a mystical vision of a black Jesus. Downing is better at writing about Shakers than Hawthorne or Melville, who had them for neighbors. (Perhaps that’s the reason.) The setting is just right. The feeling for the community and its members rings true, especially in small details like the sweeping of a walk, which an outsider sees as a chore and the Shaker sweeper as an act of worship. …"
5858,"Because of the sampler structure of “Perfect Agreement,” the reader is left in the curious position of choosing sides with one part of the novel against another. The comedy is fun, but it doesn’t last long. The spelling rules are useful, but this is, after all, a novel, not a textbook. … But the Shaker material is first-rate. And the title is just right. The book is about perfect agreements — or at least the desire for them — in grammar, in domestic life, in work, in education and in utopian theology (which may not be very different from everyday theology)."
5859,"Countless picture books follow the same narrative structure, in which a character faces a challenge and then — at the end of approximately 500 words — overcomes that challenge, or doesn’t. We call this story. “Read me a story,” a child might beg, and so we do."
5860,"But not all picture books are stories in the traditional sense, and often poetry is the tool that frees an author from the expectations of conflict and resolution. By trusting language, form, rhythm or sound to hold the reader’s focus, a poet is able to slow down or speed up, to observe or reflect. Picture books in verse can meditate or meander, imagine or reminisce, examine one small aspect of the world carefully, or elicit deep emotion."
5861,"One thing that sets picture books apart from titles for older readers is that we often share them with another person. In BOOM, BELLOW, BLEAT: Animal Poems for Two or More Voices (WordSong, 32 pp., $19.95; ages 3 to 6), Georgia Heard’s text leans into this interactive experience, creating the space for distinct speakers in each poem. Each is intended as a sort of duet, with the text set in different colors to differentiate the alternating parts."
5862,"The book relies heavily on the humor and child-friendly simplicity of animal noises, but the noises animals make are not always what you’d expect. In “We Don’t Say Ribbit,” a frog and toad offer the less expected noises they might actually make in the wild, from “quonk” to “errrgh,” almost certain to entice laughter from young readers."
5863,"In several of these poems, the language is more mature, as in “Flight of the Honeybees,” where “Pale celery parasols” or “yellow petaled broccoli” may be a challenge to younger readers. But the beauty of poetry for small children is that the sounds of words can be appealing long before their meanings are fully understood."
5864,"Many of these poems also incorporate refrains, allowing a young listener to repeat after another reader, as in “Song Thief,” where the second reader, as mockingbird, repeats everything the first reader has just said. “Why is it / why is it / what I sing / what I sing / you sing too?” Heard’s engaging poems, paired with Aaron DeWitt’s bright digital images of the natural world, are designed to bring readers together, and with an informative author’s note on various elements of the natural world, they may also find a welcome role in the classroom."
5865,"“Each tree offers / a story…” begins Verlie Hutchens and Jing Jing Tsong’s TREES (Beach Lane, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8) and what unfolds is exactly that, a series of brief character studies, as page after page, readers are introduced to a surprisingly varied cast of arboreal personalities."
5866,"Gracefully, each spread offers a distinct new friend for young readers. Pussy willow is shy, waiting for the one week in spring when “kitten velvet buds / adorn her modest twigs.” By contrast, White Pine is an “unruly uncle,” with his “buttons akilter” and “shaggy hair unkempt.” Each tree is memorable, and Hutchens’s vivid descriptions are full of movement and relatable moments. Tsong’s colorful illustrations invite readers to peer from a range of vantage points and angles, as if looking down through the foliage. Young readers on walks may well experience the canopy above them a little differently after encountering the trees through Hutchens’s and Tsong’s eyes."
5867,"Yet the book may do little to help them see people differently, since “Trees” also reinforces traditional gender roles. Female-identified trees are described as “silly” as they dance on “tippy toes” and sport “baubles.” Meanwhile, the masculine trees are “strong” and “mighty” as well as “wise.” An unfortunate choice for a book that might easily have resisted such bias."
5868,"In reading poetry, we are sometimes so lulled by rhythm and sound that we forget to pay attention to meaning. This can be especially true with familiar poems, as they become ingrained in our consciousness. A picture book version of Robert Frost’s THE ROAD NOT TAKEN (Familius, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), with illustrations by Vivian Mineker, does a wonderful job of reintroducing a well-known poem without altering a single word. The choice to redivide stanzas and to rebreak lines, as well as to set the poem in the contemporary-feeling world of Mineker’s soft palette, invites a fresh reading."
5869,"In the beginning of the book, a young boy with a backpack stands near his dog, at a fork in the road. “Two roads diverged in a yellow wood.” As the text reflects on this moment, we view him from a distance, and then from far above. We witness the boy’s indecision, and finally his seemingly arbitrary choice."
5870,"From there, the book continues, and we journey along with the poem and the boy, as he grows, goes to school, chooses a career and builds a family. Finally, at the poem’s poignant end, we face the old man who has been reciting the poem and reminiscing all along, surrounded by his grandchildren. “And that has made all the difference.”"
5871,"This is a book that begs rereading. Visually, it’s unclear what beckons the boy along his initial path, and there’s a sort of randomness, a meandering mazelike quality to the artwork, if an emotional inevitability to the poem’s conclusion. Robert Frost might well have approved that ambiguity."
5872,"“This is for the unforgettable / the swift and sweet ones / who hurdled history / and opened a world / of possible.” The beginning of Kwame Alexander and Kadir Nelson’s THE UNDEFEATED (Versify/Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 and up) feels anthemic. Listen up, the book seems to say, I’m going to share something important."
5873,"What follows is a powerful tribute to the African-American experience, replete with joy and pride in the accomplishments of individual artists and athletes, leaders and thinkers. But the book also communicates a strong sense of the suffering without which this history would be incomplete. Alexander’s resonant twisting language, and Nelson’s rich painterly style, serve to capture not just individuals but the community as a whole."
5874,"“The ones who survived / America / by any means necessary.” The book continues. “And the ones who didn’t.” This second line of text is set starkly against blank white pages, demanding that the reader consider the lives lost and the voices silenced by our history."
5875,"We see this same kind of restraint a little further along, in the startling repetition of “This is for the unspeakable.” Three spreads repeat this simple line, allowing the reader to sit with images of unforgivable acts from both past and present, inviting us to silently bear witness when words fail."
5876,"Elsewhere, the text swells again, as words and art offer a litany of historical figures and important moments, filling the ears with rhythms that demand attention, calling on poetry of the past. “This is for the unbelievable / The We Real Cool ones. / This is for the unbending. / The black as the night is beautiful ones.” These lines sing, and the accompanying paintings feel like a walk through a portrait gallery."
5877,"Poetry knows when to lean forward and when to pull back, and in “The Undefeated,” Alexander has walked that line perfectly. This book will fill readers with a sense of the wealth and the cost of history."
5878,"Last week in Paris, as the sun set after an unseasonably warm day, Christophe Lemaire and Sarah-Linh Tran presented the fall 2019 collection for their label, Lemaire, on the top floor of an applied arts school. The models, a diverse mix of mostly “street cast” women and men of all ages, walked in and out of the rooms with a languid saunter, hands in their pockets and a far-off look in their eyes. Every once in a while, some of the models would coyly turn their gaze to the audience, inviting eye contact."
5879,"This routine was the handiwork of Vanessa Le Mat, a London-based choreographer and performer who has worked on the Lemaire show as a creative movement director for several years. “I wanted to create a very natural moment that mirrored the first time you see someone,” says Le Mat of the mood of the show, adding, “and I wanted the models to interact with the space as well as the people, to bring their own energy to this idea.”"
5880,"Fashion shows as spectacles are nothing new: For years, the runway has served as a platform for performance, with designers employing choreographers to help them animate their clothes through dance and movement. But in recent years, designers have shifted toward a more discreet approach — one that encourages idiosyncratic personalities, attitudes and interactions — led by movement directors like Le Mat."
5881,"“Even the way shows are staged, the traditional runway as a linear line, is changing,” says Steven Kolb, the president and C.E.O. of the Council of Fashion Designers of America. He cites last week’s Off-White show, where Virgil Abloh sent multiple models out at once in a nonlinear formation. “Virgil Abloh created a runway that was a chessboard and the models crossed over one another — it was energized and exciting.”"
5882,"“Creating memorable experiences is one of the ultimate goals of a fashion show,” says Brian Phillips, the creative director of the New York public relations and creative agencies Black Frame and Framework. “That used to be easier, but now shows are accessible by image to all of the world, so it comes down to the feeling in the room — the movement and energy is vital.” "
5883,"Creating that energy in the room comes, in large part, down to casting. This was certainly true at Maison Margiela, where the movement director Pat Boguslawski worked with models to emphasize their individuality. “Previously, John was often looking to history, but now his inspiration, in terms of movement and characters, is what we have here and now, with the people we cast,” he says, referring to the house’s creative director, John Galliano. “Everyone in the show can be different — he’s not trying to put everyone in the same bag.” This season, Boguslawski’s work was evident in the loping gait of the male model Finn Buchanan, who opened the show, and in the model Leon Dame’s fearsome, shoulders-first stalk. (Dame walked quite differently in other shows, like Isabel Marant.) For Lemaire, Le Mat takes a similar approach: “I want each girl to feel that they are more than a number, that we count on their personality.”"
5884,"The culture of street casting has certainly contributed to this in some way. “A lot of designers feel that non-models, be they musicians or just a woman or man they find inspiring, bring strength to the show and to what they’re trying to say,” says Rachel Chandler, the co-founder of Midland, a model management and casting agency that specializes in finding unique faces for runway clients like Helmut Lang, Eckhaus Latta and Marni. This season, all of these brands cast some non-models, but “I do shows that don’t have any street casting at all, and even when I’m casting experienced models, I’m always looking for their individualism as well,” she adds."
5885,"Movement direction empowers each model to be a unique player rather than just a member of a faceless chorus — but it can often be a subtle art. “A lot of my favorite jobs are when you don’t even know that I’m there,” says the Los Angeles-based creative movement director Stephen Galloway, a former dancer who worked on the recent Deveaux presentation at New York Fashion Week. This season, Galloway helped the brand’s creative director, Tommy Ton, explore the concept of falling in and out of love. He had the models — many of who were not professional — meander about the room and interact with one another; at times they even embraced. “Stephen was there to guide them into character, to help them to be very gestural,” says Ton. “He’s really good at connecting with people.”"
5886,"For their debut show at London Fashion Week this season, the designers Max Pearmain and Anthony Symonds of Symonds Pearmain tapped the model Lily McMenamy, the daughter of the ’90s supermodel Kristen McMenamy, as their movement director. While McMenamy, who trained in physical theater and mime at the Jacques Lecoq school in Paris, has always modeled in the brand’s presentations, this season she coached the other models. “We needed someone who has an instinctive understanding of body and movement,” Symonds says."
5887,"Leading by example, McMenamy sashayed down the runway to the archetypal industry anthem “Fashion” by David Bowie, throwing her arms up to strike poses at every turn. Other girls in the show twirled, caressed their face or threw glances back over their shoulder; some did nothing out of the ordinary. They all did what they wanted. In the lineup, McMenamy tried to talk with each model and offered demonstrations. “I feel restricted when I’m on the catwalk or on a photo shoot — like a puppet — so I wanted to bring something out of every girl so they feel they can contribute,” says McMenamy. “I wanted them to feel like they had a voice.”"
5888,"Chandler says that now almost all of their clients consider casting new faces, or moonlighting models. This, however, can mean that models can often come into a show experience without much experience or confidence. To be sensitive to this, for the Maison Margiela show, Boguslawski works entirely in isolation, coaching the models one by one on both their walk and attitude. His most important task, however, is to ensure that they are comfortable. “Sometimes they think I am there because they’re not good enough, but it’s not like that at all — I’m there because I have a vision for them,” he says. “I’m there to build them up and to help them to create stories in their head.”"
5889,"The television journalist Deborah Norville saw plenty of potential when she first stepped inside her four-bedroom apartment at the massive, Georgian-style co-op at 655 Park Avenue about 17 years ago — even if she called the place “a wreck.”"
5890,"“It had the most unusual design aesthetic I’ve ever seen,” she said, noting, for example, the “bizarre, weird stone path” the previous owner had installed in sections of the unit. The apartment listing conceded: “Needs work but could be spectacular.”"
5891,"“It looked like a mess, but it felt good,” said Ms. Norville, the longtime anchor of the syndicated newsmagazine “Inside Edition” and a former co-host of NBC’s “Today” show. “You had to have a vision.”"
5892,"She and her husband, Karl Wellner, a money manager, transformed the nearly 3,000 square feet of discordant space into a homey, primary residence, raising three children there while improving their work commutes. “A lot of people bailed from New York after 9/11,” said Ms. Norville, who instead relocated to Manhattan with her family from Long Island. “We were determined to stay.” "
5893,"Now, as empty-nesters, they are ready to leave. Their country house just outside the city has become their main home. And so the apartment, No. 4E, which has an entrance on East 67th Street, is back on the market for $4.5 million, according to the listing broker, Meredyth Hull Smith of Sotheby’s International Realty. Monthly maintenance is $7,632. "
5894,"The fully renovated unit was reimagined with the help of the architect James L. Bodnar, incorporating a decidedly Scandinavian décor of muted blues and creams, and rich faux finishes — a nod to the couple’s Swedish heritage. (Mr. Wellner was born and raised in Stockholm, while Ms. Norville has family members from Sweden.)"
5895,"Many of the apartment’s original architectural details also remain: the oak herringbone floors in the entertaining spaces, the high ceilings and oversize, south-facing windows."
5896,"Along with four bedrooms and four full baths, there’s a spacious library that could be converted into another bedroom."
5897,"The home is entered through a columned gallery that opens to a large living room anchored by a wood-burning fireplace clad in raw limestone. Flanking the living room are the library and a formal dining room, each separated by French doors."
5898,"“It is well suited for entertaining because the rooms flow so nicely from one to the other,” Ms. Norville said."
5899,"The wood-paneled library, where one of Ms. Norville’s two Emmy Awards is displayed, has built-in shelves and a full bath. The formal dining room has a ceiling with a small dome that holds an elaborate candlelit crystal chandelier, matching the candlelit wall sconces, which the couple reserved for holidays and special occasions."
5900,"Off the dining room is an eat-in, windowed kitchen with granite floors, tiled countertops and a breakfast bar. “I loved to cook,” Ms. Norville said. “Anytime anyone comes home or is about to leave, they ask me to make my chicken curry.”"
5901,"Beyond the kitchen, through a long corridor, is a service/bedroom wing, which includes a washer-dryer, two small bedrooms and a full bath."
5902,"Two larger bedrooms, each with an en suite bath, are on the other side of the apartment. The master suite has a roomy carpeted seating and dressing area, two large walk-in closets and a bath with tumbled marble tile."
5903,"Ms. Norville and Mr. Wellner, who is the chief executive of Papamarkou Wellner Asset Management, especially enjoyed the natural light that streamed through the apartment. “It gets wonderful daytime light,” she said. “It makes me happy to walk in.”"
5904,"She said she would miss her friends in the Upper East Side building, who have included well-known residents like Massimo Ferragamo, the chairman of Ferragamo USA, and his family. (Mr. Ferragamo and his wife, Chiara, put their duplex penthouse on the market last year.)"
5905,"“It will be sad to leave,” Ms. Norville said."
5906,The limestone and brick apartment house at 655 Park was designed by James E. R. Carpenter and Mott B. Schmidt in the early 1920s. The building was constructed around a courtyard garden facing the avenue and encompasses a full block between 67th and 68th Streets.

5953,"A 24-year-old Staten Island man who was taken into police custody on Saturday in connection with the fatal shooting of the reputed boss of the Gambino crime family faces murder charges, according to court records and officials."
5954,"The brazen shooting of the boss, Francesco Cali, in front of his home in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island on Wednesday shocked residents and longtime observers of the Mafia alike, and fueled speculation that New York City was seeing the return of open mob conflict that last erupted decades ago."
5955,"Several officials, however, said on Saturday that preliminary information suggested that the killing of Mr. Cali, 53, was not related to organized crime. One official cautioned that the inquiry was still in its early stages."
5956,"The last time a high-ranking Mafia figure like Mr. Cali was murdered was in 1985, when the Gambino chief Paul Castellano was assassinated in front of a high-end Manhattan steakhouse on the orders of John J. Gotti. The hit led to Mr. Gotti’s ascent to the head of the Gambino organization and touched off years of instability and internecine conflict."
5957,"The man the police said was involved in Mr. Cali’s death, Anthony Comello, was taken into custody in Brick Township, N.J., on Saturday morning, according to multiple sources. He was being held in the Ocean County Jail at the request of the New York Police Department, according to a jail official."
5958,The identification and apprehension of Mr. Comello did little to clarify the motive behind the shooting.
5959,"“Was he acting alone?” Dermot F. Shea, the Police Department’s chief of detectives, said at a news conference on Saturday. “Was he acting for other people? What was the motive? I simply, standing here in front of you, do not have all the answers.”"
5960,"After initially speaking with detectives on Saturday morning, Mr. Comello retained a lawyer and refused to give further statements."
5961,Court records showed that murder and related charges were filed against Mr. Comello and that a case had been docketed. The case appeared in the New York State court system’s computerized database.
5962,Two law enforcement officials said Mr. Comello had no criminal history but had nonetheless come to the attention of law enforcement before.
5963,"Sometime in recent years, his strange behavior in a federal courthouse led the United States Marshals Service to briefly take him into custody and ask the Police Department’s Intelligence Division to check its records to determine if he had any history of terroristic threats. Neither of the officials had any details about the specific nature of his behavior, but both said no such history could be found."
5964,"Around 9:17 p.m. on Wednesday, a pickup truck driven by Mr. Comello backed into Mr. Cali’s parked Cadillac Escalade, damaging it. He then walked up to the door of Mr. Cali’s Hilltop Terrace home and rang the bell, where law enforcement sources said his face was caught on video."
5965,"Mr. Cali and Mr. Comello spoke for roughly a minute, in a conversation also recorded by surveillance cameras and reviewed by investigators. The footage showed that Mr. Comello, dressed in a hooded sweatshirt and a baseball cap, bent down and picked up a license plate that had fallen off the Escalade. Fingerprints from the license plate were recovered, according to Chief Shea, but it was unclear what the forensic evidence revealed."
5966,"Mr. Cali took the license plate and walked back to his car, where he placed it in the rear. At that moment, the gunman pulled out a 9-millimeter pistol and fired 12 times, officials said. Mr. Cali was shot multiple times, resulting in 10 bullet wounds, Chief Shea said."
5967,The truck Mr. Comello drove was recovered on Saturday morning in New Jersey. The handgun used to kill Mr. Cali has not been found.
5968,A couple of years ago I was discussing a study of the habits of great musical composers when an audience member interrupted.
5969,“That’s not true!” he shouted. “You’re totally ignorant — you don’t know what you’re talking about!”
5970,"Early in my career, I had let nasty people walk all over me. When a client berated me for my predecessor’s error on an ad, I gave in and offered him a full refund. When a boss threatened to fire me for defending a colleague who was treated poorly, I said nothing. But this time, I was prepared: I had trained as a conflict mediator, worked as a negotiator and become an organizational psychologist."
5971,"At some point in your work life, you’ve probably had to interact with a jerk. They’re the people who demean and disrespect you. They might steal credit for your successes, blame you for their failures, invade your privacy or break their promises, or bad-mouth you, scream at you and belittle you. As the organizational psychologist Bob Sutton puts it, they treat you like dirt, and either they don’t know it or they don’t care."
5972,"The natural response is to get defensive, but that only escalates the cycle of aggression. Take a classic study in which researchers recorded negotiators with different levels of skill. Average bargainers ended up in three times as many defend-attack spirals as expert negotiators. The experts escaped the heat of the moment and cooled the other person down, too. They calmly commented on their reactions to the other person’s behavior and tested their understanding of what the person was trying to convey."
5973,"I had been studying and teaching this evidence for years. Now it was time to practice it. I called a break, walked up to my heckler and said, “You’re welcome to disagree with the data, but I don’t think that’s a respectful way to express your opinion. It’s not how I was trained to have an intellectual debate. Were you?”"
5974,"I was hoping to start a conversation about the conversation — to redirect the discussion away from the topic and toward some reflection on the tone of the discussion. To my surprise, it worked."
5975,"“Well, no …” he stammered, “I just think you’re wrong.” Later, I sent him the data and he sent me an apology."
5976,"My heckler was what Dr. Sutton calls a temporary jerk. We’re all capable of those behaviors, and we feel bad about them afterward. One study showed that on days when leaders acted abusively, they ended up feeling less competent and less respected at work — and had more trouble relaxing at home."
5977,"But sometimes you’re stuck dealing with a certified jerk, someone who consistently demeans and disrespects others. A few years ago, I had a colleague who had a reputation for yelling at people during meetings. After witnessing it firsthand, I collected my thoughts and called to say I found it unprofessional. My colleague got defensive: “It was necessary to get my point across!”"
5978,"Research on the psychology of certified jerks reveals that they have a habit of rationalizing aggression. They’ve convinced themselves that they have to act that way to get the results they want. I didn’t know how to respond until recently, when I interviewed Sheila Heen, a conflict mediation expert, for an episode of my WorkLife podcast on office jerks. She suggested finding a way to gently challenge the belief that aggression is necessary: “Really? It was my impression that you were smarter than that, and more creative than that — so I bet you could come up with some other ways to be just as clear without having to actually rip somebody else apart.”"
5979,"I can imagine having that conversation with a peer. But what if the jerk is your boss or your superior, and you can’t leave?"
5980,"Research in banks and real estate companies points to two effective ways to break a pattern of abusive supervision. One is to decrease your dependence on your boss. If you can minimize interaction, they can’t do as much harm. The other is to increase your boss’s dependence on you. If they need you, they’re less likely to treat you like dirt."
5981,"If all else fails, Dr. Sutton has a tip for changing your attitude toward the situation: Pretend you’re a specialist in jerks, and think about how you’re “really lucky to see this spectacular, amazing specimen.”"
5982,"Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist at Wharton, is the author of “Originals.” For more on building your career and connections, listen to WorkLife with Adam Grant, a TED original podcast on the science of making work less awful.

5983,"I messaged her on Facebook, using an idiotic subject line: “an inconvenient truth.” After a few heated exchanges, she agreed to have dinner with me."
5984,"That evening I smoothed my green tweed skirt as I waited for her to arrive at the southern-style restaurant I had chosen. Perversely, I had picked this place because it was farm-to-table and my ex-boyfriend had told me at some point that his new girlfriend liked locally sourced food. Perhaps I had overdressed."
5985,"She arrived, smiling nervously, her cheeks pink from the cold or too much blush. Like me, she had worn a knee-length, woven skirt. Neither of us was much for makeup, but we had put it on for each other all the same."
5986,"Though I had seen her around, I mostly knew my ex’s new girlfriend through the ephemera she left in his car: oversize black sunglasses, tinted lip balm, stretched hair ties. After some small talk, I got to the heart of the matter: I said her boyfriend was stopping by my apartment on his way to work, something he’d been doing ever since I moved out several months before."
5987,"After our breakup, I took an apartment near our old place, wanting to work things out. Though we decided to date other people, we fell into old habits, and he started leaving cute notes on my car, written on the back of valet stubs and tucked under the windshield wiper."
5988,"When I told his girlfriend about the notes, she said, with a pained smile, “That’s romantic.”"
5989,"“No,” I said. It was controlling."
5990,"I had believed in the romantic gesture, the aggressive wooing through copious gifts, fancy dinners and handwritten letters, all of which heightened my sense that we were in love."
5991,"I was only beginning to understand the insidious side of romance, how his recent notes and morning visits were less about wooing me than checking up on me, less about generosity than possession. Every morning, whether or not we met up, he would drive past to see if my car was parked in front of my apartment. When it wasn’t, he would later accuse me of having slept somewhere else."
5992,"And the notes with a simple “hi” or the red inked hearts? These, too, were reminders that he was watching."
5993,"This was not the conversation I had intended to have with her. I had just wanted to tell her that her boyfriend was cheating, because when he was my boyfriend and cheating, no one had told me."
5994,"Naïvely, I had hoped things might have been different otherwise. But I didn’t just want to leave her burdened by that knowledge. I wanted to give her an opportunity to relieve herself of its weight."
5995,"“Actually,” she said, and then she went on to tell me he had been showing up outside of places where she was hanging out, even when she hadn’t mentioned where she would be."
5996,"What I wish I had said is that those kinds of romantic gestures are a trap. Instead, she and I took our unfinished puzzle and put away the pieces. We paid the check. I told her to call me sometime. We hugged."
5997,"Romance, I have since learned, isn’t just a sleight of hand that can make you see something that isn’t there. A belief in that kind of romance can also be a distraction. Years later, I almost didn’t see the man who would become my husband."
5998,"We met on Valentine’s Day (of all days), though I wasn’t doing anything to celebrate it. I had just had dinner with a friend and we decided to dip into a warm bar. Inside, the bartender informed us the bar was hosting a singles night. She held out numbered stickers, the kind they give you on the first day of kindergarten, and we reluctantly affixed them to our sweaters."
5999,The idea was for patrons to send each other Valentines using the numbers instead of giving up their names. It also flagged how long everyone had been at the bar. My number was 62.
6000,"My friend and I ordered beers. Five minutes later, a shirtless man with sagging brown corduroys and a pair of children’s fairy wings strapped to his back tapped me on the shoulder."
6001,"“Uh, this guy at the end of the bar wanted me to give this to you,” he said, handing me a note. It was in French."
6002,"I looked over at the man, who raised his glass at me. He had the droopy leer of someone who had been drinking for a while. His tag read “1.”"
6003,"I waved, shrugged and said, “I don’t read French!”"
6004,"“He’s cute, no?” said the guy with the fairy wings, who, lacking his own tag, seemed to be playing Cupid. “He wants to buy you a drink,” he added."
6005,"As he walked away, my friend jagged her thumb at Cupid and said, “I think he likes you.” I looked again at his thin body and corduroys and shrugged. After our single drink, my friend and I went home."
6006,"The next night, we ended up at the same bar. This time her ex-boyfriend joined us. I was mostly there for support. Amid their tart exchanges, I saw Cupid again, now wingless, wearing beat-up Sperrys and skinny jeans. He sidled up on the bar stool beside me and started asking questions, as if he were tapping around a wall looking for a hollow where he might put in a door."
6007,"The conversation grew intimate, and I began to recount my ex-boyfriend woes. He told me about his ex-girlfriend, who had cheated on him while she was in rehab. She had a habit, he said, of pushing him out to sea and then reeling him in when she felt lonely."
6008,"As the bar was closing, he flashed me a puckish smile and invited me back to his place to “make out and snuggle.”"
6009,"Our clothes came off quickly. Staring up at him while we were having sex, a nervous itch came over me. Afterward, he asked me to sleep over and promised to make eggs and bagels in the morning."
6010,"I smiled and said, “Sure.”"
6011,"Instead, I woke up when the sky was still black and slipped out with my boots in hand so as not to wake him. Outside, I was surrounded by old warehouses and leering industrial machinery. I followed the horizon back to my apartment and slid into bed as the sun came up."
6012,For the next few days I avoided the bar where Cupid and I met. I was ambivalent about our tryst and feeling fragile about where it might lead.
6013,"When my ex and I first met, our eyes locked across a crowded cafeteria. It was teen movie magic. He cracked a joke, I laughed; we started hanging out. He kept me hooked with chivalrous gestures like picking me up from work when I could have just as well walked home. But our relationship was toxic. How could I trust my instincts after that? Were they even my own?"
6014,"A few days later, I ended up back at the bar, and there was my Cupid. This time we went back to my place. I told him I had to walk my dog."
6015,"We slipped off our clothes and got into bed, our bodies entwined. And then he stopped, looked me in the eyes and said, “Where did you go?”"
6016,"When I was 22, I fell into an open sidewalk grate and landed one floor down in the basement of an abandoned building. It happened so fast I only remember feeling suspended in midair as my brain tried to process that I was falling. I landed on a pillow of leaves that had collected on top of a crushed oil tank. I was in a dark hole, but I was fine. It wasn’t until I looked up and saw how far I’d fallen that I realized I had been in danger. It took even longer for me to notice I had been injured."
6017,"When Cupid asked where I was, it was like seeing the star-flecked sky from the pit of that basement."
6018,"“We can’t do this,” he said, “if you don’t trust me.”"
6019,“O.K. — ”
6020,"Nine years later, he and I do not make reservations for Valentine’s Day, but we make sure the dishes are always washed when the other person is having a bad week. And every morning, after our coffee and dog walk, we slip on our coats and board the train for work together."
6021,"I sometimes wonder if my ex’s girlfriend came to the same conclusion: that real love isn’t so grandiose. I saw her once, long after our dinner. We were both at a crowded market with new boyfriends. She ran up and embraced me. And then, before I could say anything, she slipped back into the crowd, linking arms with her new beau."

6025,"KABUL, Afghanistan — The longtime motto of the American-led mission in Afghanistan that it stands “shona ba shona,” or shoulder to shoulder, with its Afghan ally no longer applies to that ally’s national security adviser."
6026,"American officials in Afghanistan have repeatedly walked out of or refused to attend meetings with the Afghan president’s most senior war adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, over controversial remarks he made on a visit to the United States this month, senior officials and diplomats in Kabul confirmed."
6027,"[To follow the peace negotiations in Afghanistan, sign up for the weekly At War newsletter.]"
6028,"The public airing of the Afghan frustration with the United States has created an impasse that threatens to further isolate President Ashraf Ghani at a delicate stage in negotiations with the Taliban, which his government has yet to participate in. At the same time, the Taliban insurgency has continued unabated, with Afghan forces that are still largely reliant on the United States bracing for what could be the most consequential fighting season in years."
6029,"It has also resulted in a bizarre reality in which Zalmay Khalilzad, the veteran American diplomat leading the talks, praises the Taliban’s deputy leader as a “patriot” for participating in peace talks but struggles to find common ground with Afghanistan’s elected government, which is propped up by 18 years of American money and led by a president who spent half his life in the United States as a citizen."
6030,"In political and diplomatic circles in Kabul, it is clear that the American anger directed at Mr. Mohib is more about his boss, Mr. Ghani, whose views Mr. Mohib was most likely representing. By focusing on Mr. Mohib, the Americans can avoid confronting the president directly."
6031,"But the anger at Mr. Mohib is intense — and personal — with some officials saying that he could be denied a visa to visit the United States even though his wife is American. When he walked into a regularly scheduled meeting of NATO ambassadors in the Afghan capital last Monday, the deputy head of the American diplomatic mission in Kabul picked up her papers and walked out."
6032,"At meetings with United States military officials since then, Mr. Mohib has sent his deputy instead. Diplomats and officials said that Mr. Ghani has found himself under intense pressure, with little choice but to remove Mr. Mohib, who for years has been one of the most central members of his team"
6033,Time is running short: Mr. Khalilzad is due to return to Afghanistan on Sunday to meet with Mr. Ghani on the next steps of the peace process. That meeting may not happen if Mr. Mohib is in the room.
6034,"Western diplomats in Afghanistan say the situation with Mr. Mohib is unprecedented, and according to one European diplomat, the United States is pressuring NATO allies in the 40-country coalition to shun him, as well."
6035,"Mr. Mohib, 36, was named national security adviser last August, after serving three years as Afghanistan’s ambassador to the United States. The relationship between the two countries was already showing signs of increasing strain."
6036,"President Trump, his weariness with the war long public, had never seemed committed to the new strategy he had announced a year earlier, which promised the Afghan government greater military assistance. In December, he unexpectedly asked the military to prepare for the withdrawal of about half of the 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan."
6037,"Afghan officials, who had banked on the new commitment, saw the sudden reversal as a betrayal, and Mr. Mohib mirrored Mr. Ghani’s short temper in venting the government’s frustrations to Western diplomats. Those frustrations were compounded when, after years of refusing to hold reconciliation talks with the Taliban without the Afghan government present, the United States relented."
6038,"On March 12, as the latest round of talks ended in Doha, Qatar, Mr. Mohib was in the United States arguing against them. In an interview on Fox News from New York, Mr. Mohib said the Taliban could not be trusted and that any peace deal made with the insurgents without the Afghan government would dishonor the victims of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as well as “the one million Americans who have served in Afghanistan.”"
6039,"Speaking to reporters in Washington later that week, Mr. Mohib said American officials had not been transparent about their talks with the Taliban and that the Afghan government was being pushed aside in the rush to reach a peace deal."
6040,"“We have sacrificed a hell of a lot,” he said. “What we’re getting is a deal that doesn’t end in peace.”"
6041,"He also accused Mr. Khalilzad, who was born in Afghanistan, of wanting to lead any interim government himself."
6042,"“The perception in Afghanistan and people in government think that perhaps, perhaps all this talk is to create a caretaker government of which he will then become the viceroy,” Mr. Mohib said."
6043,"Mr. Mohib’s comments infuriated American officials, and since returning to Afghanistan he has been excluded from planning meetings with the American-led military coalition."
6044,"The impact of the diplomatic tensions on Afghan forces is mitigated by the appointment in recent months of several high-level officials — including the interior minister, defense minister and army chief of staff — who are seen as having close working relations with the United States military."
6045,"The next round of talks is set to take place in mid-April in Doha, between prominent Afghans and Taliban insurgents. The Taliban have so far refused to negotiate with Mr. Ghani’s government, calling it a “puppet regime.” But they did hold informal talks in Moscow in February with Afghan politicians who are outside the government. The coming Doha negotiations would take that a step further by including Afghan government officials who attend as private individuals rather than as a formal state delegation."
6046,"The idea is that after the Afghans make some initial progress with the Taliban on the outlines of a future government, Mr. Khalilzad would hold another round of direct talks with the Taliban in the hope of finalizing the tentative deal he recently reached with the insurgents. Under that framework, the American military would withdraw from Afghanistan in exchange for a promise by the Taliban not to allow terrorists to operate from Afghan territory."
6047,"Mr. Khalilzad has insisted that his goal is to get the Taliban to negotiate with the Afghan government. But Mr. Ghani’s aides are skeptical, especially after Mr. Khalilzad held a meeting with the Taliban in October that the Afghan government learned about only through news reports."
6048,"A more recent point of contention has been just how much Mr. Khalilzad had informed the Afghan president about his talks with the Taliban this month. Afghan officials have said he made two calls to Mr. Ghani, each lasting no more than a few minutes. American officials say Mr. Khalilzad’s calls to the president were more substantive."
6049,"When the talks ended, those officials said, Mr. Khalilzad called Mr. Ghani to say he had to fly to Washington immediately to meet his own leadership, but two American officials — John Bass, the American ambassador to Kabul, and the top American commander, Gen. Austin S. Miller, who had been a participant in the talks, arrived within 45 minutes to brief the Afghan president themselves."
6050,"Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together."
6051,"MEDINA, Saudi Arabia — One thing I learned from working for 13 years as a foreign correspondent is that getting to and from a place can teach you a lot about a country. Even in a war zone. It’s a cliché to say it’s the journey that matters and not the destination, but there is truth in that statement."
6052,So it was that I found myself canceling a plane ticket from Medina to Jeddah in Saudi Arabia in January in favor of taking the train. 
6053,It was not just any train. 
6054,"I had discovered, while on a trip to report on a high-end concert series in the remote Al Ula region, that in October Saudi Arabia had opened a high-speed railway between Medina and Mecca, the most important pilgrimage sites for Muslims. It ran a total distance of 281 miles."
6055,"I had a flight from Jeddah that night back to Washington, where I now work as a diplomatic correspondent. If I boarded the train around noon, I could get to Jeddah by midafternoon, have time to walk around the old town and seaside corniche, maybe get dinner and catch my flight."
6056,"Booking a ticket was as easy as making a reservation on Amtrak. From my hotel room in a desert canyon in Al Ula, I got on the website of the Haramain High Speed Railway, clicked on the English-language option and looked at the schedule. There was a train departing at noon the next day that would get me into Jeddah at 2:16 p.m. All economy-class tickets were sold out so, using an American credit card, I booked a business-class seat for 220.5 Saudi riyals, or $59."
6057,"I’ve always enjoyed train travel, but there was a particular reason this railway intrigued me. When I was Beijing bureau chief, my job at The Times before this one, I researched commercial projects abroad that involved Chinese companies. Chinese state-owned enterprises were getting infrastructure contracts in many countries, even before President Xi Jinping began heavily promoting his Belt and Road Initiative."
6058,"I came across the fact that a Chinese state-owned enterprise was involved in the first phase of building a high-speed railway between Medina and Mecca. There was a certain dissonance here: The ruling Communist Party of China, officially atheist and repressive toward many of the country’s Muslims, was helping build a railway connecting the holiest sites in Islam. "
6059,"I emailed an official at the Saudi Embassy in Washington about getting a visa to go report in Saudi Arabia, but nothing came of it. The country usually does not issue tourist visas, and journalist visas are hard to get."
6060,"That was years ago. Now I had a visa, granted so I could cover a trip by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to the kingdom. And at the end of the assignment, after four days of reporting in Riyadh and Ula, I had a train ticket to Jeddah."
6061,"On the morning of Jan. 17, a driver took me south from Al Ula to Medina. We were careful to skirt north around the bustling heart of Medina to the high-speed train station. Non-Muslims are forbidden from entering central Medina. Even on the outskirts, I saw more minarets than I had seen in any other city I had visited in years."
6062,"The first thing that struck me at the station were the pilgrims. Outside, men in white robes and women in full black dress, often with their faces covered, wheeled suitcases. A few times I saw Muslims who appeared to be from as far away as Southeast Asia."
6063,"The cavernous station was busy but not crowded. A sign pointed to a mosque. Pillars and archways pulled the eye toward the dark, soaring ceilings, decorated with diamond-shaped motifs that let in sunlight. The floor tiles gleamed. "
6064,I scanned the electronic ticket on my phone at a turnstile to be let into the platform area.
6065,"In China, I had taken many high-speed trains, and these looked similar. There was a bullet-shaped car at the front and a string of passenger cars behind it. They resembled, too, the high-speed trains I had taken in Japan and France."
6066,Each train had 417 seats. 
6067,I walked to a business-class car and got on. The cabin was nearly full. I sat down in a wide seat. All the seats had a seat-back television screen. This train had been designed and built by a Spanish company.
6068,"Leaving Medina, the train steadily picked up speed, until it reached about 190 miles per hour. It zipped through flat, dry countryside dotted with shrubs. Waiters in white shirts, black vests and white gloves served dates and Arabic coffee. Then they came by with lunch: a chicken roll, a sweet cake and more coffee."
6069,“What do you think of all this?” asked an older man with a thick beard and a traditional red-checkered headdress sitting in front of me. “It’s a smooth ride?”
6070,"The scenery became hillier as we approached the Hijaz Mountains parallel to the Red Sea, before continuing south along the coast. At 1:30, we sped through a station in King Abdullah Economic City. Soon afterward, we pulled into Jeddah."
6071,"I wanted to travel on to Mecca, but — as with central Medina — non-Muslims are barred from entering the city. I stepped off the train with my bag. "
6072,"As I walked to the taxi stand with the pilgrims, I saw a poster with large photos of King Salman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the train, plus the words Saudi Vision 2030. A family took cellphone photos of themselves standing in front of it."
6073,"Saudi Vision 2030 is the catchphrase for an ambitious economic development program spearheaded by the crown prince. In the West, he is now known more for violent acts — carrying on a war against rebels in Yemen that has resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, and, according to the C.I.A., ordering the murder last October of Jamal Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist. The Saudi government has denied the crown prince’s involvement in the murder."
6074,The train presented a different glimpse of the complexities of the kingdom. 
6075,I got into a taxi and looked back at the pilgrims streaming from the station as we drove off toward the Red Sea.

6077,"A man suspected in the killing of the Grammy-nominated rapper and community advocate Nipsey Hussle was charged on Thursday with murder, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office said."
6078,"The man, Eric R. Holder Jr., 29, was arrested on Tuesday, two days after Nipsey Hussle was fatally shot while standing outside a store he owned in South Los Angeles with two other men. Prosecutors charged Mr. Holder with one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon."
6079,"If convicted, Mr. Holder would face a maximum sentence of life in prison. He pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment on Thursday, a spokesman for the district attorney’s office said."
6080,"Mr. Holder’s defense lawyer, Chris Darden, declined to comment."
6081,"According to video evidence cited by the police, Mr. Holder walked up to Nipsey Hussle and the two men who were with him several times before leaving and returning with a handgun. He fired several times before fleeing in a white Chevy Cruze that was driven by an unidentified woman."
6082,"The chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, Michel R. Moore, said at a news conference on Tuesday that investigators believed the shooting was rooted in a personal dispute between Nipsey Hussle and Mr. Holder. Chief Moore said that Mr. Holder was believed to be a member of a gang, but that the police did not think the shooting was related to gang rivalries."
6083,"The death of Nipsey Hussle, who was born Ermias Joseph Asghedom, prompted grief and outrage by residents in the Crenshaw neighborhood, where the rapper grew up and maintained a regular presence even after he became a successful artist. His fans held deep appreciation for his financial investment in the community, which has long struggled with violent crime, and saw him as a symbol of hope and self-improvement."
6084,"CHICAGO — There was little time for Lori Lightfoot to bask in her sweeping, historic victory in the mayoral election in Chicago last week."
6085,"By the weekend, she was facing one of Chicago’s most intractable problems, when 31 people were shot, three fatally."
6086,"“If people don’t feel safe, they’re not going to stay,” Ms. Lightfoot said on Monday of gun violence. “If people don’t feel safe, they’re not going to have hope. If people don’t feel safe, they’re not going to invest.”"
6087,"Six weeks before her inauguration, we sat down with Ms. Lightfoot for a wide-ranging interview in her transition office along the Chicago River. She discussed her first post-victory meeting with the outgoing mayor, Rahm Emanuel; how Chicago compares to “The Wire;” and the city’s fabled political machine, which she says isn’t quite dead yet."
6088,"Here are highlights of her responses, edited for clarity."
6089,"“Fundamentally, if people don’t feel like their lives are valued and they don’t value their lives, they’re not going to value their neighbors’ lives. So we have to disrupt that mentality and the only way that I know how to do it is to do it with investment.”"
6090,"“I met with some West Side elected officials and part of the conversation they’re like ‘Yeah, there’s an open-air drug market at X location on Madison Street.’ And when you think about open-air drug markets, you think some abandoned house, something shady, right out of ‘The Wire,’ right? But no, this is a strip mall where commerce is being conducted. But in order to get into that strip mall, you’ve got to drive by the drug dealers who are standing out in the parking lot yelling ‘blow’ and having big fistfuls of money in their hands and it’s like somebody selling tamales, right? That’s not acceptable. And what message does that send to our children who walk by there every single day? That’s not tolerable to me.”"
6091,"“The machine was built to last. And no one in that kind of context gives up power easily or willingly, and I know that. But what I said before and I’ll repeat here is, we won in all 50 wards. We won with an almost 50-point spread. I am not going to allow a relic of the past to undermine the mandate of the people. And I would like to have a good, productive relationship with members of the City Council, but I’m not going to allow them to undermine what the people’s choice was and what the people want, which is change. And you know, I haven’t gotten to where I’ve gotten in life by letting people walk all over me. And I’m not about to start now. And I would, as I said, would like people to recognize and respect the vote, and if they’re not willing to, I’m ready to fight.”"
6092,"“He started it by talking about the importance of family and making sure that, you know, my Amy and I were doing everything we could to make sure that our daughter had a normal childhood and that he was interested in doing everything he could to share advice, both he and his wife, Amy, on how to make that happen and their experiences. Which I thought was very generous. But it was mostly business-related.”"
6093,"“The fact that I won all 50 wards in such a convincing fashion — against somebody who’s been an elected official for decades as the head of the party, and who ran, I think unfortunately, a very race-based campaign, particularly in the last couple of weeks — says to me that we are in a place in our city where we’re going to reject hate, where we’re not going to divide ourselves up by what our demographics are. But I do think there’s a real desire to move beyond the categories and to be a city that says, ‘We’re Chicagoans.’”"
6094,“I think the reality on the ground needs to change. It’s hard to brand when we are facing these challenges. The reputation nationally and to some extent globally unfortunately right now is that we’re a violent city. And that’s what people know. That’s what gets reported.”
6095,"“We had some sense that victory was happening. But the magnitude of it — you never know. You never know. And when somebody invests a lot of energy in trying to destroy you personally, you never know. And I take nothing for granted. You know, I can’t afford to take anything for granted. I mean, you probably know probably more than you care to know about my story, but coming where I come from, you have to always be on the lookout for the thing that might be coming that you don’t expect. But now we’re here. And having fun.”"
6096,"It was a racial assault so vicious that it became one of the early chords of the civil rights movement, and led to the desegregation of the military."
6097,"Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr., 26, was a decorated African-American veteran. He had just been honorably discharged from the United States Army in 1946 and was headed home to Winnsboro, S.C. Still in uniform, Mr. Woodard, was forcibly removed from the bus, brutally beaten and jailed by the white police chief in the town of Batesburg."
6098,"But in the small town where Mr. Woodard was beaten so severely that he lost his sight, the crime went unpunished and largely faded from memory. Almost three generations later, a black Army veteran in Georgia and a white federal judge in South Carolina separately stumbled upon Mr. Woodard’s story and vowed to honor his memory."
6099,"On Saturday afternoon, town and civic leaders and groups of veterans will walk the two blocks from the bus stop to the jail where Mr. Woodard was taken to honor his memory and acknowledge the cruelty that was done to him. Part of the trickle of small towns throughout the country confronting their violent, racist histories, the town of 5,000 — now called Batesburg-Leesville — will unveil a historic marker downtown as a permanent reminder of the racial injustice that happened there."

6101,"“Here is this hero that so many people have forgotten or didn’t know about,” said Don North, a former Army major from Carrollton, Ga., who spent three years researching and raising money for the marker. “This is about remembering him, what he endured and the legacy he left behind.”"
6102,"Mr. Woodard enlisted in the Army in 1942, serving as a longshoreman in the Pacific Theater of World War II. After he was discharged, he left from Camp Gordon in Augusta, Ga."
6103,"What happened on the bus is still unclear, but a dispute over a restroom break led the driver to call the police when they stopped in Batesburg, 35 miles southwest of Columbia."
6104,Mr. Woodard and the bus driver argued after Mr. Woodard asked to take a bathroom break. The bus company’s policy required drivers to accommodate such requests. The driver later said Mr. Woodard had been drunk and unruly.
6105,"The police chief, Lynwood Shull, and another officer ordered Mr. Woodard off the bus. He was beaten at various points while in police custody, despite protesting that he had done nothing to warrant the assault. Chief Shull jammed the ends of his blackjack into Mr. Woodard’s eyes, at one point striking him so violently that the stick broke."
6106,"The next morning, Mr. Woodard appeared before the local judge where he was convicted of drunken and disorderly conduct and fined $50, the coda to a story that intimately portrayed the disrespect and horrific treatment of black veterans returning from service."
6107,"“There were multiple episodes of black veterans abused across the South,” said Judge Richard Gergel, the federal judge who began researching Mr. Woodard’s history in 2011. “They were serving their country, fighting for American liberty and freedom and not given liberty and freedom when they came back home.”"
6108,"News of the blinding of a World World II veteran traveled beyond the South, much of it carried by the black press. President Harry Truman was sickened by the assault and ordered a federal investigation. It was a highly unusual move at the time: investigating a white law enforcement officer for violating a black person’s civil rights."
6109,"At the trial, Chief Shull said he acted in self-defense and had only struck Mr. Woodard once. Medical records never shown in court disproved Chief Shull’s claim. It took 28 minutes for an all-white jury to acquit the police chief."
6110,"The judge who presided over the trial, J. Waties Waring, was deeply angered by the verdict, later issuing several decisions that helped upend Jim Crow laws."
6111,"“Two of the people profoundly affected by this story were Truman and J. Waties Waring,” Judge Gergel said. “Truman formed the first presidential civil rights committee and Judge Waring, who was influenced by the travesty of justice, began writing landmark civil rights decisions.”"
6112,[Judge Gergel has written a book about the case. Read our review here.]
6113,"Mr. Woodard recovered in a veteran’s hospital and eventually moved to New York without his wife, who walked out on the marriage after the incident. His family in New York helped to care for him until his death in 1992. He was 73."
6114,"Robert Young, 81, Mr. Woodard’s nephew and main caretaker, said that for some time his uncle was understandably bitter about what had happened. “But at some point, he just tried to live his life,” he said. “I still have this wonderful memory of him coming home for a break before he went overseas. He was standing in the kitchen in his Army uniform and my mom and sister were so excited to see him. He had made us proud.”"
6115,Mr. Woodard’s story might never have been formally noted by Batesburg-Leesville if not for Mr. North and Judge Gergel.
6116,"Mr. North was stationed at Fort McPherson in Atlanta in the early 1990s when he first heard about Mr. Woodard. A student of black military history, Mr. North researched more and decided a historic marker at the site of the bus stop was the best way to honor the veteran."
6117,He launched the Sgt. Isaac Woodard Jr. Historical Marker Association and submitted plans to state officials in 2017. The Disabled American Veterans organization funded most of the cost of the marker.
6118,"Judge Gergel, who presided in the Dylann Roof murder trial in 2017, began poring over police, court and medical records looking for the tiniest details of the Woodard attack around 2011. He talked to the town’s city attorney, Chris Spradley. He had never heard of the case. Neither had Mr. Spradley’s father, who was a former mayor."
6119,"The papers and archives were not enough to fully unravel an attack that was six decades old. So on a cool winter morning in December 2017, Judge Gergel traveled from Charleston to Batesburg-Leesville to see where it all happened, and walk the 250 or so paces from the bus stop to the jail."
6120,"Town leaders met him there. They, too, wanted to find a meaningful way to honor Mr. Woodard."
6121,"“I had not heard about this,” said Mayor Lance Shull, who is not related to the late police chief. “This event had been mostly swept under the rug. I know it can’t be corrected, we can’t erase what happened but we can acknowledge this horrible incident.”"
6122,"“We want people to know it is not 1946 here anymore,” he added."
6123,"The town jumped in to support Mr. North’s plans for the marker. Leaders also decided to do something else, equally permanent: they reopened the case in June against Mr. Woodard and a municipal court judge dismissed the drunken and disorderly charge."
6124,"On Saturday, a group of town leaders, African-American and disabled veterans as well as Mr. Young and Mr. Gergel, who are meeting in person for the first time, will walk the two blocks through downtown and past the remnants of what Mr. Woodard likely last saw before being robbed of his eyesight: the railroad station, a drugstore, a hardware store."
6125,"They will gather at the corner of a vacant lot where the old jail once stood. The state historic marker will rise from a tiny patch of earth, filled with freshly planted yellow nandina plants."
6126,Mr. Woodard’s story is etched in the marker. In print. And Braille.
6127,"The chatter in certain New York society circles these days isn’t so much about who’s been invited, as who’s been indicted."
6128,"Last Friday, just after Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s prison-bound former lawyer, testified before Congress, several dozen socialites gathered at the United Nations for an awards luncheon celebrating the UN Women for Peace Association."
6129,"It was hard to miss Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an association board member, whose 6-foot-1-inch frame was boosted by two-inch Manolo Blahnik heels. A close associate of Mr. Cohen, she had helped organize the president’s $107 million inauguration, the financing of which is now being investigated by federal prosecutors."
6130,"“Alexander McQueen, head to toe,” Ms. Winston Wolkoff said of her black suit with red accents."
6131,"Very chic. Also, have you been subpoenaed by the feds?"
6132,"“I am not going to comment whether I am part of the investigation or not,” she said, without missing a beat."
6133,"The luncheon — which was chaired by Raymond W. Kelly, the former New York City police commissioner; and Alice Tisch, the philanthropist — honored Leslee Udwin, the filmmaker; Ben Stiller, the actor; Naeem Khan, the fashion designer; Marc Brackett and Robin Stern, who are Yale educators; and Albert Pujols, a baseball player, and his wife, Deidre."
6134,"Guests included Karolina Kurkova, the fashion model; Geoffrey Bradfield, the uptown decorator; Rima Al-Sabah, the wife of the Kuwaiti ambassador; Susan Gutfreund, the society hostess; and several television actresses including Mozhan Marnò, AnnaLynne McCord, Kat Graham and Michelle Hurd. "
6135,"The luncheon was pegged to International Women’s Day on March 8 and raised around $500,000 for United Nations programs benefiting at-risk women. But the politesse of the occasion was lost on one man, who bowled over to discuss Ms. Hurd’s role as a villain on “Blindspot.”"
6136,"“I love your work,” he said, clasping her with both his hands. “You’re the ultimate bitch.”"
6137,"Perhaps more on-message for International Women’s Day is “Gloria Bell,” a film about a woman dealing with the travails of midlife, starring Julianne Moore and John Turturro."
6138,"Nonetheless, Ms. Moore made it clear that she doesn’t have room in her calendar for all those extra commemorative holidays."
6139,"“I hate those kinds of celebratory days,” she said at a screening of the film on Monday night at the Museum of Modern Art. “Like, I hate Mother’s Day. I just hate it. It’s a manufactured holiday. I’m always, like, ‘I don’t want to have brunch. I just want to spend time with my family.’”"
6140,"Her remarks were interrupted by several cast members of the “The Real Housewives of New York,” who arrived screeching like a flock of parrots."
6141,"Luann de Lesseps walked the short red carpet, then circled back and walked it again. Her co-star Sonja Morgan shrieked with delight at the mad serendipity of seeing Ms. de Lesseps, then somehow managed to knock over the step-and-repeat backdrop."
6142,"They were given a wide berth from the other guests, including Sebastián Lelio, the film’s writer and director; Julian Schnabel, the artist, in paint-splattered boots; Renée Fleming, the celebrated soprano; and Nicole Miller and Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designers. Numerous actors were also the in the audience, including Barbara Sukowa, Gretchen Mol, Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Bob Balaban and Celia Weston."
6143,"Ms. Moore, who wore a sleeveless Givenchy dress made of ostrich feathers, returned to the topic at hand."
6144,"“I hope you feel inspired to live when you watch this movie,” she said, smiling warmly as staff members worked to right the signage on the red carpet."
