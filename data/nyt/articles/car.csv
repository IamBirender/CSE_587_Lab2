0,"The automobile, in American life, has long been a hallmark of freedom. A teenager’s first driver’s license offers freedom from Mom and Dad. A new car and the open road bring the freedom to chase the American dream. But as more technology creeps in to help drivers, so, too, will systems that eavesdrop on and monitor them, necessitated not by convenience but by new safety concerns."
1,"Cameras that recognize facial expressions, sensors that detect heart rates and software that assesses a driver’s state of awareness may seem like superfluous flights of fancy, but they are increasingly viewed as part of an inevitable driving future."
2,"At upstarts like the electric car company Byton and mainstream mainstays like Volvo, car designers are working on facial recognition, drowsy-driver alert systems and other features for keeping track of the people behind the wheel."
3,"The most immediate impetus: concerns about the safe use of driver-assistance options like automatic lane-keeping that still require drivers to pay attention. And when truly autonomous vehicles finally arrive, the consensus among automakers and their suppliers is that new ways will be needed to check on drivers and passengers to make sure they are safe inside."
4,"“It’s really taken off from no monitoring to tactile monitoring to taking a look at your eyes,” said Grant Courville, a vice president at BlackBerry QNX, which creates in-dash software systems. “I definitely see more of that coming as you get to Level 3 cars,” he added, referring to vehicles that can perform some self-driving functions in limited situations."
5,"With its 2018 Cadillac CT6, for example, General Motors introduced an infrared camera that looks up from the steering column at drivers."
6,"The feature is part of the car’s Super Cruise system, the first hands-free driving tool to operate on select United States highways. The camera tracks a driver’s head position and eye movements to ensure that the person is attentive and able to retake control of the car when needed."
7,"Similar concerns about BMW’s semi-autonomous systems prompted the German carmaker to add a driver monitoring camera in its 2019 X5 sport utility vehicle. The video camera is mounted in the instrument cluster as part of BMW’s Extended Traffic Jam Assistant system, part of a $1,700 package, that allows the car to go autonomous — with driver monitoring — in stop-and-go traffic under 37 miles per hour."
8,"“It looks at the head pose and the eyes of the driver,” said Dirk Wisselmann of BMW’s automated driving program. “We have to, because by doing so it empowers us to add more functionality.”"
9,"Automakers understand that tracking technology raises privacy issues, so BMW does not record or store the driver monitoring information, Mr. Wisselmann said."
10,"Perhaps still smarting from lessons learned in the past, G.M. also does not record what transpires inside the car’s cabin, the company said. In 2011, G.M. tried to change the user agreement in its OnStar service to allow it to share driver information with third-party companies.  The backlash from owners was so swift and severe that the Supreme Court cited the episode as proof that people had an expectation of privacy in their cars."
11,"G.M. later introduced the first built-in video cameras and microphones meant to record the drive in 2014 Chevrolet Corvettes. A valet mode (“Think of it as a baby monitor for your car,” an official said in a Chevrolet news release at the time) that surreptitiously recorded Ferris Bueller-like joy rides made the company so nervous that it sent letters to owners warning about possible legal issues and asking them to refrain from using the setting."
12,"Now that driver-assistance programs that can steer a vehicle down the highway are becoming more widespread, automakers fear that without such monitoring efforts, some drivers will abuse or misuse the semi-autonomous systems."
13,There are multiple cases of Tesla owners circumventing the requirement that drivers keep their hands on the wheel when the car’s lane-keeping Autopilot feature is engaged. The consequences have sometimes been fatal.
14,"“But it’s not just about distraction management,” said Jada Smith, a vice president in the advanced engineering department at the auto supplier Aptiv. During an autonomous driving demonstration, she pointed out that such driver monitoring systems can assess a driver’s cognitive load levels — how many tasks the person is trying to juggle — and then adjust other car functions."
15,"“If the driver is not fully aware,” Ms. Smith said, “we might brake faster.” Other ideas include putting radar inside the car for interior sensing like detecting that a child has been left behind. (Every nine days a child left in a car dies from vehicular heatstroke in the United States, according to KidsAndCars.org, an advocacy group.)"
16,"It was infants’ being left in cars that first prompted Guardian Optical Technologies, based in Tel Aviv, to develop in-cabin monitoring technology, said Tal Recanati, the company’s chief business officer. The company has now expanded its 3-D vision and “micro vibration” sensing system to recognize faces, check seatbelt use, even adjust elements like airbag deployment velocity based on a passenger’s approximate weight. Eventually Guardian’s technology could be able to judge the emotional state of people in the car."
17,"Affectiva, a Boston company developing technology for measuring emotions, has been conducting such research for several years to assess driver behavior. On a closed test track peppered with distractions — people dressed as construction workers, a security vehicle with flashing lights, pedestrians, fake storefronts — Affectiva demonstrated how the company’s program works in tandem with a “collaborative driving” system made by the Swedish auto supplier Veoneer. Veoneer’s technology can control steering and braking on its own, with the occasional intervention of a human driver."
18,"Affectiva collected a variety of driver information during the test, measuring elements like the amount of grip on the wheel, throttle action, vehicle speed and the driver’s eyes, facial and head movements. It then compared that information with what was happening around the car to determine how much trust the driver had in the semi-autonomous system and the perceived level of cognitive load."
19,"“We want them to trust the car — but not too much,” said Ola Bostrom, a vice president of research at Veoneer. “The driver still has to be engaged” in order to take over the controls when a car encounters a situation it can’t handle."
20,"To deliver other advanced services, like augmented reality information about nearby businesses and locations, it will also be necessary to monitor what drivers are paying attention to, said Andrew Poliak, a vice president at Panasonic Automotive Systems. And companies as diverse as Mercedes-Benz and the voice-recognition company Nuance want to add Alexa-like services, meaning that your sedan or S.U.V. may always be listening."
21,"“So these systems are going to become standard in all cars,” said Nakul Duggal, who leads the automotive products group at Qualcomm."
22,Will privacy concerns then recede in the rearview mirror of advancing technologies?
23,"When fully autonomous vehicles begin circulating on public roads, designers note, they will have to be able to detect when people enter or exit a vehicle, who the person is, whether they have left anything behind in the car, and especially if a person has become disabled (because of intoxication or a medical emergency). And that information will inevitably be shared online, although there may be ways that some people can still preserve their sense of independence in the car."
24,"“In the future, it may be different for people who own their own cars, where there’s more privacy,” said Mr. Wisselmann at BMW, “and for people who use robo taxis, where there will be less.”"

26,"Re “New York Plan to Unjam Roads Opens a Path for Clogged Peers” (front page, April 2):"
27,"The population density of New York City creates the ideal conditions for a car-free zone. Residents can commute by subway and borrow cars for longer trips from shared lots, and defunct light-rail systems (trolleys) could be reinstated. The California Tomorrow Plan, published in the 1970s, lays out clear plans for going car-free."
28,"Lest we think that this change would require too large an investment in infrastructure, consider the changes wrought when cities from New York to Portland, Ore., paved over existing light rail lines (a change facilitated by carmakers)."
29,"Madrid just announced that it will go car-free in its city center, and Oslo has committed to ban cars from the city entirely by the end of this year. When a third of Paris went car-free for a day, air and noise pollution was significantly reduced. In America, Minnesotans are eyeing Norway as a potential model."
30,"As Wallace Stegner wrote of the California Tomorrow Plan in 1972, “The aim was nothing less than a plan for the good life within a growing and continuingly industrial state, without the depletion, pollution and deterioration in life-quality that uncontrolled growth has brought.” "

32,I will die before I buy another car.
33,"I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend."
34,"Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?"
35,Finished. 
36,[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]
37,"This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think."
38,"Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. "
39,"But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. "
40,"That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought."
41,"I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”"
42,"But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank."
43,"Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?"
44,Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.
45,"But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. "
46,"Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon."
47,"Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized."
48,"That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all."
49,"It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)"
50,"It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. "
51,"Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. "
52,"But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not."
53,"Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all. Anyone interested in a car with a loose clutch?"

56,Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.
57,"On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night, the authorities said."
58,"While the car was in autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver’s seat."
59,"The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter dated Monday that there was “no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation.”"
60,"But it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night given the vehicle’s speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.”"
61,The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office said an investigation into the case was continuing.
62,"In June, the Tempe Police Department released a report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show “The Voice” on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash, The Arizona Republic reported."
63,"Uber declined to comment Tuesday, as did the Tempe police. The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decision."
64,"The March 2018 crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from self-driving technology, and many wondered how prosecutors would approach a criminal investigation."
65,The crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it. Few such federal or state rules exist.
66,"“It’s not very well trod at all,” said Frank Douma, a research scholar at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies. “To my knowledge, there is not any sort of real bright-line statement about who’s liable when.”"
67,"Mr. Douma said prosecutors’ announcement Tuesday tracked with how typically people, and not car manufacturers, are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel. But, as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated, he said, such cases raise questions about that way of thinking."
68,"“Is this driver, or was this driver, behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving?” he said. “It’s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making.”"
69,"The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did its review at the request of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, which had a potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with Uber in a safety campaign. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday."
70,The New York Times reported last March that Uber’s autonomous cars in Arizona struggled to meet the company’s expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the company’s competitors.
71,"Uber suspended testing of self-driving vehicles after the crash. In December, the vehicles returned to public roads, though at reduced speeds and in less-challenging environments."
72,"In a preliminary report about the crash released in May, the National Transportation Safety Board said the Uber car’s computer system had spotted Ms. Herzberg six seconds before impact, but classified Ms. Herzberg, who was not in a crosswalk, first as an unrecognized object, then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycle."
73,"The Uber car, equipped with Uber’s sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer."
74,"But Uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,” according to the report, putting the onus on the safety driver to intervene."
75,The agency said Uber’s safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact.
76,"The Republic reported last March that family members of Ms. Herzberg had “resolved” a case against Uber. The Republic said that the family was represented by the law firm Bellah Perez, which said Tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the case."
77,"Every decade or so, Hollywood produces a movie that is not only entertaining but also raises the question just what is entertainment."
78,"The 1934 musical “Stand Up and Cheer,” in which the president of the United States appoints a secretary of amusement to dispel the Depression, is an example of what could be called meta-entertainment. Martin Scorsese’s “The King of Comedy” (1983) and Ben Stiller’s “Cable Guy” (1996), both self-reflexively predicated on characters who are mass-culture personified, are others. So is Michael Schultz’s 1976 “Car Wash.”"
79,"A movie in which mass media, specifically radio, exerts a powerful influence on its characters’ lives, “Car Wash” is an energetic, vulgar, socially conscious farce — scored by the master of psychedelic soul Norman Whitfield and focusing on a single day at the Dee-Luxe Car Wash in downtown Los Angeles. It manages to have its cake and eat it too: The film is simultaneously downbeat and uplifting. The New York Times critic Vincent Canby called it “a terrifically shrewd piece of movie-making,” noting that “if ‘Car Wash’ makes no comment on our pop culture, it’s because it’s a piece of it.”"
80,"Yet “Car Wash” does comment on itself: The contradictions between their labor and our leisure are manifest in the irresistible title song. Punctuated by the exhortation “work and work and work,” the song by the soul group Rose Royce explains that while the Dee-Luxe is “no place to be if you plan on being a star” (never mind that at least in the final credits just about everyone gets to be one), it’s “better than digging a ditch” (what isn’t?) and “the boss don’t mind if you act the fool” (of course not). Heard over the radio, the tune sets the Dee-Luxe employees bopping while they work in a speeded-up version of the Funky Robot dance. Has a $3-an-hour job ever been more fun?"
81,"“Car Wash” evolved out of the 1970s blaxploitation genre: Schultz, the director, had a hit with the coming-of-age drama “Cooley High,” and the screenplay was by Joel Schumacher, who wrote the Motown-influenced showbiz musical, “Sparkle.” In other ways, too, “Car Wash” is a quintessential 1970s film. Political exhaustion and economic recession are never far below its candy-colored surface."
82,"Unsympathetic reviewers saw “Car Wash” as a lowbrow imitation of “American Graffiti” (1973) or “Nashville” (1975). “It has no more class than Hostess Twinkie,” Pauline Kael wrote, adding “it, too, may make you gag.” But “Car Wash” is more a critique of those movies. That which was freewheeling and expansive, whether teenage car-culture in “American Graffiti” or boomtown star-making in “Nashville,” is here drastically downsized."
83,"A microcosm of Hollywood, the Dee-Luxe is a stage, and everyone, except perhaps the anxious boss, Mr. B (Sully Boyar), and his gruff ex-con employee, Lonnie (Ivan Dixon), entertains a fantasy or at least wields a shtick. Fittingly, the cast is packed with stand-up comics — Franklyn Ajaye, George Carlin, Irwin Corey and Richard Pryor. The most compelling dreams belong to the playfully romantic T.C. (Ajaye) and the sullen black nationalist Abdullah (Bill Duke), formerly Duane."
84,"T.C.’s childish fantasy of being a black superhero parallels that of the boss’s pot-smoking son (Richard Brestoff), who wears a Mao T-shirt and tells dad’s employees, “Brothers, I’m here to unite with you!” Abdullah’s tortured self-invention is contrasted with that of the self-confident snappy queen Lindy (Antonio Fargas) who, in the movie’s best-known line, tells Abdullah, “I’m more man than you’ll ever be and more woman than you’ll ever get.”"
85,"Abdullah also mixes it up with and fails to faze the resplendently smiling Daddy Rich (Pryor), the founder of the Church of Divine Economic Spirituality, transported to the Dee-Luxe in a gold limousine accompanied by a glam gospel trio (the Pointer Sisters). Their song is an utterly transparent riff on his con man’s appeal: “You gotta believe in something, why not believe in me?”"
86,"The Dee-Luxe crew includes Latinos, a Native American and one hapless white dude, but the perspective is black. Not that the African-American press was universally favorable. The Amsterdam News called “Car Wash” “something Stephen Foster might have written about a day in the life of black folk on an antebellum plantation.” Or a movie lot. That the harried owner, his nitwit son and the brash, insecure cashier played by Melanie Mayron are Jewish suggests that the carwash might be a metaphor for the entertainment industry."
87,"The Jewish characters are well-meaning but clueless, like Carlin’s white liberal cabdriver. The white customers are privileged brats basically making a mess for media-addled minimum-wage workers to clean up. The Guardian, a Marxist weekly — fancifully suggesting an ideological connection to Lenin’s manifesto “What Is to Be Done?” — noted that the movie “poses the day-to-day practical experience of the working class against the ‘abstract’ theory of those who would politicize it.”"
88,"“Car Wash” has its flaws. The most obvious is that the female roles are underwritten and cursory, including the glum hooker played by Schultz’s wife, Lauren Jones. But the movie is sensitive to heartache, Abdullah’s not the least. “It’s all falling apart, man,” he admits to Lonnie, whose situation is only marginally less hopeless. However the bright orange uniforms worn by Dee-Luxe employees appeared in 1976, they now seem eerily predictive of prison jumpsuits. The perfunctory happy ending is suffused with melancholy."
89,"Yet to be included in the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry, “Car Wash” is a landmark. It provided a showcase for Pryor, the most bankable black star between Sidney Poitier and Eddie Murphy, who was subsequently directed by Schultz in “Greased Lightning” and “Which Way Is Up?” (both 1977). “Car Wash” also features Garrett Morris, an original member of the “Saturday Night Live” cast, and is distinguished by the presence of two notable directors, Ivan Dixon and Bill Duke, as well as the multitalented pioneer Clarence Muse."
90,"It was the first movie by an African-American director shown in competition at Cannes; there would not be another until Spike Lee’s “Do the Right Thing,” a 1989 film for which “Car Wash” furnished a template. Schultz serves as a template himself — he directed more feature-length Hollywood movies than any black director before Lee."
91,"“Car Wash” is available on Amazon Prime, Vudu, YouTube, iTunes, Google Player, and Starz; “Cooley High” is available on Vudu."

93,"Re “Bring Back the Stick Shift,” by Vatsal G. Thakkar (Sunday Review, March 24):"
94,"When my husband and I contemplated how best to teach our oldest child to drive, the choice was easy: a stick shift. At the time, I had just written a textbook on health psychology, and the research on teenage drivers simultaneously texting and driving — and crashing — terrified me. Forcing both hands to be occupied — one on the wheel, one on the stick shift — seemed like the right way to go."
95,"Six years later, neither my oldest child or his younger brother, who also learned to drive on a manual transmission car, have had an accident, unlike many of their peers. And here’s an unexpected plus: Our sons never get asked by friends to borrow their car, since virtually no other teenagers have learned how to drive a stick."
96,"Catherine SandersonAmherst, Mass."
97,To the Editor:
98,"Yes, technology designed to make driving easier can make drivers less attentive, but it also takes the joy out of driving. Shifting into fifth or sixth gear on the open road is exhilarating, and it’s satisfying to downshift smoothly as you approach a red light or a curve in the road. Plus there’s the old circus trick of popping the clutch to start the car when the ignition is broken — I’ve done that a few times. "
99,"Driving a stick shift gives you more control of the road, and it’s fun. It’s a shame how few of these cars are being sold in the United States these days."

101,To the Editor:
102,Vatsal G. Thakkar offers cogent reasons for preferring manual transmissions in our cars. I will add that another is the fact that many car thieves don’t know how to drive a stick shift. I still have my 1986 Chevrolet pickup truck because the dimwits who attempted to steal it couldn’t find first gear.
103,"Martha J. EganCorrales, N.M."
104,To the Editor:
105,"I wholeheartedly agree with Vatsal G. Thakkar. As a dedicated manual transmission driver, I was disappointed while shopping for my most recent car. Many manufacturers have discontinued the manual transmission option on many models, and when they were available in my price range, the wait was so long, or so few were available, that I had to settle for a car with an automatic transmission."
106,"While it’s nice enough, something is missing. I don’t have to use my skills to stop on a hill and not roll back. I don’t have the challenge of seeing if I can beat the car next to me when the light turns green. And most of all, I miss the slightly “badass” feeling that comes with driving a stick shift!"
107,"Mickey MariashYorktown Heights, N.Y. "
108,To the Editor:
109,"I finally succumbed and gave up my almost 20-year-old beloved Volkswagen Passat with a manual transmission. I adored the feeling of control of my automobile, and the full attention driving required. Alas, after a few years of commuting along the I-95 corridor, I wore out a tendon in my left ankle. While doctors recommended surgery, I realized, as I arrived at work each morning with a limp, that it was the constant clutching with my left foot that was causing tendinitis. And the solution: $25,000 for a new car with automatic transmission. "
110,"Throughout, however, I wondered if there would be fewer traffic jams on busy commuter routes if automatic transmission didn’t exist. With the constant need to use the clutch in stop-and-go traffic with a manual transmission, commuters would be more inclined to take public transportation or live close to work."

114,"Has Ms. Swisher lived in the ’burbs? Ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles are great, but giving up owning a car is less practical for those living outside cities. Would you teach your 7-year-old to use Uber to get a ride home from her swim lesson? Should I use it to go hit several nurseries for spring plants? Each stop can easily be half an hour, and at the end we’ll be hauling home plants in pots and shrubs in burlap sacks. "

122,"At the age of 65, Richard Gillette decided it was time for him to stand out when he’s on the road. So he built himself a John Cooper Works Mini Cooper with a 228-horsepower engine, a bright red roof and — naturally — a black leather interior."
123,"“Built” doesn’t mean he worked the assembly line in Oxford, England. Instead, Mr. Gillette planted himself in front of an online configurator and chose all the bits and pieces he wanted to add to make real his vision of a Silver White Mini. About $39,000 and two months later, his bespoke carriage arrived at his dealer in New Jersey."
124,"“It was kind of a midlife crisis,” said Mr. Gillette, who described himself as a bit of an Anglophile. He changed the mirror caps and the wheels, upgraded the leather interior and added stripe decals for good measure."
125,"In our made-to-order consumer society, simple is out. And in a volatile sales universe for new cars, brands like Porsche, Ford, Mini and Volkswagen are experimenting with marketing methods to make their models more attractive to buyers — and better for their bottom lines. In a recent survey of a thousand adults commissioned by Mini, nearly two out of three people said they considered personalization important in deciding on a new vehicle."
126,"“Eventually we’ll be selling electric cars,” said George Mengisopoulos, the finance manager at Porsche Gold Coast in Westbury, N.Y. “So the motor won’t sell it — it’ll be the experience and the ability to customize. People who are about 35 to 55 years old have their own ideas of what a car should look like. The company that makes their dream car a reality is the company that’s going to get their money.”"
127,"Henry Ford supposedly told his Model T customers that they could have any color car they wanted, as long as it was black. In the 1970s, Honda bragged that the Civic, which sold for something over $3,000, about $14,000 in today’s dollars, came one way. The buyer could add an automatic transmission and a rear window wiper, and that was about all. “We make it simple,” the Honda slogan read."

129,"“We sent the helmet to Germany to match the gold color,” he said. “When the car came in, we were all nauseous — that’s how ugly it was. But the guy saw it, he had a tear in his eye. He was in love.”"
130,"With electric and autonomous vehicles on the horizon, nearly all brands worry that the car will emerge as a commodity, an appliance. So the concept is to allow customers — custom is the first part of that word — to build an automobile to their exact specifications, making it almost as easy as (and in some cases easier than) ordering an Ethan Allen couch or a pair of Nike by You sneakers."
131,"Of course, a custom automobile is generally more expensive than a pair of sneakers."
132,"Take Ferrari. The least costly 2019 Ferrari starts at more than $200,000. One that is run through the factory’s high-end Tailor Made program costs — well, if you need to ask the price, it’s not for you."
133,"“It really is a creative and immersive experience that allows them freedom in choosing bespoke materials, colors and finish to truly render their car unique,” Jeffrey Grossbard, a spokesman for Ferrari North America, said of the program’s buyers."
134,"Clients are invited to the factory in Maranello, Italy, or to a Tailor Made center in Shanghai and “guided” though the options — special liveries, colors, leathers and trim — by a “personal designer,” Mr. Grossbard said. To emphasize the one-off nature of the buyer’s ultimate show-off machine, the process “also allows the clients themselves to propose new solutions and materials that we can develop specifically for them,” he said."
135,"While Ferrari doesn’t advertise its bespoke service — Ferrari doesn’t advertise, period — the Mini brand has aggressively let its potential customers know that there are “millions” of permutations for a car."
136,"“We had a customer who was an engineering student at M.I.T., and he had a look at just the pure number of options and told us the true number is closer to one billion,” said Ishaan Khatri, product planning manager for Mini. “But, well, that wasn’t believable.”"
137,"Of the more than 16,000 Mini two- and four-door hardtops sold in 2017, 14,000 were one-of-a-kind models, Mr. Khatri said."
138,"The brand, owned by BMW, is also working on expanding the available add-ons with printed 3-D elements. This process “truly allows the customer to individualize the dash, LED door sills, the puddle-light projections, some trim pieces,” said a spokesman for Mini, Patrick McKenna."
139,"“That’s new territory for us,” he added. “We’re still in the early stages of that technology.”"
140,"Just this year, Volkswagen, whose models generally have limited options, is borrowing a program from its Canadian division. It’s called Spektrum. Using an online chart, buyers of the high-end Golf R can pay $2,500 for the privilege of choosing one of 40 colors — Raspberry Red, Squirrel Gray, Prussian Blue among them."
141,"The company estimates that up to 600 of the 4,000 Golf Rs produced for the United States market for 2019 will be ordered under the program, said Megan Closset, product manager for Golfs for Volkswagen of America. (The States are the biggest market for the Golf R.)"
142,"“The customer for the Golf R is unique, choosier about the car he buys, with more money to play with,” Ms. Closset said. “Not everybody believed in this program at the start, but we’re seeing orders in the system, and the interest from dealers and customers has been incredibly strong.”"
143,"She said that in Canada, “far and away the most popular color chosen has been Viper Green,” from a past-generation VW Scirocco. Nonmetallic grays are huge, she said, “along with bright hallucinatory colors for the customer who really wants to stand out.” There is a hitch: Once the car is ordered, the buyer must wait up to four months for delivery."
144,"At Audi, VW’s sister brand, the wait for a special color on the carmaker’s palette can take up to 120 days and costs an extra $3,900, said Matt McKown, senior manager for Audi Sport. “We do about 500 sales a year for bespoke vehicles in the U.S.,” he said."
145,"The Audi Exclusive program can also take a color sample and try to match it. “We can’t do Ferrari Red, but we can come close,” he said."
146,"Over the longer term, the automotive industry is looking at customization beyond the cosmetic aspects of funky paint and yellow textiles. Among the companies developing a higher level of science focused on car performance is Derive Systems in Florida."
147,"Using advanced software to direct the vehicle’s control systems, Derive works with enthusiasts and several carmakers to “take that one-size-fits-all vehicle and turn it into something that’s bespoke, tailored to meet your personal needs,” said David Thawley, Derive’s chief executive. “The implications are immense in terms of greater performance, or increased fuel savings, or increased safety.”"
148,"Among the potential solutions that Mr. Thawley and his team are investigating are technologies that would limit speeds based on highway data, and a seat-belt-dependent ignition system. Never mind those annoying buzzers and bells: This system would require that belts in the front be secured before the car would start."
149,Mr. Thawley believes that the big car manufacturers have had trouble adapting to today’s technology-driven consumers. He suggested that Tesla was the exception.
150,"“Tesla is a tech company that chose to create cars, and all the others are automotive companies that tried to become technology companies,” Mr. Thawley said. “A Tesla is built with the same design language as a modern smartphone. It’s about that user experience.”"
151,"The nice man who brought samples of the banoffee macaron to me and other customers one recent morning began, a few moments later, to gently buff the doors and windows of a new, rose-gold prototype car with a soft cloth. I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London."
152,"The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group, which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group’s founder and one of the world’s best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus, which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust."
153,"Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on."
154,"This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the “branded experience.” A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand. A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming “napmobile.” Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days, where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else."
155,"You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O, a “creative hub” in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer. (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.)"
156,"When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris."
157,"On the other hand, I’d go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It’s not a restaurant in three dimensions — the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I’ve come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand’s menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.)"
158,"I’ve never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand’s dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable."
159,"Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some “whites” made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d’Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami."
160,"There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts."
161,"What to make of those few dishes that did not come together — the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand’s recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir?"
162,"Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists."
163,"Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall, mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do."
164,"The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else’s menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory, gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own."
165,"The chefs of Contra, in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ, the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world."
166,"To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months’ or even a few nights’ work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are."
167,"The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It’s been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It’s a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they’re at the top of the food chain."
168,Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:
169,A lot of people are getting way more interested in putting fully autonomous cars on the road.
170,"With Lyft's initial public offering on Friday, and Uber’s expected in the coming months, investors are effectively placing bets on autonomous vehicles. The development of driverless technology is central to both companies’ becoming profitable and making good on their valuations of tens of billions of dollars."
171,"Uber and Lyft want robocars to navigate city streets alone so they can offer rides 24-7 without having human drivers share their takings. Lyft admitted in its I.P.O. prospectus that without autonomous vehicles, “our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.”"
172,"So the companies need to test the technology in the real world, aggressively. And investors will want that to happen. But the technology still lags behind the hype."
173,"Waymo, broadly considered to be the market leader, has pushed widespread testing of its vehicles for years. It is testing an autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix that is used by paying members of the public."
174,"But according to a report by The Information, things aren’t going smoothly. Almost 40 percent of Waymo’s customers registered complaints in reviews seen by the publication, from wrong turns to near-crashes. “This buggy and concerning service should not be charging money yet,” one customer reportedly wrote."
175,"Ambitions to push harder are also softening. “Currently, the company doesn’t believe it is close to being able to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis without safety drivers,” The Information wrote."
176,"Investor pressure on Uber and Lyft will probably influence decisions about holding off on accelerated testing, which raises questions about how strictly cities and states should regulate self-driving vehicles. Some jurisdictions are liberal, even allowing some cars to be tested without safety drivers; others are more strict."
177,"Mark Fagan, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, thinks city and state authorities should allow testing of vehicles only where safety improvements are “unambiguous.” Maybe that means airport shuttles, low-speed taxi pods or some other uses that are safe even if they are … well, a harder sell to investors."
178,"“I’m on the side of safety and security and over-testing,” Mr. Fagan says. “Rather than letting the market do its thing.”"
179,"In the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled a digital services plan last Monday — new TV programming, video games and news, as well as a credit card."
180,"The announcement was heavy on big names. A cast of Hollywood stars announced the streaming service, its news offering included publishers like The New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, and its credit card is backed by Goldman Sachs."
181,"Beneath the gloss, questions lurked. There were no details about pricing of the TV service. It’s unclear how much content readers will have access to in the news service. The Journal is offering just a curated selection, for instance. And there were no details about credit limits or interest rates for the credit card."
182,"Still, Apple has the inertia of its ecosystem to fall back on. It has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. Users have bought 300 million in-app subscriptions to services belonging to Apple and third parties."
183,"“If they are any indication of how Apple is leveraging their current iOS users, then they’ve been able to leverage them pretty well,” Annette Zimmermann of the research company Gartner said."
184,"If a commodities slump indicates impending economic issues, tech may have a problem."
185,"Samsung Electronics warned on Tuesday that its financial results for the first three months of this year would be disappointing. It pointed to its memory and display businesses, which account for 43 percent of its revenue."
186,"Memory and displays appear in almost all electronic devices, but are sensitive to supply and demand — like a tech world equivalent of oil. There is currently excess inventory and weak demand for the components: See, for instance, a 7 percent decline in global smartphone shipments during the fourth quarter of 2018."
187,Samsung says it “expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.” Competitors probably feel the same.
188,"It’s 2019, and a dating app is considered a potent security threat."
189,"The Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun is reportedly being forced to sell Grindr, the popular gay social network that it bought in two stages in 2016 and 2018, according to Reuters, which cited unidentified sources. That’s the result of an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American operations."
190,"“This appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted that foreign control of a social media app could have national security implications,” David E. Sanger wrote in The Times."
191,"It’s not too surprising. China is no stranger to cyberespionage, and some data on Grindr is highly personal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is supposed to be playing closer attention to data as a security risk, and has the power to unwind deals."
192,But it’s a clear sign that United States trust in China’s digital operations has worn paper-thin.

201,"LONDON — The European Union plans to require speed-limiting and emergency braking technology in all new car models starting in 2022, along with dozens of other technical features to improve road safety, its Parliament announced Tuesday."
202,"The speed-limiting technology, called intelligent speed assistance, uses video cameras, satellite location data or both to detect when drivers go over the speed limit, and curbs their ability to speed up further by restricting engine power. Drivers can override the system, depending on the model, by pressing harder on the gas pedal, for example."
203,"The technology could reduce fatalities on the European Union’s roads by 20 percent, a statement from the European Parliament said on Tuesday. The rules would also require a recorder that collects anonymous vehicle data around the time of a road accident, an emergency braking system and other safety features."
204,"The rules have been approved at the committee stage. To become official, they require confirmation from both the full European Parliament and ministers from all member states."
205,"“There have only been a handful of moments in the last 50 years that could be described as big leaps forward for road safety in Europe,” Antonio Avenoso, the executive director of the European Transport Safety Council, a nongovernmental organization, said in a statement on Tuesday. If the planned measures are approved, he added, they could prevent 25,000 deaths within 15 years."
206,"Speed limits in the European Union vary between member nations, and efforts to curtail accidents and pollution have proved divisive. Germany doesn’t set a top speed on part of its storied autobahn, and recently rejected a speed limit on the entire network after popular outrage at the proposal."
207,"France, on the other hand, has different limits for bad and good weather, on the same roads. A recent reduction of the speed limit on two-lane roads in part fueled anger of the “Yellow Vest” movement, and in January protesters, angry about traffic fines, knocked out more than half of the country’s speed camera network."
208,"But the European Union has enacted rules that have helped improve road safety across the bloc. In 1998, it set common crash-test standards, and in 2006 made wearing seatbelts mandatory in all cars."
209,"Despite those rules and others, 25,300 people died and 135,000 were seriously injured on European Union roads in 2017, with speeding cited as a major cause for accidents."
210,"To improve road safety, “you can design roads in certain ways to limit speed, enforce speed limits and use vehicle technology,” Dudley Curtis, a spokesman for the European Transport Safety Council, said in an interview on Wednesday."
211,He said the newly proposed rules were just one aspect of improving safety.
212,"Mr. Curtis also noted that this was not new technology that would be imposed by the European Union: Some carmakers have already been selling new models fitted with it. The latest Ford models available in Europe have a system that, when enabled, uses a camera to recognize traffic signs and set the maximum speed according to local limits."
213,Volvo Cars said this month that starting in 2020 it would limit top speed on all its cars at 112 miles per hour. It cited data from American regulators showing that 25 percent of traffic deaths in the United States in 2017 had been caused by speeding.
214,"“As humans, we all understand the dangers with snakes, spiders and heights. With speeds, not so much,” Jan Ivarsson, a safety expert with Volvo Cars, said in a statement earlier this month. “People often drive too fast in a given traffic situation and have poor speed adaptation in relation to that traffic situation and their own capabilities as a driver.”"
215,"Despite European Union-wide safety rules, inequalities between member states persist. According to bloc statistics, death rates on roads were more than twice as high in Bulgaria and Romania, among the bloc’s poorest members, compared with some of the wealthiest nations, including Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden."
216,"“One of the factors that divides Europe is an economic one,” said Mr. Curtis of the safety council. “Newer cars come to the richer countries first. There are also issues to do with infrastructure.”"
217,"Romania, for example, has few highways, which are generally considered among the safest areas of road transport."
218,"“Driver behavior and the amount of money available for enforcement are another factor,” Mr. Curtis said."
219,"Edmund King, the president of the Automobile Association in Britain, said there was “a good case” for autonomous emergency braking to be fitted in all cars, according to the BBC. “When it comes to intelligent speed adaptation, the case is not so clear,” he said."
220,"“The right speed is often below the speed limit — for example, outside a school with children about — but with I.S.A., there may be a temptation to go at the top speed allowed,” Mr. King said, using the technology’s abbreviation. “Dodgem cars are all fitted with speed limiters, but they still seem to crash,” he added, referring to bumper cars."
221,"The rules would apply to all new models starting in May 2022, and existing models on sale starting in May 2024. They will not require retrofitting cars sold before 2022. Britain’s Department for Transport said it would follow the rules despite the country’s planned withdrawal from the European Union."
222,"Five years ago, the classic car market had just completed a turnaround that left even seasoned observers surprised by its speed. The deep recession that began in 2007 had dealt the same initial blow to vintage car prices that it did to the Dow and to the real estate market."
223,"The downturn erased four or five years’ worth of gains for collectible cars, by many estimates. But by 2014, most had fully recouped their pre-recession values, and the market has maintained an even keel."
224,"There are some signs, however, that the good times may be coming to an end. A mix of factors is at play, including demographics, changes to tax laws and general uncertainty."
225,"For auctions in 2018 and early 2019, the sell-through rate (the percentage of cars meeting reserve and selling) for million-dollar-plus cars has dropped about 20 percent from the previous year, according to Hagerty, a classic-car insurer in Michigan. That’s the lowest rate since Hagerty started tracking the statistic in 2008."
226,"The wealthiest and most discriminating collectors may simply be taking a pass on the current offerings, or “it may be a sign that the savviest collectors are sensing a change in the tone of the market,” said Brian Rabold, vice president for valuation at Hagerty."
227,"If the recent crop of cars isn’t persuading elite collectors to raise their paddles, the question then becomes why aren’t more owners of blue-chip cars selling them?"
228,"Cam Ingram, a collector and restorer in North Carolina, pointed to last year’s changes in Section 1031 of the tax code, which had allowed the capital gains tax on a sale to be deferred if the proceeds were used to buy another collectible — artwork, say, or cars."
229,"“One factor that few people are acknowledging at the moment is the effect of the loss of 1031 exchanges,” Mr. Ingram said. “Top collectors were able to strategically play with positions in their collections to avoid realizing taxes on gains. Now they have to be far more disciplined. The change in the law is affecting both supply and demand.”"
230,"With the economy still running strong, he added, few top collectors are in a position where they need to sell to free up cash."
231,"Both Mr. Ingram and Michael Sheehan, a dealer-broker of vintage Ferraris in Southern California, acknowledged the perception among top collectors that now might be the time to hold the best of the best. When those cars do sell, they often do so off the radar and at still very robust prices, they said. Private sales have always taken place among elite collectors, but now comparatively few big private sales are the exception to the general rule that the top of the market is cooling off."
232,"Demographics, too, are influencing this market."
233,"“Every day, I get the same calls: Guy dies, his kids don’t want the cars, and they want me to sell them. Or it’s knee surgery, hip surgery or prostate cancer and the owner simply can’t enjoy the car anymore,” Mr. Sheehan said."
234,"What Mr. Sheehan describes is most likely the vanguard of a wave of baby boomers getting out of the market, and nobody seems to have a clear idea of what comes next."
235,"When the classic-car market rebounded after the recession, it was still boomer-driven, and the very top end came back first, in 2011, according to Hagerty data."
236,"“The stock market was still in a slump, and cars were being talked about as one of the few asset classes where good returns could be had,” Mr. Ingram said. “By the next year, the middle of the market (cars costing between $250,000 and $1 million) returned to health, and the year after that, the entry level got active again.”"
237,"If there is a shift now, it’s still in its early days, and the market may be mirroring its resurgence from 2011 to 2013. The broad entry level continues to be robust, according to Mr. Ingram and Mr. Rabold, while the top end is sluggish, a possible leading indicator of a general slump."
238,"The United States economy is in its longest period of growth on record, and most observers predict a downturn reasonably soon. That would certainly affect the classic-car market. But it’s the demographic shift, combined with the potential for another 2008-like crash, that seems to worry the keenest market-watchers the most."
239,"“Several things are in play here,” Mr. Sheehan said. “There’s general uncertainty and concern about things like the world economy and Brexit. The boomers are leaving the market in droves."
240,"“Younger people can’t drive a stick shift,” he added, “and they can’t afford the cars at the level that the boomers have driven the prices to — they’re busy paying record money for housing, education debt and health care.”"
241,"At the moment, the market seems to be in a holding pattern."
242,"“Gen-Xers and millennials are still priced out of the market,” Mr. Sheehan said. “The last time that the market corrected, in 2008, it turned around quickly after it became apparent that the recession wouldn’t turn into a depression. Baby boomer money was still in play, and it quickly drove prices back to pre-correction levels.”"
243,"That may not happen again. “The boomers aren’t going to be around to prop the market back up after the next one,” Mr. Sheehan said."
244,"What it all means is debatable. Mr. Ingram and Mr. Sheehan both believe that some form of correction is inevitable as baby boomers complete their exit from the market over the next 10 to 15 years. Their cars aren’t going to disappear, but their ability to spend will."
245,"“How Gen-Xers and millennials will value those cars,” Mr. Ingram said, “is the $64,000 question.”"
246,"Looking for a new car over the holiday weekend? It may be challenging to find an affordable one, given rising prices and higher financing costs."
247,"The long Presidents’ Day weekend is traditionally a popular time to buy a car, as dealers advertise sales, including deals on last year’s models still sitting on their lots."
248,"Yet people who haven’t shopped for a car in several years may find that they will have to spend thousands more than they did the last time they bought a new vehicle, said Matt Jones, senior consumer advice editor with the auto website Edmunds."
249,"“The change could be dramatic,” Mr. Jones said, suggesting that returning shoppers should be prepared for “sticker shock.”"
250,"The average transaction price for a new car was expected to top $37,000 in January, Edmunds found. (Average sale prices are higher, in part, because of consumers’ preference for more expensive sport utility vehicles and high-end pickup trucks, said Anil Goyal, executive vice president for operations at Black Book. He also cited the effect of more costly technology options offered in new cars, along with the impact of new tariffs on steel and aluminum.)"
251,"Edmunds found that the average interest rate for new cars bought with financing reached 6.19 percent in January, the second-highest monthly reading in 10 years and up from 4.99 percent in January 2018 and 4.22 percent five years ago. Zero-percent-financing offers are less plentiful, reaching their lowest level since 2006, the site found."
252,"The upshot? The average new car payment is about $551 a month, Edmunds found. Ouch."
253,"One reason for the increase in the cost of cars is the “trickle-down” of luxury features — heated steering wheels, for instance — to lower-end models, said Jeff Bartlett, deputy editor specializing in cars at Consumer Reports. Also, the advent of features like automatic emergency braking, blind-spot warning and forward-collision warning can make cars much safer, he said, but also add to the price."
254,"As cars become more expensive, consumers are financing them with longer-term loans to reduce monthly payments. A typical car loan used be three years, or four at the most. Now, five- and six-year terms are common."
255,"While longer loans make payments affordable, they can put borrowers at risk for being “upside down” on the loan, or owing more than the car is worth, said Laura Adams, education analyst at DriversEd.com. That can be a problem if the owner wants to trade in the car for a new model during the term of the loan, or hits a financial bump and needs to sell the car quickly."
256,"Even with longer loan terms, there are new signs that borrowers are having trouble keeping up with their payments. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported this past week that a record seven million Americans were three months or more behind on their car loans."
257,"While shoppers may find deals on Presidents’ Day weekend, there may be better offers in the spring because of another factor. Early signs are that income tax refunds are smaller than expected because of changes resulting from the 2017 tax law."
258,"Because consumers often put their refunds toward the purchase of a car, that could result in “slightly lower demand for car shopping this spring,” according to Black Book, which provides car pricing guides for dealers and lenders."
259,"That, in turn, could translate into more dealer incentives this spring to move cars off sales lots, Mr. Bartlett said."
260,"Or, Mr. Goyal of Black Book said, it could just mean that shoppers will adjust their sights, and choose lower-cost new cars, or perhaps used autos, instead."
261,Here are some questions and answers about car shopping on the long weekend:
262,How can I get the best price on a new car?
263,"Don’t be pressured into buying something just because it’s the holiday weekend and dealers are promoting sales, Mr. Bartlett said. “Buy when it’s the right time for you,” he said. “There’ll always be another car buying opportunity. There’s no shortage of cars.”"
264,"If you’re ready to shop, do some homework online about models and prices before you visit a dealership to strengthen your negotiating position and reduce stress."
265,"“Do your research in advance, have a short list and test-drive all of them,” he said. Tell the dealer that you’re not buying yet, to help reduce pressure."
266,"For a three-day weekend, Mr. Jones suggested narrowing your list to two or three models by Saturday. Test-drive the cars on Sunday, then buy — if you’re ready — on Monday."
267,"Also, be flexible. Overall car quality has improved immensely, Mr. Jones said, so you may be able to find an affordable option by looking beyond your first choice. “Take off your blinders, if you’re loyal to one brand,” he said."
268,Do I have to use the dealer’s financing offer?
269,"No. Consider getting preapproved for a loan at your own bank or credit union before visiting a dealership, Ms. Adams said. That way, you’ll know how much money you qualify for and you’ll have a base rate to compare with the dealership’s offer."
270,"While buying is generally less expensive than leasing over all, shoppers may want to consider leasing in certain situations — if, say, a teenager is going to be driving the car. Leasing may make a car with the latest safety features more affordable, which is an acceptable trade-off if an inexperienced driver is behind the wheel, Mr. Bartlett said."
271,How can I judge if a car is affordable for me?
272,"A good rule of thumb is “20-4-10”: Put at least 20 percent down in cash, stick to a four-year loan, and aim for a monthly payment that is no more than 10 percent of your gross income."
273,"Mr. Bartlett’s general advice is to pay cash for a car, if you can. If financing is a must, a loan term of 48 months at the most, at a rate as near zero as possible, is the next best option. “Going beyond that is a bad investment on a depreciating asset,” he said."
274,"Many shoppers, unfortunately, are dazzled by cars that cost more than they can afford, he said. So it’s a good idea to keep long-term financial goals in mind."
275,"“Buying a more humble vehicle or buying used can save money today, help achieve the long-term goals and will still get you from point A to point B,” he said."
276,"Used cars — particularly a reliable model that’s just a few years old — are often a smart compromise, Ms. Adams said. You’ll still get recent safety features but at a more affordable price. The average monthly payment on a used car, Edmunds found, is $407 a month."
277,[Update: How a hazardous rail crossing became a deadly crash site.]
278,"A railroad crossing in Nassau County turned into a chaotic disaster scene on Tuesday night when two Long Island Rail Road trains traveling in opposite directions struck a car that had swerved around lowered gates and onto the tracks, killing three people."
279,"The rush-hour collision occurred near the Westbury station, about 30 miles east of Manhattan, setting off fires that terrified passengers before they could escape. The authorities said that at least seven people on the trains were injured; the three people who were killed were in the car."
280,"After the driver of the vehicle went around the gates, an eastbound train pulling out of the station struck the car, according to Phillip Eng, the president of the railroad."
281,"Another train, traveling westbound, then crashed into the vehicle and pushed it down the tracks before the front two cars of the train derailed and collided with the concrete platform."
282,"By late into the night, the westbound train still lay against the Westbury station’s platform, part of which had been knocked over."
283,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
284,"On Wednesday, the L.I.R.R. continued to have extensive delays because of the crash. In an early-morning report, officials said the impact caused “significant damage” to 200 feet of third rail."
285,"The two trains were together carrying about 900 passengers, and some offered a harrowing account of what happened."

350,"“It was like a bad movie,” said Michelle Asprer of Hicksville, N.Y., a passenger in the second-to-last car on the eastbound train. “It was so scary.”"
351,"She said her train stopped after Westbury without explanation. “There was a whole line of cars” at the grade-level crossing where the train stopped, she said."
352,She said she heard a westbound train approaching and “making a funny noise.”
353,"“It hit us,” she said. “It hit the last car” of the eastbound train, she said. “The people from the last car were running up, saying ‘Move up, move up because the last car is on fire.’”"
354,"A passenger on the westbound train, Mike Picarella, 36, was in the back of the train when, around 7:20 p.m., he heard “a little thump.” He said he didn’t think much of it, but seconds later, there was a second, bigger thump, he said."
355,"“You knew something happened,” Mr. Picarella said. “The train stopped.”"
356,"Realizing their train had hit something, the passengers stood up and then looked out the window, where they saw another train. At first many wondered if they had hit it."
357,"But there was a fire raging, too, flames knifing up from underneath the train, halfway up the windows. On the ground below was half of a crumpled vehicle."
358,"Within a minute of stopping, the train started filling up with smoke, Mr. Picarella said, and passengers were quickly moved to the front. Eventually, the doors were opened to let the smoke out, he said, and passengers could then see that a train car had peeled off the tracks."
359,"Mr. Picarella, who is a maintenance manager for New York City Transit, praised the response of local emergency responders and the police, who he said arrived within minutes of the crash, and got people off the train quickly."
360,"Rescuers could not immediately identify the vehicle or its passengers because the car was damaged so severely, said Commissioner Patrick Ryder of the Nassau County Police."

405,Mr. Eng said that the authorities often warned drivers about the dangers of trying to cross ahead of trains.
406,"“You’re not only taking your own life into your hands, but you’re taking the lives of others into your own hands: our engineers, our conductors, our customers and anyone else along the local road. It’s unfortunate,” Mr. Eng said."
407,Mr. Eng added that Wednesday morning service would undoubtedly be affected.
408,"Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued a statement calling for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the State Police, local law enforcement and the National Transportation Safety Board to investigate the crash."
409,"“As we continue to gather information surrounding the incident, my heart goes out to the victims and their loved ones,” Mr. Cuomo said."
410,"Crashes at railroad crossings have occurred with surprising regularity in the New York region over the last decade, federal data show."
411,"At the same time, the number of accidents and fatalities at these crossings has fallen nationally, as grade crossings have been eliminated and safety improvements made, according to safety groups."
412,"In 2015, a crowded Metro-North train passing through Westchester County at the height of the evening rush slammed into a sport utility vehicle on the tracks at a crossing, killing seven people."
413,"The crash in Westbury was the second fatal encounter on the railroad on Tuesday. At about 3:45 p.m., a westbound train struck and killed a pedestrian between the stations in Baldwin and Freeport, said Chris McKniff, a spokesman for the L.I.R.R. That accident caused long delays for commuters who were trying to get home from Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan."
414,"Mr. McKniff said service had been restored around 5:45 p.m., about an hour before the crash in Westbury."

416,"We were apart for seven months. He was in Alabama, at Fort Rucker, and I was at Columbia. We spent three days together while he was on leave."
417,"The day before he left, we were on the No. 1. In the twitching subway light, a band swung into our car and seasoned the tight air: One musician kneaded a metallic accordion, and another sang."
418,"He smiled — there is a slight gap between his front teeth — and we danced. In the music, the moment felt infinite. I didn’t think about saying goodbye, about the distance from Alabama to New York. I just thought about him, on the No. 1, with me, swinging to the music."
419,"The next day he boarded his train at Penn Station. I walked to Times Square, crying and cold, and I caught the No. 1. After two stops, a band swung into the car: It was the one from the day before. I couldn’t help but smile and swing my hips to the music."

439,I was supposed to meet a friend to pick up a dress she was altering for me. We were going to rendezvous in the middle of the No. 1 subway at West 79th Street. She was coming downtown from Washington Heights on her way to work.
440,"When the train pulled into the station, I looked up and down the platform to find her, but I didn’t see her."
441,The train operator poked his head out the window. His smile was as bright as the sun.
442,“Who are you looking for?” he said.
443,"“Jackie,” I said."
444,He got on the public address system.
445,“Will Jackie please step out of the door of your car so your friend can find you?” he said.
446,"Jackie stepped out. I saw her, and we hopped back on the train together."
447,The train operator made another announcement: “Jackie and her friend found each other. That’s good.”
448,People on the train were laughing and smiling. Jackie gave me the dress and I got off at the next station.
449,I ran up to the train operator to thank him.
450,"“You see that musician over there?” he said, pointing to a guy on the platform playing a keyboard. He handed me a $5 bill. “Give him this.”"

468,"Wakker departed the Netherlands on March 15, 2016 and has spent a total of 1,119 days travelling more than 95,000 km (59,000 miles) and visiting 33 countries to try and draw attention to the durability and sustainability of electric cars."

473,"SACRAMENTO — In the backyard of California’s Capitol sits Franklin Boulevard, a largely industrial area where many residents earn a living keeping old vehicles on the road. The state, which has been aggressively pushing toward an electric-car future, has made few such inroads in this working-class neighborhood."
474,"“Electric vehicles are for the rich. It’s not for us,” said Mike Bokan, who owns an auto-repair shop on Franklin Boulevard, explaining a prevailing attitude. The median income here is $30,000."
475,One solution for making electric vehicles accessible to low-income Californians is coming from an unlikely ally: Volkswagen.
476,"In 2016, after admitting to lying about excessive emissions from its diesel vehicles, Volkswagen agreed to pay $14.7 billion in penalties. The settlement also earmarked $2 billion to be invested by Electrify America, a Volkswagen subsidiary, in building a nationwide network of highway chargers that allow long-distance road trips in an electric vehicle. But California, which will receive $800 million from that pool, is requiring 35 percent of the funds to be spent on low-income and disadvantaged communities."
477,"Among the first investments are three new all-electric, eight-seat shuttles that will be put into service along Franklin Boulevard — courtesy of Electrify America. Mr. Bokan, who is also president of the local business association, welcomes the shuttles, due by July. They will be a small relief from the exhaust coming from Highway 99, a diesel-choked trucking route that borders the area."
478,"Across town, Sarah Quismondo, a retired nursing staff coordinator, lives in Riverview Plaza, a low-income senior apartment complex. In a neighboring parking lot are two Kia Soul electric cars that are part of a car-share program that began in May 2017. The program provides free access to the cars, and Ms. Quismondo signed up right away."
479,"She was so enthused by the experience — “I love driving these cars, they’re very quiet,” she said — that she became an official representative of the program, Our Community CarShare. She signed up six other residents, and gives rides to fellow retirees at Riverview Plaza who no longer drive."
480,"The program, run by the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District, served as the blueprint for another Electrify America program in the city, just underway, to put 140 all-electric Volkswagen e-Golfs at 70 low-income apartment complexes for car-sharing."
481,"The air district’s boss, Alberto Ayala, is a longtime leader in California’s clean-energy efforts. His previous work as the chief enforcer of the state’s vehicle emissions regulations was instrumental in exposing Volkswagen’s diesel deceptions."
482,"After the scandal fully came to light, the company agreed to pay huge financial penalties worldwide, two Volkswagen executives were sent to prison — and Mr. Ayala’s city is now teeming with E.V. experiments."
483,"Outside the Edge Water affordable housing complex opposite the county jail, Mr. Ayala points proudly to two more shared electric cars. “We just don’t want more rebates for Tesla buyers, because they don’t need it.” (The first Tesla cars cost upward of $100,000, and the company is pressing to bring its Model 3 to the mass market.)"
484,Mr. Ayala added that programs to democratize electric vehicles were “the only thing to keep people like me that were involved in the Volkswagen case going.”
485,"He said that for many years, the state’s goal was to lift sales numbers of electric vehicles regardless of how wealthy the buyers might be. “But the thinking evolved,” he said. “Our political leaders said that’s not going to cut it anymore.”"
486,"For nearly a decade, California has offered consumer rebates, as much as $7,000 per car, to make E.V.s more affordable. Since 2011, 15 residents of the 95824 ZIP code that surrounds Franklin Boulevard used the rebates. In the dense 95814 ZIP code where Ms. Quismondo lives, 71 did."
487,"The combined population of 40,000 in those two ZIP codes received $163,900 in state rebates. By contrast, in the affluent 94025 ZIP code, home to a similarly sized population — near Tesla’s headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif. — buyers received $2.4 million in rebates."
488,"Persuading people to use the e-Golfs stationed at low-income apartment buildings could be a challenge. They cost 15 cents a minute or $9 an hour to use. Mr. Ayala cited obstacles to adoption in his organization’s car-share program, which is free. He said many residents don’t have driver’s licenses or credit cards, which are needed to activate the service."
489,"I paid three visits to the Whispering Pines apartments, which was included in the service by Electrify America on Nov. 1. Each time, I found leaves collecting in the charging ports of the two cars, as if they had not been moved for several days. Envoy Technologies, which operates the program, declined to share usage rates for the cars at Whispering Pines."
490,"In yet another Sacramento-based experiment financed by Electrify America, a program called Gig this month started to put the first of 260 all-electric Chevrolet Bolts on city streets in a 13-square-mile zone between downtown and midtown. Seventy percent of residents in this zone are considered low income."
491,"Users can locate a Bolt via a mobile app, unlock the door, start it up and drive for $2.50 a mile or $15 an hour. When the ride is completed, members can park the car in any legal spot in the designated zone, lock the door and move on."
492,"These activities, which have turned Sacramento into a test bed for equitable access to E.V.s, are being conducted in the first $200 million cycle of the Electrify America investment. The company says these programs have taken about a year to develop and won’t bear fruit until later this year."
493,"Even with few of those services fully in operation, Electrify America went back in December to the California Air Resources Board to get approval for the second $200 million cycle. The meeting became contentious when two board members, Assemblyman Eduardo Garcia and the former State Senator Dean Florez, both hailing from rural districts, accused Electrify America of primarily focusing on profits, which it is entitled to earn under the Volkswagen settlement."
494,"“They plan to invest $95 million to $115 million in places like San Francisco, Beverly Hills or La Jolla, where projected demand is high for electric vehicles, rather than building charging stations in lower-income communities where the market will take longer to grow,” they wrote in a Sacramento Bee editorial. “Comparatively, only $2 million would be spent for community charging in rural areas badly in need of investment and opportunity.”"
495,"Electrify America officials say the rural investment in the first two cycles is closer to $50 million, when considering the charging stations positioned at Target and Walmart stores and at other locations along highway routes, as well as urban charging hubs."
496,"Encouraging adoption of electric vehicles in rural areas might be the toughest challenge. “Electrify America is not going to want to heavily invest in an area where they think the utilization of the chargers is going to be really low,” said Scott Shepard, a senior research analyst at Navigant Research, which focuses on clean-energy markets. “They’re going to need extra pushing from regulators.”"
497,"After four hours of testimony from the public and board members, the state approved the second phase of the project. Mr. Florez cast the only vote against moving forward. He cited insufficient investment in rural areas, a lack of data about progress to date and a broken promise to quickly approve a second city to join Sacramento in becoming a test bed."
498,"“I have a very serious issue with trust in the company,” Mr. Florez said in an interview. “People tend to forget why we got here in the first place,” he added, referring to Volkswagen’s emissions scandal."
499,"Giovanni Palazzo, the chief executive of Electrify America, defended the company’s progress and its commitment to equity. He said Electrify America needed to simultaneously serve regions where E.V.s were already popular and “invest, test and learn where there’s no adoption at all.”"
500,"Electrify America also faces criticism from competing charging infrastructure companies, like ChargePoint and EVgo. They are unhappy to see a new, well-financed rival — with the state’s imprimatur and Volkswagen’s funding — for coveted public charging locations."
501,"Mr. Ayala, the former California regulator, is undaunted by the political friction in making electric vehicles accessible to all. “We know that not all projects are going to work,” he said. “But this city is now a laboratory where things happen. If we find something that works, we can scale it up to the state level, then the nation and eventually the world.”"
502,"The police in Columbia, S.C., arrested a man on Saturday in connection with the killing of a 21-year-old college student who was last seen early Friday before she apparently got into a car that she mistook for an Uber she had called, the authorities said."
503,"The police said at a news conference on Saturday night that the body of the woman, Samantha Josephson, was found Friday in a wooded area in Clarendon County. They said they believed that the man they had taken into custody, Nathaniel D. Rowland, 24, had recently lived nearby."
504,"Mr. Rowland faced murder and kidnapping charges. He was arrested early Saturday when the police found him driving a car that resembled the one Ms. Josephson had entered, said William H. Holbrook, the chief of the Columbia Police Department. The police did not say whether there was any known connection between Ms. Josephson and Mr. Rowland."
505,"The police did not share a possible motive for the killing, but Chief Holbrook asked the public to report any recent experiences of someone trying to “entice” them into a rideshare vehicle in the Five Points neighborhood, where Ms. Josephson was last seen at 2 a.m. on Friday getting into a black Chevrolet Impala."
506,Uber on Saturday directed questions about the case to the police.
507,The company said in a 2017 blog post that it had received reports “from cities across the country about rideshare scams.”

509,"Ms. Josephson’s disappearance and the discovery of her body drew national attention, including from the University of South Carolina, where she was a student."
510,"“Our prayers are with the family and friends of Samantha Josephson following the devastating news of her death,” Harris Pastides, the president of the university, said in a statement. “Times like these leave me searching for words of wisdom and comfort.”"
511,"On Facebook, her father, Seymour Josephson, wrote about the loss of his daughter. “It is extremely hard to write this and post it but I love her with all my heart,” he said. “I could continue to write about her but it kills me. I sit here and cry while looking at the picture and write this.”"
512,"The Township of Robbinsville, N.J., where Ms. Josephson’s family lives, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that its “thoughts, prayers, boundless grief and endless support” were with them."
513,"Ms. Josephson lived with roommates in student housing, Chief Holbrook said. He said they reported her missing on Friday afternoon after they had been out together the night before but got separated and had not heard from her since."
514,"Ms. Josephson’s body was found in a wooded area off a dirt road in Clarendon County by people who were hunting turkeys, Chief Holbrook said."
515,"He said the police saw a black Chevrolet Impala around 3 a.m. on Saturday and that when they tried to stop the driver, Mr. Rowland, he got out and fled. He was arrested, and the police found blood on the car’s passenger seat and in the trunk that matched that of Ms. Josephson, the chief said."
516,"He said they had also found liquid bleach, germicide wipes and window cleaner in the car."

523,An ordeal that ended with police officers shooting a half-naked man in Queens on Sunday afternoon began just before 3 p.m.
524,"The man, who is in his 30s, first crashed his car into a police car in front of the 111th Precinct in Bayside, the police said. He then doused both cars in accelerant fluid and lit his own car on fire. As police officers approached, the man, who was not wearing pants or underwear, lunged at them with a 12-inch kitchen knife."
525,"Two police officers then fired eight gunshots, striking the man in his torso and leg. The man was transported to NewYork-Presbyterian/Queens hospital, where he remained in stable condition on Sunday night. The two officers were also transported to a hospital to be evaluated."
526,The police did not identify the man but said he was not previously known to the officers in the precinct.
527,"Rodney Harrison, the Police Department’s chief of patrol, said at a news conference that it was likely the man had “some mental issues.”"
528,"In recent years, the department has tried to increase training for officers about how to handle situations involving emotionally disturbed people. But less than 12,000 of the city’s nearly 37,000 officers have gone through the training. Emergency calls for those situations have nearly doubled over the last decade, to about 179,000 last year, according to the police."
529,Officers are often unaware if a person is mentally ill when they respond to a call.
530,"On March 5, police oficers responding to a 911 call in Harlem shot a man, Michael Cordero, after he claimed he was armed and then lunged at them with an item in his hand that turned out to be a wallet. Mr. Cordero had several previous arrests, and his family said he was being treated for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder."
531,"Last year, the attorney general’s office began investigating the police killing of Saheed Vassell, who in April was fatally shot by officers who mistook the pipe he was holding for a gun. Mr. Vassell had bipolar disorder, and his family said that the police at his local precinct knew of his condition."
532,"In both of those cases, the police have said, the responding officers were unaware of the men’s mental histories."
533,"The city adopted crisis intervention training in 2015 but has been slow to roll it out. Police officials have said they need more money to accelerate training, and Mayor Bill de Blasio allocated $5.3 million in his recent budget proposal to train more officers."
534,"On Tuesday the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray, will testify in front of City Council about ThriveNYC, a nearly $1 billion plan to address mental health in New York City. Despite Mr. de Blasio touting the program, which Ms. McCray oversees, as “revolutionary,”  it has faced questions about its effectiveness."

540,"TOLEDO, Ohio — The American automobile and the Toledo Museum of Art were born only a few years apart. Now the museum is about to present a major show that examines the car’s impact on American life during the 20th century and beyond."
541,"“Life Is a Highway: Art and American Car Culture” is set to open June 15 and run through Sept. 15. It will feature works including photographs and graphic arts, paintings, sculptures and other objects."
542,"A quarter of the works are coming from the collection of the museum, which was established in 1901, only a few years after Henry Ford test-drove his first automobile on the streets of Detroit, 60 miles north of Toledo."
543,"But Toledo, on Lake Erie just across the Ohio-Michigan border, has had its own connection with the industry for nearly all that time. It is home to the big Jeep plant run by Fiat Chrysler, on a site where vehicles have been produced since 1910. General Motors has built transmissions here since 1916, and the city is home to, and surrounded by, scores of smaller parts plants."
544,"However, the museum itself owes its existence to an industry that was around before cars: glass. Its benefactors were Edward Drummond Libbey and Florence Scott Libbey, members of the family that founded what was to become the Libbey Glass Company in 1818."
545,"Portraits of the museum’s founders hang everywhere in the sprawling main museum building, while a separate building devoted to glass is across the street. In all, there are more than 30,000 works of art, a third of them paintings, a third works on paper, and a third glass objects."
546,"“Mr. Libbey had ambitions that were very, very grand,” said the museum director, Brian Kennedy."
547,"The 40-acre museum campus sits on Monroe Street, surrounded by large, gracious homes and apartment buildings — and the constant rush of traffic."
548,"This prevailing influence of cars in every aspect of American life was a reason the show’s curator, Robin Reisenfeld, wanted to mount the exhibition."
549,"Ms. Reisenfeld, previously course director for global and contemporary art at Christie’s Education and an associate curator at the Museum of Modern Art, joined the Toledo museum in 2016 as its curator for works on paper."
550,"She arrived in Toledo early that year as the North American International Auto Show was underway in Detroit, which she says put cars on her radar."
551,"As she got her bearings in her new position, “I realized how different automotive culture translated here, as opposed to other parts of the country, such as the West Coast,” she said."
552,"Ms. Reisenfeld said she began thinking about the transformations taking place in Detroit as well as in the automobile industry, which is facing a future in which cars have to compete with other forms of transportation to capture consumers’ attention."
553,"Rather than focus on vehicles themselves, Ms. Reisenfeld said she wanted to depict the overall concept of “automobility,” meaning the relationship of cars to everything they touch."
554,"“My hope is that (the show) offers an expansive view of automobility and the United States,” she said."
555,"The Toledo show will be sizable, with 125 works. (By comparison, many major shows have about 80 works, Ms. Reisenfeld said.)"
556,"Laid out along a road theme, the show sketches out three major cultural shifts that Ms. Reisenfeld says have been brought about by cars."
557,"The first is the period before World War II, when cars first became part of American culture. The second is the boom that followed the war, with the building of the Interstate System and the expansion of suburbs, and the third is the rise of consumer culture related to automobiles."
558,"“The automobile becomes identified as a symbol of empowerment, and success and individuality,” Ms. Reisenfeld said."
559,"Along with pieces in Toledo’s collection, Ms. Reisenfeld has secured loans from 47 other institutions and collectors, including the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the Detroit Institute of Arts."
560,"The show will include vintage photographs from Dorothea Lange and Gordon Parks, and newer works by Edward Burtynsky and Helen Levitt. Graphic artists will include Andy Warhol, Robert Indiana and Jim Dine, while painters include Thomas Hart Benton and Kerry James Marshall."
561,"Pieces derived from vehicles will be part of the show, such as a George Segal installation, “The Red Light,” which features a truck’s front end, and a car hood by the sculptor Richard Price. But there are no plans for rolling art inside, although cars could be part of events in association with the show."
562,"Mr. Kennedy said there are numerous places in the Midwest and around the country to see classic cars. “You can go to the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles, and it’s extraordinary. You can go up to Dearborn,” home to the Henry Ford museum, which has a variety of historic cars."
563,"But those places, he said, “are just about cars. What about car culture?”"
564,"The Toledo show’s automobility theme, he said, is about more than putting down the top of a convertible and feeling the sun."
565,"“This was a utility,” he said. “It got people around and got them on vacation. It got them to work. It got things to work,” he said, referring to the economy."
566,"Though Mr. Kennedy said he didn’t know how many people would attend the show, he did know that the Toledo museum has had some impressive attendance numbers. In the past four years, the museum, which does not charge admission, has averaged 411,000 visits annually, in a city of 276,000 and a metropolitan area of 600,000. That makes it the second-most visited museum per capita in the country, after the National Gallery of Art in Washington, he said."
567,"If the museum were mounting a car show, it might be able to compare itself with other museums that have put automobiles on display."
568,"But “Life Is a Highway” is going down a road that offers little guidance, Mr. Kennedy said. “This is about the way we’ve used cars.”"
569,"If you’re at all thankful for our minimal snowfall this winter, at least until this week, thank me."
570,"I was the one who, trying to prepare early, jacked up my Volvo station wagon on a frigid December morning and swapped my all-season tires for a set of four winter tires. That pretty much assured our low-snow winter."
571,"There could be great dumping ahead of us, as there is almost every February and March. And for the most part, drivers will venture out, confident that modern drivetrain designs like front-wheel and all-wheel drive will get them to their destinations without drama. Electronic aids like traction control, stability systems and antilock brakes further bolster their self-confidence."
572,"But I learned early that there is no substitute for winter tires in conditions with heavy snow. Their tread design keeps your car from skidding during braking and while making turns. You won’t slide through stop signs; you won’t continue going straight when trying to turn. Simply put, the tires give you more control of the car, help keep you out of accidents and avoid the skidding cars that don’t have them. All-season tires, despite their name, fall one season short if it’s a season of heavy snow."
573,"If it’s just a dusting of freshly fallen snow, all-season tires will probably be fine. Driving gets trickier, though, when traffic packs snow to concrete hardness and parking spots get burnished to skating-rink slickness. Which is why you need to have tires that are up to the task."
574,"This is even true if there’s just a little winter slop. Those electronic assistants built into modern cars can limit the amount of power going to the wheels or the braking force during a skid, but improving traction requires a better match of tires to surface conditions."
575,"Winter tires — what used to be called snow tires — stand apart from all-seasons or summer performance tires with deeper grooves, a distinct tread design and special recipes for the rubber. True winter tires carry a symbol on the sidewall depicting three mountain peaks with a snowflake inside."
576,"Unlike all-seasons, winter tires have an increased tread depth that helps channel away snow and slush and improves traction by packing snow in the tread grooves for what Bridgestone, the tire company, calls “snow-on-snow” traction. The idea is to take advantage of the stickiness that makes snowballs hang together."
577,"More noticeable are the many added small slits, called sipes, in the tread surface. The sipes help the tire by presenting more edges that can dig into the snow for grip. Smaller voids in the rubber surface help to disperse the layer of water that often lies over snow. That’s also a significant benefit when the surface has turned to ice, like it’s done this winter. "
578,"What you won’t see, though, is the rubber chemistry tailored to cold-weather duties. Winter tires are engineered with softer compounds to remain flexible at far lower temperatures. While a summer performance tire becomes stiffer and loses grip as temperatures dip toward freezing, a winter tire stays pliable, making it superior even when the roads are dry."
579,"The negative, though, is that the softer rubber increases tire wear on dry roads. A benefit of all-season tires, which maybe should be called “all-temperature” instead, is that they remain pliable in much colder conditions than summer tires can handle."
580,"One more thing: You want to have winter tires at both the front and rear, no matter which wheels are doing the driving."
581,"Why would you need winter rubber at the front if your car is rear-drive like my pre-turn-of-the-century wagon? It’s so you’ll be able to turn corners when the road gets slick. Likewise, traction is crucial for braking, which transfers weight onto the front tires. And having equal grip at both ends of the car, no matter which pair of wheels are powered, makes the reactions to turning and slowing more predictable and controllable."
582,"Buying four tires — and ideally wheels to mount them on — is not cheap, usually about $1,000, and swapping them out twice a year is a hassle, but the safety and peace-of-mind benefits are considerable, especially if you have less-experienced teenagers driving. Owners can save money on having a garage do the swaps by mounting their winter tires on less-expensive plain steel wheels."
583,"Ideally, it’s best to put some miles on a new set of winter tires before the snow falls. Typically, the manufacturing process includes the application of a lubricant to keep the rubber from sticking to the mold in which the tire is formed, and it can take some miles for this release agent to wear away."
584,"And what do you do with those off-season tires? That’s a challenge for apartment dwellers, though some retailers offer storage. Homeowners, assuming they can clear space in the garage, should put tires away clean and dry, out of direct sunlight. An airtight storage bag is recommended, and if the tires are mounted on rims, store them standing on the tread surface."

587,"LONDON — It just might be the most adorable thing on four wheels. People smile when one cruises by. They point, they wave, they use the word “cute” a lot, and they ask, “What is that?”"
588,"The tiny Nissan Figaro has an almost cartoonish design that is guaranteed to stand out. To an American living in Britain, who regularly spots pristine Figaros, it would appear to be a highly popular model that was made recently."
589,"Every part of that guess is wrong: The Figaro is rather old, built for the 1991 model year, and there never were large numbers anywhere. Nissan never even exported it from Japan."
590,"Yet here it is in Britain, in the thousands, an oddball little convertible with an ardent following and a back story that is even odder."
591,More on that in a minute.
592,"Britain never had dominant carmakers like Ford, General Motors and Chrysler. Instead, for generations, it had a profusion of small-to-medium manufacturers."
593,"Those carmakers produced a much wider array of designs than their American counterparts, a good number of them quirky, small, underpowered, none too practical — and beloved by their many admirers."
594,"But in the face of foreign competition, recessions, bankruptcies and consolidation, British car manufacturing plummeted from its peak in the early 1970s. Brands like Morris, Triumph, Austin, Sunbeam, Daimler, Rover and Reliant died off."
595,"An increasingly competitive and global market had less room for eccentric cars, British or not, or for models that sell only a few thousand."
596,"“Cars have lost their personality,” said Nic Caraccio, a devoted Figaro owner and trader who lives outside London. “If you go out on the street now, the Citroëns and Vauxhalls and Skodas and Peugeots, they’re all black or white or silver, and they all look the same. Not the Fig.”"
597,"Definitely not. And it is the look that entices people here — the curvy, throwback shape, and the front end that could have been the face of one of the animated characters in the movie “Cars.”"
598,"“The quirkiness, there’s something very British about it, isn’t there?” said Colin Bullock, a harbormaster in London. “It’s so familiar to people, even if they’ve never seen it before. They say, ‘Oh, I used to have one of those in 1962,’ which is impossible, and I just smile.”"
599,"Owners join Figaro clubs and Facebook groups, give their cars names, often buy more than one per family, and sometimes pay over 10,000 pounds, or $12,500 — more than the car cost new."
600,"They drive in Figaro rallies and attend classic car shows, proudly displaying their budget compacts the way other people show off their pricey Aston Martins and Rolls-Royces."
601,"People who took their Figaros to a show in Guildford, a town southwest of London, said one of its best features was the built-in social circle. That comes in handy when the owner’s manual is written only in Japanese."
602,"“The one thing that worried me when I met my husband, Ian, was whether he would love the car,” said Zoe Collier, who lives in Surrey, runs training courses and calls her car Figlet. He did."
603,"The Figaro may look a bit like a sporty roadster, but performance is hardly the point. It has a small engine, just under one liter, and the only transmission available was a pedestrian three-speed automatic."
604,"It has an unusual “fixed profile” convertible roof — the middle folds down, but the sides stay put. The legroom in what passes for a back seat would cramp all but the smallest passengers."
605,"“It really harks back to the more interesting cars in the past, when there was more of a homegrown industry,” said Steve Huntingford, the editor of the British car buying magazine What Car? “A lot of people really loved those cars.”"
606,"Vehicle production in Britain gradually recovered from its 1980s nadir, but what has emerged is an industry that is not very British. There are six large-scale carmakers in the country — and every one is foreign-owned."
607,"Niche luxury brands of British heritage like Bentley, Rolls-Royce and Lotus are also now foreign-owned, as is the maker of London’s famed black cabs. The few British makes that are manufactured in Britain by British companies, like Aston Martin and Morgan, account for less than 1 percent of the country’s car production."
608,"For many years, it has hardly mattered to the British market where cars were made; most vehicles made here are exported, most sold here are imported, and membership in the European Union allows for seamless trade with 27 other countries."
609,"It could begin to matter a great deal if Britain leaves the union, as it is scheduled to do on March 29. Manufacturers worry that new trade barriers will obstruct both their international supply chains for parts, and the movement of finished products."
610,"Analysts say that is unlikely to create a renaissance in British manufacturing for British consumption, much less a return of the idiosyncratic products of old. People looking for something really out of the ordinary will have to keep turning to rarities like the Figaro."
611,"Nissan built the Figaro in pale shades of aqua, green, gray and taupe — one of a few idiosyncratic, limited-edition models the company made in that era."
612,"The company originally planned to build just 8,000 Figaros, priced at about $8,300, and strictly for the Japanese market."
613,"Even before sales began, it was clear that demand would far exceed that figure, so Nissan held a lottery to choose its buyers. Celebrities were among those in the running, generating still more interest."
614,"Nissan expanded production to 20,000, but even so, most would-be buyers were turned away. Despite the unmet demand, the company stuck to its plan to make the car for just one year."
615,"From early on, a very few appeared in Britain, as people visiting Japan — including Eric Clapton — bought Figaros and had them shipped home."
616,"The car required only minor modification to be street legal in Britain, and drivers here, as in Japan, sit on the right side of the car."
617,"Until 2016, the Figaro was barred from the United States because it did not meet emissions and safety standards, but cars become exempt from those rules 25 years after they are made."
618,"It took several years before a semiregular pipeline to Britain was created by people like Mr. Caraccio, who buy, repair and resell cars, and who began going to Japan to find Figaros and send them back a few at a time. The first big Figaro gathering here was held in 2008."
619,"More than 3,000 of the cars are registered as being in active use in Britain, but numbers are no longer rising, and the pipeline has slowed to a trickle."
620,"“There’s only so many, and they’ve been around awhile,” said Peter Pattemore, who drives a Figaro (named Jimmy), as does his wife, Sandra (hers is Sally). “But we’re going to keep them as long we can.”"
621,"Wyatt Cenac was lapping the competition. He was speaking softly in paragraph-long thoughts about his HBO show, “Wyatt Cenac’s Problem Areas,” his love for animation and his relationship with his modest fame. "
622,"Simultaneously, he was winning an unspoken competition at Buzz-a-Rama, the only place in New York City where a comedian can destroy all takers in a slot car race while seemingly not trying."
623,"Mr. Cenac’s drowsiness is an illusion. “Problem Areas” combines elements of a talk show, an animated show and a documentary series, and is perhaps the most structurally ambitious news-comedy hybrid on television. (The second season will have its premiere on April 5.)"
624,"Among the show’s executive producers are John Oliver and Ezra Edelman (an Oscar-winning documentarian), and its writing staff includes Emma Carmichael, the former editor of Jezebel. Mr. Cenac has a knack for choosing talented collaborators."
625,"And also, apparently, for slot car racing. “You’re doing pretty good,” said Frank Perri, as he watched Mr. Cenac’s initial runs around the circular track. Mr. Perri, whom everyone calls Buzz, opened Buzz-a-Rama in the Kensington neighborhood of Brooklyn in 1965. "
626,"Now 83, he runs the place with his wife, Dolores. He stayed with Mr. Cenac until 2 p.m., when he had to rush off to host a birthday party for a 6-year-old boy named Rocco."
627,"Slot cars (so-called because their chassis are fitted with nibs that slot into racing tracks) are operated by remote control. The simplest ones, which are about the length of an adult man’s hand, are fairly easy to get the hang of. The fastest can reach speeds well over 100 miles an hour. "
628,"Children love them, and so, it turns out, does Mr. Cenac. His earnest response when Mr. Perri showed him some previously operational steering wheels was: “Wow. They’re amazing. Wow. These are great.”"
629,"It makes sense that Mr. Cenac, who had a peripatetic childhood, would be taken with model cars. Born in New York, he moved to Dallas when he was a young child and returned to Brooklyn over the summers to stay with his grandmother, who lived in Crown Heights. After a friend moved to Cleveland, he started spending parts of the year there as well. "
630,"“When I was very young, I was given a St. Christopher’s medal,” Mr. Cenac said. “I guess he’s the patron saint of travelers.” Now, he wears a pendant with a picture of a bird on it, which he was wearing at Buzz-a-Rama along with a Muhammad Ali sweatshirt and a patch from the Houston apparel company Grits featuring its cartoon mascot Roscrow."
631,"Mr. Cenac, who turns 43 later this month, is single and has lived in his Brooklyn neighborhood for close to a decade. Asked about his personal life, he said: “I don’t think I have much of one. Work kind of dominates everything.”"
632,"Episodes of “Problem Areas” consist of three sections. In the first, Mr. Cenac explores topics like energy policy and worker protections, adding jokes and animated bits. The second features comic riffs on civic problems (say, the glut of umbrellas whenever it rains) and solutions (government-mandated retractable awnings on every building). "
633,"The final section, which takes up most of each episode, concentrates on a single subject throughout a season. In the first, the subject was policing; the second will feature education."
634,"Mr. Cenac talks about his goals for “Problem Areas” as a journalist might, saying that he is interested in starting a conversation about the issues he has chosen, rather than presenting easy answers. He is less glib about his reporting than his former boss at “The Daily Show,” Jon Stewart, who was known to dismiss questions about the dual role he pioneered. "
635,"With “Problem Areas,” Mr. Cenac said, “I’m not necessarily saying ‘Oh, here’s the answer for everything.’ But maybe if I show you someone who’s building a staircase you might think, ‘Oh, it’s maybe not as challenging or weird as I thought to build a staircase.’ It’s maybe something worth tackling as opposed to getting caught up in the intractability of ‘we’ll never be able to do this.’”"
636,"Several times, Mr. Cenac’s blue car went so fast that it plowed into an orange one he was racing, knocking it out of the slot. He would then get up to place them back on track. "
637,"Asked if, in his fifth decade, he ever felt concerned that his peers were passing him by in some way, he responded that he sometimes felt envious of people who had gotten cool new jobs or bought houses. "
638,"But, he pointed out: “The only person who’s really keeping score in any way is me. And if I’m keeping that score, is that the healthiest thing for me to be doing?”"
639,"He would prefer to think about what his show can do better. He returned several times to the idea of change, suggesting that it should be the goal of any good policy, whether it pertains to policing, education or eradicating the accursed umbrella. "
640,"As he continued to race his car, he made his priority clear: “How do you make it actually work so we don’t have to do the same things over and over again?”"
641,"NEW YORK — Uber Technologies Inc expects it will be a long time before one of its biggest investments, self-driving cars, is ready for wide-scale deployment, a senior scientist said on Monday, as the ride-sharing firm gears up to go public. "
642,"Raquel Urtasun, who is chief scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and heads the group's unit in Toronto, spoke about the challenges for self-driving development at a Reuters Newsmaker https://www.reuters.com/newsmakers event in New York. "
643,"""Self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet,"" Urtasun said. ""To have it at scale is going to take a long time."""
644,"The more cautious tone marks a change from three years ago, when Uber embraced aggressive tactics to turbocharge its autonomous vehicle development in a bid to get more robot taxis on the street driving more miles. The company had been seen as an industry leader in the technology until one of its autonomous SUVs killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March last year."
645,"Urtasun's comments fall in line with the rest of the self-driving industry, which after much hype and bold promises has tempered expectations and pushed out timelines for deployment. The extreme technical challenges of building cars that can predict human behavior and respond appropriately proved greater than even some of the industry's brightest minds had anticipated."
646,"The progress of Uber's self-driving car unit is in the spotlight as the company prepares to kick off its initial public offering this year. Uber, whose losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion last year, has at times spent close to $200 million in a single quarter on its self-driving unit, sources told Reuters."
647,"Uber, last valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion in its IPO and may kick off its investor roadshow before the end of April, Reuters has reported."
648,"""It is true that when you go to an IPO, there is much more of a look into your finances,"" said Urtasun. ""That being said, again because Uber understands that self-driving cars at scale is not something that's going to happen tomorrow, they understand the need for the science."" "
649,"Urtasun declined to offer any guidance on what mix of human-driven cars and autonomous cars Uber will have in the next 10 years, citing too many uncertainties in the industry."
650,"""What is clear is that in a 10-year timeframe there will be a mix of both (self-driving and human-controlled cars),"" she said. "

653,"By removing drivers and adding automation, Uber will be able to pocket the full fare that passengers pay and create more efficient routes to move around people and packages."
654,"Uber opened ATG in Toronto in 2017 and named Urtasun, who is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto, as head of the Toronto organization. Uber said last year it would invest more than $150 million in Toronto to grow its self-driving car operations, open an engineering hub and expand its work in artificial intelligence. "
655,"After the fatal Arizona crash, Uber removed its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its testing hub. Uber resumed very limited testing on public roads in Pittsburgh in December. "
656,"Uber has recently taken a more collaborative approach, inviting General Motor Co's self-driving car unit Cruise and Alphabet Inc's Waymo to put their cars on Uber's ride-hailing network. Urtasun said on Monday that Uber encouraged every self-driving company to add their cars to the Uber network. "
657,"""We've been very, very open that we would like every other company to be in our (autonomous vehicle) network,"" said Urtasun. "
658,"A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp are in talks to invest $1 billion or more into Uber's self-driving vehicle unit, Reuters reported last month."
659,Toyota previously invested $500 million to jointly develop self-driving cars with Uber.

661,"LONDON — Prince Philip, the 97-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, has apologized to a woman who was injured in a car crash he was involved in this month, British news outlets reported on Sunday."
662,"The Duke of Edinburgh sent an apology letter to Emma Fairweather, who sustained a broken wrist when his Land Rover hit the Kia  minivan in which she was traveling near the royal estate of Sandringham on Jan. 17."
663,"In the note, written on Sandringham stationery and dated Jan. 21, the duke said he was “deeply sorry” and wished Ms. Fairweather a “speedy recovery.” He also acknowledged that the accident had left him “somewhat shaken,” a rare admission from a member of the royal family."
664,"“I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident at the Babingley crossroads,” Prince Philip said in the letter, acknowledging his share of responsibility. The note was first published online by The Sunday Mirror."
665,"The crash flipped the armor-plated Land Rover that Prince Philip was driving, and the minivan careened off the road. Prince Philip and a 9-month-old child in the minivan were unhurt, but Ms. Fairweather broke her wrist and the driver of the minivan had cuts to her knee."
666,"Some Britons expressed confusion over why the prince was driving, particularly at age 97. As for why he steered off the A149 road that Thursday, the prince reportedly told police officers that he had been “dazzled by the sun.”"
667,"He returned to that point in his letter to Ms. Fairweather. “It was a bright sunny day,” he wrote. “The sun was shining low over the main road.”"
668,"“In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming from the Dersingham direction,” he continued, as if to address the debate about older drivers in Britain. “But I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences.”"
669,"Ms. Fairweather had previously expressed dismay that Prince Philip had not personally apologized to her, saying in an interview with The Mirror two days after the accident, “He hasn’t even said sorry.”"
670,"At the time, she also disputed the duke’s claim that the sun had momentarily blinded him. “I can’t see how that could be true when it was overcast,” she said."
671,"Since then, Ms. Fairweather has accepted the duke’s apology, calling his letter to her a “nice touch.” “He’s tried to give an explanation, so I appreciate that, whether I agree with it or not,” she told The Mirror."
672,"While the four-paragraph letter was typed, Prince Philip addressed Ms. Fairweather by hand and signed the letter, a point that did not go unnoticed. “I thought it was really nice that he signed off as ‘Philip’ and not the formal title,” she told the British tabloid. “I was pleasantly surprised because of the personalized nature.”"
673,Ms. Fairweather could not be reached for comment on Sunday.
674,"“I wish you a speedy recovery from this very distressing experience,” Prince Philip wrote, signing off his letter."
675,"Two days after the accident, Prince Philip was photographed driving another Land Rover outside the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk County in eastern England — this time without a seatbelt."
676,"SEOUL — South Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co and Chinese technology firm Tencent Holdings have signed a preliminary deal to develop software for driverless vehicles, South Korea's Maeil Business Newspaper reported on Saturday."
677,"Both companies plan to conduct joint research and development on safety and security systems for self-driving cars, which Hyundai seeks to roll out commercially by 2030, the report, which cited unnamed industry sources, said. "
678,"The agreement was signed on the sidelines of a business forum held in Seoul on Thursday by the South Korean government and China's Guangdong province, it said. "
679,Hyundai and Tencent did not offer any immediate comments on the report. 
680,"The two companies are also exploring ways to utilize Tencent's popular WeChat messaging app in developing China-targeted car models, the newspaper said. "
681,"Hyundai, the world's 5th largest automaker together with affiliate Kia Motors, has been fostering partnerships with self-driving tech and social media firms as it aims to introduce highly automated vehicles by 2020 and fully autonomous vehicles by 2030. "
682,"Hyundai Mobis, another affiliate of the car maker, clinched an agreement last month with Russia's largest internet search engine Yandex to jointly develop control systems for driverless vehicles."
683,Shenzhen-based and Hong Kong-listed Tencent has also ventured into self-driving tech and had advertised to recruit engineers in Silicon Valley last year.

685,DUBLIN — The police in Northern Ireland arrested four men on Sunday in connection with a car bombing outside a courthouse in central Londonderry the night before that drew condemnation from across the political spectrum.
686,"The bomb, which had been planted in a hijacked delivery van, caused no casualties or major damage. But after receiving a warning, the police had little time to evacuate children from a youth club nearby and hundreds of people from a luxury hotel and a masonic hall before the device exploded around 8.10 p.m. Saturday."
687,The explosion followed a pattern of attacks in the city attributed to republican groups opposed to the peace agreement that ended the “Troubles” in Northern Ireland 20 years ago.
688,"The delivery van used in the attack had been hijacked shortly before in Brandywell, a nearby nationalist area of the city. The police arrested two men in their 20s, then later on Sunday detained two others, age 34 and 42, Reuters said. The police did not identify them or provide a possible motive."
689,The police later posted CCTV footage of the bomb blast on Twitter.
690,Assistant Chief Constable Mark Hamilton called the car bombing “unbelievably reckless.” He said officers were inspecting a suspicious vehicle outside the courthouse on Bishop Street at 7:55 p.m. Saturday when a 15-minute warning was received by phone.
691,"“Thankfully, the attackers failed to kill or injure any members the local community out socializing and enjoying the best of what the city has to offer,” Mr. Hamilton said. “The people responsible for this attack have shown no regard for the community or local businesses. They care little about the damage to the area and the disruption they have caused.”"
692,Politicians from both sides of the Irish border condemned the attack.
693,"Arlene Foster, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and the current leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, said on Twitter that the attack “only hurts the people of the City” and had been “perpetrated by people with no regard for life.”"
694,"The foreign minister of the Republic of Ireland, Simon Coveney, said on Twitter that there was “no place and no justification possible for such acts of terror, which seek to drag Northern Ireland back to violence and conflict.”"

707,"Local representatives of Sinn Fein, the largest nationalist party in Northern Ireland and formerly the political wing of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, also condemned the bombing."
708,"“Derry is a city moving forward, and no one wants this type of incident,” said Elisha McCallion, a Sinn Fein member of Parliament from the area. “It is not representative of the city. I would encourage anyone with information about this incident to bring it to the police.”"
709,"The Provisional I.R.A. was the largest and most active armed nationalist faction during the Troubles. From 1968 to 1998, more than 3,500 people died in bombings and gun attacks linked to deep divisions between the predominantly Protestant unionists who supported Northern Ireland’s belonging to the United Kingdom and the mostly Roman Catholic nationalists who favored a united Republic of Ireland."
710,"The Provisional I.R.A. formally stood down after the Good Friday peace agreement of 1998, but a number of splinter groups refused to recognize the accord and have continued to organize attacks on local rivals and on security forces, killing two British soldiers, two Northern Ireland police officers and two prison officers over the past 20 years."
711,"Republican dissidents were blamed for an increase in unrest and rioting in the Bogside area of Derry City (which unionists prefer to call Londonderry) last summer, in which the police and motorists were attacked with rocks and sometimes gasoline bombs."
712,"Declan Power, a Dublin-based security expert and lecturer, said that sporadic and usually localized violence could be seen as an attempt by splinter groups to recruit young followers and maintain an appearance of political relevance."
713,"“Dissident groups like the Real I.R.A. and the Continuity I.R.A. are active but not in a strategic direction,” he said. “Most of their activity is related to holding turf for organized criminal activities like drug dealing, and directed at feuding with rivals.”"
714,"“Every now and then there is an attempt to do something like this,” he said of the bomb Saturday night, “to retain their credibility as serious republican revolutionary movements.”"
715,"Such violence is now receiving more attention than before, he said, because of fears that Britain’s likely exit from the European Union could lead to the reintroduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic of Ireland, disrupting the constitutional arrangements that underpin the Good Friday agreement."
716,"BRUSSELS — A key committee of EU lawmakers on Monday rejected a European Commission push for a wifi-based technology for cars, backing critics who support the alternative 5G standard."
717,"The EU executive is seeking to set benchmarks for internet connected cars, a market for carmakers, telecoms operators and equipment makers expected to be worth billions of euros a year."
718,"The Commission's preference for the wifi-based ITS-G5 would give Volkswagen and Renault an edge over Daimler, Ford and PSA Group which endorse the rival 5G standard C-V2X."
719,"A clause requiring new technologies to be modified in order to be compatible with older technology has triggered alarm in the telecoms industry which is rooting for the 5G standard, and other involved parties."
720,The European Parliament's transport committee said the clause would put a brake on innovation.
721,"Commission digital chief Andrus Ansip, Finland and Spain have also voiced criticism of this requirement. The EU executive declined to comment on the parliamentary committee vote."
722,"Parliament will vote on the Commission's proposal on April 17, which can only be blocked by a majority. The European Council also has a say in the issue and would also need a majority of EU countries to derail the proposal."
723,Lobbying group and C-V2X supporter 5GAA has said the wifi push goes against the Commission's campaign to promote 5G-based activities and boost economic growth.

726,"Elon Musk long promised that Tesla would offer a low-cost Model 3 electric car. Yesterday, he finally made good on that promise — but Tesla is making big sacrifices to offer the vehicle."
727,"What $35,000 gets you is a Model 3 that can cover 220 miles before needing a charge, along with a cheaper interior than higher-priced versions. The new Model 3 is expected to start shipping in two to four weeks."
728,"Tesla expects to sell a lot of them. The announcement led Mr. Musk to raise production estimates to 600,000 cars in 2019."
729,"But it will probably post a loss this quarter. Mr. Musk wouldn’t reveal what kind of margins the company would make on its lowest-priced Model 3. But he admitted, “Given that a lot is happening in Q1, we do not expect to be profitable in the first quarter.”"
730,"And the company will change its business model. Tesla will only take orders online, close some of its showrooms and lay off employees to save money. “There’s no other way for us to achieve the savings for this car,” Mr. Musk said."
731,Shareholders are worried. Tesla’s stock fell 3 percent in after-hours trading. Liam Denning of Bloomberg Opinion argues that’s “because this crowning moment came with more than a hint of a gamble.”
732,More: Mr. Musk hired a new law firm to defend him against the S.E.C.’s attempt to hold him in contempt of court.
733,"President Trump and his top economic advisers have sent a series of conflicting messages about the status of trade talks with China, Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson of the NYT write."
734,"• “We’re heading for a historic deal,” Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on CNBC yesterday. “The outlook for a deal is very positive.”"
735,"• “We are well on our way to doing something special” with China, Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday."
736,"• But “I am always prepared to walk. I’m never afraid to walk from a deal,” he added. “I would do that with China, too, if it didn’t work out.”"
737,"• And “much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more important, after it is reached, if one is reached,” Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, told House lawmakers on Wednesday."
738,"A final deal is being prepared according to Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources. Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign it within weeks."
739,"But it may not go far enough. “We don’t look at all close to meaningful, enforced provisions on intellectual property,” Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told the NYT."
740,"And Mr. Trump has proved he will walk. After he abandoned peace talks with Kim Jong-un of North Korea yesterday, concerns that the president might settle for a poor deal now appear diminished. If he doesn’t like the terms of a China deal, the trade war could continue."
741,More: The U.S. plans to take a hard line in negotiations with Britain over post-Brexit trade.
742,"Some of the world’s biggest internet messaging companies hope to succeed where cryptocurrency start-ups have failed by introducing consumers to the world of digital coins, Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaac of the NYT report."
743,"“The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.”"
744,"“The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.”"
745,"Other platforms are working on similar initiatives. “Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates, has its own coin in the works. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line.”"
746,"“The new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries,” Mr. Popper and Mr. Isaac write. “But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream.”"
747,The American economy slowed at the end of 2018. But there may be worse to come.
748,"Gross domestic product growth slowed at the end of last year. It grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2018, Ben Casselman of the NYT reports, compared to a rate of over 4 percent in the middle of the year."
749,"“This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace,” Mr. Casselman writes. “Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January.”"
750,"But the final quarter slowdown wasn’t as severe as many economists had expected. “Even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession,” Mr. Casselman writes, adding, “Most economists do not expect a recession this year.”"
751,"And the Fed remains optimistic. “The economy is in a good place,” Jay Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said yesterday."
752,"Richard Plepler helped make “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones,” two iconic HBO series. But he now plans to step down as the company’s chief executive, in a huge shift under the company’s new owner, AT&T."
753,"Mr. Plepler chafed at losing autonomy under his new bosses, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. AT&T has been in talks to hire Robert Greenblatt, a longtime TV executive, for a high-level role at Warner Media, which includes HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Mr. Plepler may have had to report to a former rival."
754,"He already had issues with AT&T, particularly John Stankey, the head of Warner Media. Last June, the two men taunted each other uncomfortably in public. Mr. Stankey said that Warner Media needed to make money. Mr. Plepler responded, “We do that” — to which his boss said, “Just not enough.”"
755,His departure could precede a larger shake up. Unnamed HBO executives told Peter Kafka of Recode that AT&T wants to further integrate HBO with other Warner Media properties. (Think: early seasons of “Game of Thrones” on TBS.)
756,"But it’s a gamble. AT&T believes that it can put good managers into any business and succeed, but Mr. Plepler is beloved by HBO talent. Alex Gibney, who directed a documentary on the health technology company Theranos for the network, called the executive’s departure “dismaying.”"
757,"In his testimony on Capitol Hill this week, Michael Cohen mentioned several Trump associates whom lawmakers should call in for further questioning. Among them, the NYT reports: Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s C.F.O. and a longtime financial adviser to President Trump."
758,"• “On Wednesday, Mr. Cohen specifically identified Mr. Weisselberg as helping mastermind a strategy to mask reimbursements to Mr. Cohen for his payment to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump.”"
759,"• “For decades, he has represented Mr. Trump on paperwork for everything from complex real estate deals to the operations of the antique carousel in Central Park, which the Trump Organization runs.”"
760,"• “Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign official, wrote in a book that he co-authored, ‘Let Trump Be Trump’ that Mr. Weisselberg ‘knows of every dime that leaves the building.’”"
761,"• President Trump thinks his longtime finance chief wouldn’t turn on him, but others aren’t so sure. “I am sure Allen does not want to hurt Donald, I am sure there is an affection there,” Barbara Res, a former Trump Organization executive, told the NYT. “But he’s in a terrible position — and Donald put him there.”"
762,"We may hear more from Mr. Weisselberg. The House Intelligence Committee plans to call him as a witness, and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform may as well."
763,Andrew Wheeler was confirmed as the administrator of the E.P.A.
764,"Two top G.M. executives — Alicia Boler Davis, the carmaker’s global head of manufacturing, and Alan Batey, the head of North American operations — are leaving."

798,Volkswagen plans to rapidly increase its production of electric cars as it tries to transform itself from an emissions cheat to a leader in bringing battery-powered transportation to the masses.
799,"The company will build 22 million electric cars through 2028, Herbert Diess, Volkswagen’s chief executive, said Tuesday at a news conference at company headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. The company, which currently sells only a small number of electric cars, has set a new goal well above the 15-million-vehicle mark it had previously forecast."
800,Volkswagen’s move is another sign of how quickly the car industry is changing and how automakers are assessing what the next generation of car buyers want.
801,"But the company is also taking a major risk by making such a major commitment to electric cars. Sales of such vehicles are growing fast but still account for only a sliver of the new car market, and it remains unclear how many buyers will want them."
802,"Until recently, most traditional carmakers were ambivalent about electric cars. But demand for Tesla models, despite the company’s financial problems, signaled a broader, if more affluent, market for battery-powered vehicles. Carmakers also face increasing government pressure to make electric vehicles."
803,"Within months, Volkswagen plans to start selling its first electric cars designed from the beginning to run on batteries rather than being converted from existing vehicles. Its Audi division will begin selling an electric sport utility vehicle shortly, and the company’s Porsche unit will begin selling an electric sports sedan, the Taycan, before the end of the year. Volvo’s Polestar electric car brand unveiled a luxury electric sedan this month."
804,Volkswagen’s increased commitment to electric cars is significant because the German carmaker has powerful influence over the direction of the global auto market. The company’s impact on the environment is also huge.
805,"Volkswagen sold 10.8 million cars and trucks in 2018, edging out Toyota as the world’s largest vehicle manufacturer. Mr. Diess noted that vehicles made by Volkswagen were responsible for 1 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, and he said that, too, would change."
806,"“We aim to reduce this to zero,” he said. He explained that the company would strive to be carbon neutral by 2050, in part by switching its factories to renewable energy, and would encourage suppliers to do the same."
807,"Electric cars with the Volkswagen brand will not begin appearing until 2020, and the company has promised that the battery-powered models will be close in price to a Golf, or under $30,000. That kind of pricing would be in keeping with the company’s heritage as the producer of the Beetle, which made car ownership affordable for millions of people in the decades after World War II."
808,"As part of its new push, Volkswagen is retooling a factory in Zwickau, Germany, and expanding a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., to produce electric cars."
809,"Volkswagen is responding in part to government pressure, at home and abroad. China, Volkswagen’s largest market, has set quotas on electric cars for automakers to meet. In Europe, carmakers are struggling to adhere to tougher pollution rules for gasoline- and diesel-powered vehicles. Those standards make electric vehicles more attractive because they have no tailpipe emissions."
810,European emissions rules have also gotten more stringent after Volkswagen was found in 2015 to have rigged its diesel vehicles to cheat on emissions tests.
811,"Volkswagen has struggled more than other carmakers to cope with the more rigorous screening procedures that took effect last year, leading to major delays in delivering its latest models."
812,"“Our complex portfolio meant that we were more seriously affected than our competitors,” Mr. Diess said."
813,"The delays, and a decline in sales to China, cut into Volkswagen’s net profit, which fell 30 percent in the fourth quarter, to 2.8 billion euros, or $3.1 billion, the company said Tuesday."
814,"Adding to Volkswagen’s problems, European buyers are shunning diesel vehicles, which once accounted for more than half of the new passenger car sales in the region. Volkswagen has long promoted its leadership in diesel technology, but the emissions scandal called attention to the harmful nitrogen oxide pollution produced by diesel cars and led some European cities to consider banning them."
815,"Infiniti, Nissan’s luxury car unit, said Tuesday that it would discontinue production of diesel cars, withdraw from the Western European market altogether in 2020 and focus instead on selling vehicles in the United States and China."
816,"Automakers, local authorities and tech giants are all racing peers to new tech horizons."
817,"The Chinese government said it is paying great attention to the development of intelligent connected vehicles and considers the sector a vital way to ease the burden on transportation, energy consumption and environmental pollution, a top official said."
818,"“By 2020, the market scale of the country’s intelligent connected vehicles sector is expected to exceed 100 billion yuan ($14.5 billion),” said Minister of Industry and Information Technology Miao Wei at the World Intelligent Connected Vehicles Conference held in Beijing from Oct. 18 to 21."
819,"“A new era of the automobile industry is here,” he said. “The development of intelligent connected vehicles can drive the technological reform and upgrading of the automobile industry.”"
820,"With the Chinese government fostering the development of intelligent connected vehicles, several cities have enacted laws and regulations for autonomous driving trials, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, and Changchun in Jilin province."
821,"Chen Jining, mayor of Beijing, said the capital city has regarded the intelligent connected vehicles sector as one of the key development directions for advanced industry since 2017, and has introduced special supportive policies to promote open road tests for self-driving vehicles."
822,"Beijing will commit itself to taking the lead in building the fifth-generation internet of vehicles to form a complete technological system of intelligent connected vehicles that meet the requirements of advanced autonomous driving, known as Level 4, said the white paper by the Beijing Commission of Economy and Information Technology, issued on the sidelines of the conference."
823,"A 123,552-acre pilot zone will be established and over 1,242 miles of roads will be earmarked in Beijing for testing intelligent connected vehicles."
824,"By mid-October in 2018, Beijing had opened 44 road sections with a total length of 76 miles for automakers to test their autonomous driving technology, according to the white paper."
825,"Chen said the intelligent connected vehicle industry, as a strategic development direction in the new era, is closely related to a wide range of industries. Therefore, its improvement requires joint efforts from all parties."
826,China’s major internet giants are already embracing the trend and betting big on the promising market.
827,"Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc. has taken the lead in China to realize fully automatic driving under the mixed road conditions of urban roads, beltways and expressways, and has achieved mass production of the Apolong, China’s first Level 4 fully self-driving minibus. It plans to ship the buses to Japan early in 2019."
828,Baidu has been engaged in the automobile industry since 2013.
829,"“The Apollo project launched by Baidu in 2017 has become the world’s largest intelligent driving environment,” said Robin Li, chairman and CEO of Baidu."
830,"The Apollo intelligent driving system has attracted 129 eco-partners and over 10,000 developers to create products so far. Due to the open platform, many “new species” of autonomous driving have become involved, such as driverless trucks, unmanned delivery vehicles, unmanned sanitation cars and autonomous wheelchairs."
831,"Li said Baidu has pushed forward with a series of initiatives aimed at limiting unintended consequences from artificial intelligence, as the internet giant has taken safety and security as its first principles in the development of autonomous driving."
832,"E-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has been developing its own internet-connected vehicle technology. The technology giant collaborated with SAIC Motor Co. and launched the internet-connected model Roewe RX5, sparking a buying frenzy."
833,"Alibaba said it believes the development of intelligent connected vehicles should not be limited to the product itself, but expand the vision from the car to the road."
834,"“It’s worth thinking about whether smart cars can effectively use road resources,” said Wang Jian, chairman of the Alibaba Group Technical Committee. “The internet should be another form of infrastructure for cars, just as roads are.”"
835,"Alibaba’s plans for automatic driving run alongside its vehicle-road synergetic project, which sees autonomous vehicles driving in an information-based environment and obtaining required road environment information from the intelligent transportation system."
836,Wang said technological progress is closely related to the optimization of urban resources.
837,"“Only when the least physical resources are used to support the development of transportation, the era of intelligent connected vehicles will really begin,” he said."
838,"Underpinning that goal is Alibaba’s acceleration into real-world testing of autonomous driving. The company announced in September that its driverless fleet had been granted test license plates by the authorities in Hangzhou, Zhejiang province."
839,"Another internet giant, Tencent Holdings Ltd., is not far behind. Currently, Tencent has signed strategic cooperation agreements with FAW, BMW, GAC, Changan and other automakers. Several models powered by Tencent’s internet of vehicles system, AI in Car, are already on the market."
840,"Pony Ma, chairman and CEO of Tencent, said the company is designing a voice interaction system to help drivers safely send and receive messages, minimizing drivers’ distractions."
841,"“Carmakers are the leaders of the intelligent connected vehicle industry, and Tencent’s position is clearly as an ‘assistant’ to carmakers, which helps the automobile industry achieve transformation and upgrading,” Ma said."
842,"“No automotive enterprise can provide all the resources and capabilities required to produce an intelligent connected vehicle. The future of the automobile industry needs efforts from internet tech giants and traditional carmakers,” he said."
843,His comments were echoed among major Chinese carmakers.
844,"“Traditional automobile enterprises and internet technology companies are naturally and strongly complementary,” said Xu Heyi, chairman of Beijing Automotive Group Co., or BAIC Group."
845,"BAIC Group unveiled its five-year plan, which aims to equip all of its products with world-leading self-driving or intelligent connected technologies by 2020."
846,"“BAIC should strengthen its industrial presence in high-performance sensors, controllers, computing platforms, automatic driving systems and high-precision maps,” Xu said."
847,"The group will cooperate with world-leading electronics company Bosch, Chinese tech giant Baidu, Chinese voice technology firm iFlytek Co., and other tech firms to integrate high-quality resources across the globe and to build an open intelligent connected vehicle ecosystem, Xu said."
848,BAIC is not the first carmaker that has decided to build such an open vehicle ecosystem.
849,"BYD Co. Ltd. has launched its own car app platform, D++. Using the platform, app developers can gain access to 66 control rights, 341 sensors and extensive vehicle data."
850,"“We are the first car brand to open all sensors and controls,” said Wang Chuanfu, chairman and president of BYD. “It is also the first step in the process of establishing a fully open vehicle ecosystem.”"
851,"The platform has already attracted dozens of partners, including Baidu with its self-driving Apollo system, online security company 360 Security Technology Inc., and AI specialist Horizon Robotics Inc."

853,"LONDON — A two-vehicle collision on an English country road was just an accident, and no charges will be filed against the driver who seemed to have been at fault, prosecutors said on Thursday — the kind of everyday decision that would ordinarily draw no attention."
854,"Except that in this case, the 97-year-old driver in question is married to the queen, has a longstanding reputation for being a bit too fond of going fast and has drivers at the ready to take him wherever he might like to go."
855,"When Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, had the accident last month, many in Britain and beyond wondered why he was driving at all, and the episode seemed all too familiar to countless people who have tried to persuade their elderly parents to give up the car keys."
856,"It did not help his cause that two people in the other vehicle were injured in the accident, or that the prince, the duke of Edinburgh, was spotted driving again just two days later, this time without wearing a seatbelt, drawing a verbal warning from the local constabulary."
857,"But on Saturday, Buckingham Palace announced that Philip had voluntarily surrendered his driver’s license. Whether any royal arm-twisting was involved remains a closely held secret."
858,"Chris Long, chief prosecutor for eastern England, said in a statement about the accident released on Thursday, “We took into account all of the circumstances in this case, including the level of culpability, the age of the driver and the surrender of the driving license.”"
859,"“We have decided that it would not be in the public interest to prosecute,” he added. “All those involved in the collision have been informed and provided with a full explanation in writing.”"
860,"The crash, on Jan. 17, took place near the queen’s Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, eastern England. Prince Philip’s Land Rover collided with a Kia minivan carrying two women and a baby; the prince’s vehicle flipped onto its side and came to a stop on the shoulder of the A149 road, while the minivan ended up a few feet away, nosed into a brush-filled ditch."
861,One of the women suffered a broken wrist and the other had cuts to her leg. The prince and the baby were unhurt.
862,The opioid crisis in the United States has become so grim that Americans are now likelier to die of an overdose than in a vehicle crash.
863,"That’s according to a new report by the National Safety Council that analyzed the causes of preventable deaths in the country in 2017. The probability of dying from an opioid overdose, according to the report, is one in 96. The chances of dying in a vehicle crash? One in 103."
864,"Most Americans are still most likely to die of natural causes, chiefly heart disease (a one in six chance) or cancer (one in seven). But the report shows, in stark numbers, that everyday events — such as falling down — might be effectively more dangerous than rare ones, such as getting hit by lightning."
865,"“Human beings, we just are not good at estimating our own risk,” said Ken Kolosh, manager of statistics at the National Safety Council, who oversaw the report. “We tend to fixate or focus on the rare, startling event, like a plane crash or a major flood or a natural disaster, but in reality, when you look at the numbers, the everyday risks that we face and have become so accustomed to form a much greater hazard.”"
866,"Medicine has improved our ability to combat fatal illnesses. But while deaths from natural causes have gone down, deaths from preventable causes have ticked up, and the result is that Americans’ life expectancy has actually decreased over the past few years, Mr. Kolosh said."
867,"Here’s a look at the trends, and the top 10 causes of preventable deaths."
868,The total number of deaths from opioid overdoses first surpassed the total number of deaths from vehicle crashes years ago. But the report found that 2017 was the first year in which accidental opioid deaths exceeded the number of accidental vehicle crashes. (Intentional overdoses or vehicle crashes were counted as suicides.)
869,"“Something that was a nonissue 30 years ago now looms as this incredible monster of an issue,” Mr. Kolosh said. "
870,"Overdoses of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid, have been driving the increase, according to data on opioid deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
871,"Car crashes continue to be a leading cause of preventable death, with pedestrians accounting for a bigger proportion of the fatalities, especially in urban areas. While Mr. Kolosh said the reasons behind the increase have not been thoroughly studied, distracted driving is widely considered to be a factor. "
872,"When it comes to deadly car crashes, the report made a notable finding: About half of the people who died in the crashes studied were not wearing seatbelts."
873,The probability of dying in a fall increased to one in 114. Mr. Kolosh attributed the uptick to the fact that more older adults are reporting falls. Some of them at first might not seem particularly serious.
874,"“They’re slipping or tripping in their bathrooms, or in their kitchens,” Mr. Kolosh said. But researchers are finding that even some of these minor falls may lead to hospitalization and a chain of events that may then result in death."
875,"Among the ways to prevent falls, according to the CDC: Exercise that focuses on strength, flexibility and balance."
876,Heart disease: one in six
877,Cancer: one in seven
878,Lower respiratory disease: one in 27
879,Suicide: one in 88
880,Opioid overdose: one in 96
881,Car crash: one in 103
882,Fall: one in 114
883,Gun assault: one in 285
884,Pedestrian incident: one in 556
885,Motorcycle crash: 1 in 858
886,Here’s the full list. 
887,"California joined about a half-dozen states this month in banning the use of a person’s gender when assessing risk factors for car insurance, a change that could potentially alter rates for scores of drivers across the state."
888,"The state, which is the country’s most populous, requires insurers to prioritize criteria like drivers’ safety records and years of experience behind the wheel when setting auto rates, but it also allows them to weigh other factors, like marital status. Gender had been among the optional criteria until the beginning of this year, when a new regulation went into effect prohibiting the practice."
889,"In announcing the change, the departing state insurance commissioner, Dave Jones, said the new regulations “ensure that auto insurance rates are based on factors within a driver’s control, rather than personal characteristics over which drivers have no control.”"
890,"Mr. Jones’s term as commissioner ended in early January, and the new regulation was one of his final acts. The state’s Insurance Department, in explaining its reasoning for the change, noted that the industry had inconsistently — and perhaps unfairly — applied gender weighting in pricing."
891,"Some insurers found that female drivers were a higher risk while others claimed the inverse, the department concluded, and the factoring of gender on rates varied widely by location."
892,"“Gender’s relationship to risk of loss no longer appears to be substantial,” the department noted, saying the rationale for using it was “suspect.”"
893,"“Charging drivers different rates by their gender might have seemed like a good idea decades ago,” Ricardo Lara, the new state insurance commissioner, said in an emailed statement. “Gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation are beyond your control, and it is not a fair or even an effective way to predict risk.”"
894,The specific impact on someone’s insurance rates in California remains uncertain. Insurers have until at least July to submit gender-neutral auto rating plans to the Insurance Department for review.
895,"Removing the gender factor could in effect equalize rates for inexperienced drivers: Younger men, who have typically paid higher rates, on average might see declines, while younger women could see increases. In an economic analysis of the change, the Insurance Department estimated that female drivers with three or fewer years of driving experience were expected to see the biggest impact, with rates going up 6 percent on average. Male drivers with similar driving experience could have a corresponding decrease of about 5 percent."
896,"The department’s analysis, based on 17 companies that make up about two-thirds of the state’s consumer car insurance market, estimated scant effect on rates over all."
897,"The impact for any given driver, however, could “vary considerably” by the individual, by the insurer and by the type of coverage chosen, the state noted."
898,"Janet Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the Insurance Information Institute, an industry group, said she didn’t expect California drivers over all to see a big impact on premiums, because gender wasn’t one of the top factors used in setting rates anyway."
899,"Other states that ban the use of gender in setting rates include Hawaii, Massachusetts, Montana, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to the Consumer Federation of America, a nonprofit advocacy group. Most other states allow the practice, and insurers have long argued that the use of gender in setting premiums is sound actuarial practice."
900,"Alyssa Connolly, director of marketing insights at the Zebra, a website that provides auto insurance quotes, suggested that gender as a rating factor tended to have “minimal impact” on rates across the United States. On a national level, the premium difference is about 1 percent, she said, with men having paid slightly more through 2016 and women paying more since then. Nevada, Utah and Minnesota have the greatest disparity in rates by gender, with premiums varying by 4 to 6 percent."
901,"Douglas Heller, an insurance expert and consultant, submitted testimony to the Insurance Department in support of the change, on behalf of the Consumer Federation of California’s Education Foundation, a consumer rights group. Research he conducted with the Consumer Federation of America found that despite widespread belief to the contrary, women — particularly those over 25 — may often pay “significantly” higher rates than men with similar driving records."
902,"“By using gender as a rating factor,” Mr. Heller said in his testimony, “insurers diminish the impact of more appropriate rating factors, such as driver safety, miles driven and driving experience.”"
903,"Other groups, including Texas Appleseed, a nonprofit advocacy group, have also found that women are often unfairly charged higher rates."
904,"The rule change in California followed the advent of a state law aimed at accommodating the concerns of transgender people when using identity documents. The Gender Recognition Act of 2017 in part allows Californians to choose, in addition to “male” or “female,” a third category of “nonbinary” on their state driver’s licenses. The law describes nonbinary as an umbrella term for people whose gender identities “fall somewhere outside of the traditional conceptions of strictly either female or male.” The option became available Jan. 1."
905,"In Oregon, where drivers may select “not specified” as a third gender category on their licenses, insurers may continue to use gender as a factor in setting rates. However, insurers must submit documentation justifying how they rate those drivers."
906,Here are some questions and answers about auto insurance premiums:
907,What factors do insurers consider when setting auto insurance rates?
908,"The rules vary by state, and some exclude or restrict certain criteria. Typical factors used by insurers to assess a driver’s risk and set premiums, in addition to your driving record and claims history, might include where you live, your age, education, occupation, marital status, credit history and the type of car you drive, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners."
909,What can I do if I think my auto premium is too high?
910,"Industry representatives and consumer advocates alike advise people to seek quotes periodically from competing insurers. Ms. Connolly of the Zebra suggests getting quotes for comparison every six to 12 months. “Rates change all the time,” she said."
911,What else can I do to keep my auto rates affordable?
912,"Consider raising your deductible, the amount subtracted from your check when an insurer pays a claim under your policy. Going from $500 to $1,000 can save between 10 and 15 percent annually on premiums, Ms. Connolly said. Also, make sure you don’t let your policy lapse; if you go without coverage even for a day, you’ll likely see your rates rise. And, she said, bundling your coverage for renter’s or homeowner’s insurance with your auto policy with the same insurer can save an average of 8 percent annually."
913,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The suspect in a car bombing that left 21 people dead on Thursday in Bogotá, the capital,was a member of the country’s largest remaining guerrilla group, the defense ministry said Friday."
914,"José Aldemar Rojas Rodríguez, the assailant who was also killed in the attack, was a member of the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN, said Guillermo Botero, the Colombian defense minister."
915,"The group did not claim responsibility for the bombing, but it has stepped up attacks against the government since its rival, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, signed a peace deal with the government in 2016."
916,"Thursday’s attack was the first car bombing in Bogotá in years, a gruesome reminder of a time when drug lords and rebel groups ravaged the capital’s streets with car bombs, killing hundreds of civilians and members of the security forces. Since the signing of the peace accords, the Colombian government has said it turned the page on that violent era."
917,"[Read our latest update on the suspect arrested for the Bogota, Colombia bombing.]"
918,Scenes of the carnage tell a different story. Cellphone videos shared with The New York Times on Friday and filmed by someone who was at the scene showed a burning vehicle with a dismembered torso in blue pants sprawled in front of the flames. The camera also captured images of a human foot and what appeared to be a severed head. Rescue workers struggled to carry survivors out on stretchers.
919,"The attack against security forces in Colombia’s center of power marked an escalation of hostilities with the ELN, which in the last year has bombed police stations, attacked oil pipelines and kidnapped soldiers, police officers and military contractors. And it will almost certainly derail negotiations with the group, which says it is seeking a similar peace deal as the FARC, said Jairo Libreros, a professor at Externado University in Bogotá and a security analyst who tracks the group."
920,"“This closes the window and ends all chance in the short term of peace talks,” Mr. Libreros said. “Citizens will not tolerate peace negotiations at a time of attacks.”"
921,"Iván Duque, Colombia’s president, who had been away from the capital, called the bombing a “miserable terrorist act” and said that he was returning to direct the investigation. “All Colombians reject terrorism and are united to confront it,” he said on Twitter."
922,"The car had been laden with about 175 pounds of pentolite, a powerful explosive, which went off minutes after a promotion ceremony for police officers, according to the office of the Colombian attorney general."
923,"“This kind of thing has an impact,” said Jenifer Beltrán, 36, a mother of two who was home when she heard the explosion. “It makes you think that once again the country is headed toward that memory of those years when there were so many car bombs and attacks everywhere.”"
924,"By midday Thursday, relatives of students of the Santander General School had gathered by the building to search for their loved ones."
925,"Among them was Leonor Pardo, a saleswoman whose 21-year-old son had been studying at the academy and had just been found unharmed."
926,"“We heard an explosion — it was horrible because the first thing I thought of was my son,” said Ms. Pardo, who was near the police academy at the time. “I fainted.”"
927,"Even before Mr. Botero spoke on Friday, local news reports speculated that the bombing may have been the work of Colombia’s remaining guerrilla fighters, many of whom remain at large."
928,"Last January, guerrilla fighters of the National Liberation Army killed five police officers and wounded more than 40 in the bombing of a police station in the port city of Barranquilla."
929,"The group also kidnapped four soldiers, three police officers and two military contractors last year in a bid to pressure the government to enter into peace talks. The hostages were released, but the government refused to negotiate."
930,"The attack was a blow to Mr. Duque, whose approval ratings as president have fallen in recent months, particularly on issues of security."
931,"“I think this comes at a critical juncture for Duque’s early government,” said Arlene B. Tickner, a political scientist at Bogotá’s Del Rosario University who writes a column in El Espectador, a Colombia newspaper. “He’s not high in the polls, he’s subject to ridicule in some circles and under tremendous pressure on security.”"
932,"Under pressure from his own right-wing Democratic Center party, Mr. Duque recently replaced the heads of the national police and armed forces with hard-liners and promoted other top military officials who had been linked to extrajudicial killings, according to Human Rights Watch."
933,"“The decision to appoint officers linked by credible evidence to serious abuses conveys the toxic message to the troops that respect for human rights is not necessary for career success,” said José Miguel Vivanco, the head of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division."
934,"Among the witnesses on Thursday was Berta Poussaint, 62, who sells military uniforms near the school. Rather than using this as a call for a crackdown, she said, the authorities should try to negotiate with guerrilla groups."
935,"“The president needs to push for peace,” said Ms. Poussaint."
936,"I was backing my wife’s car out of our driveway when I realized I wasn’t watching the backup camera, nor was I looking out of the rear window. I was only listening for those “audible proximity alerts” — the high-pitched beeps that my car emits as I approach an object while in reverse. The problem was that my wife’s car, an older model, doesn’t offer such beeps. "
937,"I had become so reliant on this technology that I had stopped paying attention, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences. "
938,"Backup cameras, mandatory on all new cars as of last year, are intended to prevent accidents. Between 2008 and 2011, the percentage of new cars sold with backup cameras doubled, but the backup fatality rate declined by less than a third while backup injuries dropped only 8 percent. "
939,"Perhaps one reason is, as a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put it, “Many drivers are not aware of the limitations” of the technology. The report also found that one in five drivers were just like me — they had become so reliant on the backup aids that they had experienced a collision or near miss while driving other vehicles. "
940,The fact that our brains so easily overdelegate this task to technology makes me worry about the tech industry’s aspirations — the fully autonomous everything. Could technology designed to save us from our lapses in attention actually make us even less attentive?
941,"Uber’s march toward a self-driving car hit a major speed bump last year in Tempe, Ariz., when one of its self-driving Volvos struck and killed a pedestrian. While a lot of focus was on how a vehicle with cameras and radar sensors could completely miss a human being on the road, less has been said about the failure of the most intricately programmed system in the vehicle — the brain of the human in the driver’s seat. "
942,"An investigation revealed that the driver was watching Hulu until the moment of the crash. Because the human brain is impeccable in its ability to filter out extraneous information, this type of behavior should have been predicted. During normal driving, our brains are in a near-constant state of vigilance. But let someone or something do the driving for us and this vigilance easily fades."
943,Something similar seems to have happened with a handful of fatalities involving Tesla’s Autopilot mode. It seems that the drivers made little to no effort to intervene.
944,"The introduction of safety technology has resulted in unintended accidents in other contexts as well. In December 2017, a patient died at a major medical center when a nurse searched for an anti-anxiety medication in an automated dispensing cabinet by typing only its first two letters. She chose the first drug that appeared in the results — Vecuronium, instead of Versed. Vecuronium is a paralytic drug that is sometimes used in executions. When it was administered, the patient’s vitals crashed and she died within days."
945,"Technology seems to have turned against us once again in the deadly crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts. In October, pilots on Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia seem to have struggled against the plane’s supposedly lifesaving technology. Investigators suspect that sensors incorrectly interpreted the plane’s ascent as too steep, causing the plane’s “maneuvering characteristics augmentation system” to kick in. It brought the plane’s nose down, ultimately into the Java Sea at 450 miles per hour. "
946,"Boeing had begun to develop a software fix, but it wasn’t ready in time for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which just this month crashed, possibly because of the same bug, killing all 157 people on board. In these cases, no one can criticize the pilots for failing to pay attention. Still, the crashes were a wake-up call, especially because pilots weren’t required to be trained on the new technology."
947,"Though a supercomputer will always surpass the human brain in terms of pure speed, the brain is beyond complex in its ability to reprioritize salient data inputs from multiple sources. If one input becomes less relevant, our cognitive systems shift their attention to the next most relevant one (which these days is usually our mobile devices)."
948,But there’s one feature available on some cars today that can increase a driver’s vigilance instead of diminishing it — the manual transmission.
949,"A car with a stick shift and clutch pedal requires the use of all four limbs, making it difficult to use a cellphone or eat while driving. Lapses in attention are therefore rare, especially in city driving where a driver might shift gears a hundred times during a trip to the grocery store. "
950,"I’ve owned a stick-shift vehicle for the last 20 years. I bought my first upon graduating from med school — a used 1994 BMW 325i. Years later, my best man wrote “just married” on the back windshield, and the next year my wife and I drove our newborn son home from the hospital in it."
951,"Sadly, sales of manual transmissions are falling, and many automakers, including Audi, are discontinuing the option in the United States. It appears that I’ll have to keep my 2013 S4 model until 2026 if I want to teach my kids to drive a stick."
952,"When I bought that first five-speed BMW, my dad cautioned me about safety, thinking that driving a stick would be more distracting and less safe. He was wrong. Though research on the safety of manual transmissions is scant, one study on the driving performance of teenage boys with A.D.H.D. revealed that cars with manual transmissions resulted in safer, more attentive driving than automatics. This suggests that the cure for our attentional voids might be less technology, not more."

955,Ford Motor Company said on Wednesday that it would build its first autonomous vehicles at a $50 million production center in Michigan as part of an earlier pledge to invest $900 million in manufacturing operations in the state.
956,"Production of the self-driving vehicles is expected to start in 2021, with hybrid vehicles being shipped in to be fitted with driverless technology, the carmaker said. Ford said the work would be done in the Detroit area but did not specify where. Kelli Felker, a spokeswoman for the company, said the hybrids would not be an existing model."
957,"In addition to the autonomous vehicle production center, Ford said it planned to expand its production capacity at an existing plant in Flat Rock, Mich., where it will continue to make its Mustang car. The company said it intended to invest more than $850 million in the Flat Rock factory and start production on new electric vehicle models there by 2023."
958,"The effort will create 900 new jobs in the next few years, the vast majority of them at the Flat Rock plant, the company said."
959,"Ford’s intentions for its Detroit-area factories have fluctuated in recent years. In early 2017, the company said it was abandoning plans for a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico and would instead invest $700 million and add 700 jobs at the Flat Rock plant for the production of electric and hybrid vehicles."
960,"Later that year, the company appeared to backtrack, saying that it would take advantage of lower labor costs in Mexico and make a new battery-powered sport utility vehicle in Cuautitlán in 2020, a goal it reiterated on Wednesday. The Mexican facility is Ford’s first electric vehicle factory; the Flat Rock location will be its second."
961,"Last year, 361,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles were sold in the United States, making up just 2 percent of car purchases, according to estimates by InsideEVs.com. Tesla accounted for half of the tally."
962,"Ford has said it plans to invest $11.1 billion over all in electrification, with 16 battery electric vehicle models by 2022 and 24 hybrid options by 2022."
963,"Earlier this year, Ford and Volkswagen laid out an agreement under which they said they would cut costs by cooperating on the development of electric and autonomous cars."
964,"President Trump spent several days on Twitter this week admonishing Ford’s rival General Motors to reopen an idled car factory in Lordstown, Ohio."
965,Ford said Mr. Trump’s comments had not influenced the timing of its announcement.
966,"“What we do is a result of our business,” Ms. Felker said. “The reason we’re doing it now is because we have to tell our suppliers.”"
967,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion, as the ride-hailing company prepares to go public, according to four people with knowledge of the matter."
968,"The talks are still underway and may not result in an investment, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apart from SoftBank, the investor consortium includes an automaker, they added."
969,"Under the terms of the proposed deal, investors would purchase from a pool of Uber stock specifically earmarked for the self-driving technologies unit. Uber would maintain majority control of the self-driving arm and would use the investment to fund its research and development. The deal would value the self-driving business at $5 billion to $10 billion, the people said."
970,"Uber filed confidentially to go public in December in what would be one of the largest tech initial public offerings of recent years. The company, based in San Francisco, could hit a valuation of $120 billion when it reaches the stock market."
971,But Uber is under scrutiny for its losses — its net loss was $842 million in the fourth quarter — and self-driving technologies are expensive. A $1 billion infusion could ease worries about how costly it is to develop autonomous cars.
972,The proposed investment was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.
973,"Uber has for years invested heavily in self-driving cars, which it has said will eventually become a primary mode of transportation, replacing its human drivers. But its autonomous unit, formed in 2014, loses between $100 million and $200 million each quarter. Its fleet of vehicles was also grounded for nine months last year after one of the autonomous cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. In the past, Uber has considered spinning off the unit as a separate entity."
974,"Uber Freight, the company’s long-haul trucking business, also has a separate valuation based on pools of equity specifically earmarked for the unit. As part of an agreement with employees, the company rewarded them with equity in Uber Freight as a stand-alone business late last year."
975,"SoftBank is already a major investor in Uber after it acquired about 17.5 percent of the ride-hailing firm’s stock last year at a significant discount. In addition to Uber, SoftBank has poured money into ride-hailing companies such as Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia."
976,"SoftBank has also invested in businesses focused on autonomous vehicles. In mid-2018, the firm invested $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, a division of General Motors. Structuring Cruise as a separate entity made it possible for General Motors to isolate the losses from its autonomous division."
977,"In August, Toyota invested $500 million in Uber. The move was meant to let Uber put its self-driving technology in Toyota vehicles."
978,"“Toyota constantly reviews and considers various options for investment, but we do not have anything to announce about a further investment in Uber at this time,” a Toyota spokeswoman said on Wednesday."
979,"For millions of Americans who don’t have credit cards, renting a car is a hassle."
980,"While most major car rental companies allow customers to use debit cards, those customers typically must jump through hoops, like submitting to a credit check and providing proof of a return ticket when renting at airports."
981,"Now, Dollar Car Rental is easing or eliminating most of those extra requirements in a bid to be friendlier to budget-conscious families and young adults who may not qualify for credit cards or simply prefer debit cards. The change, which also affects Dollar’s sister company, Thrifty Car Rental, is starting as consumers are making travel plans for spring break season."
982,"Rental car companies have long considered credit cards less risky than traditional debit cards, which are linked to a checking account and therefore offer many people less liquidity than a credit card’s line of credit, said Neil Abrams, a consultant to the car rental industry."
983,"But as competition increases, including from ride-sharing services, Dollar appears to be trying to please its “more value-conscious” customers, Mr. Abrams said. “Most likely they’re looking to gain market share,” he said of the new policy."
984,"Susan Jacobs, senior vice president and global brand leader at Dollar, said improved data analysis suggested that the use of a debit card didn’t necessarily correlate with higher risk and that restrictions on debit renters were overly strict."
985,"“There’s no need to create such a bad customer experience,” Ms. Jacobs said, noting that it can be stressful for customers to provide multiple forms of identification and other documents while waiting at the rental counter."
986,"“It’s industry leading, and we’re really proud of that,” she said of the new policy."
987,"The company will no longer check renters’ credit when they’re using a debit card. Previously, customers needed a credit score of 660 or higher to reserve with a debit card, which meant many renters wouldn’t qualify, the company said. Dollar cited Federal Reserve data from 2017, which found that half of adults 50 and younger have credit scores below 660."
988,"Also, the money deducted as a temporary “hold” against incidental costs — meaning that the funds aren’t available to the customer during the rental — has been reduced to $200, the same hold used on credit cards, from $350. (The funds are in addition to the charge for the estimated cost of the total rental.)"
989,"That may still be a concern for many people, said Ted Rossman, industry analyst at CreditCards.com. A hold on your credit card is less of a problem than having $200 removed temporarily from your checking account. When renting with a debit card, he said, consumers should make sure they have adequate funds in their bank account to cover the extra hold and avoid overdraft fees."
990,"Dollar is also lowering the age restriction on debit card rentals, to 20 from 25, to match the requirement in place for renting with a credit card."
991,"Some debit card restrictions remain, however. The company will still require proof of return travel plans and two forms of identification for rentals booked with a debit card less than 24 hours in advance, and for rentals of luxury automobiles."
992,"Dollar’s parent company, Hertz, isn’t planning to adopt the new rules, a spokeswoman said. Hertz’s customer base includes many business travelers paying with corporate credit cards rather than debit cards."
993,"It’s unclear whether other big-name companies will follow suit. Avis didn’t respond to a request for comment. Enterprise emailed a copy of its debit card policy, which includes restrictions that vary depending on whether the car is rented at an airport or off site."
994,Here are some questions and answers about using debit cards to rent cars:
995,Will all Dollar and Thrifty locations accept debit cards?
996,"All corporately owned locations will, but franchise locations, which are independently owned, may not. Most airport locations are corporate owned, the company said, and it planned to provide a list of noncorporate locations on its website “in the next few days.” To verify a location’s policy, customers can call the location or the company’s customer care line."
997,Are there advantages to using a credit card to rent a car?
998,"Yes. Some people avoid credit cards because of the temptation to run up debt. But credit cards often come with useful perks, Mr. Rossman said, like allowing customers to accrue points or rewards and offering auto insurance coverage."
999,"Credit cards also offer users the right to withhold payment while disputing charges and provide stronger protections against fraudulent charges, said Christopher L. Peterson, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America. So while credit cards must be used cautiously, they can often be a smart choice."
1000,"“When I rent a car,” Mr. Peterson said, “I use a credit card.”"
1001,Does the new Dollar policy include prepaid debit cards?
1002,"Dollar accepts traditional Visa, Mastercard and Discover debit cards linked to bank checking accounts, but not prepaid debit cards, which work a bit differently, the company said."
1003,"They’re classic cars fit for a concours d’elegance, a royal wedding or simply a quiet drive down a country lane. They exude vintage elegance, but lifting the hood reveals they’re fueled by electricity, not gasoline."
1004,"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle quietly sped off in a 1968 E-type Jaguar after their 2018 wedding, they made automotive history. Although completely “stock” in appearance, beneath their roadster’s sleek, opalescent blue bonnet throbbed a heart measured in kilowatts. Indeed, the royal honeymoon coach was believed to be the first classic sports car converted to electric power by a major automaker."
1005,"“In the collector world, this is a very exciting development,” said McKeel Hagerty, whose namesake firm in Traverse City, Mich., sells vintage-auto insurance, tracks classic car values and conducts driver-owner surveys."
1006,"Shortly before year’s end, another venerable British marque joined the trend, the newcomer being Aston Martin, the century-old automaker. (In October, Morgan Motor Company of England postponed plans to introduce an electrified version of its iconic three-wheeler.)"
1007,"Aston Martin unveiled a reversible “cassette” system meant to offer owners the best of all worlds. Installed directly on the original engine and gearbox mountings, the zero-emissions EV powertrain is enclosed within its own self-contained cell or “cassette.” If an owner wishes to compete in classic car shows or sanctioned motor sports events, the original engine and transmission can be reinstalled in about a week’s shop time, says Paul Spires, president of Aston Martin Works."
1008,"“We want to give our heritage cars greater longevity,” said Mr. Spires, president of Aston Martin Works. “We’d hate for them all to just wind up gathering dust in museums, where no one can actually enjoy a classic Aston on the road.” A secondary goal: staying ahead of global environmental “regulatory and social pressures,” especially as they relate to automobile use in and around urban centers."
1009,"As with Jaguar’s “Concept Zero” E-Type, the only external clue to the car’s true power source is a glowing digital screen nestled in its dashboard."
1010,Both Aston and Jaguar say their electric cars offer handling and performance that’s on a par with the originals. That works out to top speeds of roughly 120 miles per hour and modern-day-matching 0-to-60 acceleration times.
1011,"Wrote Car and Driver magazine of its August 2018 test drive in the Jag: “It handles rougher surfaces well and, despite some enthusiastic throttle applications, never felt short of traction.” The review was headlined: “Battery Power Doesn’t Ruin the Jaguar E-Type.”"
1012,"Mr. Spires said a ride in Aston’s converted 1970 DB6 MKII Volante — successor to James Bond’s famous DB5 — conveys “an incredible sense of well-being.” It may not deliver the same soul-satisfying sounds and smells as a half-century-old original, he acknowledged, but silently cruising through winding country lanes in a vintage top-down roadster offers its own rewards."
1013,"“We expect sophisticated global buyers, especially those who consider themselves socially and environmentally aware, to think more of Aston Martin,” Mr. Spires said. “This adds credibility to our value as a brand.”"
1014,"To be sure, electric automobiles are nothing new. Ferdinand Porsche unveiled the first hybrid-powered auto in 1900. Thousands of early electric cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses were built in the United States by firms like the Electric Vehicle Company. The hybrid Owen Magnetic a century ago, for example, used a gasoline motor to run its generator, a setup reminiscent of today’s Chevrolet Volt."
1015,"Still, might not the Jaguar-Aston offerings rankle some purists as, well, heretical? “On the contrary,” Mr. Hagerty said, “it bodes well for the collector hobby.” Last year, for the first time, his firm recorded more requests for vintage-auto insurance quotes and greater usage of its valuation tools by Generation Xers and millennials than by baby boomers, he said."
1016,"Something of a purist himself — he still drives the 1967 Porsche he restored with his father at the age of 13 — Mr. Hagerty added, “If this gives someone a reason to buy a vintage car for the first time, it’s awesome.”"
1017,"Even so, electric-minded collectors should brace for some sticker shock. Jaguar estimates something “in the region” of 300,000 pounds (a bit over $380,000) for a fully restored E-type Zero, and then about £60,000 (over $75,000) for a conversion."
1018,"The company, based in Coventry, England, says it has already taken deposits on deliveries expected to commence in the summer of 2020. Jaguar is working to bring street-legal versions to the United States, says Mike Goodbun, a spokesman for Jaguar Classic, a division of Jaguar Land Rover dedicated to preserving the firm’s heritage. Build slots are filling up fast, he said."
1019,"While Jaguar is moving ahead with restored and converted E-types, Mr. Spires says, his firm will offer conversions — and reversals — of the rarer Aston models at its Newport Pagnell facilities in Buckinghamshire. As at Jaguar, prospective clients “have already raised their hands,” he says."
1020,"Would a converted — or rather a reconverted — classic really be welcome at ultra-choosy events like the annual Pebble Beach Concours d’Elegance in Carmel, Calif.? “It depends on how seamless it is,” says Martin Button, a member of the show’s selection committee and owner of Cosdel International, which transports and stores vintage cars."
1021,"“If the reversion process really removes all evidence of the changes, it would probably be judged like any other car,” Mr. Button said. “But if it’s still got some little screen on the dash, that’s another matter — that would be a real takeaway.”"
1022,"Chances are those glowing controls won’t pose an insurmountable problem, at least for the Jags, said Bruce Trenery, an E-type owner. “The original instrument panels come out with a few thumb screws,” he says, “so swapping out a digital screen shouldn’t be that big a deal.”"
1023,"On the other hand, the economics of vintage cars could present a higher hurdle. Even a perfectly restored Series 1 roadster, with covered headlights and dashboard toggle switches, “is a $250,000 car,” says Mr. Trenery, whose company, Fantasy Junction in Emeryville, Calif., has bought and sold collector vehicles for over four decades. “A nearly $80,000 conversion fee would represent almost a third of its value.” For less valuable American sports cars like most Corvettes and Mustangs, such conversions would seem even more impractical, at least for now."
1024,"Mr. Button also frets about the usable range of electrified sports cars. “Spirited driving can really gobble juice,” he says, remembering an experience in a Tesla Roadster. With a reputed range of well over 100 miles, the Tesla ran dry at less than 50, he says."
1025,"Despite such reservations, Mr. Trenery and Mr. Button see a path to the future in the British automakers’ announcements. The Jaguar XKE “isn’t just a beautiful car, it’s a milestone design that’s going to live on,” Mr. Trenery said. “If you want to enjoy it in congested areas — and you have the financial means — electrification could make sense.”"
1026,"Mr. Button thinks such conversions might someday “inoculate” older classics like Duesenbergs and Packards against tightening regulations. “But it won’t happen overnight,” he added. In the United States at least, lower fuel prices and relaxed mileage requirements mean “we’re still a long way from not being able to drive our classic cars,” he said."
1027,"In any case, Mr. Button, an avid vintage car collector in his own right, probably won’t be an early customer. “I’m an engineer,” he said. “I like pistons and valves and mechanical old stuff. I even like the smell of gasoline.”"
1028,"On good days, it’s a concert hall, a news source or a way to entertain the kids. On bad ones, it’s a cranked-to-11 therapy session to the loudest tracks on your Spotify playlist."
1029,"Factory audio systems in cars were once, at best, an AM-FM radio with a cassette player and a couple of speakers crammed into leftover dashboard space. A turning point came in 1982, when Bose tuned a system to the acoustics inside a 1983 Cadillac Seville. This audio revolution heard around the world featured four speakers. Four."
1030,"Today, solid midpriced systems pack a dozen. The best are so immersive, your next automobile decision might come down to how well the car stereo rocks your favorite Alabama Shakes song."
1031,"Chances are a team larger than the Count Basie Orchestra designed the stereo in your car. “It’s definitely a challenge to put a good sound system into a vehicle,” said Chris Ludwig, vice president of Harman Lifestyle Automotive, whose audio and infotainment systems are in tens of millions of cars."
1032,"“We sit down with the manufacturer and find out if the target is best-in-class or affordability, then go forward,” Mr. Ludwig said. “And it’s not just cost and sound quality. It’s about dimensions, aesthetics and weight. Automakers want to shave off every gram.”"
1033,"To grasp the heroics of your car’s system, consider the home setup. Traditionally good ones have an amp, a tuner, a CD player and a turntable for vinyl aficionados. Decent speakers can be two feet high with heavy ferrite magnet drivers hidden by gossamer cloth grilles. My living room system with a subwoofer satellite speaker setup weighs 45 pounds. It remains dry and temperature-controlled (unless my furnace conks out again). Other than an earthquake and the bass produced by “Another One Bites the Dust,” it has seen no vibration."
1034,"Now reflect on car electronics. They’re jammed into small spaces. Door speakers endure thousands of slams and pothole shock. Grilles protect from shoes and elbows yet remain acoustically neutral. For lightness, car speakers use neodymium drivers. Components need to survive North Pole and Death Valley conditions, for the life of the car."
1035,"To commemorate its first car audio system, Bose tracked down a 30-year-old Seville. Its audio system still worked."
1036,"Ultimately, systems need to be light and small but big on entertainment. The average sound system weighs under 10 pounds, Mr. Ludwig said, with “the ones in hybrids and electric cars weighing around five pounds.”"
1037,"Even the most luxurious car cabin is a torture chamber for sound systems. John Pelliccio, head of product communications at Bose, said its components “are subjected to ‘salt fog’ to ensure they won’t corrode in coastal regions and Northern areas where salt is used to keep streets ice free.”"
1038,"The testing is just getting started. “We have temperature chambers that rapidly cycle between minus-40 and 176 degrees Fahrenheit to ensure solder joints don’t fail during extreme temperature swings when heating frozen interiors in Alaskan winters or cooling them in Arizona heat,” Mr. Pelliccio said. “They must be fairly waterproof, too — door speakers get rained and splashed on.”"
1039,"Anything audio companies can do to make installation easier on the assembly line saves money, too; Bose devised a “one screw” method to securely install speakers. And poor-quality components mean the expense of warranty replacement. Mr. Pelliccio claims a failure rate of three parts per million, and said Bose’s total annual defective components fit in a wheelbarrow."
1040,"While the carmakers and the audio teams must battle over environment, budget, weight and space, owners simply want their vehicle to sound as if Ariana Grande were riding shotgun."
1041,"Typically, an automotive sound system is the best one people own. Audio engineers look at the car cabin both as a wonderfully controlled space to acoustically tune and a nightmare of reflective surfaces, absorptive materials and constantly changing exterior sounds that obliterate fidelity."
1042,"Mark Ziemba, audio systems manager at Panasonic Automotive, acknowledged that “the sound stage in a car isn’t optimal.”"
1043,"“The driver sits to one side with one ear six inches away from reflective glass, while the other is left open against upholstery,” Mr. Ziemba said. “And every vehicle is different, so they have to be tuned accordingly.”"
1044,"Because of psychoacoustics, ears don’t easily locate the sources of bass frequencies, so subwoofers can be tucked into the cargo area. The rear seat-back material can act as a filter to eliminate distortion. Cloth seats absorb treble. Leather reflects it."
1045,"Some cars, like Honda’s Pilot, offer a choice of upholstery. While developing the electronics for the Pilot, Mr. Ziemba’s team produced two software profiles to optimize the sound for each cabin. On Honda’s assembly line, the units are coded for fabric or cowhide."
1046,"At Acura, the sound profile for the standard MDX and RLX is different from the hybrid versions, since the hybrid powertrain, heavier and stiffer, changes the interior’s tonal quality."
1047,"Mr. Ziemba and Elliot Scheiner, a Grammy-winning producer, teamed up 17 years ago to improve audiophile systems. Mr. Scheiner, who has produced albums for Steely Dan, Sting and Foo Fighters, grew frustrated after listening to studio mixes in automobiles."
1048,"The latest system to bear his initials, the ELS Studio 3D available in the 2019 Acura RDX crossover, uses slim roof-mounted drivers to anchor vocals, bass, drums, brass and guitar to a sound field that’s not just left and right but front, side and rear. It’s so precisely tuned there’s a separate version of the software for RDXs with a “head up” instrument display to compensate for the windshield coating and dashboard projector."
1049,"The ELS Studio 3D, along with the 34-speaker Bose Panaray in Cadillac’s CT6 and the Bang & Olufsen 3D Advanced Sound System in Audi’s Q7, has caused me to linger in the driveway for hours. The optional Mark Levinson Reference Surround audio in a Lexus LC sounds like a $100,000 home system. The whole car costs $4,000 less than that."
1050,"Automakers provide audio companies preproduction interior prototypes to tune the sound. The grille material and hole pattern make a difference: Metal is more acoustically transparent than plastic. Designers in both camps haggle over placement and aesthetics. In the past, automakers preferred resin grilles because they can blend into the interior. Aluminum with laser-drilled holes is becoming more popular. The metal confers a status symbol appearance."
1051,"Automakers find that a premium logo affixed to speaker grilles helps to sell a car. Fiat Chrysler licenses Beats Audio to appeal to younger shoppers, though it’s not clear who manufactures it. For example, Harman makes JBL, Harman Kardon, Infinity, Mark Levinson, Revel and Lexicon. It licenses Bang & Olufsen and Bowers & Wilkins for the car. Panasonic produces ELS, Fender and Blue Note."
1052,It’s not simply branding. Engineers strive to recreate a company’s signature sound in the automobile.
1053,"“The Bose sound is something our customers actively want, and we deliver the same quality whether it’s home, headphone or car audio,” Mr. Pelliccio said."
1054,"The systems go beyond music. Think of all the warning tones and navigation alerts chirping through the speakers. Most systems are smart enough to ramp the music volume down while delivering some messages. (Usually during the song’s best part, right?) Multiple source inputs and Bluetooth support are essential."
1055,"Some systems even work like noise-cancellation headphones, on a bigger scale. Microphones sample the road noise and then pump a reverse waveform into the cabin. That helps eliminate heavy sound insulation, adding to fuel efficiency."
1056,"To give small modern turbocharged engines a large pleasing throat, similar electronics reduce dissonant drivetrain notes and augment pleasing major tones through the speakers. All this happens while you endure another NPR pledge drive."
1057,"Not only are cars and trucks getting more reliable, but everyman vehicles over all are now more dependable than luxury brands. That’s according to the 2019 J. D. Power Vehicle Dependability Study, which looks at how well 2016 models have held up."
1058,"Lexus was first, followed by a tie between Porsche and Toyota, with Chevrolet taking fourth. Buick, Mini, BMW, Audi, Hyundai and Kia rounded out the top 10."
1059,"“The industry continues to make more and more reliable vehicles despite putting more and more technology on those vehicles,” said David Sargent, a J. D. Power vice president."
1060,That doesn’t mean perfection has been achieved.
1061,"Owners complained about a wide variety of problems, including batteries that fail, wind noise, transmissions that shift oddly and things that just break, Mr. Sargent said in an interview. While they may upset owners, these issues are not likely to leave them stranded, he said."
1062,"J. D. Power, which sells automakers the right to advertise good ratings from its research, has conducted the Vehicle Dependability Study for 30 years. For 2019, almost 33,000 owners of 31 brands were asked about problems in eight major categories, including engine, transmission, controls, entertainment and navigation."
1063,"The vehicles and automakers are ranked on the number of problems for every 100 vehicles, with lower numbers being better. The industry average this year was 136 problems per 100 vehicles. That’s down from 142 in 2018 and 156 in 2017."
1064,"When J. D. Power combined the scores of “mass market brands,” it came up with an average of 135 problems per 100 vehicles. That compared with 141 for the luxury marques, which weren’t helped by Volvo (204) and Land Rover (221). They took the 29th and 30th spots. Fiat (249) was ranked last."
1065,"A Land Rover spokesman said the automaker had problems with its infotainment system and was correcting those. A Fiat spokesman said the automaker expected to move up as a result of a quality improvement program. A Volvo spokesman did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Sargent said that Volvo had just introduced its new 2016 XC90 and that it was not unusual for new models to have problems."
1066,"The difference isn’t just that luxury owners are more likely to complain because they spent more money. That’s always been the case, yet this is the first time the mass-market brands came out ahead, Mr. Sargent said."
1067,"The major reason comes down to infotainment systems, with features like navigation, voice recognition and the ability to link a smartphone, Mr. Sargent said. It amounts to a triumph of the simple."
1068,"On mass-market cars and trucks, the systems are less complicated. Consequently, they are easier to operate, work better and are less likely to frustrate their owners. Luxury automakers’ efforts to dazzle and amaze may instead confuse and annoy."
1069,"“Complex, infuriating systems have a much, much greater impact,” Mr. Sargent said."
1070,"Another factor is an improvement in good, old-fashioned engineering. “The mass-market manufacturers have gotten a lot better at fundamental reliability, the absence of things going wrong, wearing out, falling off,” he said."
1071,"While the luxury automakers as a group faltered, some brands triumphed. It’s the eighth consecutive year at the top for Lexus, with 106 problems per 100 vehicles. Porsche followed at 108, along with Toyota."
1072,"For the first time, Porsche and the other German brands were all better than the industry average. BMW was seventh, Audi eighth, Volkswagen 12th and Mercedes-Benz 13th."
1073,"One shift during the past decade is that Japanese automakers no longer dominate. A decade ago, five of the top 10 were Japanese. This year, only Toyota and Lexus, its luxury brand, were in the top 10."
1074,Mr. Sargent said that reflected fierce industry competition — and how some officials who had worked for Japanese automakers moved to help competitors.
1075,"Honda, once a regular in the top 10, is 18th — four spots below the average. The 2019 study looked at 2016 models — the year Honda introduced a new Civic and Pilot."
1076,"Going back at least a decade, cars have been targeted by hackers, some who ended up working with the industry, others acting maliciously. But vehicles now carry far more electronic equipment, and autonomous driving, relying on sensors, cameras and radar, is on the horizon, with all kinds of ripe new targets."
1077,"Concern that cars could be seriously hacked — by criminals, terrorists or even rogue governments — has prompted a new round of security efforts on the part of the auto industry."
1078,"As far back as 2010, a disgruntled former employee at Texas Auto Center in Austin used a co-worker’s account to log into company software used for car repossession. He disabled over 100 cars, and owners who were up to date on their payments suddenly found their vehicles honking furiously, and unable to start."
1079,"In 2015, a veteran hacker named Samy Kamkar built a device for under $100 that he said could find, unlock and remotely start any General Motors car equipped with the OnStar communications system. Luckily, Mr. Kamkar was acting as a “white hat,” and not selling his OwnStar device to unscrupulous hackers."
1080,"“I worked with G.M. to resolve that issue,” he said, and that particular vulnerability is gone. “Cars are getting more secure, but it’s a long cycle to get the necessary new software and hardware installed.”"
1081,"Dan Flores, a G.M. cybersecurity and safety spokesman, confirmed the collaboration with Mr. Kamkar. “We recognize the importance of the work that researchers, like Samy, do to help advance the work in this area,” he said in an email."
1082,"Securing cars is a big challenge, which is why some companies that traditionally prefer to go it alone have teamed up to share best practices."
1083,"Digital threats to self-driving cars, according to a 2018 University of Michigan report, “include hackers who would try to take control over or shut down a vehicle, criminals who could try to ransom a vehicle or its passengers and thieves who would direct a self-driving car to relocate itself to the local chop-shop.”"
1084,"The average car has over 150 million lines of computer code, and some have even more than a Boeing 787, according to a 2018 KPMG report. That complexity, the report said, “creates a real risk of cyberattack — a risk we fear many companies in the automotive industry may be underestimating.”"
1085,"That view is widespread. “From my perspective, automakers were a little surprised and caught off guard by this threat,” said Doug Newcomb, a senior industry analyst at Wards Intelligence. “They added all this connectivity, but got ahead of themselves and don’t always think of the vulnerabilities that exist. It’s an ongoing issue, not a fix-it-and-forget-it thing.”"
1086,"Failing to protect consumers can be costly, said Steve Tengler, a principal at the consulting company Kugler Maag Cie who has worked at Ford, Nissan and G.M., and was a senior director of connected vehicle cybersecurity at Honeywell."
1087,"Automakers are legally bound to provide state-of-the-art protection for their cars, Mr. Tengler said. “Legal precedents show that it’s not enough to provide a product that is kind of safe,” he said. “Companies don’t have to put themselves out of business to provide the safest technology, but they do have to work within their commercial ability.”"
1088,"Mr. Tengler said the industry was a frequent target. “Every automaker has been hacked — every one of them,” he said. “Attacks aren’t a matter of if, but when and how.”"
1089,"Once a car is out of warranty, automakers are used to cutting or at least loosening their ties. But hacking issues mean that protection will most likely require factory-to-junkyard monitoring."
1090,"In 2015, Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million cars and trucks after Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller demonstrated, in a Wired magazine article, that they could remotely control a Jeep Cherokee’s brakes, radio, wipers and other functions by gaining access through its UConnect infotainment system."
1091,The company declined to comment on any subsequent security changes.
1092,"Dr. André Weimerskirch, vice president for cybersecurity and functional safety at Lear Corporation, said that automakers had made “huge improvements” in recent years, and that joint efforts involving the industry, academia and standards organizations had also led to gains."
1093,"Most car hackers have been wearing those white hats, with no criminal intent, but imagining what could happen led to the 2015 formation of the Automotive Information Sharing and Analysis Center, known as Auto-ISAC. Most of the world’s automakers are members."
1094,"Faye Francy, the center’s executive director, described the Jeep episode as “a good wake-up call for the industry.”"
1095,"“The hackers are smart guys, very educated,” she said. “It’s not simple to do what they did. We’re fortunate that there hasn’t been another breach, but it’s not impossible.”"
1096,"Not impossible, but still difficult. Ron Plesco, a principal at KPMG Cyber Security Services, agrees that hacking into a car’s driver controls requires “a lot of knowledge and effort.”"
1097,"“It’s not as easy as Hollywood claims it is,” he said."
1098,"That’s one reason we haven’t seen more major attacks. But Mr. Plesco argues that today there isn’t much incentive for thieves, since the identity information stored onboard vehicles is fairly limited."
1099,"“But,” he added, “that’s about to change as we do more purchasing through the dashboard of the car. The automobile is becoming another computer that can be hacked.”"
1100,"New infotainment and autonomous features are important selling points, but because most consumers assume their cars are safe, automakers tend to keep cybersecurity news in the background. Much is happening behind the curtain, however. Some private security firms say they are signing on with major automakers to provide expert protection."
1101,"“There are multiple ways for hackers to get in, and it’s the job of the whole industry to defend against it,” said Dan Sahar, a vice president at Upstream Security in Israel. “Just one hack can cost a manufacturer tens of millions of dollars, and that doesn’t include the brand damage. And the threat is getting more serious.”"
1102,"According to Mr. Sahar, “2018 saw more than 60 documented automotive-related cybersecurity incidents, a sixfold increase in just four years.”"
1103,"Upstream is working with “a handful” of manufacturers, Mr. Sahar said. “Automakers are focused on cybersecurity, but few say they can do it on their own,” he said."
1104,A 2019 Upstream report extrapolates a cost topping $1.1 billion for a breach that requires a large recall. The opportunity will certainly be there for criminal hackers. Juniper Research of Britain estimated in a 2018 report that by 2023 some 775 million cars would be connected to the web in some way (up from 330 million in 2018).
1105,"Mr. Tengler, of Kugler Maag Cie, said it was easy to picture the danger that hackers posed to autonomous vehicles — potentially redirecting them as part of a theft. But the Jeep hack proved “it doesn’t matter if someone is driving,” he said. “If they can take control of the car, the vulnerable technology is already there.”"
1106,"Thieves have stolen cars by using fairly simple electronic technology, some of it freely available. A device that amplifies the signals from a car’s remote can be used to unlock the target vehicle’s doors. Mr. Kamkar said he had built such devices from off-the-shelf components for approximately $50."
1107,"“It’s a lot simpler than people think,” he said."
1108,"Other devices include a radio transmitter that cycles through huge numbers of possible combinations until they “crack” the target car’s key fob. In 2006, that was reportedly how the soccer star David Beckham’s armor-plated BMW X5 was stolen in Madrid. A second X5 belonging to Mr. Beckham was also stolen."
1109,"“Car thieves used to have crowbars; now they use laptops,” said Mr. Plesco at KPMG."
1110,"Jono Anderson, also a principal at KPMG, said the auto industry needed to learn from aerospace."
1111,"“They’re very familiar with this kind of security,” Mr. Anderson said, “but it’s new to the auto industry. Maybe it’s possible to hack the entertainment system in a plane and get free movies, but it’s virtually impossible to hack the actual communications.”"
1112,"A 7-year-old who was riding in a car with her mother and three sisters was killed in Texas over the weekend, the authorities said, when a gunman in a pickup truck suddenly pulled up alongside them and opened fire."
1113,"The authorities, who said the shooting appeared random and unprovoked, were searching Monday for her killer."
1114,"The 7-year-old, Jazmine Barnes, was a second grader at a Houston-area elementary school, and her death — in the family’s car, early one morning over the holidays — unnerved and perplexed her community."
1115,"“It’s New Year’s Eve,” Sheriff Ed Gonzalez of Harris County said in an interview on Monday. “It should be a time of fellowship and celebration for many — but not for this family. They have to bury a child.”"
1116,"Jazmine was riding with her mother and sisters, a 6-year-old and two teenagers, near Houston when they were attacked in a “random and senseless” shooting about 7 a.m. Sunday, Sheriff Gonzalez said."
1117,"Jazmine’s mother, LaPorsha Washington, 30, told ABC13 that she and her family had been on a trip to get coffee when a man in a truck opened fire."
1118,"“The truck slowed down and continued to fire as he was in front of us,” Ms. Washington, who was injured in the shooting, told the television station from a hospital bed. “It was not fair. It was not fair. He intentionally killed my child for no reason. He didn’t even know her.”"
1119,"After the shooting, she said, one of her other daughters realized that Jazmine had been struck."
1120,"“She said: ‘Momma, Jazmine’s not moving. She’s not talking,’” Ms. Washington recalled. “I turned around and my 7-year-old was shot in the head.”"
1121,"Jazmine was pronounced dead at the scene, the sheriff said. Ms. Washington was shot in the arm and her 6-year-old daughter suffered injuries from broken glass, the authorities said."
1122,"The authorities described the gunman as a white man in his 40s with a beard, wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt and driving a red pickup truck."
1123,The image of a white man suddenly firing on a black family raised questions about whether the shooting had been racially motivated. Sheriff Gonzalez said the authorities had not established a motive and could not discount the possibility of a hate crime.
1124,"“We’re not ruling anything out and we’re not going to speculate,” he said."
1125,His office has released a grainy image of a red pickup truck and is asking for the public’s help to find the gunman.
1126,"At a news conference on Monday, Jazmine’s father, Chris Cevilla, said Jazmine had been doing well in school and was a “sweet” and “innocent” young girl. He begged anyone with knowledge of what happened to “step up as if it were your own.”"
1127,"“I’m asking, from the bottom of my heart,” he said. “Whoever knows anything, please step up at this point in time and help me and my family get justice for my baby girl.”"
1128,"Born in Biella, a mountainous province in northern Italy known for its fine wool, Alessandro Sartori grew up just a few miles from the fabric mill where, half a century earlier, Ermenegildo Zegna — the Italian luxury house of which Sartori is now artistic director — got its start. His father designed mechanical looms, while his mother ran a tailoring shop. “I remember being just 3 or 4 and watching in awe as she altered wedding dresses and winter coats,” he says. “Being surrounded by sketches and patterns and fittings has always felt like my most natural habitat.” As a teenager in the late ’80s, he studied textile engineering and joined Zegna soon after, working first as a product designer and later as the director of the brand’s sporty Z Zegna diffusion line. Following a hiatus at Berluti, he returned to the fourth-generation family-owned company in 2016 in his current role and began deconstructing the rigid, traditional dress codes to which it had long adhered."
1129,"“The new generation doesn’t want the same old stiff suit their father wore; they want a totally personalized silhouette,” says the designer, 52. “Nowadays, you mostly see formal suiting at funerals and in court.” Instead, Sartori champions technical rigor — he’s pioneered high-performance materials including crease-free and machine-washable wools — and the concept of an infinitely modular wardrobe. As he sees it, his ultralightweight anoraks, leather-mesh sweatshirts and utilitarian bombers can just as easily be paired with high-waisted double-pleat trousers as with track pants that cleverly unzip into shorts; he also makes topcoats and button-downs with interchangeable collars and detachable French cuffs. “In an era that’s embracing the Silicon Valley hoodie-and-sneaker office look, men’s wear needs to be malleable,” he says, adding, “a heritage brand may as well be declared dead the moment it stops evolving.” "

It was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer in 1968, which happens to be the year Zegna launched ready-to-wear, and was a fitting setting because Niemeyer’s work was one of the main inspirations for the collection. I thought a lot about how he created contrasts between outdoor and indoor spaces.”"

1167,"General Motors is moving to widen its lineup of electric cars, and adding jobs in the process."
1168,"The automaker said Friday that it would begin producing a new electric vehicle as part of its Chevrolet lineup, resulting in the addition of 400 jobs at its plant in Orion Township, Mich."
1169,"The vehicle will share some characteristics with the all-electric Chevrolet Bolt EV, a small wagon that is already produced at the Orion factory, the company said in a statement. The addition of the vehicle will be accompanied by an investment in the plant of about $300 million. The company did not offer any other details about the new vehicle."
1170,"G.M. has said since 2017 that it planned to substantially expand its lineup of all-electric cars. The push comes as other carmakers, including Hyundai and Audi, prepare to unveil new plug-in hybrids and fully electric models in a bet that car owners are ready to switch from gasoline-powered vehicles."
1171,"“It’s an ongoing story of just trying to get realigned with where they see the business going in the future,” said Jeff Windau, an equity analyst at Edward Jones. “This is a capital-intensive business, and it takes time for the investments to be made and for the products to start being manufactured.”"
1172,"In an appearance on CNBC, G.M.’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said it would take one or two years for the new vehicle to reach the market."
1173,Competition in the electric-vehicle market is increasing. Ford announced this week that it would invest $900 million in Michigan to increase production of autonomous and electric cars in the coming years.
1174,"Both G.M. and Ford seem to be trying to chip away at Tesla’s hold on the electric vehicle market. Even as Elon Musk’s company expands its fleet, its sales seem to be slowing. A federal tax credit for electric vehicles was recently reduced for Tesla buyers after the company reached a sales threshold, but customers buying electric vehicles from other automakers still qualify for the higher reimbursement."
1175,"G.M. announced its new vehicle several days after President Trump criticized the automaker on Twitter over its decision to end production at a factory in Lordstown, Ohio. The plant is one of five in North America that the company said in November it would idle as part of a broader effort to cut costs."
1176,"G.M. said Friday that it had around 2,700 job openings at its factories and that it was trying to fill the vacancies with employees affected by the shutdowns at Lordstown and elsewhere. The company said 1,100 employees from idled plants had already been placed at other factories."
1177,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Just before Thanksgiving, Ken Westerman came close to buying his first fully electric car, a Tesla Model 3."
1178,"A retired music teacher with an interest in protecting the environment, Mr. Westerman was looking to replace the hybrid car he had been driving for years, a red Toyota Prius, and test-drove a Model 3. He was dazzled by the car but concluded that the limits of its range — 300 miles on a single charge — would complicate his regular trips from Ann Arbor to the East Coast and Arkansas."
1179,"“Those are six- to eight-hour trips, and if you have to stop to charge up, that would add two hours each way,” Mr. Westerman said. “I absolutely loved the car, but the range was the killer.” Instead of the Model 3, he bought another Prius."
1180,"Mr. Westerman’s decision should serve as a caution sign during the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Electric vehicles will be a hot topic at the showcase, which opens to the news media and industry executives on Monday and to the public on Saturday."
1181,"Automakers are preparing to introduce dozens of fully electric cars and plug-in hybrid vehicles over the next three years, and Hyundai, Kia, Mini, Nissan and Audi will display electric models due in the United States this year. It is a gambit based on the idea that many mainstream car owners will rush to make the leap from gasoline."
1182,"But to sell all those cars, the manufacturers have to attract a new class of customer."
1183,"Mainstream consumers may be harder to win over than the wealthy luxury car buyers, hard-core environmentalists and early adopters who have flocked to buy Model 3s and delivered Tesla’s rapid sales growth. That may be especially true in the middle of the country, because charging stations are more sparse there than on the coasts, where most Tesla models are sold."
1184,"Mr. Westerman, for example, said he’d like an electric car with a range of 600 miles — about as far as his Prius takes him on a full tank of gas."
1185,"Manufacturers are developing so many electrified models primarily to compete in China and Europe, where government subsidies and stringent environmental laws are spurring sales of zero-emission vehicles, said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at AlixPartners, a consulting firm. The sales pace is less certain in the United States, in part because gasoline remains cheap and the Trump administration has pulled back on emissions regulations."
1186,"“In the U.S., you can’t assume you’re going to be selling 100,000 of one model,” Mr. Wakefield said. “You don’t want to dedicate an entire factory to E.V.s” — as Tesla has done."
1187,"Last year, 361,000 electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles were sold in the United States, just 2 percent of car purchases, according to estimates by InsideEVs.com. Tesla, which has struggled with production and delivery problems, accounted for half of those sales."
1188,"But automakers have ambitious plans. Next year, Ford plans to introduce a small electric sport utility vehicle with a look influenced by its Mustang. The company is spending $11 billion to develop 16 battery-powered vehicles and 24 other types of electrified cars over the next five years."
1189,"“It’s still early days, but we think people will be coming to us for electric vehicles,” said Ted Cannis, the leader of Ford’s Team Edison, which is developing its electric vehicles. “We think we’re coming at the right time.”"
1190,"General Motors is making a similar push. On Friday, its chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said G.M. was increasing production of its Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle and planned to make electric cars a key part of Cadillac’s lineup."
1191,"Automakers have concluded that improvements in battery technology and declining battery prices will enable them to produce electric cars with much greater range. Mr. Westerman’s 600 miles may be unlikely soon, but far speedier recharging times are becoming a reality."
1192,"For electric cars over all, one big hurdle is the availability of charging stations. While more are popping up in shopping centers and parking garages, with about 20,000 in the United States, they are vastly outnumbered by the 150,000 gas stations across the country. Homeowners can install charging units in garages, but the millions who live in apartments don’t have that option."
1193,"Chris Torrella, a college student who lives in a rented home in Ann Arbor with no garage, bought a Model 3 last March and found he had to go too far out of his way to get to the city’s public chargers. His solution was one that few others may try: He persuaded his landlord to pay about $8,000 to modify the sidewalk in front of the house and install a public charging station at the curb."
1194,"“Now I can park on the street and charge up, and anyone else in the neighborhood who has a Tesla can, too,” Mr. Torrella said."
1195,Charging time is another issue. Even Tesla’s Superchargers require 40 minutes to provide an 80 percent charge. Doing the trick at home is generally an overnight job.
1196,"Automakers are trying to address those challenges. G.M., Nissan, Volkswagen and others are working with partners to install more chargers. They are getting help from Electrify America, a company that Volkswagen funded as part of its agreement to settle lawsuits over its deception on diesel emissions. With a budget of $2 billion, Electrify America is aiming to install an initial wave of 600 chargers at gas stations, and 1,500 at office parks and apartment buildings. Three more waves are to follow."
1197,"But even so, Electrify America’s network will probably provide only 10 percent of the country’s charging needs by 2021, the company’s chief executive, Giovanni Palazzo, said at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November."
1198,"“We can’t make it happen on our own,” he said. “We need more players.”"
1199,"Electrify America is also hoping to install 350-kilowatt chargers within the next few years, which in theory could provide a full charge in about 15 minutes. About 80 percent of the chargers currently installed use 120 kilowatts, Mr. Palazzo said."
1200,"One advantage that automakers are counting on is the wider variety of cars they will bring to the market. The Model 3, the Chevrolet Bolt and the Nissan Leaf are all small cars, a type of vehicle that fewer Americans are buying. Like Ford, Nissan is working on a roomier, S.U.V.-like model that it thinks will have wider appeal."
1201,"“There’s not a lot of variety right now, but as more vehicles come up in the small and midsize S.U.V. body styles, it will bring in more people,” said Brian Maragno, Nissan’s director of E.V. sales and marketing strategy. “The market, in just a couple of years, is going to look very different.”"
1202,"Fixing a cracked windshield used to be the kind of repair a technician could perform in a few minutes in your office parking lot while you were at work. Today, the same repair could take hours and require expensive computerized equipment in a special facility. And it will probably cost much more. If the repair is not done properly, it could have dire consequences."
1203,"In this new world of advanced driver assistance systems, features like lane-keeping assistance, automatic emergency braking and collision avoidance are integrated with windshields. They can prevent horrific accidents and save lives, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, but they also involve a complex suite of sensitive components, including ultrasonic, radar and video sensors."
1204,"Cameras nestled behind the windshield, radar sensors hidden in the front grille and ultrasonic components embedded in bumpers work within narrow tolerances. A seemingly minor impact can knock them out of alignment. And as vehicles — and drivers — rely on these systems more and more, tuning these components properly can be a life-or-death matter."
1205,"A camera that hasn’t been recalibrated after a windshield repair, for example, could mean the difference between keeping you between the lines or steering you off a cliff."
1206,"“It can be very complicated,” said Mike Calkins of AAA, the automotive group. “With radar and video, typically you need to do a wheel alignment before you do a calibration, because it needs to be pointed straight down the road.” That’s an extra step that wasn’t previously part of a windshield replacement."
1207,The driver-assistance systems may also require so-called static recalibration using custom laser and targeting equipment in a specially configured garage.
1208,"Many repair shops use Bosch’s DAS 1000 calibration equipment. Cars are aligned using a complex system involving lasers that requires proper lighting and an open, level area free of interference. Certain cars from Fiat Chrysler, Honda and Toyota require such static calibration, with each model using different measurements — even if the cars use the same camera systems — according to Edward Sprigler, a vice president at Safelite Autoglass."
1209,"At a Safelite repair center in the Astoria section of Queens, the company had to install high-output LED lighting overhead to accommodate the new technology."
1210,"“It’s about brightness and eliminating shadows so that the camera can see,” said Errol Webley, the Safelite quality manager for the New York and Long Island area."
1211,"The Bosch equipment also uses green lasers to bisect the car and create virtual lanes for the vehicle. Even the pitch of the windshield glass has to be perfect; otherwise, the sensors may look too far down the road and brake the car prematurely even when there’s no danger of a collision, Mr. Webley said."
1212,"Some models may specify that recalibration be done with a full tank of gas (to account for the precise height of the vehicle). Others require recalibration even after such seemingly minor adjustments as changing the wheel sizes on your car, Mr. Calkins said."
1213,"Still other vehicles, including cars from Ford, General Motors and Dodge, require what is known as dynamic recalibration, meaning the vehicle has to be test-driven according to very specific parameters."
1214,"“The repair facility may drive it 25 miles,” said Richard Beckwith, senior manager at Allstate’s Tech-Cor applied research and collision repair center. “It’s not for a joy ride but just to recalibrate the lane-departure warning system.”"
1215,"Mr. Webley demonstrated the process on city roads and highways. Using a scanning computer plugged into an S.U.V.’s onboard diagnostic port, we had to drive on roads with clearly marked lanes, not an easy assignment around New York City. The vehicle also had to be driven at over 50 m.p.h. for at least 20 minutes — in clear weather — enough time for the sensing system to confirm that it was correctly calibrated."
1216,"Some cars, like certain model years from Honda and Mercedes-Benz, require both static and dynamic recalibration, adding an hour or two of testing to a typical repair. That, plus the added cost of the components, has raised the price of repairs after a simple fender bender, according to AAA."
1217,"Replacing a cracked or chipped windshield, for example, in a car with automatic emergency braking, adaptive cruise control and lane-departure warning systems could cost as much as $1,600. Furthermore, many cars are now bristling with embedded ultrasonic and radar sensors. So a relatively minor driving misjudgment that damages a side mirror and rear bumper could require fixing rear radar sensors used with blind-spot monitoring and rear cross-traffic alert systems. The price? As high as $2,050."
1218,"Even tapping a curb and putting a car out of alignment could require a $300 adjustment to make sure the driver-assistance system is still operating properly, Mr. Calkins of AAA said."
1219,"Consequently, Mr. Calkins recommends that new car buyers take two important steps: Check their insurance deductible so that they can cover potential driver-assistance-system repairs, and understand what safety systems are in their new cars so that they can make sure any repairs include those systems as well."
1220,"Of course, driver-assistance systems are supposed to reduce the frequency of collisions, justifying the added expense, and hopefully avoiding costly repairs. A recent study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety of General Motors vehicles in 23 states found that models with auto-braking and forward-collision-warning systems had 43 percent fewer front-to-rear crashes reported to the police. It also found 64 percent fewer injuries from such collisions compared with similar models without the driver-assistance technology."
1221,"Moreover, the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety estimates that assistance systems could prevent over 2.7 million accidents, 1.1 million injuries and nearly 9,500 deaths in the United States each year. The caveat: The driver-assistance systems would have to be in all vehicles on the road."
1222,"“The whole question in the industry is frequency” of preventing accidents, Mr. Beckwith at Allstate said, “but we’re dominated with vehicles that do not have this equipment on them now.”"
1223,"“We field 15 million repair calls a year,” Mr. Sprigler at Safelite said. “Now, about 10 percent of these have ADAS.” Those percentages should go up in the future given that all the top automakers have voluntarily committed to making automatic emergency braking systems standard equipment in all vehicles by 2022."
1224,"Down the road, as more semiautonomous driver assistance packages are added, the complexity of such systems will increase, fusing together radar, camera, ultrasonic and lidar technologies. That will make repairs even more challenging, and consumer awareness of the technology even more important."
1225,"“Ultimately, if it’s not operating properly,” Mr. Beckwith warned, “it might not avoid an accident.”"
1226,"Forgetting to shut off a keyless vehicle has been a safety hazard for years, causing a growing number of carbon-monoxide deaths. But a proposed regulation to require warning signals and other precautions has languished in the face of opposition from the auto industry."
1227,"Now an effort is underway in Congress to force action on the issue, and at least one automaker has enlisted in the cause."
1228,"General Motors says it supports a bill introduced this week by Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, that would direct the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to adopt a rule addressing the danger. It would require automakers to include a feature that automatically shuts off an engine after a specified period of idling. The rule would apply to all new keyless vehicles, which make up more than half of new cars sold in the United States."
1229,"Because they don’t need to turn a physical key, drivers can forget to shut off a keyless vehicle. Some motorists, particularly older ones, have inadvertently left cars with the engine running in garages attached to homes, which have filled up with carbon monoxide and poisoned occupants, often while they slept."
1230,"The safety agency proposed a rule in 2011 that would have required automakers to install more beeps and alerts to draw attention to a running vehicle, an effort the industry opposed. Trade groups have said there is not enough data to support the rule. That proposal did not require an automatic shut-off feature."
1231,"The agency “has abysmally failed in protecting consumers,” said Mr. Blumenthal, a member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. “The reason for our legislation is to require the agency within months, not years, to make these devices standard.”"
1232,"General Motors, which has installed an automatic shut-off feature in 31 of 39 keyless models from its Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac brands, said it “supports the spirit” of the bill, designated the Park It Act. “This legislation reflects G.M.’s continued dedication to advancing automotive safety,” the company said in a statement. It would not say whether it planned to extend the safety features on its own to its entire fleet."
1233,"Ford, which has the automatic shut-off function on all its keyless models made after 2015, said it was reviewing the measure and would “work with the committee as it lays out its legislative agenda on vehicle safety.”"
1234,"In May, The New York Times reported that 28 people had been killed and 45 injured by carbon-monoxide poisoning from keyless vehicles since 2006. At a hearing days later, Senator Blumenthal sharply questioned the agency’s deputy administrator, Heidi King, about the issue and demanded that the agency adopt the rule it proposed in 2011."
1235,[Read The Times’ reporting on keyless cars and their carbon monoxide toll.]
1236,"Since then, five more fatalities have been identified by The Times, including three in December and January."
1237,"Across manufacturers, there is no consistency in the safeguards to protect motorists against the carbon-monoxide hazard. Some carmakers have gradually introduced an automatic shut-off feature, but others use only sounds or visual alerts to warn motorists of a running engine."
1238,"Asked if it would follow General Motors in backing the Blumenthal bill, Hyundai also said it was studying the bill. Toyota, Mazda and Volkswagen referred to a statement by an industry group, the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which said that “current keyless ignition system designs generally follow the recommended practices” of the Society of Automotive Engineers, a car standards body."
1239,"Toyota vehicles, for example, beep externally three times, and once inside, to inform drivers getting out of a vehicle that the motor is still running, a set of alerts that meets the voluntary standards. Toyota does not have an automatic shut-off feature. Its vehicles, including Lexus models, have figured in almost half of the fatal incidents identified by The Times."
1240,"Fiat Chrysler, which began introducing an automatic shut-off in its 2018 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivan, did not respond to a request for comment on the Blumenthal bill."
1241,"The legislation also aims to address the danger of rollaway vehicles, a hazard heightened by keyless ignitions because a driver can leave with the key fob without putting the car into park, regardless of whether the engine is running. The legislation would require carmakers to install technology that prevents a car from moving if the driver’s door is opened, the driver’s seat buckle is unfastened and a brake is not engaged."
1242,"According to the agency, 142 people were killed by rollaways in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. It is not clear how many of the vehicles were keyless."
1243,"In January, the highway safety agency said that it continued to review public comments on its 2011 proposal, and that it was “evaluating a range of options to determine the best path forward to optimize safety.” It also pointed to a safety video it released in 2016 to highlight the carbon-monoxide and rollaway hazards of keyless vehicles."
1244,"Jim Boeheim, the longtime men’s basketball coach at Syracuse, struck and killed a pedestrian on Wednesday night, the police said."
1245,"A man had been involved in an earlier accident and had left his car on I-690 near Syracuse. Boeheim drove by later, striking the man, the police said."
1246,"The victim was Jorge Jimenez, 51, of Syracuse. A police statement said Boeheim had tried to avoid the disabled car in the middle of the road and as a result had “struck the victim who was standing on the side of the road.”"
1247,"A police statement said that neither driver was impaired by drugs or alcohol. It said Boeheim’s speed had not been determined. While no tickets had been issued, an investigation was being conducted, it said."
1248,The area was under a weather advisory for snow and ice conditions.
1249,"“I am heartbroken that a member of our community died as the result of last night’s accident,” Boeheim said in a statement. “Juli and I extend our deepest sympathies to the Jimenez family. Out of respect for those involved, I will not be providing further comment at this time.”"
1250,"“We are saddened by the death of a member of our Central New York community,” said John Wildhack, the Syracuse athletic director. “Coach Boeheim is in contact with local authorities and cooperating fully.”"
1251,"Boeheim, 74, has been the coach at Syracuse since 1976, winning a national championship in 2003 and logging four other Final Four appearances over the years."
1252,"Earlier in the evening, Syracuse (18-8) had beaten No. 18 Louisville, 69-49."
1253,"Motorists who live in New Jersey and have a major problem with a new vehicle have a handy tool: the best lemon law in the land. But about a third of the states have such weak lemon laws that consumers will have a tough time getting a fair deal, according to a study released this month by the Center for Auto Safety."
1254,"All 50 states and the District of Columbia have “something that is arguably a lemon law,” but too many fail consumers, said Jason Levine, the executive director of the center, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization founded by Ralph Nader."
1255,"In the worst states, Mr. Levine said, there might as well be no lemon law on the books."
1256,"The states differ on what constitutes a lemon. But in general, a lemon car or truck has a single, serious defect impairing its safety, use or value. A vehicle could also be a lemon if it had a series of problems and could not be used for a long period — often set at 30 days — because it was at the dealership."
1257,"Given the cost of new vehicles, consumers should be angry that too many states “have decided they are not going to give anything but mediocre rights” to consumers, said Ronald Burdge, a lawyer from Dayton, Ohio, whose firm has specialized in lemon laws for decades."
1258,"That weakness is compounded because attorneys general are often not given the funding they need to help consumers who have bought a lemon, he said."
1259,"The International Association of Lemon Law Administrators declined to comment on the study. The executive director, Rick Soletski, said the association’s policy was to have each state comment individually on such matters."
1260,"Typically, lemon-law claims do not require a lawyer and are instead handled by an arbitration board that may be chosen by the automaker or the state. For autos deemed lemons, the manufacturer is required to buy them back. There is, however, no national data on how many cars the makers buy back. Under weaker laws, the owner may have to pay for the miles driven."
1261,"The center’s rankings are based on 10 factors, including how many repair attempts are required, the amount of time lost while the dealer has the vehicle and whether arbitration is state-run."
1262,"New Jersey claimed the top spot in part because it pushes the automaker to fix a problem quickly. The automaker gets only one chance to fix “a serious safety defect likely to cause death or serious bodily injury” and three chances to fix a less-severe problem. It also provides state-run arbitration, which the center contends can be “fairer to consumers than the manufacturer arbitration programs.” And a vehicle can’t be out of service for more than 20 days."
1263,"New York ranked sixth. It earned high marks for not allowing an automaker to charge a customer for use under 12,000 miles."
1264,"Illinois was ranked last, with a major criticism being that it lacks a penalty for an automaker that drags out the process, hoping the consumer will become frustrated and give up. Illinois also covers vehicles for only one year or 12,000 miles, whichever comes first. The center said there were also “a host of other deficiencies that can lead to a bitter outcome for consumers.”"
1265,"Annie Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general, said the office would review the center’s report. Meanwhile, “we encourage consumers to visit the attorney general’s website to file a complaint, and we will attempt to mediate,” she said."
1266,The center also looked at whether consumers face any jeopardy by filing a lemon law complaint.
1267,"That’s one reason that Colorado was ranked next to last. If a consumer sues an automaker over the lemon law and loses, the judge could make the consumer pay the automaker’s legal bills."
1268,It works both ways.
1269,"If the consumer wins, the judge could order the automaker to pay the consumer’s bills. But a consumer may just give up rather than risk a big legal bill, Mr. Levine said."
1270,"Lawrence Pacheco, the director of communications for the Colorado attorney general, had no comment on the ranking."
1271,"For consumers, a related and historically worrisome issue is interstate lemon laundering, said Rosemary Shahan, the president of Consumers for Auto Reliability and Safety, a nonprofit in Sacramento."
1272,"When a vehicle is repurchased by the automaker, Ms. Shahan said, not all states mark the title with its lemon status. That lets an automaker sell the vehicle again without the new buyer knowing its troubled history, she said."
1273,"In 1996, the Federal Trade Commission considered requiring all states to mark the titles of lemons. But faced with opposition from the auto industry, the agency backed off."
1274,"“The F.T.C. failed to act, and still fails to act, to protect the public from lemons with serious defects,” Ms. Shahan said."
1275,"Entering the newest train station in Miami is a bit like walking into another world. With natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, the modern building is bright, sleek and full of thoughtful amenities. Outlets and USB ports are at every seat, free Wi-Fi is available at the entranceway, and the entire structure smells lovely, thanks to a signature scent wafting through the corridors (grapefruit, orange and lemongrass with a touch of vanilla)."
1276,"The multibillion-dollar Brightline train that stops at this station offers the only private intercity passenger train service in the country. The diesel-electric system currently connects Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. In 2021, it will expand to Orlando, with groundbreaking scheduled for later this year. Brightline partnered with Virgin last November, and will soon be rebranded Virgin Trains USA. "
1277,"As fewer people in the United States apply for driver’s licenses and more take ride-sharing services, the team behind Virgin Trains believes that this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit. And they are starting with top urban areas in Florida."
1278,"“We recognized this major mobility problem that was starting to present itself between densely populated too-short-to-fly but too-long-to-drive areas, and we saw it as an opportunity,” said Patrick Goddard, president of Brightline. "
1279,"An alluring promise to passengers is a shorter trip. In Florida, the train stops at stations along Interstate 95, but compared to that stretch of highway, where speeds average around 34 miles per hour, the train chugs along at up to 79 miles per hour. That cuts the hour-long drive from Fort Lauderdale to Miami in half; the hour and a half drive between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach is cut to 45 minutes. The train has mostly been used by commuters, but company officials hope that it will appeal to more tourists. "
1280,"The MiamiCentral station will soon be home to Central Fare, a new food hall, and is a 10-minute drive from Port Miami, the busiest cruise port in the world. That station also connects to public transit options like the Metrorail and the Tri-Rail. In Orlando, stations will be located at Walt Disney World and at Orlando International Airport, to entice travelers to hop onboard. "
1281,"In December, Doug Maesk and his husband took the train from their home in Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach for a day trip. The journey by car would have been annoying, he said, while the train ride was very smooth and quiet."
1282,"“The seats were so comfortable, there was an attendant offering snacks and drinks,” Mr. Maesk said, noting that they didn’t travel first class. “Just being on the train was a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon and it was a really nice way to travel.” "
1283,"He said that he and his husband are likely to use the train to Orlando to avoid the three-and-a-half to four-hour drive, and would spend the time working instead of sitting in traffic. "
1284,"“We just wanted to try the train once,” Mr. Maesk said. “But now we’re really looking forward to them expanding to Orlando, so we can save time and be productive at the same time.” "
1285," Brightline’s Mr. Goddard said that the company, to set itself apart, has invested deeply into the details in its stations and on its trains."
1286,"“The transportation business is rife with stories of bad experiences, whether it is airplanes or public transit or even a bad Uber driver,” Mr. Goddard said. “We wanted to be the antithesis of that.”"
1287,"Along with its signature scent (scented candles are also available for purchase), the Miami station offers a gourmet coffee shop, a play area for children and electric scooters to rent. The station and the train are A.D.A. compliant and accessible to people in wheelchairs, and train bathrooms are touchless. A deal with Lyft allows passengers to pay for train tickets and a ride under the same tab, and the free Wi-Fi is available from the instant you enter the station to the time you depart the train at your destination."
1288,"Smart, Smart Plus and Select are the three class options. Tickets cost between $10 and $30 each way. Smart is the main class, which the company says is equivalent to business class and which it suggests commuters, families and groups take. Smart Plus costs a bit extra and includes one complimentary snack and beverage on each trip. Select is the train’s first-class experience, which provides access to station lounges that offer wine and charcuterie, and scented cold hand towels. "
1289,"All passengers, regardless of their class, are allowed up to two carry-on bags for no extra fee, with an option also to check luggage. They can also bring up to one cat or dog on the train, and the company is working on allowing passengers to book seats for their pets. "
1290,Ford Motor and Volkswagen have outlined what the companies hope will become a broad alliance — one that will hasten development of electric and self-driving cars and eventually cut costs.
1291,"But the initial step announced Tuesday, a plan to cooperate on pickup trucks and delivery vans, will do little to address the troubles both automakers face now. It also falls short of the detailed restructuring plan from Ford that investors have been waiting to see for more than a year."
1292,"On the fringes of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Ford said it would develop and manufacture a compact pickup truck that the two companies may sell under their own names in South America, Africa and Europe. The truck will be based on the new Ford Ranger, which goes on sale in the next few weeks. Ford will also produce a large delivery van and Volkswagen a compact van, both primarily for Europe."
1293,"Ford expects those projects to save about $500 million a year, but not until after the vehicles are introduced in 2023."
1294,"“We are forecasting the benefits at the end of our five-year period, so it is the 2023-2024 time frame mostly that the synergies start to accrue,” Ford’s chief executive, Jim Hackett, said in a conference call."
1295,"The companies said they were continuing to discuss ways to cooperate in the development of electric vehicles and self-driving technology, but stopped short of detailing how they might do that."
1296,"“It just makes sense to share investment, pool innovation capabilities and create scale effects in clearly defined areas,” said Volkswagen’s chief executive, Herbert Diess. “And that’s what we are going to do together with Ford.”"
1297,"Rebecca Lindland, an independent auto consultant, said that many big auto alliances failed, but that those that prospered tended to start out small and expand slowly."
1298,"“VW and Ford have a nice synergy with their customer base, so this limited partnership could be successful,” she said."
1299,Ford has invested more than $1 billion in a bid to produce a driverless vehicle that can transport passengers or deliver goods. It is also spending $11 billion to develop more than three dozen electric or hybrid models that it plans to roll out over the next five years.
1300,"Volkswagen, too, is developing a string of electric cars. On Monday, the company said it would spend $800 million to build a plant next to its existing factory in Chattanooga, Tenn. It will assemble a battery-powered sport utility vehicle that the company has called the ID Crozz."
1301,"Volkswagen’s push into electric vehicles began after its diesel scandal, in which it rigged diesel cars with software to cheat on emissions tests. To settle lawsuits in the United States, it agreed to buy back diesel cars from owners and paid a fine of $4.3 billion. It also promised to introduce a range of electric vehicles in the United States, and has funded a company that is installing charging stations in cities around the country."
1302,"But both companies have more immediate issues: a suddenly slumping auto market in China, slow growth and slim margins in Europe, and the need to develop technologies to meet the stringent emissions regulations that Europe will phase in."
1303,"Ford’s issues go beyond those challenges. Unlike General Motors, whose stock jumped last week when it raised its financial guidance, Ford is expected to show a decline from a year earlier when it releases its fourth-quarter earnings next week. While the company remains solidly profitable in North America, it is losing or barely making money in the rest of the world."
1304,"Mr. Hackett, who was named chief executive almost two years ago to revitalize Ford, has announced plans to cut jobs, but has not yet outlined a comprehensive turnaround strategy — something many analysts expected within months of his taking the top job."
1305,"“Ford continues to frustrate investors by delivering piecemeal information on its future plans,” said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at Jefferies Securities. “We continue to see tremendous scope for improving Ford’s performance through its own restructuring and more extensive cooperation with VW.”"
1306,"Ford’s stock has been trading at levels last seen during the recession a decade ago. On Tuesday, its shares fell 1.7 percent to $8.84."
1307,"As they recorded another year of strong United States sales, automakers said Thursday that they saw little cause for concern in the months ahead. But a closer look shows signs of strain emerging on several fronts."
1308,"Annual sales reached 17.3 million new cars and light trucks last year, a rise of 0.6 percent from 2017. It was the fourth year in a row that the figure exceeded 17 million, the longest such streak the industry has ever recorded."
1309,"But last year’s increase was driven by higher sales to rental, government and corporate fleets. Sales to individual consumers — considered a more accurate measure of demand — were flat, according to Edmunds, an auto-retail data provider."
1310,"At the same time, the enticing loan deals that many car buyers rely on have started to disappear. Interest-free loans, for example, accounted for just 5.5 percent of all finance plans offered by dealers in December. That was the lowest level for December since 2005, according to Edmunds."
1311,"Furthermore, sales in 2018 got a one-time lift from the Trump administration’s tax overhaul, which gave some consumers extra income to spend on new cars. Automakers won’t have that tailwind again."
1312,"“This year is going to be tougher than last year,” said Mark Wakefield, a managing director at Alix Partners, a consulting firm, “and the next year will even tougher than 2019.”"
1313,"Even though total sales rose in 2018, signs of halting demand were clear, Mr. Wakefield said. While sales of small sport utility vehicles rose strongly last year, sales of most other types of vehicles were either down or up only slightly."
1314,"“Other than that one segment, there isn’t a lot of growth,” he said."
1315,"In addition, Tesla’s sales more than tripled in 2018, and without that increase, the industry would have reported a decline in sales. G.M., Ford and Toyota reported lower sales for a third year in a row. G.M.’s domestic market share fell to 17 percent — its lowest level since the company’s infancy a century ago."
1316,"Most automakers posted gains early in 2018, with sales markedly weakening late in the year. G.M. reported a decline of 1.6 percent for the full year, but its estimated year-over-year decline for December was 3.7 percent. (The company no longer reports monthly sales.) Ford’s sales fell 9 percent in December."
1317,"Beyond the domestic market, automakers face other potential challenges. The potential tremors from an economic slowdown in China became more palpable this week as Apple slashed its financial forecast, citing disappointing iPhone sales there."
1318,"Lower consumer spending in China could hurt G.M., Ford, Toyota and other automakers because they now depend on that country to drive global growth, and some reap considerable profits there. Ford is especially vulnerable because it has been losing money in China and is trying reorganize its operations there."
1319,Those concerns seemed distant in the upbeat remarks of officials on Thursday.
1320,"Ford said any worries about a slowdown in China were not likely to be a factor in domestic demand. “It’s certainly something we look at, as a global company,” Emily Kolinski Morris, Ford’s chief economist, said of the China outlook. But as far as the United States market, she said, “I think consumers are looking at their personal financial situations.”"
1321,She added that unemployment remained low and that surveys showed strong consumer confidence.
1322,"Likewise, a Toyota executive played down the prospect of continued rate increases by the Federal Reserve — and tougher borrowing terms for car buyers."
1323,"“Interest rates are always going to be a concern at some level,” Jack Hollis, a group vice president at Toyota’s North American manufacturing arm, said in a conference call. “But it hasn’t slowed the industry to a point of concern.”"
1324,"Still, Ford and G.M. are preparing for more difficult times. Both companies are cutting jobs and costs in North America. G.M. said in November that it was idling five North American plants and aiming to eliminate more than 14,000 blue- and white-collar jobs."
1325,"Earlier in 2018, Ford announced a plan to reorganize its worldwide salaried work force of 70,000 with the goal of having a leaner staff by the second quarter of 2019. The move is expected to eliminate several thousand jobs."
1326,"General Motors began the year with an executive appointment, naming Mark Reuss on Thursday as its resident. Mr. Reuss, the son of a former G.M. president, Lloyd Reuss, has been serving as the company’s product development chief. He succeeds Dan Ammann, who was named chief executive of G.M. Cruise, a division developing self-driving cars."
1327,"One thing that the economic outlook may not change is the continued American preference for larger vehicles. Slumping oil prices — at about half their level five years ago — have offered little motivation for buyers to make fuel economy a priority. And unless supplies are constrained, an economic slowdown should keep prices low."
1328,"Three people on a carjacking spree drove a stolen car to a Bronx courthouse on Monday so that one of them could make an appearance in court in regards to a different crime, the police said."
1329,"That decision led to wild confrontation on a bustling avenue in the borough’s court district during which a police officer, who was nearly crushed, shot the driver of the stolen car, the police said."
1330,"The sequence of events began when police license-plate readers detected a car in the area that had been reported stolen. A 24-year-old officer, whom police did not identify, spotted the car and approached it when she saw three people climb inside, Terence A. Monahan, the police chief of department, told reporters at the scene."
1331,"But upon seeing the officer, the driver slammed into reverse, pinning the officer against a parked car across from the entrance to the Bronx County Family Court building. She fired three rounds into the car, striking the driver in the chest and left torso, Chief Monahan said."
1332,"The officer was being treated for injuries to her hip and leg at an area hospital, the police said. The driver underwent surgery for her wounds at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, where she was in critical condition, according to the police. Two passengers in the stolen car were arrested."
1333,"The police did not release their names and charges against them, and an official at the scene said they appeared to be teenagers."
1334,"Chief Monahan said the wounded driver, the two passengers and a fourth man who remained at large were involved in a robbery and carjacking spree that began early Sunday in the Bronx and traversed Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn."
1335,"The foursome — two young women and two young men — stole two cars and robbed three people of purses and cellphones, he said."
1336,"They had ditched the first car after crashing it in Brooklyn on Sunday and then stole a charcoal-colored Hyundai Sonata, whose owner had reported it missing that same day, Chief Monahan said."
1337,"It was the Sonata that three of the youths rode on Monday morning to Sheridan Avenue and 162nd Street, where one had to answer a charge in Bronx Criminal Court, the police said."
1338,"What they did not know is that police license-plate readers had tracked the car to the spot where it was parked, Chief Monahan said. After the court appearance, the three returned to the car and were about to drive away when the officer and her partner approached, the chief said."
1339,"The wild scene unfolded along Sheridan Avenue around 11:30 a.m., as dozens of people were going in and out of the area courts, restaurants and law offices."
1340,"Nathaliz Martínez, a legal secretary at the Goodfriend Document Center across from the family court entrance, said she heard the gunshots from the second-floor office and tried to convince herself it was just a car backfiring."
1341,"“It wasn’t even afternoon yet,” she said incredulously. “Are you serious?”"
1342,"A man who did not want to be identified because he was on parole said he was coming out of the Social Security office a block away when he saw the officer spin around before hearing three shots. Within minutes, police helicopters were hovering overhead and police officers swarmed the area."
1343,"Another man, Jason Rogers, 32, said he was coming out of the Bronx Criminal Court next door on East 161st Street when he heard the shots, ducked and peered around."
1344,"“I was trying to look for the shooter,” Mr. Rogers said. “It was a rush.”"
1345,"Jose Sánchez, 30, had just passed through the scanners in the Family Court when he heard a female officer yelling, “Sir, this is not an exit!” Moments later, he heard gunshots."
1346,"“It was loud enough that everybody scattered,” he said. “There were kids outside and the officers brought them inside.”"
1347,"Dozens of police and court officers cordoned off streets near the scene. High-ranking police officials — the first deputy commissioner, the deputy commissioner for counterterrorism and the chief of patrol — huddled with investigators surrounding the stolen sedan. A Nike bag sat on the ground nearby and nine evidence markers surrounded the car."
1348,"Officials said the officer and her partner were wearing body cameras, but they were not turned on before the shooting unfolded. Still, investigators recovered video of the incident from nearby buildings, the police said."
1349,"BERLIN — Targeting foreigners, a man repeatedly drove his car at pedestrians celebrating New Year’s Eve in western Germany, injuring four people before being arrested, the police and prosecutors said Tuesday."
1350,"The suspect made comments disparaging of foreigners when the police detained and questioned him, Herbert Reul, interior minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where the attacks took place, told reporters on Tuesday."
1351,"“This is a case of a German deliberately driving into groups of people, people who for the most part were foreigners,” Mr. Reul said. “That means this man clearly intended to kill foreigners.”"
1352,"At least three adults and one child, among them a Syrian and an Afghan, were struck and severely injured, officials said."
1353,"The 50-year-old suspect, whose name was not released, had a history of psychiatric illness but no previous police record or known affiliation with far-right extremist groups, said Friederike Zurhausen, the police chief for the area where the first attacks took place."
1354,"At 11:40 p.m., the attacker appeared to target a pedestrian on a main artery in Bottrop, a city in the culturally diverse, industrial Ruhr region, the authorities said. People in the street were able to flee and no one was injured."
1355,"He then drove his silver Mercedes toward the city’s main square, where people were lighting fireworks to celebrate the New Year. There, he struck the four victims, including a woman who remains in life-threatening condition, Mr. Reul said."
1356,"The man then fled to Essen, a larger city nearby, where he tried to steer into a group of people waiting at a bus stop, officials said. They noticed his erratic driving and were able to flee and alerted the police, who apprehended the suspect shortly afterward."
1357,"Tensions between Germans and foreigners have increased in Germany since the arrival of more than 1 million people in 2015, most of them fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan and seeking asylum in Europe’s largest economy."
1358,"Although the country has successfully absorbed a majority of new arrivals, a series of violent incidents has highlighted the frictions and fueled mistrust on both sides."
1359,"As 2016 began, men described as North African or Arabic in appearance assaulted hundreds of women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve. Near the end of that year, a truck attack at a Berlin Christmas market killed 12 people and injured 48."
1360,"At the same time, the number of attacks on immigrants by far-right extremists has increased, fueled in part by a rise in anti-foreigner rhetoric by the Alternative for Germany party, the country’s strongest opposition force."
1361,"The newly appointed chief of domestic security, Thomas Haldenwang, said last month he would double the number of agents focused on fighting the far-right extremists."
1362,"BOGOTÁ, Colombia — The suspect in a car bombing that left 21 people dead on Thursday in the Colombian capital, Bogotá, was a member of the largest guerrilla group remaining in the country, the Colombian government said Friday."
1363,"José Aldemar Rojas Rodríguez, the suspect who was also killed that day, was part of the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN, said Guillermo Botero, the Colombian defense minister."
1364,"The ELN did not claim responsibility, but it has increased attacks against the government since its rival guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, signed a peace deal with the government in 2016."
1365,"The attack on Thursday, near a police academy, was the first car bombing in Bogotá in years, a gruesome reminder of an era when such attacks were the norm, as drug lords and rebel groups waged aggressive terror campaigns, killing hundreds of civilians and security forces. Since the signing of the peace accords, the Colombian government has said it turned the page on that violent era."
1366,Scenes of the carnage near the academy told a different story. Cellphone videos shared with The New York Times on Friday and filmed by someone who was at the scene showed a burning vehicle with a dismembered torso in blue pants sprawled in front of the flames. The camera also captured images of a human foot and what appeared to be a severed head.
1367,Rescue workers struggled to carry possible survivors out on stretchers.
1368,"The attack against security forces in Colombia’s center of power was an escalation of hostilities with the ELN, which in the past year has bombed police stations, attacked oil pipelines and kidnapped soldiers, policemen and military contractors."
1369,"In a speech on Friday night, President Iván Duque of Colombia announced that Colombian authorities had reactivated arrest warrants for members of the ELN leadership and had asked Cuba, where 10 members are based, to extradite them."
1370,"“The ELN is and has been a criminal machine of kidnappings and attacks,” he said. “We have had enough of death.”"
1371,"Even before the attack, Mr. Duque, whose right-wing Democratic Center party campaigned against the peace deal with the FARC, expressed little enthusiasm for negotiating with the ELN."
1372,"“If the ELN really wants peace,” he said on Friday, “they need to show the country concrete actions, like the immediate return of all kidnapped people and the end of all criminal actions.”"
1373,"Mr. Botero, the defense minister, said the attacker, Mr. Rojas, had joined the ELN in the 1990s and worked as an explosives instructor. He lost a hand at one point in an explosion and thereafter was known by the nickname “Mocho,” slang in Colombia for someone who is missing a hand or arm."
1374,"In 2015, as the FARC was nearing its peace deal with the government, Mr. Rojas had tried three times to pass himself off as a member of that group to receive demobilization benefits, but FARC members rejected him repeatedly, said Mr. Botero, the defense minister."
1375,"The FARC, which has given up arms and formed a political party, worked to distance itself from the attack this week."
1376,"“We express our solidarity with the victims and their families,” the party wrote in a statement after the attack. “And we call on all sectors of the country to keep building a pact that takes violence and weapons out of doing politics.”"
1377,But the ELN has taken a different stance from their former guerrilla brethren.
1378,"Last January, a faction of the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed five police officers and wounded 40 others in a Colombian port city. During the summer, they tried to coax the government into negotiations by offering nine hostages for ransom. The kidnappings continued even this month, when the group said it had downed a civilian helicopter and taken three more hostages."
1379,"Jeremy McDermott, the co-founder of Insight Crime, a foundation that tracks criminal groups, said the group’s fractured command structure meant that some factions kept fighting the government even while others may express interest in a peace deal."
1380,"“The ELN isn’t a vertically integrated organization,” he said."
1381,"His foundation is also tracking another problem for the government: Former rebels of the FARC who have taken up arms once again. Last fall, Insight Crime estimated that as many as 2,800 fighters may have returned to arms — about 40 percent of the number that fought before the peace deal."
1382,"Jairo Libreros, a professor at Externado University in Bogotá who also works as a security analyst, said he saw little option for the government other than to continue fighting guerrilla groups like the rogue FARC fighters and ELN."
1383,"“The ELN is still anchored in ideologies from the last century,” he said, referring to its vows to continue Marxist struggle. “But this attack closes any window there was for negotiation in the short term.”"

1385,"Before J.V. Car Wash closed for good, it was open all the time, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Workers put in 12-hour shifts, sponging, drying, and waxing the cars, cleaning the wheels, and vacuuming the interiors, six or even seven days a week."
1386,"They worked in frigid and searing weather, were expected to use harsh chemical cleaners without gloves, and endured abuse if they took a few minutes to rest."
1387,"For all this, the employees were paid about $50 a day, roughly $4 an hour. Complaints about low wages were ignored. “The manager would say, ‘If you want to work, then work,’” Juan Remigio Licona said in Spanish. “‘If you don’t want to work, you can go.’”"
1388,"Two workers, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino, had logged eight years between them at the carwash when they concluded they did not want to work under those conditions and sought the advice of a lawyer. Both were immigrants from the Dominican Republic who had an imperfect command of English and an imperfect understanding of their rights under U.S. labor law. But in 2011, against long odds, they filed suit against their employer, alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state labor law."
1389,"The case against J.V. Car Wash (and its sister locations) took some unusual turns, as the carwash owner, José Vázquez, contrived a series of bizarre claims to undermine the workers’ lawsuit. But the really surprising twist to this unlikely story: the carwasheros, as they call themselves, won. By the time the last checks are disbursed this summer, almost eight years after the suit was filed, the 106 workers who eventually signed on as plaintiffs will have received a share of roughly $8.5 million — a spectacular sum for a wage theft case."
1390,"The average plaintiff award in a wage theft case is less than $6,000, according to Samuel Estreicher, a professor at New York University Law School and director of the school’s Center for Labor and Employment Law. These carwasheros won an average of more than $80,000 per worker."
1391,"Carwash workers are among the most marginal laborers in New York City’s low-wage economy. Most are foreign-born, according to Carlos Encarnacion, an organizer with New York Communities for Change — often from the Dominican Republic, Central America and West Africa — and some unknowable number are undocumented, which makes them especially vulnerable to exploitation."
1392,"Both the Attorney General’s office and the Department of Labor have investigated and recovered stolen wages in the carwash industry in recent years, and union organizers have been mobilizing carwash workers. But wage theft remains an endemic problem, and so far, only a few carwashes are unionized."
1393,"For 15 years Martín Ureña was on the night shift at J.V. Car Wash in Inwood, which was known to the carwasheros as “Broadway.” The work was grueling and sometimes hazardous. The winters were the worst. When he got home at the end of his shift, he would soak in a hot bath. “I was in pain from the cold.”"
1394,"Juan Remigio Licona remembered a day at the Bronx location that he was told to clean out the underground pit where sludge and chemicals collect. “The smell was so strong, I was feeling dizzy,” Mr. Licona said through an interpreter. The manager insisted he finish the job."
1395,"“You come from a poor country, you have dreams,” said Aldo Sención, who was born in the Dominican Republic. “But you never think that this reality could hit you so hard.”"
1396,"José Vázquez came to the United States from Cuba at age 12. He didn’t finish high school, but he saved his money and with his father bought a gas station in Inwood in the 1986, which became J.V. Car Wash (though it was known simply as Broadway.) Eventually he bought three more carwashes: one in Harlem, one in the Bronx and one in Elizabeth, N.J."
1397,"Mr. Vázquez did not respond to requests for an interview, but Ofelia Sanchez, his girlfriend of 30 years, said that the carwash employees were not exploited. “We are immigrants ourselves,” she said in a lengthy phone interview. “We treated them like family.” The workers’ claims that they had been underpaid, she said, were lies. He may have had “a different way of doing things,” Ms. Sanchez said, but “José Vázquez is not a crook.”"
1398,"He was certainly successful. Sometimes Mr. Vázquez would drive up in his red Ferrari or his Rolls-Royce, and the workers would wash it for him. None of the workers interviewed for this article could recall him ever leaving a tip."
1399,"Mr. Vázquez’s crews were nevertheless considered tipped workers. Like bartenders and waiters, manicurists and hair stylists, dog groomers and parking valets, the carwasheros depend on the generosity of customers to make a living. All these workers toil in industries that can legally pay employees according to a subminimum “tipped wage” scale. Gratuities from customers are supposed to make up the difference, but if tips are scarce, the employer is legally obliged to top up their pay envelopes to the standard minimum."
1400,"But for some tipped workers, it doesn’t work out that way. Carwash managers frequently help themselves to a portion of the tips, according to testimony at New York Labor Department hearings last summer. One worker testified that if the giant automatic brushes damaged a windshield wiper or a mirror, his boss would reach into the tip jar to compensate the customer."
1401,"At the Vázquez carwashes, workers had no notion of what their base wage might be, and whether the tips were actually coming to them. The managers would simply collect the money from the tip boxes at the end of each shift, take it into the office, and then hand the workers their wages in cash."
1402,"“You don’t know if the customers gave more tips or less tips,” said Josué Gómez, who worked at Broadway for nearly nine years. “They gave us an envelope, and we had to take whatever is inside.”"
1403,"The workers were not alone in their confusion. The tipped wage is so complicated — with several different wage scales, depending on how plentiful tips are — that even scrupulous employers may find it hard to determine what they owe. That complexity also makes it difficult to sort out if workers are getting swindled."
1404,"“I have many years of experience analyzing wage theft,” said Deborah L. Axt, co-executive director at Make the Road New York, an advocacy organization. But the payroll records for tipped workers are often bewildering. “It’s virtually impossible to detect and enforce wage theft with a system where employers are allowed to count tips toward the minimum wage,” she said."
1405,"For years, the carwasheros took their pay envelopes with little complaint, and payment practices at the carwashes escaped scrutiny."
1406,"Without an army of government investigators deployed in every workplace, enforcement of wage laws depends to some extent on employees to report violations. But immigrant workers are both more likely to be cheated and also less likely to come forward with their grievances. They may fear retaliation from a boss, they may hesitate to contact a government agency and they may not know how to find a private lawyer who would take an interest in their troubles."
1407,"Steven Arenson, a lawyer with Arenson, Dittmar & Karban, takes an interest in workers’ troubles. Mr. Arenson taught constitutional law at Yale College, and now represents employees who believe they have been underpaid, discriminated against, or harassed on the job. In musing about his career path, Mr. Arenson, who wears glasses and a yarmulke, quoted a medieval Talmudic scholar on the Torah’s prohibition against cheating a hired laborer. He is a familiar figure in certain Latino immigrant circles, and that is how, in late 2010, Marcos Díaz and Giovanni Paulino arrived at his Madison Avenue office with their tale of stolen wages."
1408,"The minimum wage in New York City at the time was $7.25 an hour. Working 72 hours a week, they should have been paid $638, including time and a half for every hour after 40 hours. But the carwasheros received around $300 each week."
1409,"Colleagues advised him not to get involved. “They told me it was a quixotic fool’s errand,” he recalled, and that he’d never recover enough from a small operation like a carwash to make it worth his time."
1410,"But Mr. Arenson listened as they talked about working outdoors all day in the cold, with wet hands and feet, making sweatshop wages. “The exploitation was so extreme,” Mr. Arenson recalled. “I thought it was outrageous.” He agreed to take the case."
1411,"And so began a seven-year battle that turned out to be anything but a routine wage-and-hour case. After Mr. Vázquez learned about the suit, he fired all the plaintiffs who were still employed at his carwashes. He then declared in court conferences that none of the men had ever worked for him. He said they were “squatters,” “delinquents,” and “agents of drug lords,” who had usurped his businesses and kept the money for themselves. He accused them of criminal witness tampering."
1412,"Mr. Vázquez refused to testify, failed to show up for depositions, fired his lawyers on the eve of a rescheduled deposition, asked to have the case dismissed and then, two years on, half an hour before he was once again scheduled to be deposed, he filed for bankruptcy protection."
1413,"It looked as though Mr. Arenson’s colleagues had been right; it seemed the carwasheros would never collect their stolen wages. “The hope is that they are going to wear you down,” Mr. Arenson said. “You’ll accept some very small offer of a settlement and go away. And often it works.”"
1414,"That’s not what happened. Indeed, the Chapter 11 filing was a grievous tactical error. Ordinarily bankruptcy protection halts all litigation, but Mr. Arenson persuaded the bankruptcy judge that his clients deserved their day in court, and the case was allowed to proceed. Worse yet for Mr. Vázquez’s prospects, when he failed to comply with the bankruptcy court’s instructions, the judge appointed two trustees, Donald Biase and Donald Conway, to manage his business and personal affairs."
1415,"As Mr. Biase sorted through the carwashes’ finances, he discovered that the accounts for the all-cash operations were “essentially nonexistent.” The payroll tax records listed just four employees for four carwashes: Mr. Vázquez himself, his girlfriend, his brother, and his octogenarian father. “Obviously,” Mr. Biase concluded, “these payroll tax returns were works of fiction.”"
1416,"The trustees also discovered, hidden in a safe in Mr. Vázquez’s basement, a stash of nearly $1.3 million in cash that he had not disclosed. “I can say this,” Mr. Arenson said. “José Vázquez never failed to surprise us.”"
1417,"The trustees concluded that there was no defense Mr. Vázquez could make at trial, and in December 2014 the lawsuit was settled. The men who had labored the longest at the carwashes received close to $200,000 each. Together, the 18 workers received $1.65 million."
1418,"But that was not the end of it. For months Mr. Arenson had been turning away employees of Mr. Vázquez’s businesses who had hoped to join the suit; the court’s deadline for submitting claims had long since expired. But Mr. Biase had been operating the carwashes (and paying a legal wage), and he understood that there were dozens more workers who might also have valid claims. He asked the court to allow more plaintiffs."
1419,"In the next few months, 88 more workers signed on. This is where a lot of cases would fold: with so many claims, some going back a decade or more, it seemed likely there would be no money to share. But it turned out that Mr. Vázquez owned not just the carwash businesses but also three of the four plots of land beneath them, including one property in a rapidly gentrifying corner of Harlem. Together the three parcels were sold for more than $30 million. A seven-story condominium is being built on the lot where the Harlem carwash once stood."
1420,"In December, five days before Christmas, the second group of plaintiffs received their settlement checks, ranging from a few thousand dollars to more than $90,000. Once the final payments are released this summer, the total settlement for all 106 workers, in both groups — including their attorney fees and expenses, which the judge ordered would be paid by Mr. Vázquez — will be roughly $8.5 million."
1421,"On a day when he suddenly had money for more than the bare necessities, Manuel Mercado talked about his old job as a car washer. “One of the managers, I never will forget, we had an argument, and he said, ‘You’re a nobody, you don’t even have papers.’” Mr. Mercado now owns a small restaurant in Brooklyn and plans to put some of his settlement money into his new business. But his big dream, he said, “is to be able to go to college and get a degree in this country.”"
1422,"Martín Ureña’s first luxury would be buying Christmas presents for his wife and daughters. In the spring, the family will move back to the Dominican Republic. Josué Gómez would like to buy a house outside the city, to save for his daughters, and to send something to his family in the Dominican Republic. Juan Remigio Licona wants to help his children in Mexico, and simply “to live better than I did before.”"
1423,"But when explaining why they sued their employer, the workers didn’t talk about the money. They wanted to be treated fairly, Henry Paulino said. They did it “to make justice.”"
1424,"Cash bribes were called “monopoly money,” and handed out to high-ranking members of South Africa’s governing party on monthly retainers. When that payoff wasn’t enough, $22,000 was stuffed into a Louis Vuitton handbag and delivered to a close ally of the president at the time."
1425,"That sent the recipient “over the moon,” according to Angelo Agrizzi, a businessman — and now whistle-blower — who detailed, at a continuing government inquiry into public corruption, extravagant bribes doled out to members of the party, the African National Congress, at the highest levels of government."
1426,"A current government minister, he testified, liked receiving an annual Christmas basket that included “four cases of high-quality whiskey, 40 cases of beer, eight lambs — cut up, obviously.” Her daughter was partial to high-end convertibles, Audi A3 Cabriolets, but kept crashing the cars given to her."
1427,"“So I actually called her in one day and sat her down and said, ‘Can I arrange for driver training, special driver training for you,’ because it was getting embarrassing,” Mr. Agrizzi said."
1428,"The granular details about the bribes in South Africa, where widespread corruption has gutted state institutions and public programs, emerged after several days of explosive testimony, broadcast live nationwide, by Mr. Agrizzi at the inquiry. Mr. Agrizzi was the chief operating officer of Bosasa, a South African logistics company that he said handed out between $300,000 to $440,000 a month in cash bribes to senior A.N.C. officials to secure lucrative government contracts."
1429,"Mr. Agrizzi, who wrapped up his testimony on Tuesday, implicated by name not only powerful politicians, but also senior civil servants who he said had facilitated transactions or were paid to look away. Though Bosasa had long been accused of unethical and illegal conduct, the company continued to win government contracts through its ties with the A.N.C."
1430,"Even President Cyril Ramaphosa, who has pledged to clean up South Africa, is being investigated for his ties to Bosasa."
1431,"Last week, the public protector’s office, a government agency responsible for investigating corruption, started an investigation into $37,000 given by Bosasa to Mr. Ramaphosa’s campaign before party elections in December 2017 — and also into whether Mr. Ramaphosa misled Parliament about why that money was given."
1432,"On Tuesday, Mr. Ramaphosa met with the public protector, Busisiwe Mkhwebane, to discuss the case, said Oupa Segalwe, a spokesman for the office."
1433,"Initially, Mr. Ramaphosa said in Parliament that the payment had been made to his son, Andile, for doing consulting work for Bosasa. Mr. Ramaphosa later said that the money was donated by the company to his 2017 campaign. He added that he had not been aware of the donation and pledged to return it."
1434,"“The president performed a spectacular about-turn and was forced to admit to the nation that his campaign received dirty money from Bosasa,” Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the main opposition party, Democratic Alliance, said."
1435,"The reports come just months before national elections are expected to be held, most likely in May. Allies of Mr. Ramaphosa, who ousted Jacob Zuma from power a year ago, are hoping that he will win a decisive victory and carry out reforms inside a fractured A.N.C."
1436,"“We’ve gone through a challenging number of years, nine years to be exact, where we seemed to lose our way, where we deviated from the path that you traditionally would have expected us to traverse,” Mr. Ramaphosa said last week at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, referring to Mr. Zuma’s nine-year presidency."
1437,"But Mr. Agrizzi’s testimony indicated that malfeasance has long been — and still is — an integral part of the A.N.C., which has held power since the end of apartheid in 1994. Corruption, he testified, long predated Mr. Zuma’s presidency and involves officials in Mr. Ramaphosa’s own cabinet and in the party’s top hierarchy."
1438,"Established by leaders of the A.N.C.’s Women’s League, Bosasa was bought and then built up by a white South African businessman, Gavin Watson, who with his brothers became anti-apartheid heroes for playing rugby with black South Africans in the 1970s. After democracy was introduced in the 1990s, the Watsons used their links to the A.N.C. for business purposes. The company changed its name last year to African Global Operations."
1439,Mr. Agrizzi served as Mr. Watson’s right-hand man but said he was coming clean after nearly dying during heart surgery in 2016. He said Bosasa’s business grew thanks to ties to the A.N.C. during the government of Thabo Mbeki.
1440,"By 2009, the company was under severe scrutiny: The Special Investigating Unit, a government agency, released a report detailing widespread fraud in Bosasa’s relations with officials overseeing the nation’s prisons."
1441,"But nothing came of the report or further investigations into Bosasa, Mr. Agrizzi said, because the company paid off national prosecutors and A.N.C. lawmakers on a parliamentary committee overseeing prisons."
1442,"Bosasa also bought protection from prosecutors by cultivating ties with Dudu Myeni, a close ally of Mr. Zuma, Mr. Agrizzi said. Ms. Myeni served for years as the head of South Africa’s now bankrupt national airline despite having no experience in the industry."
1443,"Bosasa funneled $22,000 a month to Mr. Zuma through her, Mr. Agrizzi said, adding that the money was once stuffed into a Louis Vuitton bag that sent Ms. Myeni “over the moon.” Mr. Zuma has not commented on the testimony."
1444,"As Bosasa sought further protection, Mr. Agrizzi said a monthly retainer was also paid to another close ally of Mr. Zuma, Nomvula Mokonyane, who was so quick in getting things done for the company that she was nicknamed the “Energizer Bunny.”"
1445,"The company also rewarded Ms. Mokonyane — who is now Mr. Ramaphosa’s minister for environmental affairs — with the annual Christmas basket, and her daughter with cars, Mr. Agrizzi said."
1446,Ms. Mokonyane’s lawyers said that her “right to procedural fairness” had been breached by the investigating panel and that she “felt betrayed” that newspapers had obtained Mr. Agrizzi’s prepared testimony.
1447,"Just over a century ago in Ludwigshafen, Germany, a scientist named Carl Bosch assembled a team of engineers to exploit a new technique in chemistry. A year earlier, another German chemist, Fritz Haber, hit upon a process to pull nitrogen (N) from the air and combine it with hydrogen (H) to produce tiny amounts of ammonia (NH₃). But Haber’s process was delicate, requiring the maintenance of high temperatures and high pressure. Bosch wanted to figure out how to adapt Haber’s discovery for commercial purposes — as we would say today, to “scale it up.” Anyone looking at the state of manufacturing in Europe around 1910, Bosch observed, could see that the task was daunting: The technology simply didn’t exist."
1448,"Over the next decade, however, Bosch and his team overcame a multitude of technological and metallurgical challenges. He chronicled them in his 1932 acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize for Chemistry — an honor he won because the Haber-Bosch process, as it came to be known, changed the world. His breakthrough made possible the production of ammonia on an industrial scale, providing the world with cheap and abundant fertilizer. The scientist and historian Vaclav Smil called Haber-Bosch “the most important technical invention of the 20th century.” Bosch had effectively removed the historical bounds on crop yields, so much so that he was widely credited with making “bread from air.” By some estimates, Bosch’s work made possible the lives of more than two billion human beings over the last 100 years."
1449,"What the Haber-Bosch method had going for it, from the very start, was a ready market. Fertilizer was already in high demand, but it came primarily from limited natural reserves in far-flung locales — bird droppings scraped from remote islands near Peru, for instance, or mineral stores of nitrogen dug out of the Chilean desert. Because synthetic ammonia competed with existing products, it was able to follow a timeworn pattern of innovation. In much the same way that LEDs have supplanted fluorescent and incandescent bulbs (which in turn had displaced kerosene lamps and wax candles), a novel product or process often replaces something already in demand. If it is better or cheaper — and especially if it is better and cheaper — it usually wins in the marketplace. Haber-Bosch did exactly that."
1450,"It may now be that another gas — carbon dioxide (CO₂) — can be removed from the air for commercial purposes, and that its removal could have a profound effect on the future of humanity. But it’s almost certainly too soon to say for sure. One sunny morning last October, several engineers from a Swiss firm called Climeworks ambled onto the roof of a power-generating waste-incineration plant in Hinwil, a village about 30 minutes outside Zurich. The technicians had in front of them 12 large devices, stacked in two rows of six, that resembled oversize front-loading clothes dryers. These were “direct air capture” machines, which soon would begin collecting carbon dioxide from air drawn in through their central ducts. Once trapped, the CO₂ would then be siphoned into large tanks and trucked to a local Coca-Cola bottler, where it would become the fizz in a soft drink."
1451,[Is It O.K. to Tinker With the Environment to Fight Climate Change?]
1452,"The machines themselves require a significant amount of energy. They depend on electric fans to pull air into the ducts and over a special material, known as a sorbent, laced with granules that chemically bind with CO₂; periodic blasts of heat then release the captured gas from the sorbent, with customized software managing the whole catch-and-release cycle. Climeworks had installed the machines on the roof of the power plant to tap into the plant’s low-carbon electricity and the heat from its incineration system. A few dozen yards away from the new installation sat an older stack of Climeworks machines, 18 in total, that had been whirring on the same rooftop for more than a year. So far, these machines had captured about 1,000 metric tons (or about 1,100 short tons) of carbon dioxide from the air and fed it, by pipeline, to an enormous greenhouse nearby, where it was plumping up tomatoes, eggplants and mâche. During a tour of the greenhouse, Paul Ruser, the manager, suggested I taste the results. “Here, try one,” he said, handing me a crisp, ripe cucumber he plucked from a nearby vine. It was the finest direct-air-capture cucumber I’d ever had."
1453,"Climeworks’s rooftop plant represents something new in the world: the first direct-air-capture venture in history seeking to sell CO₂ by the ton. When the company’s founders, Christoph Gebald and Jan Wurzbacher, began openly discussing their plans to build a business several years ago, they faced a deluge of skepticism. “I would say nine out of 10 people reacted critically,” Gebald told me. “The first thing they said was: ‘This will never work technically.’ And finally in 2017 we convinced them it works technically, since we built the big plant in Hinwil. But once we convinced them that it works technically, they would say, ‘Well, it will never work economically.’ ”"
1454,"For the moment, skeptics of Climeworks’s business plan are correct: The company is not turning a profit. To build and install the 18 units at Hinwil, hand-assembled in a second-floor workshop in Zurich, cost between $3 million and $4 million, which is the primary reason it costs the firm between $500 and $600 to remove a metric ton of CO₂ from the air. Even as the company has attracted about $50 million in private investments and grants, it faces the same daunting task that confronted Carl Bosch a century ago: How much can it bring costs down? And how fast can it scale up?"
1455,"Gebald and Wurzbacher believe the way to gain a commercial foothold is to sell their expensive CO₂ to agriculture or beverage companies. Not only do these companies require CO₂ anyway, some also seem willing to pay a premium for a vital ingredient they can use to help market their products as eco-friendly."
1456,"Still, greenhouses and soda bubbles together represent a small global market — perhaps six million metric tons of CO₂ annually. And Gebald and Wurzbacher did not get into carbon capture to grow mâche or put bubbles in Fanta. They believe that over the next seven years they can bring expenses down to a level that would enable them to sell CO₂ into more lucrative markets. Air-captured CO₂ can be combined with hydrogen and then fashioned into any kind of fossil-fuel substitute you want. Instead of making bread from air, you can make fuels from air. Already, Climeworks and another company, Carbon Engineering, which is based in British Columbia, have moved aggressively on this idea; the Canadians have even lined up investors (including Bill Gates) to produce synthetic fuel at large industrial plants from air-captured CO₂."
1457,"The ultimate goal for air capture, however, isn’t to turn it into a product — at least not in the traditional sense. What Gebald and Wurzbacher really want to do is to pull vast amounts of CO₂ out of the atmosphere and bury it, forever, deep underground, and sell that service as an offset. Climeworks’s captured CO₂ has already been injected deep into rock formations beneath Iceland; by the end of the year, the firm intends to deploy 50 units near Reykjavik to expand the operation. But at that point the company will be moving into uncharted economic territory — purveyors of a service that seems desperately needed to help slow climate change but does not, at present, replace anything on the consumer or industrial landscape. To complicate matters, a ton of buried CO₂ is not something that human beings or governments have shown much demand for. And so companies like Climeworks face a quandary: How do you sell something that never existed before, something that may never be cheap, into a market that is not yet real?"
1458,"Even the most enthusiastic believers in direct air capture stop short of describing it as a miracle technology. It’s more frequently described as an old idea — “scrubbers” that remove CO₂ have been used in submarines since at least the 1950s — that is being radically upgraded for a variety of new applications. It’s arguably the case, in fact, that when it comes to reducing our carbon emissions, direct air capture will be seen as an option that’s too expensive and too modest in impact. “The only way that direct air capture becomes meaningful is if we do all the other things we need to do promptly,” Hal Harvey, a California energy analyst who studies climate-friendly technologies and policies, told me recently. Harvey and others make the case that the biggest, fastest and cheapest gains in addressing atmospheric carbon will come from switching our power grid to renewable energy or low-carbon electricity; from transitioning to electric vehicles and imposing stricter mileage regulations on gas-powered cars and trucks; and from requiring more energy-efficient buildings and appliances. In short, the best way to start making progress toward a decarbonized world is not to rev up millions of air capture machines right now. It’s to stop putting CO₂ in the atmosphere in the first place."
1459,"The future of carbon mitigation, however, is on a countdown timer, as atmospheric CO₂ concentrations have continued to rise. If the nations of the world were to continue on the current track, it would be impossible to meet the objectives of the 2016 Paris Agreement, which set a goal limiting warming to 2 degrees Celsius or, ideally, 1.5 degrees. And it would usher in a world of misery and economic hardship. Already, temperatures in some regions have climbed more than 1 degree Celsius, as a report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change noted last October. These temperature increases have led to an increase in droughts, heat waves, floods and biodiversity losses and make the chaos of 2 or 3 degrees’ additional warming seem inconceivable. A further problem is that maintaining today’s emissions path for too long runs the risk of doing irreparable damage to the earth’s ecosystems — causing harm that no amount of technological innovation can make right. “There is no reverse gear for natural systems,” Harvey says. “If they go, they go. If we defrost the tundra, it’s game over.” The same might be said for the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, or our coral reefs. Such resources have an asymmetry in their natural architectures: They can take thousands or millions of years to form, but could reach conditions of catastrophic decline in just a few decades."
1460,"At the moment, global CO₂ emissions are about 37 billion metric tons per year, and we’re on track to raise temperatures by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. To have a shot at maintaining a climate suitable for humans, the world’s nations most likely have to reduce CO₂ emissions drastically from the current level — to perhaps 15 billion or 20 billion metric tons per year by 2030; then, through some kind of unprecedented political and industrial effort, we need to bring carbon emissions to zero by around 2050. In this context, Climeworks’s effort to collect 1,000 metric tons of CO₂ on a rooftop near Zurich might seem like bailing out the ocean one bucket at a time. Conceptually, however, it’s important. Last year’s I.P.C.C. report noted that it may be impossible to limit warming to 1.5 degrees by 2100 through only a rapid switch to clean energy, electric cars and the like. To preserve a livable environment we may also need to extract CO₂ from the atmosphere. As Wurzbacher put it, “if you take all these numbers from the I.P.C.C., you end up with something like eight to 10 billion tons — gigatons — of CO₂ that need to be removed from the air every year, if we are serious about 1.5 or 2 degrees.”"
1461,"There happens to be a name for things that can do this kind of extraction work: negative-emissions technologies, or NETs. Some NETs, like trees and plants, predate us and probably don’t deserve the label. Through photosynthesis, our forests take extraordinary amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and if we were to magnify efforts to reforest clear-cut areas — or plant new groves, a process known as afforestation — we could absorb billions more metric tons of carbon in future years. What’s more, we could grow crops specifically to absorb CO₂ and then burn them for power generation, with the intention of capturing the power-plant emissions and pumping them underground, a process known as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. Other negative-emissions technologies include manipulating farmland soil or coastal wetlands so they will trap more atmospheric carbon and grinding up mineral formations so they will absorb CO₂ more readily, a process known as “enhanced weathering.”"
1462,"Negative emissions can be thought of as a form of time travel. Ever since the Industrial Revolution, human societies have produced an excess of CO₂, by taking carbon stores from deep inside the earth — in the form of coal, oil and gas — and from stores aboveground (mostly wood), then putting it into the atmosphere by burning it. It has become imperative to reverse the process — that is, take CO₂ out of the air and either restore it deep inside the earth or contain it within new surface ecosystems. This is certainly easier to prescribe than achieve. “All of negative emission is hard — even afforestation or reforestation,” Sally Benson, a professor of energy-resources engineering at Stanford, explains. “It’s not about saying, ‘I want to plant a tree.’ It’s about saying, ‘We want to plant a billion trees.’ ” Nevertheless, such practices offer a glimmer of hope for meeting future emissions targets. “We have to come to grips with the fact that we waited too long and that we took some options off the table,” Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton scientist who studies climate and policy, told me. As a result, NETs no longer seem to be just interesting ideas; they look like necessities. And as it happens, the Climeworks machines on the rooftop do the work each year of about 36,000 trees."
1463,"Last fall, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine published a lengthy study on carbon removal. Stephen Pacala, a Princeton professor who led the authors, pointed out to me that negative-emissions technologies have various strengths and drawbacks, and that a “portfolio” approach — pursue them all, then see which are the best — may be the shrewdest bet. If costs for direct air capture can be reduced, Pacala says he sees great promise, especially if the machines can offset emissions from economic sectors that for technological reasons will transition to zero carbon much more slowly than others. Commercial aviation, for instance, won’t be converted to running on solar power anytime soon. Jennifer Wilcox, a chemical-engineering professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts, told me that air capture could likewise help counter the impact of several vital industries. “There are process emissions that come from producing iron and steel, cement and glass,” she says, “and any time you make these materials, there’s a chemical reaction that emits CO₂.” Direct air capture could even lessen the impacts of the Haber-Bosch processes for making fertilizer; by some estimates, that industry now accounts for 3 percent of all CO₂ emissions."
1464,"Pacala equates the challenges confronting Climeworks and Carbon Engineering to what the wind- and solar-power industries faced in the 1970s and ’80s, when their products were expensive compared with fossil fuels. Those industries couldn’t rely on demand from the private sector alone. But some policymakers perceived tremendous environmental and public benefits if they could surmount that hurdle. Government investments in research, along with state and federal tax credits, helped the young industries expand. “Wind and solar are now the cheapest forms of energy in the right locations,” Pacala says. “The return on those investments, if you calculated it, would blow the doors off anything in your portfolio. It’s like investing in early Apple. So it’s a spectacular story of success. And direct air capture is precisely the same kind of problem, in which the only barrier is that it’s too costly.”"
1465,"[Thirty years ago, we had a chance to save the planet. Read about the decade we almost stopped climate change.]"
1466,"Most of Climeworks’s 60 employees work in a big industrial space in downtown Zurich, on two floors of a low-slung building that the company sublets from a German aerospace firm. Manufacturing operations are on the ground floor; the research labs are upstairs, along with a small suite of shared offices, a hallway kitchen and a hangout area. The place has the stark, casual feel of a tech start-up, with one exception: The walls are lined with oversize photos of pivotal moments in Climeworks’s young history — its ungainly early prototypes; the opening of the first Hinwil plant that collected CO₂ for the greenhouse."
1467,"“It’s a little bit by accident that we are based in Switzerland,” Wurzbacher told me. He and Gebald both grew up in Germany and met as undergraduates at E.T.H. Zurich, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. “We met on Day 1, on the 20th of October of 2003,” Gebald recalled. “And on Day 1 we decided that we’d have a company.” Their aspiration was to be entrepreneurs, not to start a carbon-capture firm, but both men were drawn to research on renewable energy and reducing emissions. After they completed their master’s projects, they decided to create a direct-air-capture prototype and go into business. Both took the title of company director. Helped by a number of small grants, Climeworks was incorporated in 2009."
1468,"The two men were not alone in trying to chip away at decades of carbon emissions. An American start-up, Global Thermostat, now finishing its first commercial plant in Alabama, began working on air-capture machines in 2010. And almost from the start, Gebald and Wurzbacher found themselves in a friendly competition with David Keith, the Harvard engineering professor who had just started Carbon Engineering in British Columbia. Keith’s company settled on a different air-capture technology — employing a higher-heat process, and a liquid solution to capture CO₂ — to brew synthetic fuels. Climeworks’s big advantage is that it can make smaller plants early, Keith told me: “I am crazy jealous. It’s because they’re using a modular design, and we’re not.” On the other hand, Keith said he believes his firm is closer to building a big plant that could capture carbon at a more reasonable cost and produce substantial amounts of fuel. “I don’t see a path for them to match this.” Gebald told me he thinks his and Keith’s companies will each succeed with differing approaches. For now, what all the founders have in common is a belief that the cost of capturing a ton of carbon will soon drop sharply."
1469,"Their view is not always shared by outside observers. M.I.T.’s Howard Herzog, for instance, an engineer who has spent years looking at the potential for these machines, told me that he thinks the costs will remain between $600 and $1,000 per metric ton. Some of Herzog’s reasons for skepticism are highly technical and relate to the physics of separating gases. Some are more easily grasped. He points out that because direct-air-capture machines have to move tremendous amounts of air through a filter or solution to glean a ton of CO₂ — the gas, for all its global impact, makes up only about 0.04 percent of our atmosphere — the process necessitates large expenditures for energy and big equipment. What he has likewise observed, in analyzing similar industries that separate gases, suggests that translating spreadsheet projections for capturing CO₂ into real-world applications will reveal hidden costs. “I think there has been a lot of hype about this, and it’s not going to revolutionize anything,” he told me, adding that he thinks other negative-emissions technologies will prove cheaper. “At best it’s going to be a bit player.”"
1470,"Last year, when David Keith and his associates at Carbon Engineering published figures projecting that their carbon-capture technology could bring costs as low as $94 a metric ton, Herzog was not convinced. Keith nevertheless made the case to me that two new investors in Carbon Engineering — Chevron Technology Ventures and a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum — scrutinized his company’s numbers to an exhaustive degree and agreed the economics of the venture were solid enough to merit putting up substantial amounts in a $60 million investment round. Both Climeworks founders told me they agreed with Keith’s cost estimates, and saw a similar downward curve for their own technology."
1471,"Climeworks’s current goal is to remove 1 percent of the world’s annual CO₂ emissions by the mid 2020s. Yet meeting such a benchmark, if it’s even possible, would require bringing the cost of direct air capture down by nearly an order of magnitude while maintaining and expanding their roster of clients substantially. At the moment, Wurzbacher and Gebald have planned for several generations of Climeworks machines, with each new model promising declining prices. “Basically, we have a road map — $600, down to $400, down to $300 and $200 a ton,” Wurzbacher said. “This is over the next five years. Down to $200 we know quite well what we’re doing.” And beyond $200, Wurzbacher suggested, things get murkier. To move below that price would depend on “new developments” in technology or manufacturing."
1472,"Both founders told me they expect to reap enormous cost reductions from expanding production — activities that involve buying materials more cheaply in bulk and assembling units on automated factory lines instead of building them by hand, as is the case now. Design advances could wring out other costs. “Maintenance is very expensive,” Wurzbacher said. “Right now, if we exchange the filters in the collectors, we have to rent a crane, and that’s a lot of man-hours. In the next-generation units, we have improved that a lot, so relatively small design changes could cut the costs of maintenance by a factor of three.” Climeworks also intends to derive savings from improvements to crucial materials, like the sorbent that catches the CO₂. At the moment, the company’s technology requires that the temperature inside the units be raised periodically to about 100 degrees Celsius to release CO₂ from the sorbent so it can be drawn off and stored. If the process can be done at a lower temperature, the units will use less energy, and the life of the materials should be extended, further driving down costs."
1473,"The company’s ambitions for mass production may still seem extreme. To actually capture 1 percent of the world’s carbon emissions by 2025 would, by Gebald’s calculations, require that Climeworks build 250,000 carbon-capture plants like the ones on the roof at Hinwil. That adds up to about 4.5 million carbon collectors. For a company that has only built 100 collectors (and has 14 small plants around Europe), it’s a staggering number. The Climeworks founders therefore try to think of their product as the automotive industry might — a piece of mass-produced technology and metal, not the carbon they hope to sequester. “What we’re doing is gas separation,” Wurzbacher said, “and that’s traditionally a process-industry business, like oil and gas. But we don’t really see ourselves there.”"
1474,"The founders note that Toyota makes more than 10 million cars annually. “Every CO₂ collector has about the same weight and dimensions of a car — roughly two tons, and roughly 2 meters by 2 meters by 2 meters,” Gebald said. “And all the methods used to produce the CO₂ collectors could be well automated. So we have the automotive industry as a model for how to produce things in large quantities for low cost.” The two men have already sought advice from Audi. They are also aware that the automotive industry perfected its methods over the course of 100 years. Climeworks, if it plans to have even a modest impact, doesn’t have nearly as much time."
1475,"In 1954, the economist Paul Samuelson put forward a theory that made a distinction between “private-consumption goods” — bread, cars, houses and the like — and commodities that existed apart from the usual laws of supply and demand. Modern global markets are obviously quite successful at pricing private goods we need and want. But the other type of commodity Samuelson was describing is something now known as a “public good,” which benefits everyone but is not bought, sold or consumed the same way. Definitions of a public good can vary, but the oft-used examples are lighthouses, national defenses and clean air."
1476,"Direct air capture can no doubt create private goods, like soft-drink carbonation or fuels. What makes its value so difficult to estimate is that in burying CO₂ for a better atmosphere — and, almost certainly, a better future — its purveyors would also create a public good. “The challenge with just collecting and burying CO₂ is that there isn’t a market yet,” Julio Friedmann, a former United States Energy Department official who now works at Columbia University, told me. “What it’s really about is offering an environmental service for a fee.” And what that means, in short, is that direct air capture’s success would be limited to the size of the market for private goods — soda fizz, greenhouse gas — unless governments decided to intervene and help fund the equivalent of several million (or more) lighthouses."
1477,"An intervention could take a variety of forms. It could be large grants for research to find better sorbent materials, for instance, which would be similar to government investments that long ago helped nurture the solar- and wind-power industries. But help could also come by expanding regulations that already exist. A new and obscure United States tax provision, known as 45Q and signed last year by President Trump, offers a tax credit of up to $50 a ton for companies that bury CO₂ in geologic formations. The credit can benefit oil and gas firms that pump CO₂ underground during drilling work, as well as power plants that capture emissions directly from their smokestacks. Yet it could be used by Climeworks too, should it open plants in the United States — but only if it manages to remove and bury 100,000 tons of CO₂ per year."
1478,"Governments can make carbon more expensive too. The Climeworks founders told me they don’t believe their company will succeed on what they call “climate impact” scales unless the world puts significant prices on emissions, in the form of a carbon tax or carbon fee. “Our goal is to make it possible to capture CO₂ from the air for below $100 per ton,” Wurzbacher says. “No one owns a crystal ball, but we think — and we’re quite confident — that by something like 2030 we’ll have a global average price on carbon in the range of $100 to $150 a ton.” There is optimism in this thinking, he admitted; at the moment, only a few European countries have made progress in assessing a high price on carbon, and in the United States, carbon taxes have been repudiated recently at the polls, most recently in Washington State. Still, if such prices became a reality, they could benefit the carbon extraction market in a variety of ways. A company that sells a product or uses a process that creates high emissions — an airline, for instance, or a steel maker — could be required to pay carbon-removal companies $100 per metric ton or more to offset their CO₂ output. Or a government might use carbon-tax proceeds to directly pay businesses to collect and bury CO₂. In the absence of any meaningful government action, perhaps a crusading billionaire could put all the money in his estate toward capturing CO₂ and stashing it in the earth."
1479,"If carbon came to be properly priced, a global ledger would need to be kept by regulators so that air-capture machines could suck in and bury an amount equivalent to the CO₂ that emitters produce. Because CO₂ emissions mix quickly into the atmosphere, location would be mostly irrelevant, except for the need to situate plants near clean energy sources and suitable areas for sequestering the gas underground. A direct-air-capture plant in Iceland, in other words, could take in the same quantity of emissions produced by a Boeing 787 in Australia and thus negate its environmental impact. What’s more, there might not be limitations on the burial process. “It doesn’t cost too much to pump CO₂ underground,” Stanford’s Sally Benson says. Companies already sequester about 34 million metric tons of CO₂ in the ground every year, at a number of sites around the world, usually to enhance the oil-drilling process. “The costs range from $2 to $15 per ton. So the bigger cost in all of this is the cost of carbon capture.” Benson told me that various studies suggest that the earth’s capacity for CO₂ sequestration could be in the range of 25 trillion metric tons; burying, say, five billion metric tons of CO₂ a year is therefore within the realm of possibility."
1480,"In an imaginary, zero-carbon future, the revenue prospects for air-capture companies would probably be enormous. “If we get to $100 to $150 a ton,” Wurzbacher told me, “then the market is almost infinite.” It would be so large, he said, that even if his company went through an exponential expansion, he doubted it could serve all the potential clients. At such low prices, companies could potentially fold carbon offsets into their pricing — or be compelled to do so — leading to an explosion in the market. “Christoph and me, we are always saying, we think that if this develops in a direction we think it does, we are not founding a company — we’re really founding a new industry,” Wurzbacher said. He points to the work in Iceland — a collaborative effort, funded partly by the European Union — as the first step toward that industry. At the moment, a single Climeworks collector on a Reykjavik geothermal field takes in air and collects CO₂; after the gas is flushed from the machine’s filter, it is mixed with water, essentially forming hot seltzer. Then the liquid is injected into a basalt rock formation deep underground. Over the course of about two years, the CO₂ mineralizes, locking away the gas forever."
1481,"At Climeworks’s offices in Zurich, I asked Valentin Gutknecht, who was at the time the company’s business-development manager, if he could bury in Iceland my emissions from my plane flight from the United States to Zurich. He had a written agreement he could print out and give me, but it wouldn’t be cheap, he warned. The price was running about $600 a metric ton, meaning my flight would cost about an extra $700. But I was hardly the first person to ask him. The weekend before, Gutknecht told me, he received 900 unsolicited inquiries by email. Many were from potential customers who wanted to know how soon Climeworks could bury their CO₂ emissions, or how much a machine might cost them. I had the sense I was getting a glimpse of what’s to come: A community of people — not large enough to make a difference, but nonetheless motivated — seemed ready to pay a premium to reverse their CO₂ emissions."
1482,"Later, Wurzbacher told me he wants to offer a “one click” consumer service, perhaps in a year or two, which would expand what they’re doing in Iceland to individual customers and businesses. A Climeworks app could be installed on my smartphone, he explained. It could then be activated by my handset’s location services. “You fly over here to Europe,” he explained, “and the app tells you that you have just burned 1.7 tons of CO₂. Do you want to remove that? Well, Climeworks can remove it for you. Click here. We’ll charge your credit card. And then you’ll get a stone made from CO₂ for every ton you sequester.” He sat back and sighed. “That would be my dream,” he said."
1483,"Paradoxical though it may seem, it’s probable that synthetic fuels offer a more practical path to creating a viable business for direct air capture. The vast and constant market demand for fuel is why Carbon Engineering has staked its future on synthetics. The world currently burns about 100 million barrels of oil a day. David Keith told me he thinks that by 2050 the demand for transportation fuels will almost certainly be modified by the transition to electric vehicles. “So let’s say you’d have to supply something like 50 million barrels a day in 2050 of fuels,” he said. “That’s still a monster market.”"
1484,"Steve Oldham, Carbon Engineering’s chief executive, added that direct-air-capture synthetics have an advantage over traditional fossil fuels: They won’t have to spend a dime on exploration. “If you were a brand-new company looking to make fuel, the cost of finding and then extracting fossil fuel is going to be really substantial,” he says. “Whereas our plants, you can build it right in the middle of California, wherever you have air and water.” He told me that the company’s first large-scale facility should be up and running by 2022, and will turn out at least 500 barrels a day of fuel feedstock — the raw material sent to refineries."
1485,"Climeworks perceives a large market for fuels, too. In a town near Zurich called Rapperswil-Jona, the firm has installed a collector in a small plant, run by the local technical university, to produce methane. In a room about the size of a shipping container, the Climeworks machine takes in CO₂ through an air duct and sends it through a maze of pipes to combine it with hydrogen, which is derived from water using solar power. When I visited, the plant was a few weeks away from being operational, but the methane coming out of the works could replace gasoline in the engine of just about any car, bus or truck outfitted to run on natural gas. At a larger plant in Italy, Climeworks recently joined a consortium of European countries to produce synthetic methane that will be used by a local trucking fleet. With different tweaks and refinements, the process could be adapted for diesel, gasoline, jet fuel — or it could be piped directly to local neighborhoods as fuel for home furnaces."
1486,"From an economic standpoint, synthetic fuels could allow producers to plug into a huge existing infrastructure — refineries, gas stations, cars, planes, trucks, homes, ships — and replace a product already in demand with something arguably better. But the new fuels are not necessarily cheaper. Carbon Engineering aspires to deliver its product at an ultimate retail price of about $1 per liter, or $3.75 per gallon. What would make the product competitive are regulations in California that now require fuel sellers to produce fuels of lower “carbon intensity.” To date this has meant blending gas and diesel with biofuels like ethanol, but it could soon mean carbon-capture synthetics too."
1487,"In an expanding market, synthetic fuels could have curious effects. Since they’re made from airborne CO₂ and hydrogen and could be manufactured just about anywhere, they could rearrange the geopolitical order — tempering the power of a handful of countries that now control natural-gas and oil markets. The methane project in Rapperswil-Jona is especially suited for that country’s needs, Markus Friedl, a thermodynamics professor overseeing the project, told me, because Switzerland imports almost all of its natural gas, and its ability to generate energy from renewable sources is limited during the colder months. Carbon-capture-derived fuels, if they become cheap enough, could be a form of energy storage — made in summer, with solar or wind power, and used in winter — that carries a lower cost (and longer life) than batteries."
1488,"From an environmental standpoint, air-capture fuels are not a utopian solution. Such fuels are carbon neutral, not carbon negative. They can’t take CO₂ from our industrial past and put it back into the earth. If all the cars, trucks and planes of the year 2050 run on renewable fuels instead of fossil fuels, their CO₂ emissions would need to be removed from the air, recycled into the same product they originally burned through, and the cycle would need to repeat, ad infinitum, lest emissions increase. Even so, these fuels could present an enormous improvement. Transportation — currently the most significant source of emissions by sector in the United States — could cease to be a net emitter of CO₂. Just as crucial, the technology of direct air capture could scale up to become better and cheaper."
1489,"A huge expansion would also involve huge complications. “You start to get into really big challenges when you get to these big, large scales,” Glen Peters, a research director at the Cicero Center for International Climate Research in Oslo, told me. “If you can do one carbon-capture facility, where Carbon Engineering or Climeworks can build a big plant, great. You need to do that 5,000 times. And to capture a million tons of CO₂ with direct air capture, you need a small power plant just to run that facility. So if you’re going to build one direct-air-capture facility every day for the next 30 years to get to some of these scenarios, then in addition, we have to build a new mini power plant every day as well.” It’s also the case that you have to address two extraordinary problems at the same time, Peters added. “To reach 1.5 degrees, we need to halve emissions every decade,” he said. That would mean persuading entire nations, like China and the United States, to switch from burning coal to using renewables at precisely the same time that we make immense investments in negative-emission technologies. And Peters pointed out that this would need to be done even as governments choose among competing priorities: health care, education and so on."
1490,"“The idea of bringing direct air capture up to 10 billion tons by the middle or later part of the century is such a herculean task it would require an industrial scale-up the likes of which the world has never seen,” Princeton’s Stephen Pacala told me. And yet Pacala wasn’t pessimistic about making a start. He seemed to think it was necessary for the federal government to begin with significant research and investments in the technology — to see how far and fast it could move forward, so that it’s ready as soon as possible. At Climeworks, Gebald and Wurzbacher spoke in similar terms, asserting that the conversations around climate challenges are moving beyond the choice between clean energy or carbon removal. Both will be necessary."
1491,"Gebald and Wurzbacher seem less assured about the future of global policy than on the mechanics of scaling up. Some of that, they made clear, was related to their outlook as engineers, to what they’ve gathered from observing companies like Audi and Apple. If the last century has proved anything, it’s that society is not always intent on acting quickly, at least in the political realm, to clean up our environment. But we’ve proved very good at building technology in mass quantities and making products and devices better and cheaper — especially when there’s money to be made. For now, Gebald and Wurzbacher seemed to regard the climate challenge in mathematical terms. How many gigatons needed to be removed? How much would it cost per ton? How many Climeworks machines were required? Even if the figures were enormous, even if they appeared impossible, to see the future their way was to redefine the problem, to move away from the narrative of loss, to forget the multiplying stories of dying reefs and threatened coastlines — and to begin to imagine other possibilities."
1492,"Ride-share companies are facing increased pressure to ensure their users’ safety and to provide better identification for their drivers after the death of Samantha Josephson, a University of South Carolina student who was killed last weekend after she got into a car she believed was her Uber. "
1493,"The Times’s Jack Healy reported Thursday about other incidents in which ride-share users, mostly young women, have been assaulted, kidnapped or robbed by someone posing as a driver. Uber sent an email to customers on Thursday imploring them to “Check your ride, every time.”"
1494,"We asked readers to share their stories of scary experiences with ride-share services. We heard from passengers and legitimate drivers alike, who offered advice for navigating these frightening situations. In some cases, drivers who don’t work for ride-share companies said they have been startled by would-be passengers trying to get into their cars. "
1495,"Here are some of those responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity."
1496,I was lucky! 
1497,A few years ago I was visiting New York and decided to use the Uber app I had read about to go to the Metropolitan Opera. I stood on the curb outside my hotel looking at my phone as a Lincoln Town Car pulled up. 
1498,“Are you my Uber?” I naïvely asked.
1499,“Yes. Yes. Get in.” 
1500,"When we arrived at Lincoln Center the driver asked for $20. “Doesn’t this go on my account?” I handed him the money and stepped out of the car, somewhat puzzled by my first Uber experience. Later, when I checked my voice mail, my real Uber driver said, “I am here at the Carlyle Hotel … ”"
1501,"I have since learned to verify all the driver details before getting in a car. — Kathryn Ryder Boussemart, 63, Palm Beach, Fla. "
1502,"I was leaving a club in a desolate part of the city in the small hours of the morning and got into the only car waiting on the block thinking it was my Lyft. The guy had a box of doughnuts in the back and I told him I would move them and started small talk. Before we got to the end of the block he stopped and said, “I am not your driver,” so I got out, in shock. I probably would have figured it out myself within the next couple of minutes but whoa was that a close call! I am increasingly choosing to drive myself if I can chance the parking situation in the city, which I increasingly do since it is a much better experience than rolling the dice with a Lyft/Uber. On that note, this urban dweller will not be relinquishing her car anytime soon. — Julia V., 33, San Francisco"
1503,"I’m currently studying abroad in the Dominican Republic. It’s actually quite common here for the car to not match what the app says; people borrow their friend’s cars, or drivers have their original account suspended so they share a profile with a friend. "
1504,"My tactic is to always check that they have my profile up on their phones. There was a ride I took where the driver canceled the trip on the app as soon as we got in the car (I don’t have data service here so I didn’t find this out until I got to Wi-Fi) and drove us around the city, ignoring our directions. He charged us three times the average toll, and Uber can’t do anything about this since the trip was technically canceled. "
1505,"If I could do it over again, I’d get out of the car as soon as I suspected he was trying to scam us. It’s hard to know when you’re doing the right thing in such an intimidating situation. — Liz Roberts, 21, Saratoga Springs, N.Y."
1506,"Recently, I decided to try a Lyft in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., where I vacation. When the car arrived, there was already one female passenger. I noted that the license plate did not match the plate indicated on the app, and pointed this out to the driver, who said, “Sometimes I drive a different car.” His face did match the app photo. "
1507,"He pulled away and should have driven straight west. However, he left course and drove to a less populated industrial area. I asked him where he was going. He said, “To pick someone else up.” "
1508,"Four miles later, I told him to “let me out of the car.” The other female passenger did not speak English and she agreed this felt “wrong in some way.” I didn’t want to leave her alone. The uncommunicative driver said he “couldn’t find his pickup” and wanted me to calm down. I said, “I do not like this.” I pretended to be on a phone call with a loved one (a very protective and angry loved one), describing the area, giving the license plate, the driver’s name and street names."
1509,He did not slow down but did turn around and head to the most direct route. What should have been simple turned into something else. 
1510,"Immediately following I contacted Lyft and asked them to respond to my concerns. What I got was a standard email that dismissed my concerns. The email said, “OOPS that’s on us” and “sometimes our drivers are asked to pick up … ” Not what I expected. The Lyft response was unacceptable and made me rethink this whole Lyft/Uber thing. — Rebecca Krueger, 53, Bay Village, Ohio "
1511,"After parking my car recently, a young woman jumped in the back seat thinking I was her Uber ride. She was so careless that she did not even notice I had no Uber decal. After some confusion on both our parts, she spotted her actual Uber ride, apologized and jumped out. Her Uber ride car was not even the same color as mine. "
1512,"I hope this horrible story will get people to be a lot more careful, but ride-share companies need to come up with solutions not only for people who are paying attention, but those who are not. It is very easy to get distracted when you are with a group having fun and in many other scenarios. — Michael Rodriguez, 55, Corvallis, Ore. "
1513,"I am a driver. I can’t tell you how many times people try to hop in my car without looking and think I am their driver. There are bad actors out there, and you are the first person responsible for your safety. I can go on with hundreds of stories, but I am going to leave the ladies here some advice."
1514,"If you are in a situation where you actually have someone who you think may not be a legitimate driver, fake it that you are receiving a phone call. Act extremely upset that your loved one was just rushed to a hospital. Tell the driver to bring you straight to the local emergency room. "
1515,"Now why do you ask about the emergency room? Simple, they are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are always people there, and there is almost always a cop stationed there. Go inside and wait for the driver to leave, and then order a new car. — Matthew J. Andras, 48, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. "
1516,"Unfortunately, I regularly experience men telling me that they are my Uber driver when I am waiting for an Uber in Boston. It usually happens when I am waiting alone for an Uber outside of a bar or other highly trafficked spot. I have never gotten into one of these cars and I am fortunate that the first time that it happened I was walking where I needed to go and hadn’t called for a ride-share. — Sara Goldman, 22, Boston "
1517,"This happens to young women far more often than is reported. I had a similar situation in 2016 in Washington, waiting for an Uber on Wisconsin Avenue (in a well-lit, wealthy area). As my Uber X was supposed to arrive, a black car pulled up like clockwork. The driver rolled down the window and said he was my ride. "
1518,"As I was about to open the door and get in, something didn’t feel right. I hesitated and checked my app to make sure it was my car. He became increasingly insistent that he was my ride, and that he could give me a ride to wherever I want to go. Thankfully I realized he wasn’t an Uber driver and politely declined his ride. Unfortunately, at the time, I didn’t know this was a growing problem and didn’t know how to report it. Predatory drivers are scanning the sidewalks seeking women waiting for Ubers, even in areas you wouldn’t expect. — Amy Casey, 23, Brooklyn, N.Y. "

1521,"SAN FRANCISCO — Lyft officially signaled on Monday that it sought to have the biggest technology initial public offering since 2014, setting the stage for a bonanza of riches for young tech companies this year."
1522,"The ride-hailing company said in a new regulatory filing that it hoped to be valued at up to $23 billion when it lists on the stock market as soon as next week, the highest number for a tech company since Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, went public at a $169 billion valuation in 2014. Lyft’s target value is significantly greater than its $15.1 billion valuation in its last private funding round, a sign that it expects a warm reception from investors."
1523,"That provides a benchmark for other tech companies that are preparing to go public this year, including Lyft’s chief rival, Uber, as well as Pinterest, Postmates, Slack and others. All are seeking high valuations, with their offerings likely to bring a wave of wealth to tech investors, founders and early employees that will once again rev up the Silicon Valley start-up ecosystem. Lyft’s I.P.O. is expected to be quickly eclipsed by Uber, which may go public at a valuation of up to $120 billion."
1524,"“We’re looking at Lyft as a bellwether for the summer I.P.O. market,” said Matthew Kennedy, a senior I.P.O. market strategist at Renaissance Capital. “The others in the pipeline are all watching Lyft and looking to see whether investors are interested in companies that are highly unprofitable but highly valuable.”"
1525,"But in a troubling trend for some investors, Lyft’s new filing also revealed how tech founders are continuing to assert control over their companies in a way that gives other shareholders very little say. Because of a mechanism that gives Lyft’s two founders — Logan Green, the chief executive, and John Zimmer, the president — outsize voting rights, the duo will own less than 5 percent of the company’s outstanding stock once it is public but they will control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares."
1526,"The filing coincided with the start of Lyft’s so-called road show, a two-week run of meetings during which company executives and advisers will try to persuade prospective investors to grab a piece of what will the first ride-hailing firm to go public."
1527,"Lyft’s offering will test how investors value the ride-hailing business model. Lyft and Uber have demonstrated rapid growth but neither company is profitable, and each spends heavily on subsidies for riders and drivers in an effort to win market share from each other. Lyft lost $911.3 million last year on revenue of $2.2 billion, the company disclosed in an earlier filing."
1528,"In its new filing, Lyft proposed a high-end share price of $62 to $68, a range that would generate about $2.1 billion, and perhaps as much as $2.4 billion if demand for shares is great enough for the company to increase the number it makes available."
1529,"Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer are set to reap hundreds of millions of dollars apiece as a result of the offering, the updated prospectus showed. Mr. Green’s stake would be worth about $569 million at the high end of the expected initial share price; Mr. Zimmer’s would be worth about $393 million."
1530,"Perhaps more important, the two men would retain control of Lyft, thanks to their ownership of a special class of shares that gives them 20 times the voting power of regular shareholders, despite each of them owning less than 3 percent of the company."
1531,"The arrangement is common in I.P.O.s by founder-led technology companies. Facebook and Snap, for example, ensured that their creators would keep an iron grip on their businesses. But the practice has been criticized by investor advocates who say that it creates a disadvantage for regular shareholders."
1532,"“This arrangement imposes a significant gap between those who exercise control over the company, and those who have economic exposure to the consequences of that control,” a coalition of institutional investors wrote in a letter last week to Lyft’s board that asked them to reconsider the arrangement."
1533,"In a video promoting the company’s roadshow that was also released on Monday, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer discussed their reasons for founding Lyft. The video showed Mr. Green, 35, riding a public bus in San Francisco and recalling a visit to Zimbabwe, where he drew inspiration from car pools he saw there. Mr. Zimmer, 34, reflected on his time in hotel management while wandering through a hotel parking garage."
1534,"In the video, the pair then meet in the back seat of a car, where they hinted at their advantages: Their company is still led by its founders, they said, and is solely focused on consumer transportation without side bets in food delivery and freight shipments. Their message was a dig at Uber, whose founders are no longer in executive roles at the company and which has expanded into food delivery with Uber Eats and freight shipments with Uber Freight."
1535,"“Car ownership in the U.S. is failing people,” Mr. Zimmer said in the video, suggesting that the transportation industry will eventually flip from car ownership to ride services like Lyft."
1536,"The price for Lyft’s shares is expected to be finalized on March 28, according to Ipreo, setting the company up to begin trading on the stock market on March 29."
1537,"No matter who crosses the finish line first at the Daytona 500 on Sunday, it is all but certain what the winning driver will do: stop his car in front of the main grandstands, rev his engine, and then delight the crowd with a smoky burnout as he sends his car spinning in big loops."
1538,"“You’re so hyped up after winning that you want to do something destructive,” said Jimmie Johnson, the 2013 Daytona 500 winner."
1539,"Victory donuts — as those exuberant, rubber-burning celebrations have come to be known — might be ubiquitous in auto racing now, but they were not common in Nascar until 1998. That is when Dale Earnhardt artfully used his spinning tires to carve a “3”— his car’s famous number — in the grass between the track and the pit lane after his first, and only, Daytona 500 victory."
1540,"Two decades later, after Joey Logano won the 2018 season’s final race to clinch his first Monster Energy Cup series title, his celebration was similar: looping donuts with his yellow Ford before and after grabbing a championship flag."
1541,"“The big smoky ones, to me, don’t really do it,” Logano said recently. “Anyone can park the car and burn the tires out.”"
1542,"But although the donut may be the most recognizable postrace tradition for winners, that does nor necessarily mean fast driving translates into beautiful celebratory spins. Jeff Gordon, now a Nascar analyst on Fox, won 93 Cup races during his Hall of Fame career but said he was never all that good at doing postrace donuts — obliging only because fans would have been “let down and disappointed” if he didn’t."
1543,"“I remember making some comments about doing my first donut,” Gordon said, “and I don’t think I did a very good one. But I said I saw all these kids doing it, so I’d definitely have to do it, too.”"
1544,"Earnhardt may have popularized the donut in Nascar, but there is a chance it never would have made its way to American racing circles without Alex Zanardi, the Italian who joined the now-defunct Championship Auto Racing Teams open-wheel series in 1996."
1545,"Zanardi, who came from Formula One, started out in the pole position each of his first two races in his second year in CART but finished out of the top three in both. In the third race, on a street course in Long Beach, Calif., Zanardi started second but passed Jimmy Vasser with 12 laps left and held on to win."
1546,"After the victory, he took his car to Turn 1 and whipped his car around in a donut."
1547,"“It was basically a fantastic way to start the season, and I was so happy,” Zanardi said in a recent interview, adding: “People made a big thing out of it, like, ‘Wow, yeah, he’s spinning donuts!’ So they encouraged me to do it again."
1548,"“It wasn’t long before fans would call me Mr. Donut, Donut King, and so on. People would start to show up with a case of doughnuts.”"
1549,"But CART officials were not as enthused, telling Zanardi to cool it with the donuts out of safety concerns for reporters and photographers near the track. His peers did not immediately fall in love with the celebration, either."
1550,"Zanardi said: “Other drivers would say: ‘I’d never do something like that. Come on. That is beyond the limit. It’s dangerous, and it’s showing off too much. Be happy with your race win you just earned.’ ”"
1551,"So he held off on the donuts after back-to-back victories in Michigan and Ohio, but picked it back up after a third win, in Wisconsin, en route to his first CART title."
1552,"The donut came to Nascar courtesy of the veteran driver Ron Hornaday Jr., who executed them in the Craftsman Truck Series in 1995. They were not appreciated by the truck’s owner, Earnhardt, who thought it was too hard on the transmission. Earnhardt, who died in a crash at Daytona in 2001, told Hornaday to knock it off, but the idea, it seems, grew on him until he was willing to use it himself."
1553,"Johnson, a seven-time Monster Energy Cup Series champion, has become something of an expert on donuts simply because of how often he has won. His favorite donuts, he said, are those by the former Cup driver Greg Biffle and the 28-year-old Logano, who has won 21 Cup races and “is pretty cool to watch” doing donuts, Johnson said."
1554,"Zanardi, who lost his legs in a crash in Germany in 2001, said it was not all that difficult to do a good burnout and donut on a car with a standard transmission: Put the car in gear, he said, let out the clutch “quite brutally” so the wheels start to spin, and then turn the steering wheel as the tires spin to twirl the car around."
1555,"Johnson discovered the hard way that the best method was to put the car in second gear before spinning the wheels. After his first Cup victory in 2002 in Fontana, Calif., Johnson tried doing celebratory donuts, at a high cost to his Chevrolet."
1556,"“At first, we had this discussion where we wanted to do a burnout in reverse,” Johnson said after the race. “And I tried that, and I blew the transmission out of it. And then I was doing the donuts and I burned the motor up."
1557,"“So it was just a bad last five minutes there on the racetrack, but I wanted to do some donuts and boil the tires off this Chevrolet.”"
1558,"Zanardi, 52, has won four gold medals in paracycling at the Paralympics, and in January raced a specially fitted BMW in the Rolex 24, a 24-hour endurance auto race, at Daytona. He said he could have used a traction-control button on his steering wheel to do a donut if his team had won, but, unfortunately for Zanardi and fans of donuts, it did not."
1559,"While still known as the godfather of the donut, Zanardi finds some amusement in his unusual role in racing history."
1560,"“I didn’t invent anything,” he said. “Of course, I have an ego. When somebody points out that I was the first one to do something like this, yes, there’s a small reason for pride. But I’d be much happier if people still believed it was a stupid thing to do — and I’d have another opportunity to do it.”"
1561,"Good Sunday morning, and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing, where we’ll take a deep dive into Lyft’s upcoming public offering. It’s the first of many decacorns about to go public. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)"
1562,Lyft plans to make its public market debut in the coming week. The car sharing company’s I.P.O. will be the first of many highly valued tech companies that are expected to hit American stock exchanges this year.
1563,"Uber, Slack, Postmates and Pinterest have all filed documents with the S.E.C. to list shares. Palantir, Peloton and possibly Airbnb are expected to follow later this year."
1564,America’s most successful start-ups have remained off-limits to most investors for years:
1565,• Venture capital cash allowed America’s current wave of unicorns to eschew the public markets — and the spotlight that comes with them.
1566,• That means a large portion of investors have been unable to buy a slice of the fastest-growing start-ups.
1567,"With Lyft’s I.P.O., that’s about to change, which explains much of the excitement it is generating. Here’s your cheat sheet for the offering."
1568,____________________________
1569,Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in New York and edited by Jamie Condliffe in London.
1570,____________________________
1571,"Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. In 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer renamed the company Lyft and shifted the business toward providing short trips, mimicking taxi rides."
1572,Here’s how it sizes up today:
1573,"• Lyft gave 18.6 million people at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016."
1574,"• It has a 39 percent share of the United States ride-sharing market,  based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft. That is up from 22 percent in 2016. But Lyft has been offering discounts to riders ahead of its offering, and the company warned: “We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives.”"
1575,"• Lyft only operates in the U.S. and Canada, unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe."
1576,"• But it has matched its rival’s innovation, by developing self-driving car technology and expanding into short-term bike and scooter rentals."
1577,"Lyft will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of, er, “LYFT.”"
1578,"The company expects to be valued at as much as $23 billion. It plans to sell about 35.4 million shares, including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters, at between $62 to $68 a piece. At the high-end of that range, it will raise $2.4 billion."
1579,That’s well above the $15.1 billion that private investors valued it at during a financing round in June.
1580,"And it would make it one of the largest I.P.O.s in the past 10 years. At a $23 billion valuation, Lyft’s offering would rank as the fifth largest since the financial crisis, and among the largest ever for American technology start-ups — only Facebook’s I.P.O. in 2012 would be larger."
1581," JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies are the lead underwriters of the I.P.O. for Lyft. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the top underwriters of tech I.P.O.s recently, are both working on Uber’s offering."
1582,"In all, Lyft will have 29 underwriters for its I.P.O., 13 (or 45 percent) of which are firms owned or led by women, minorities and military veterans. By comparison, such firms accounted for 30 percent of the underwriters Facebook selected for its I.P.O. and 14 percent for Snap’s."
1583,"After going public, the company will have two classes of stock: class A shares, which carry one vote each, and class B shares, which carry 20 votes. Lyft plans to sell only class A shares in the offering."
1584,"Lyft’s two founders will hold the Class B shares. That means that Mr. Green, the C.E.O., and Mr. Zimmer, the president, will own roughly 5 percent of the company’s outstanding stock but control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares."
1585,This is quite normal in Silicon Valley. Facebook and Google went public with a dual-class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. Snap went further: It issued only nonvoting shares during its 2017 I.P.O.
1586,"But the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts. Kenneth Bertsch, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said in a letter to Lyft’s outside board members: “The principle of one-share, one-vote is a foundation of good corporate governance and equitable treatment of investors.”"
1587,"Companies with dual-class stock structures outperformed those with a single stock structure in recent years, according to some studies. But prior to 2010, studies show, such companies didn’t perform as well."
1588,Lyft is growing quickly. Its revenue more than doubled to $2.16 billion last year from 2017.
1589,"Its losses are also increasing, though not nearly as quickly. The company reported a loss of $911 million last year, up from $688 million in 2017. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017."
1590," Uber’s losses are smaller in percentage terms. Lyft’s rival, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $1.8 billion in 2018 on net revenue of $11.3 billion."
1591,"Bookings, which represent fares less taxes, tolls and tips, surpassed $8 billion last year for Lyft, 76 percent more than in 2017. (In 2018, Uber increased its bookings to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017.)"
1592,"Lyft plans to funnel some future profits into ethical investing. In its pitch to investors, it says it expects “to invest the greater of 1% of our profits or $50 million annually toward our social impact efforts.”"
1593,"The risk factor section of any I.P.O. prospectus acts as a warning label for investors. Lyft’s is no different, but it offers a discussion of regulatory and data security issues that could become a recurring theme in this year’s I.P.O.s."
1594,"Rivals: The company faces a long list of competitors on several fronts. Uber, Gett (along with its acquisition Juno) and Via are its main ride-sharing rivals, along with regular taxi companies and automotive manufacturers, such as BMW, that are looking to enter the sector. Its bike and scooter sharing business faces competition from Lime, Bird and Uber’s acquisition Jump. And Waymo, Apple, Baidu, Uber and a number of other tech and auto companies compete with it on autonomous vehicles."
1595,"Regulation: Lyft says its industry is “rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated.” It warns investors that it has “been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ride sharing.”"
1596,"Labor: Lyft’s million-plus drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Legal actions that classify them as employees “could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,” the company says."
1597,"Autonomous driving: Among the biggest risks involved in the push to driverless cars is getting beaten in the race. The first companies to offer autonomous ride sharing “are expected to have long-term advantages compared with traditional non-autonomous ride sharing offerings,” Lyft says."
1598,"For Lyft’s current shareholders and employees, the I.P.O. could provide a windfall. Here’s a rundown of who stands to gain."
1599,"• Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer will hold stakes in the company that are set to be worth $570 million and $390 million, respectively."
1600,"• The Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten is Lyft’s biggest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake. At $68 a share, its holdings would be valued at $2.1 billion. It will own 11.6 percent of Lyft’s stock after the I.P.O."
1601,• General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft in 2016. That stake could be worth as much as $1.27 billion at the time of the I.P.O.
1602,• The fund giant Fidelity is Lyft’s third largest shareholder. Its stake could be worth as much as $1.26 billion.
1603,"• Alphabet owns 12,828,964 shares, most of them purchased by its venture capital arm, CapitalG. That stake is worth $870 million at the high end of the range."
1604,"• The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was among the earliest investors in Lyft. At $68 a share, the firm’s stake will be valued at just over $1 billion."
1605,"Governments and money managers have made a push to improve gender diversity on corporate boards. Last fall, California, where Lyft is headquartered, became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards."
1606,Lyft will have three women on its board:
1607,• Valerie Jarrett. The former senior adviser to President Barack Obama has been on Lyft’s board since July 2017.
1608,• Maggie Wilderotter. The former chief executive of the telecom company Frontier Communications joined Lyft’s board in May 2018.
1609,"• Ann Miura-Ko. The co-founder of Floodgate Fund, a venture capital firm, has served on the board since June 2016."
1610,"Rounding out the board of directors are: its chairman, Sean Aggarwal, of Soar Capital; Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz; David Lawee of CapitalG; and Hiroshi Mikitani of Rakuten."
1611,"Lyft and Uber are unlike any other businesses, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. That “makes it difficult for potential investors to feel confident that they’re paying the right price given the potential reward and the potential risk that the on-demand ride business isn’t financially viable or as large as optimists believe.”"
1612,"Lyft’s investors “will need to strap themselves in for what may be long periods of rather ugly numbers,” according to Heard on the Street’s Dan Gallagher. That’s because “decacorns tend to share two characteristics: plenty of money and a propensity to spend it in a race to build up share.”"
1613,"“Investors may still want to decide between” Lyft and Uber, argues Richard Beales of Breakingviews. “If their fear of missing out allows them to look past the absence of foreseeable profit at either company, though, it’s hard to see any sensible course other than to put money on both.”"
1614,"“The last time a fast-growing, lossmaking tech company tried this hard to persuade Wall Street to judge it by its own measure of profits, things didn’t end well,” the FT’s Richard Waters writes. He is referring to Groupon."
1615,"An I.P.O. prospectus often features an idealistic, sometimes corny, letter from the company’s founders about their vision for the firm. Here are a couple of choice cuts from Lyft’s letter:"
1616,"“The Y in Lyft. The why in what Lyft is doing is most important to us, as well as the cities and communities we serve, and it will always be our company’s North Star. Lyft’s mission is to: improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.”"
1617,"“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car. We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”"

1621,"SAN FRANCISCO — In a rush to beat its rival Uber to the public market, Lyft is preparing to start trading in early April, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans."
1622,"Lyft intends to begin its roadshow, in which it meets with investors to talk up the initial public offering, the week of March 18, the two people said. Companies usually start trading a week or so after a roadshow."
1623,"If Lyft wins this race, it will be the first ride-hailing company to go public. The two companies have been locked in a competition to go public, with Lyft facing pressure to be first to avoid being overshadowed by Uber, which is much larger."
1624,"The start-up, founded in 2007 by Logan Green and John Zimmer, is one of several tech companies pushing to go public early this year. Slack and Pinterest are among the others."
1625,Lyft and Uber declined to comment.
1626,"Lyft and Uber have competed fiercely for riders and drivers since their earliest days, often introducing copycat services within days of each other. In keeping with that tradition, both filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day in early December."
1627,"The review of their filings stalled briefly when the government partially shut down later that month. The review process may take longer for Uber than for Lyft, because Uber is involved in several secondary businesses, like food and freight deliveries. Uber and Lyft both operate bike and scooter services, as well as self-driving car development wings."
1628,"Lyft will list on the Nasdaq and expects to be valued between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to the people familiar with the company’s plans. The details about Lyft’s pending roadshow were first reported by Reuters."
1629,"The Lyft listing is a win for Nasdaq, which struggled to attract tech companies after the exchange suffered delays and technical issues during Facebook’s I.P.O. and faced tough competition from the New York Stock Exchange for tech debuts. In the aftermath of the Facebook fumble, tech firms like Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, Square, and Twitter went public on the Big Board."
1630,"Lyft was last valued by private investors at $15.1 billion, and has selected JPMorgan Chase to lead its public offering."
1631,"The black sedan glided up to the Las Vegas hotel where Elizabeth Suarez was waiting to take an Uber home after a night of gambling. She recalled asking the driver: Are you waiting for Liz? Yeah, he responded. Get in."
1632,"She had done it countless times. But that night in July 2018, as the man veered off course toward a deserted parking lot, as he cranked up the radio and ignored her questions, as her real driver called her wondering where she was, Ms. Suarez said she realized with horror: This was not an Uber."
1633,"“That’s when he said, ‘Give me your wallet, give me your phone, give me everything you have,’” Ms. Suarez, 28, said."
1634,"On busy streets outside bars or clubs, people often hop into a car without a second thought. But the killing of Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old college student in South Carolina who was stabbed to death after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber last weekend, has brought national attention to a rash of kidnappings, sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as ride-share drivers."
1635,"There have been at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years, according to a tally of publicly reported cases, including instances where suspects have been charged with attacking multiple women. In Connecticut, a man was arraigned last week on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who believed he was their ride-share driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women, climbing into the back seat and pinning them down."
1636,"These attacks turn a simple mix-up into a nightmare, showing how easily bad actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of a ride-sharing culture that so many people trust to get them home safe."

1638,"The drivers troll nightclubs and bars late at night to find people scanning the dark for their ride, according to law enforcement descriptions of the assaults. They wave to passengers and say, “I’m your driver.” Some even hang ride-share decals in their windows."
1639,"The attacks represent a tiny fraction of the millions of uneventful rides that Americans hail every day. But Ms. Josephson’s murder has forced ride-sharing companies to address renewed safety concerns, led to legislative proposals and public efforts to reduce future attacks, and prompted passengers across the country to weigh the risks of climbing into a stranger’s back seat."
1640,"“It could be any one of us,” said Kate Lewis, a junior at the University of South Carolina, where Ms. Josephson had been a senior about to head to law school."
1641,[Have you had a scary experience with what you thought was a ride-share driver? Please share your experiences in the comments.]
1642,"State lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law named for Ms. Josephson that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign from their company. Her father, Seymour Josephson, has become an outspoken advocate for stronger safety measures, saying at a vigil this week, “I don’t want anyone else to go through it as a parent.”"
1643,"At the University of South Carolina, students have started a new safety campaign that urges riders to ask, “What’s my name?” to ensure they are talking to their actual ride-share drivers before getting into a car."
1644,"Students described the campaign as one constructive action they could take amid a week of stunned grief and candlelit vigils, after the police announced on Saturday that they had found Ms. Josephson’s body in the woods 70 miles away. She had last been seen at 2 a.m. Friday in a busy downtown neighborhood in Columbia, S.C., getting into a black Chevrolet Impala."
1645,"The security footage of those moments is haunting: As Ms. Josephson gets into the back seat, there are people everywhere, tapping on their phones, hugging one another’s shoulders, enjoying the night."
1646,"The police charged Nathaniel David Rowland, 24, with kidnapping and killing Ms. Josephson. They said they had found Ms. Josephson’s blood and her cellphone in Mr. Rowland’s car, along with bleach and cleaning supplies. The child-safety locks had been engaged."
1647,"Mr. Rowland has not entered a plea, and his lawyer declined to comment. He was not an Uber driver, the company said."
1648,"“Everyone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime,” Grant Klinzman, a company spokesman, said in an email. “We spoke with the University of South Carolina president and will be partnering with the university to raise awareness on college campuses nationwide about this incredibly important issue.”"
1649,"Uber sent a message to its users on Thursday advising them to match the license plate, car make and model and to check the driver’s photograph before taking a ride."
1650,"In the wake of reports of Ms. Josephson’s death, Carla Westlund, 30, thought once again about the night in 2017 when she was raped in Los Angeles by a man she mistakenly thought was her Uber driver. She said she fell asleep in the back seat of the car and woke to him beating her head against the seat."
1651,"“He had an Uber sticker,” she said. “He was pretending to be an Uber driver.”"
1652,"After three hours in his car, Ms. Westlund said she was able to convince the man to let her go outside her boyfriend’s house, and she immediately reported the attack and went to the hospital. Ms. Westlund said she felt re-victimized by reporting the crime — a common complaint from sexual-assault survivors. She said that she had given additional details of the attack as she remembered more with each retelling, but that the officers had characterized this as changing her story."
1653,"“I felt like I was definitely being treated like I did something wrong,” she said. She now volunteers with PAVE, a nonprofit that works to end sexual violence."
1654,"In February 2018, Nicolas Morales was arrested and charged with raping her and six other women by posing as a ride-share driver. He pleaded not guilty and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 8."
1655,"Uber and Lyft have been criticized in the past for not adequately vetting their drivers or doing enough to ensure passenger safety, which has led to temporary bans or restrictions on the services in some cities. A 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. The companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority."
1656,"Uber said it has worked with law enforcement since 2017 to teach riders how to avoid impostors. Last year, it added a panic button that lets riders tap their screens and dial 911 directly from the app."
1657,Uber and Lyft also distribute glowing dashboard lights in some markets called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. The lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers.
1658,"Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who hosts a podcast called The Rideshare Guy, said it was common for people to hop into the wrong car in the crush outside bars, airports, games or concerts, where hundreds of people are jostling for their cars."
1659,"“These sorts of mistakes are happening all the time,” Mr. Campbell said. “But there are some bad actors who realize this and take advantage.”"
1660,"It is not hard to fake, safety experts and law enforcement authorities said."
1661,"Knockoff decals and light-up signs saying “Uber” and “Lyft” are easy to buy from major online retailers. Impostors trawl night spots when people have often been drinking and are particularly vulnerable, as they part with friends for the evening and search the dark for an unfamiliar car."
1662,"“They’re taking advantage of an individual who’s intoxicated and doesn’t have all their senses. They’re going to overlook little warning signs,” said Lt. Harrison Daniel of the Athens-Clarke County Police in Georgia, where a man was charged with posing as an Uber driver and raping a college student last year."
1663,"Identifying the attackers can also be difficult. Unlike actual ride-share drivers, they do not register their personal details in a ride-hailing service’s database, so police have to pull security footage, look for witnesses and search the streets for cars matching a suspect’s vehicle."
1664,"The driver who abducted and robbed Ms. Suarez in an empty parking lot behind a grocery store early that morning in July 2018 still has not been arrested, though police said the investigation was active."
1665,"Ms. Suarez escaped by jumping out of his moving car. She cracked her skull and broke her wrist and ankle. When she reported the attack, she said the police had seemed leery of her story and asked her about how she was dressed and what she had been doing out at 4 a.m."
1666,"She decided to speak out about the attack, posting photos of her injuries on social media and talking to a local television station. Some people responded by saying she was “crying wolf” and was to blame for getting into the wrong car."
1667,Ms. Suarez said she believed that the man who attacked her was not there by coincidence that night.
1668,"“He was waiting for the right person,” she said. “He knew exactly what time to be out there. I think he’d done it in the past, and he’ll continue to do it. Because he’s still out there.”"

1670,"Lyft, just days into its existence as a publicly traded company, is drawing unwanted interest from Wall Street’s pessimists."
1671,"Traders who bet that the stock will decline are piling into the ride-sharing company. These so-called short-sellers borrow and sell the shares, hoping to buy them back at a lower price sometime in the future."
1672,"One way to gauge their interest in a stock is to look at the number of shares that are being lent, and as of Wednesday, 9.2 million shares, or $662 million worth of Lyft, were on loan, according to the data provider IHS Markit. That was equal to 28 percent of the shares actually available for trading, known as the float."
1673,"By comparison, just 2 percent of Twitter’s float, and a similar amount of Snap’s, was on loan at the same point after their initial public offerings. For Facebook, that percentage was 8 percent."
1674,"Currently, the shares on loan from Facebook and Twitter total fewer than 1 percent, and at Snap they’re nearly 9 percent."
1675,"The percentage of shares on loan at Lyft is roughly equal to the level at Tesla, the electric-car maker, whose chief executive has waged a very public fight with short-sellers, accusing them of conspiring to bring his company down."
1676,"Since making its public market debut on Friday, Lyft’s stock has stumbled. Shares closed Wednesday at $72, equal to Lyft’s I.P.O. price and off nearly 18 percent from their opening trade."
1677,"Lyft’s performance is not unusual. Facebook fell below its offer price during its first week, and Snap traded well below its opening price in its first week."
1678,"But the company’s debut was a test of investor appetite for fast-growing but unprofitable tech companies. While Lyft’s revenue more than doubled last year, it lost nearly $1 billion, and a number of Wall Street analysts have questioned whether it can maintain its current growth trajectory."
1679,The short-sellers are betting it can’t.
1680,"During a 10-day tour of India, Farryn Truen sketched out an ambitious itinerary to visit Delhi, Jaipur, Ranthambore National Park, Alwar and Agra, that included a big-ticket item: She and her now-husband, Jake, hired a private driver for their trip. Paying for that meant forgoing activities — there was no hot air balloon ride in Jaipur — and downgrading to budget-friendly hotels for part of the trip."
1681,"But it’s the go-to travel splurge for Ms. Truen, 33, a New York-based brand consultant and frequent traveler: a way to see more of the place she is visiting at her own pace, make local connections, and avoid all the wasted time spent traveling to, from and in airports."
1682,"“My husband and I have this joke that we’ve had some of our favorite meals at rest stops because you get to see real life,” Ms. Truen said. “Immersing myself in a place is the ultimate luxury.”"
1683,"Among seasoned travelers, selective splurging — picking the one thing they’ll spend big on, while saving everywhere else — is a common strategy for getting the most out of a trip. The additional spend doesn’t have to be sizable; it can be several thousand on a nice hotel room — or a hundred dollars or less on a local experience. It’s about mindfully choosing to allocate a little extra on one part of the trip to make it easier, more memorable or more engaging."
1684,"The indulgences can be directed at any step of the adventure: hotel, excursions, a particularly unforgettable meal. For some, practical upgrades — a nonstop flight, a nicer rental car — make all the difference. Chris Jackson, a London-based photographer for Getty Images, recommends a good pair of noise-cancelling headphones. “They make a massive difference,” Mr. Jackson said of his Bose Quietcomfort 35 II pair ($349.95). He often doesn’t even play music on them, preferring to just drown out other passengers."
1685,"Elaine Welteroth, an author and the former editor in chief of Teen Vogue, always hunts for a fabulous vintage souvenir. The 32-year-old’s closet is home to a few 40s-style dresses from a shop in Amsterdam that cost about $60 apiece and a Calvin Klein Collection faux fur coat that she “spent way too much on” in New Orleans. “Every item is totally unique to that place and time in my life,” she said."
1686,"Strategic luxury can be a way of splurging and saving at the same time. The actress, author and talk show host Busy Philipps doesn’t always travel on a budget, but when she does she makes finding the perfect resort her focus, then economizes on the room. “We will rent the cheapest room in the nicest hotel,” she said. “I don’t mind, on vacation, being cramped.”"
1687,"Last year, she and her family stayed at the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita in Mexico. The family of four squeezed into one of the hotel’s standard rooms (which can range from $450 to $2,200 a night, depending on the season, according to the hotel) with her two daughters sleeping on a pull-out couch. While the same money would have bought a bigger room at a less luxurious resort, it wouldn’t have given them the access to the same pristine beaches and infinity-edge pool. And springing for a one-bedroom at Punta Mita would have cost twice what they paid. (She also recommends a beach-side massage, which provides a relaxing indulgence without sacrificing lounging time.)"
1688,"In the United States, spending on travel, which includes transportation, lodging and tourist attractions, was expected to reach an estimated $580 billion in 2018, an increase of 23 percent from 2013, according to the market research firm Euromonitor International. Travelers tend to splurge most on where they are headed: More than eight in 10 respondents in the 2017 U.S. Family Travel Survey said they would splurge on the destination. The study, conducted by the Family Travel Association and the Tisch Center for Hospitality at New York University’s School of Professional Studies, surveyed 1,599 people, each representing one family."
1689,Roughly six in 10 will splurge on accommodations and meals out.
1690,"This kind of spending — on experiences, rather than more stuff — is a good idea, said Michael Norton, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School. That’s because, by and large, it’s more satisfying. If it’s between spending $2,000 on a television or a vacation, “for most people the $2,000 vacation will make them happier,” according to Dr. Norton."
1691,"But splurging is most effective when done sparingly, something people sometimes forget in this era of overconsumption, Dr. Norton said. “The specialness of the one can be really meaningful,” he said."
1692,"Buying yourself time can lead to greater happiness, but it is something many people are reluctant to do."
1693,"Ashley Muir Bruhn, who lives in Davis, Calif., recommends paying extra for a direct flight. The mother of two and author of the blog Hither & Thither argues that whatever money you save on connecting flights is negated by the added risks. Missing your next flight or losing your bags is a terrific way to ruin a trip. Two shorter legs could mean less in-flight service, and how much more would you pay for those extra hours at the pool where you are headed?"
1694,"Plus, there is the mental toll, especially with children (hers are ages 5 and 7). By booking connecting flights, “you’ve made your whole travel time — the not-fun part — so much longer,” Ms. Muir Bruhn, 40, said. Her family takes two to three major trips a year and will go out of their way to get a direct flight. Instead of flying out of Sacramento, the closest airport, she will travel to Oakland or even San Francisco in order to fly nonstop. "
1695,"Some travelers splurge on making their first moments hassle free. Tina Leung, a stylist and blogger who splits her time between New York and Hong Kong, always hires a black car to pick her up from the airport. “I’m so happy to see someone holding a sign with my name,” Ms. Leung said. “You don’t have to think about it, right when you get off the plane and you’re already frazzled.”"
1696,"She appreciates it most during fashion week in Paris, which comes after the shows in New York, London and Milan, when she’s lowest on sleep and highest on luggage. The cars often have a phone charger and water ready for her. “It’s small little things that make all the difference,” she said."
1697,"Patrick Janelle, whose food-and-travel-focused Instagram account @aguynamedpatrick boasts 439,000 followers, splurges on upgrading his rental car. “With just a little extra spending, you can make a really significant part of your travel that much more comfortable,” he said. Mr. Janelle, a 37-year-old New Yorker, once rented a Volvo SUV in Los Angeles via Sixt Rent, a German-based company that offers up-market cars. It was about $360 for four days, Mr. Janelle says, and he planned his day around conference calls on the go."
1698,"In Europe, Mr. Janelle prefers to rent scooters. The pristine, royal blue Vespa he rented in Cannes, spending about $280 dollars for three days, made for the perfect backdrop for one of his Instagram posts. “I’m often thinking about what details in my life in general are photo-worthy,” Mr. Janelle said, “or what I can do to make them photo-worthy.”"
1699,"Lodging is a much more common splurge, whether on a carefully situated (and decorated) AirBnb or a four-star hotel. “I want to wake up in a place that brings me joy,” said Ukonwa Ojo, a New York-based marketing executive. “I’m inelastic when it comes to cost on that.” She researches heavily before booking, reading reviews everywhere she can find them and making sure the accommodations are known for their high-touch service. Her stays have ranged from a room with a sea view at the Sofitel Bahrain that won’t break the bank (up to $320 a night, according to the hotel) to the Zen grand experience at the all-inclusive Grand Velas Riviera Maya in Mexico (starting at $434 per person based on double occupancy, according to the hotel)."
1700,"Ms. Ojo remembers her stay at the Taj Exotica in the Maldives, in a deluxe lagoon over-water villa (from $1,109 to $1,725 a night, double occupancy, according to the hotel),  particularly fondly: “You didn’t even want to leave your room it was just so special,” Ms. Ojo said."
1701,"Hotel splurging is not limited to cash. The longtime journalist Dan Frommer, 36, founder of the travel rewards newsletter Points Party, will go out of his way on a work trip to earn enough Hyatt points for a later luxury stay on vacation. On a work trip to San Francisco last year, he stayed in a Hyatt to get the points, even though it was in Emeryville, on the other side of the Bay and required an extensive bus ride each morning."
1702,"The reward? “I’m overlooking this skyline of Tokyo,” he said, talking by phone from the 48th floor of the Andaz hotel there, where the entry-level rooms range from 40,000 to 123,000 yen per night, according to the hotel (roughly $360 to $1,100 depending on the time of year). The points price is steep, too — it cost him 25,000 a night — but worth it, he said."
1703,"“When you are on the other side of the world, when your sleep schedule is messed up, it’s really nice to come back to a large, well-designed, well-appointed room with a beautiful view,” Mr. Frommer said. His strategy is to splurge for three nights. One night goes by too quickly; two is adequate, giving you one whole day to “spread your stuff out,” Mr. Frommer said. But three feels like a real indulgence and enough time to enjoy all the hotel has to offer. "
1704,"If he’s spending money, as opposed to points, Mr. Frommer, founder of a new online publication called The New Consumer, is willing to pay for the possibility of a “life-altering meal,” he said. He had just eaten at Inua, the new Tokyo restaurant from Noma-trained Thomas Frebel, with friends (his share of the tab: $333.41) and was still processing the dish made from nasturtium leaf and enoki mushroom. And he was more than happy to eat hard-boiled eggs and salmon onigiri rice balls from the corner store some days as a trade off. "
1705,"“Splurging on food is totally an acceptable and worthwhile and delightful way to spend too much money,” he said. "

1708,"A 27-year-old Uber driver was fatally stabbed in the Bronx on Saturday night in a vivid reminder of the perils of the job, the police and driver groups said."
1709,"The driver, Ganiou Gandonou, was found shortly after 9 p.m. seated inside a black Toyota Camry with stab wounds to his neck and torso, the police said. The police are looking for the attacker and investigating whether Mr. Gandonou’s death began as a robbery."
1710,"On Sunday evening, the police released video of a “person of interest” wanted in the killing. The man fled the scene on foot and was last seen walking northbound on Co-op City Boulevard wearing dark clothing, the police said."
1711,"The police did not say if the “person of interest” was a passenger. The driver was working at the time, but the police did not say whether he was completing a trip when he was stabbed."
1712,"Mr. Gandonou drove for Uber and had received his for-hire vehicle license in January 2017, according to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission."
1713,"He left home around 7 p.m. on Saturday to work a shift picking up passengers, but he never came home, his wife said in an interview with News 12. He had a 2-year-old son."
1714,"“My husband doesn’t deserve this,” she said. “I don’t know how my life’s going to be without him.”"
1715,"Driving a taxi or for-hire vehicle has long been a dangerous job. In the early 1990s, dozens of livery drivers were killed on the job in a single year and many more were assaulted or robbed."
1716,"An Uber spokesman, Grant Klinzman, called Mr. Gandonou’s death “a horribly tragic incident,” adding, “our hearts go out to the grieving family.”"
1717,"“We stand ready to work with law enforcement to assist their investigation in any way possible,” Mr. Klinzman said in a statement."
1718,"On Sunday, a driver group offered a $3,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the killing."
1719,"“We call on anyone who may have witnessed the attack to contact the police so that the culprit may be brought to justice,” the group, the Independent Drivers Guild, said in a statement."
1720,"Violence and threats are part of being a professional driver, said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance."
1721,"“Knowing how to protect yourself from crime is as critical to a driver as knowing the names of streets and avenues,” Ms. Desai said. “It’s a part of their day-to-day life behind the wheel.”"
1722,"Mr. Gandonou was taken from the car, which was found on the Hutchinson River Parkway East, to Jacobi Medical Center, where he died. His vehicle and driver’s license were in good standing, according to the taxi commission."
1723,"A 68-year-old Uber driver died in 2017 after he was hit in the head with a hockey stick by a pedestrian during a dispute in Manhattan, the police said. A man was arrested, but the charges were later dropped."
1724,"In 2014, two livery drivers were killed in the Bronx in the span of a month, prompting concerns over driver safety. The taxi commission requires most taxis and for-hire vehicles to have stickers in back seats reminding passengers that assaulting a driver is punishable by up to 25 years in prison."
1725,"On Sunday, the taxi commission offered condolences to Mr. Gandonou’s family."
1726,"“We hope there is swift justice for the for-hire vehicle driver that was killed this weekend,” the commission said in a statement, “and that the perpetrator is quickly apprehended.”"
1727,"SAN FRANCISCO — Owning a piece of the gig economy became a reality for millions on Friday when Lyft began trading on the public markets, signaling the start of a stream of stock offerings expected from high-profile technology companies this year."
1728,"Lyft’s shares rose 8.7 percent in its first day of trading after opening at $87.24, far above the public offering price of $72. By the end of the day, the ride-hailing firm’s market value stood at $26.4 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade. At that level, it was more than 23 times the valuation of the parent company of Hertz, the rental car provider, and bigger than the parent of United Airlines."
1729,"Lyft’s public market debut formalized the rise of the sharing economy, even though persistent questions remain about the effect of gig-type work on people’s quality of life and their wages. When ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber began growing this decade, they hawked their kind of work — where drivers are freelancers who drive only when they want to — as providing flexibility. But with drivers ineligible to receive employee benefits like health care, the businesses have since prompted lawsuits and labor protests."
1730,"Gig economy companies also have not proved a business fundamental: that they can make money. While Lyft and Uber have been expanding rapidly, they have lost close to or more than $1 billion a year. And the companies are spending heavily on new initiatives like food delivery, electric bikes and self-driving vehicles, making profits a distant prospect."
1731,"[Unicorns are riding into the public markets, and their elite early investors will be the biggest winners.]"
1732,"Even so, Lyft’s offering means that people will now own shares of the company in their mutual funds and stock portfolios, giving them more of a vested interest in the financial outcomes of gig economy firms. That will be compounded when Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing operator, goes public in the next few months in what is expected to be the largest initial public offering of the past five years. Uber will almost certainly become part of index funds, which underlie the retirement portfolios of millions of Americans."
1733,"“Their business model is completely reliant on an unsettled issue, which is the status of their drivers,” Veena Dubal, an employment and labor law professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, said of ride-hailing companies. “They’ve been trying to shift risk onto workers, and now they are shifting risk onto investors as well.”"
1734,"Those risks sent jitters through some investors on Friday, with Lyft’s shares falling after opening up strongly. The stock dipped to roughly $80 before declining further near the end of trading to finish the day at $78.29."
1735,"But others turned a blind eye to the steep losses and heavy spending, which bodes well for the herd of other coming tech offerings. Apart from Uber, those set to join the I.P.O. bonanza are Pinterest, the digital pin board; the messaging company Slack; the delivery company Postmates; and the home-fitness company Peloton."
1736,"Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors."
1737,"Interest in buying Lyft’s stock was so high that demand outstripped supply within the first two days of the company’s road show to pitch prospective investors this month. By the end, the I.P.O. was 20 times oversubscribed, Lyft told investors on Friday."
1738,"Lyft’s high listing price and performance are a “reflection of the appetite” from investors, said Tom White, a senior vice president at D. A. Davidson, a wealth and asset management firm. “Right now, I think investors generally are focused on growth.”"
1739,"With its initial offering, Lyft leapt ahead of Uber to become the first publicly traded ride-hailing firm. Logan Green and John Zimmer, Lyft’s founders, celebrated the event on Friday in Los Angeles, where pink confetti rained down them as they marked the occasion. The pair had founded Zimride, a long-distance car-pooling service for college students, in 2007. Zimride evolved into Lyft, which initially used the gimmick of fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches to distinguish its service."
1740,"Mr. Green, 35, who grew up in Santa Monica, and has cited heavy traffic in the area as an inspiration for Lyft, and Mr. Zimmer, 34, used the I.P.O. to announce a program called Lyft City Works. The program will donate $50 million to transportation initiatives in cities where it operates."
1741,"Mr. Green said he planned to further expand Lyft into other modes of transportation, including public transit."
1742,"“We want Lyft to be the first app that you open up,” he said. “The biggest investments we’re making today are broadening the portfolio of products that you can access within Lyft.”"
1743,"The offering increased Mr. Green’s and Mr. Zimmer’s wealth, while allowing them to maintain tight control over their company. The pair hold a special class of shares that give them extra voting power, a practice common among tech founders but criticized by investor advocates."
1744,"During the nearly two-week road show, Lyft pitched itself to institutional investors as a mission-driven company focused on reshaping the transportation industry. It emphasized its do-gooder stance on encouraging car-pooling and reducing the environmental impacts of individual car ownership."
1745,"Investors’ most frequent question during the road show was what the company would look like in five years, Mr. Zimmer said. “Investors realized that ride-sharing is the tip of the iceberg,” he said."
1746,"Using independent contractors to provide services has indubitably become the keystone of a generation of tech companies, from ride-hailing apps to food delivery services like DoorDash to hair and makeup services like Glamsquad. Some researchers said contingent work could account for 43 percent of the American work force by next year, though the Department of Labor has reported that the number of workers in gig roles has remained mostly flat since 2005."
1747,"“I think it’s quite clear that this is part of a larger trend in the economy,” said Sean Aggarwal, Lyft’s chairman. “That makes it an exciting story for the long-term investor. It gives them an opportunity to participate not just in this gig economy transformation but also in this larger trend of transportation as a service.”"
1748,Mr. White of D. A. Davidson said the good will toward Lyft would eventually evaporate if it ultimately couldn’t make money.
1749,"“As we get closer to 2020, there will be an expectation that we see them narrow the losses,” he said."
1750,"The first challenge you face on arriving somewhere new is usually how to get around, but the right technology can make it easier. There are tools suited to specific destinations, or to modes of transport, whether you want to hail a ride in Tel Aviv, explore Paris by scooter or catch a bus from Bangkok to Chiang Mai."
1751,"Here are some free transportation apps, beyond the usual Google Maps and Google Translate, to consider downloading before your next trip."
1752,"Sometimes walking is faster than taking the bus, or the most direct route includes a tram and a bike ride. Citymapper helps you figure all that out, and it works in 39 cities around the world, including Tokyo, Copenhagen and Sydney. Plug in your starting and ending points, and get a list of possible routes organized by mode of transport. The app also displays trip duration and any applicable prices (like estimated cab or subway fares), along with tips for where to sit on the train and which station exit to use to reach your destination faster."
1753,"You can receive alerts when it’s time to disembark, and when there are line delays or closures. You can even use it to plan your daily commute, and get a warning to leave before you’re late for work, or estimates on when you’ll get home depending on when you leave the office. The app also shows how many shared bikes and free bike spaces are available at a given location in real time, making pickup and drop-off more efficient."
1754,"Depending on your destination, you may have to break your Uber or Lyft habit when you arrive: the former is banned in several European countries and parts of Australia, and operates in a gray area in others, like in Hong Kong . The latter only operates in the United States."
1755,"You may also prefer to hail rides from licensed taxis. You don’t have to give up the convenience of an app to do it, though. Gett will get you a cab in Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom; and in New York City, the company has merged with ride-sharing platform Juno. Gett allows you to book a ride with an economy or higher-end car up to two weeks in advance, or on-demand. Like any good ride-sharing app, your driver’s location is displayed in real time while you wait to be picked up, but with Gett, you can pay in cash or through the app. "
1756,"Taxify is a similar option that’s available in 60 cities across 29 countries, including throughout Europe and Africa. Like Uber or Lyft, its drivers are not actual taxi drivers however; the company is called Txfy in France to avoid confusion. Taxify offers different vehicle tiers, displays real-time driver location and it lets you pay through the app. Some destinations offer alternatives to cars. For example, you can hail motorcycles and auto-rickshaws in East Africa, and rent GPS-enabled scooters in Paris."
1757,"If you want to explore Europe or North America without renting a car, Wanderu can help you find and book bus, train and ferry tickets instead. The app aggregates options from big-name carriers like Amtrak and Deutsche Bahn, as well as niche brands, like FlixBus and the Tallink Silja Line, a Baltic Sea ferry service."
1758,"You can quickly sort options according to your schedule, budget and preferred mode of transport — maybe you want the cheapest overnight bus or the earliest luxury train."
1759,"Currently, Wanderu has a separate flight finder powered by Skyscanner, but flights will be integrated into overall search results next year, so you’ll be able to see airfares along with ferries and ground transportation options in one place."
1760,"A website called Bookaway provides a similar service in developing countries, including throughout Southeast Asia. You can search for bus, train and ferry options, and see whether a carrier offers amenities such as bathrooms and Wi-Fi before booking your tickets."
1761,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Melissa Eddy, a Berlin correspondent for The Times, discussed the tech she’s using."
1762,"What are the most important tech tools for doing your job, and how do you use them?"
1763,"My iPhone X has become my multipurpose portable notebook, camera, recorder and connection device. I have typed breaking stories into the Notes app and sent them to editors, or jotted down key points from an event, when I found myself without pen and paper."
1764,"I’ve used the camera to record Facebook Live video, but also to take still photos of anything that catches my imagination when I am out reporting, or signs that I don’t have time to stop and translate. When I sit down to write, I go back through my photos to jog my memory, although I sometimes worry that it would be better to pause and capture the thought in the moment."
1765,"I use the VoiceMemos app to record news conferences and in-person interviews. For phone interviews, I rely on TapeACall Pro, which is easy to use and has been a great addition."
1766,"Because many Germans use Android phones, I installed WhatsApp initially to keep in touch with my friends and kids. But increasingly, it is a popular way to communicate with sources. When we were reporting on the more than one million migrants who made their way to Germany in 2015 and 2016, most of them still had cellphones from their home countries, and the only way to reach them was via WhatsApp messages, or “Whatsies.”"
1767,"Google Maps, a German railway app and a local car-sharing app make up my essential travel tech trio. As a nation obsessed with keeping a paper trail, Germans were very cautious about using apps to make everyday transactions easier — Apple Pay arrived only at the end of last year — but the apps are catching on. It has been several years since I used a paper ticket on the train, and where car-sharing services like DriveNow initially required an extra card to unlock the car, now all I need is my phone."
1768,"Is there any tech that you’ve stopped using lately or use less, and why?"
1769,"I have turned off Apple’s FaceTime after the latest scandal over privacy, but I only ever used that to reach my 80-year-old father, who isn’t on WhatsApp."
1770,"For years, I have been a lurker on Facebook and would like to quit it altogether, but I find it too useful for reporting. About 32 million of Germany’s 82 million people are active on the platform. Some members of Germany’s far-right and nationalist circles, including some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, use Facebook almost exclusively to communicate with their base, so it has become increasingly useful for tracking their activities."
1771,Germany has a reputation for being very privacy-conscious online. How have you seen that manifest itself?
1772,"Many public records are protected in Germany by strict privacy laws, which means that access in general is difficult and that records are not at all available online. The country still demands that applications for most official documents take place via paper or fax. Digital databases of information on individuals do not exist."
1773,"Searching for places in Germany on Google Street View returns a patchwork of images and blurred blotches. That’s because in 2010, data privacy activists succeeded in forcing Google to allow them to render their residences unrecognizable. The irony is that Germans, who like to head into vacations hyper-prepared, love to look up their hotels or the cities they will visit on Google Street View."
1774,"Nothing in the Berlin public school system is digitized, and parents have to sign special waivers for their kids to have access to Wi-Fi in the schools that offer it. At the start of every school year, parents have to give permission for their email addresses to be shared on a class list, and those who don’t will be left out."
1775,"That being said, Germans in their 20s and younger are as active on Instagram or Facebook as their counterparts in the United States. Yet despite being raised in a privacy-obsessed country, they seem to struggle with the idea that whatever they publish on Facebook can be seen publicly, unless they take special action to keep their entries private."
1776,"After the 2017 terror attack on a disco in Istanbul, I reached out to a group of friends of one of the victims from southern Germany. They had posted homages to him, and I wanted to use them and perhaps talk to them about their friend. But my attempts to reach out were met with hostility that I would be invading their privacy and “preying” on their mourning — which they had made publicly available on Facebook."
1777,What apps and gadgets do Germans love to use? 
1778,"Germany’s highly mechanized society seems to extend even to the act of cleaning teeth: Germans love electric toothbrushes. Young kids are started on smaller, battery-powered brushes, which become larger and more sophisticated as they grow. I have had to argue with my dentist that I am capable of keeping my teeth clean with good old-fashioned brushing and flossing."
1779,"Uber basically doesn’t exist in Germany after they were largely forced to retreat from the market in 2015 for violating local transport laws. To be on the safe side, the taxi companies quickly realized they needed to create an app or eventually be left behind, so MyTaxi was born. It works the way Uber does elsewhere, but by connecting riders with taxis wherever they are in Germany — even in tiny towns where the local taxi driver has to be pulled off his sofa in front of the TV to come pick you up at the station at some odd hour. To this day, I have never used Uber."
1780,"Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?"
1781,"Other than trying to keep up with the latest Netflix series and doing The Times’s crossword puzzle, we are largely an analogue family. Monopoly and Scrabble will come out on the rare nights we are all together for a game."
1782,"My 17-year-old son is a YouTube junkie and is surviving his exams and studies by exchanging tips and notes with his peers around the world via Discord, the communication app. He recently wondered how anyone could have passed exams in the days before online resources were available."
1783,"Despite teaching herself to read via Starfall, an online program, my 14-year-old daughter prefers paper books to her Kindle. Germany still has a strong network of bookstores, and I try to support their continued existence by ordering books through them, but more often than not we turn to Amazon for easy access to English-language books."
1784,"People have always envied my having a bookworm for a child. But the frustrating part is that while I’ve never had any qualms removing an electronic device from someone, I have a much harder time pulling a book out of my daughter’s hands, even when homework and chores need to be done."
1785,"SAN FRANCISCO — Uber plans to buy Careem, its largest rival in the Middle East, the American ride-hailing company announced on Tuesday, giving it a strong foothold in the region ahead of its expected public offering."
1786,"The deal, valued at $3.1 billion, will need regulatory approval and may not be completed until next year."
1787,"Uber’s public offering, expected next month, could reach a valuation of up to $120 billion, rivaling the 2012 listing of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. But Uber has remained unprofitable, burning cash on subsidies for its riders and drivers in an effort to undercut its competition. In the final quarter of 2018, the company lost $865 million on revenue of $3 billion."
1788,"By taking over its main competition in the Middle East, Uber could cut its losses there. The deal with Careem will also give it access to some countries, like Iraq, Palestine and Morocco, where it does not operate."
1789,"Uber will pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes. Careem will continue to operate under its own brand and remain somewhat independent of Uber. Both companies will continue to offer rides, but may test certain features on one platform before introducing them on the other."
1790,"The deal is a break from Uber’s approach in some other regions. Uber has sold majority stakes of its businesses in Russia, China and Southeast Asia to local competitors after deciding to avoid price wars in those areas. Those deals briefly put Uber in the black for the first time in the company’s history."
1791,"“With a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions, Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East, becoming one of the most successful start-ups in the region,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement."
1792,"Careem was founded in 2012 as a corporate car service but eventually adopted a ride-hailing model similar to Uber’s. The company is based in Dubai and operates in 15 countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It recently expanded into food delivery and payments, seeking to establish itself as a one-stop shop for consumers. Private investors valued the company at about $2 billion last year."
1793,"But Uber’s deal could raise privacy concerns. As the company planned its expansion in Egypt in 2017, government officials there asked it to provide real-time access to users’ location data. Uber declined, arguing that it had never provided real-time access to governments, but Careem was more open to cooperating with the government."
1794,"In 2018, hackers stole personal data for 14 million users from Careem. To address these concerns, Careem’s security and legal teams will report directly to Uber, according to a person familiar with the deal. The person would speak only on the condition of anonymity ahead of Uber’s public offering."
1795,Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an email to employees that both Uber and Careem would benefit from operating independently.
1796,"“This framework has the advantage of letting us build new products and try new ideas across not one but two strong brands, with strong operators within each,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote. Over time, Uber and Careem will integrate some elements of the other’s products, he added."
1797,"Careem will be guided by its own board, with two members from Careem and three from Uber."
1798,"“The mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped, and has the potential to leapfrog our region into the digital future,” Mudassir Sheikha, Careem’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement."

1800,"It is not enough that a subway fare increase could soon make traveling underground in New York City more expensive. The cost of getting around above ground is going up, too."
1801,"An extra $2.50 fee will be tacked onto any yellow taxi rides in Manhattan that begin, end or pass through south of 96th street, and an extra $2.75 fee will be added for other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts — all before the car even starts."
1802,"The new ride fees were supposed to start Jan. 1, and are intended to raise more than $1 million a day to help fix the city’s broken subway system. New York is following a growing number of states and cities, including Chicago and Seattle, that have adopted similar per-ride fees in recent years to pay for public transportation and other services."
1803,"In New York, the new ride fees had been temporarily blocked at the last minute by a lawsuit filed by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers who called it a “suicide surcharge” that would drive away customers and devastate an industry already crumbling under financial pressures."
1804,"Judge Lynn R. Kotler of State Supreme Court disagreed, ruling Thursday that the new ride fees could proceed, noting that the taxi coalition had not “demonstrated irreparable injury.” But she did deny a motion from the state to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that the coalition’s arguments merited moving the case forward."
1805,The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 in Manhattan.
1806,Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s office would not say when the fees would start.
1807,The new ride fees are seen as the first step in passing a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all vehicles a fee to drive in the busiest neighborhoods and help reduce gridlock. The fees were approved last year by the State Legislature and also included a 75-cents fee for shared car-pool services.
1808,The taxi coalition argued in its lawsuit that the fees would “drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”
1809,"But lawyers for the state attorney general’s office countered that the lawsuit hurt city transit riders, and that every day the new fees went uncollected meant less money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways."
1810,"Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the decision was “a positive step in our efforts to find a dedicated revenue stream for our subways and buses, as well as easing congestion in Manhattan’s central business district.”"
1811,"But taxi owners and drivers criticized the judge’s decision, saying it would only add to their problems. Many are already struggling with enormous debt as the value of their taxi medallions — the aluminum plate that once sold for more than $1 million — has plummeted. Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year."
1812,"“It’s a big problem — that means people will not ride in taxis anymore,” said Mahmud Hossain, 54, a yellow taxi owner and driver from Astoria, Queens. “It’s very hard.”"
1813,"Mr. Hossain said that he typically takes home $70 or less after a 12-hour shift, or about half of what he used to make five years ago before ride-hailing apps started taking away customers. He worries that he will take home even less now."
1814,"Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said taxi drivers would feel the effect right away from the new fee. “Their income will drop immediately and force them to delay decisions over food and medicine,” she said."
1815,Ms. Desai called on the governor to hold off collecting the new fee while the lawsuit continues and said her group would lobby state legislators to pass an exemption for taxis from the new fee.
1816,"“Implementing the surcharge while the lawsuit continues could put the industry in the predicament of figuring out how to refund passengers, even those who paid with cash, should the drivers ultimately win the case,” she said."
1817,"With the new $2.75 fee, the cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will also rise to a minimum of $10.75. But Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city."
1818,"The taxi lawsuit had argued that taxis should not be charged a “congestion tax” because their number has been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services were allowed to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services."
1819,"Mayor Bill de Blasio has supported the new taxi fee, but Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has said it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry."
1820,"David Graves, 60, a taxi driver for almost two decades, said he was frustrated that the city had created the congestion problem and was now trying to address it by turning taxis into “unpaid tax collectors for the M.T.A.”"
1821,"“This is my future, this is the future of the New York City taxi,” he added."
1822,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1823,The new fees were supposed to help fix New York City’s ailing subway by raising more than $1 million a day from those who could afford to take taxis and Ubers in Manhattan.
1824,"But before the $2.50 fees on rides could even go into effect as planned on Jan. 1, they were sidelined by a lawsuit brought by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers."
1825,"The opponents warn that the fee will add up for passengers, and will also deal a final blow to a taxi industry teetering on the brink. They say the surcharge will drive away customers when they are already losing business to Uber and other app-based services and struggling with enormous debt and bleak prospects."
1826,Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year.
1827,"“If they put the surcharge on, that’s it, we’ve lost our whole life investment,” said Gloria Guerra, 62, who with her husband, William, owns a taxi medallion, the aluminum plate required to drive a yellow taxi in New York that once sold for more than $1 million. “The business will be bankrupt. All the medallions will be bankrupt.”"
1828,"On Thursday, the Guerras and other taxi owners and drivers took their fight against what they call a “suicide surcharge” to a state court hearing in Lower Manhattan, capping off months of protests. Their lawsuit contends that by imposing the new taxi fee, state and city officials “seek to drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”"
1829,"Last month, a state court judge temporarily blocked the fee until both sides could present arguments. At Thursday’s hearing, a judge continued the suspension of the fee until the next hearing, scheduled for Jan. 31."
1830,"The $2.50 taxi fee was passed by state lawmakers last year along with a $2.75 fee on other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts, and a 75-cent fee on shared pool rides. The fees are expected to raise more than $400 million annually, according to budget projections."
1831,"Every day those fees go uncollected means lost revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways and buses. As a result, taxi drivers and owners have found themselves pitted against state officials, business leaders and transit advocates who see the new fees as crucial to the city’s transit system."
1832,"“Transit riders, individual taxpayers and business are all contributing toward the cost of modernizing our transit system and it is only fair that the taxi industry and their customers do the same,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of influential business leaders that supports the fee."
1833,The $2.50 taxi fee has also divided city officials and transportation advocates and complicated a renewed effort by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and transit advocates to push for a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all drivers a fee for entering the busiest neighborhoods at peak times. Mr. Cuomo and others have called the fees on taxis and for-hire vehicles the first phase of congestion pricing.
1834,Mayor Bill de Blasio has also backed the new fees on for-hire vehicles.
1835,"But Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has criticized the fee, saying that it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry. Ms. Joshi, who is stepping down in March, is named in the taxi lawsuit and declined last week to comment on the case."
1836,"The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 — which is still lower than an Uber ride. The cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will rise to a minimum of $10.75, including the new $2.75 fee."
1837,"Unlike the taxi industry, Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city."
1838,"“In order to truly address these issues, it’s imperative that all vehicles, including personal and commercial, are included in this effort,” said Campbell Matthews, a spokeswoman for Lyft."
1839,"Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders, said most taxi riders in Manhattan can afford to pay the fees. They have access to more public transit options than in the other boroughs, he said, and should pay more if they choose to use a taxi or car service."
1840,"“There are a privileged number of people who take taxis and Ubers to get around the core of the city,” he said. “They can afford to support the transit system that makes New York what it is.”"
1841,"But others said the new fees unfairly single out taxis and for-hire vehicles without a larger plan in place to charge all cars on congested streets — and by itself, will have little, if any, impact on reducing gridlock."
1842,"Marco Conner, a deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said the taxi lawsuit — and the resulting court-ordered delay in fees — “shows the fallacy of taking baby steps to address a problem as tremendous as congestion and the M.T.A. crisis.”"
1843,"In the lawsuit, taxi owners and drivers also claim that they should not be charged a so-called “congestion tax” because their numbers have been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services had been allowed until recently to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services."
1844,"Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official, said taxis and ride-app cars have contributed to Manhattan gridlock. In a study last year, he found equal numbers of taxis and black cars in the central business district during the weekday — together accounting for two-thirds of all the vehicles there. Making matters worse, the for-hire vehicles often drove around with empty back seats."
1845,"“You don’t just tax the last person in,” Mr. Schaller said. “You tax everyone causing the problem. It’s not like moving around Manhattan was la-dee-da before Uber.”"
1846,"While Mr. Schaller agreed that the taxi fee would do little to reduce congestion, he said that it would raise badly needed money for the transit system. Chicago, Seattle and other cities and states have adopted similar per-ride fees to pay for public transportation and other services. “It’s a misnomer to call this a congestion fee,” he said. “It’s all about raising revenue.”"
1847,"Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the new for-hire fee would force more taxi owners into bankruptcy, while taxi drivers would earn less and could have to cut back on food, medical care and other necessities."
1848,"“I don’t know anybody who has savings left,” she said. “They will face foreclosures because payments simply won’t get made. I believe it will be this dire.”"
1849,"Augustine Tang, 34, a yellow taxi driver who planned to attend Thursday’s hearing, said he makes about $240 after 10 hours of driving. That is about $100 less than he earned four years ago when he said he inherited a taxi medallion — and the remaining $500,000 loan on it — when his father died."
1850,"“It’s a little annoying that people are saying the lawsuit is costing public transportation,” he said. “We’re trying to save our lives.”"
1851,"SAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Green, chief executive of the ride-hailing service Lyft, was asked which tech leaders he admired, he pointed to three men who had built their companies ruthlessly: Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos."
1852,"“A lot of other Silicon Valley companies are very scared to get their hands dirty with operations,” Mr. Green said in a 2017 interview with The New York Times, adding that he wanted to emulate the take-no-prisoners methods of Mr. Musk, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Bezos."
1853,"The problem for Mr. Green is that Lyft seems very nice. Its app is pink. Its cars were once adorned with fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches. Its drivers have a reputation for being friendly. And while Lyft has racked up more than one billion rides and become a strong No. 2 to Uber in the United States and Canada, it has not shaken off its cuddly image."
1854,"Now Mr. Green, 35, must show that Lyft can be as assertive as an Amazon or a Facebook. He and Uber are locked in a race to take their companies public: Both filed papers in December to list on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings — the first for any ride-hailing firm — are likely to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley and set the stage for listings of other highly valued tech start-ups, including Slack and Pinterest."
1855,"The pressure is on Mr. Green to get the jump on Uber. (Both offerings have been stalled because the government shutdown, which ended Friday, prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from reviewing their filings.) Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation."
1856,"For Mr. Green, this means he may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role. While Lyft’s more gregarious president, John Zimmer, his No. 2 for the last 12 years, has frequently handled the public-facing side of the business, Mr. Green would rather speak at staff meetings than at tech conferences. Colleagues describe him as reserved."
1857,"In a 2017 interview, Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Green was often misunderstood because of his quiet demeanor. “He is, like, extremely competitive,” Mr. Zimmer, now 34, said. “He has been an activist.”"
1858,"Lyft declined to make Mr. Green or Mr. Zimmer available for new interviews, citing the quiet period before an initial public offering. In a statement, the chief operating officer, Jon McNeill, described them as “cutthroat missionaries in service of creating positive change.”"
1859,"One of the tech leaders Mr. Green cited as inspiration, Mr. Musk, recommended against taking Lyft public."
1860,"“The current system makes long-term value creation and product innovation difficult,” Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla, wrote in an email last week. “It insists on quarter-by-quarter results or punishes companies severely. This is particularly bad for companies that are high growth and are valued on potential, like Lyft (or Tesla).” (The S.E.C. fined Mr. Musk  last year for a tweet about taking Tesla private.)"
1861,"Mr. Green, who was born and raised in Culver City, Calif., graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2006 with a degree in business economics. He then worked as the university’s sustainability coordinator, poring over alternatives to the gas-guzzling one-car-per-owner model. He was also on the board of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, a position that gave him insight into municipal transportation."
1862,"While visiting Zimbabwe on vacation during his 20s, Mr. Green said in the 2017 interview, he was inspired by Zimbabweans who had created makeshift services to fill every seat in car pools, saving passengers money and taking cars off the road."
1863,"So in 2007, Mr. Green started Zimride in Santa Barbara, Calif., to provide long-distance car-pool rides to college students by matching them with other students who were driving."
1864,"Mr. Zimmer, then working at Lehman Brothers, noticed posts about the start-up on Facebook from John Siegel, whom he had met while studying abroad and who had attended middle school with Mr. Green."
1865,"“John didn’t have this technical or programming background, but he was this really impressive guy,” Mr. Siegel said. “I thought they could work together well.”"
1866,"Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who remained in New York, embarked on what Mr. Zimmer called a “long-distance relationship,” working together over Skype. In 2008, they moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto, Calif. Neither drew a salary in the first three years of building Zimride, and each contract they sold to a college was celebrated with a trip to Ikea for Swedish meatballs, Mr. Zimmer said."
1867,"In 2011, Zimride raised $6 million. But as a web service, it was caught flat-footed by the rise of smartphones and mobile apps. In 2012, Mr. Green decided to spin out of Zimride a mobile, peer-to-peer ride-hailing service, calling it Lyft."
1868,"Instead of just pairing students for long-distance rides, Lyft would put drivers together with riders on public streets, in real time. Mr. Zimmer came up with the idea to emblazon the cars with pink mustaches; Mr. Green encouraged passengers to greet their drivers with a fist bump, to keep the community feeling of Zimride."
1869,"At the time, ride-hailing wasn’t legal, and only licensed drivers could pick up passengers on public streets. Ann Miura-Ko, a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate, who had invested in Zimride and sits on Lyft’s board, recalled that some board members had been doubtful about the change — but that Mr. Green had been confident."
1870,"“Someone asked, ‘Will this really work?’ And he wasn’t just sure, he was positive,” she said."
1871,"But Mr. Green didn’t reckon with one issue: Uber. At the time, Uber, run by Travis Kalanick, had positioned itself as a luxury service for the wealthy that used only licensed drivers, unlike Lyft’s lower-cost service. In 2013, Uber published a white paper outlining the risks of peer-to-peer ride-hailing, a way to elbow Lyft out of the market."
1872,"“They were trying to get the whole category shut down behind the scenes,” Mr. Green said. “They didn’t want competition.”"
1873,"Uber officials met with California regulators about the matter. As for Mr. Green, several current and former regulators and lawmakers who oversee ride-sharing in California said they had never worked with him, because Mr. Zimmer was often the one who communicated with officials."
1874,"“Truth be told, I’ve never heard of him,” said Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor who called for crackdowns on Uber and Lyft in their early years and negotiated a new per-ride tax with Uber and Lyft last summer."
1875,"Mr. Kalanick eventually moved Uber into non-luxury ride-sharing with no licensed drivers, the same as Lyft. He and Mr. Green quickly became bitter rivals. When Mr. Green was set to introduce Lyft’s car-pooling product in 2014, Uber announced the same service first."
1876,"That same year, Uber considered buying Lyft. Over dinner at Mr. Kalanick’s home in San Francisco, the Uber chief laughed at Mr. Zimmer’s high asking price. No deal was struck."
1877,An Uber spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick didn’t return a request for comment.
1878,"While Mr. Kalanick went on to raise billions of dollars in funding for Uber, Mr. Green relied on Mr. Zimmer’s Wall Street knowledge and showman personality to garner investments from venture capitalists and others. In total, Lyft has raised close to $5.1 billion, compared with Uber’s roughly $14 billion in equity."
1879,"In 2017, Mr. Kalanick was ousted from Uber after a series of scandals. Mr. Green seized the moment, billing Lyft as a kinder, gentler network. Ridership surged, with Lyft taking a share of up to 35 percent in some American cities."
1880,"More recently, Lyft has ventured into self-driving cars, offering autonomous rides in Las Vegas. It also acquired Motivate, the largest bike-share operator in the United States, giving Lyft a dominant position in an emerging transportation market."
1881,"In the 2017 interview, Mr. Green said he was far from done."
1882,"“As an entrepreneur, you always kind of want what you’re pitching to sound somewhat off the wall,” he said. “You’re trying to pitch the future that doesn’t exist, and you want it to be — it needs to be — a little bit of a stretch.”"
1883,"SAN FRANCISCO — Lyft pulled back the curtain on its business for the first time on Friday as it prepared to go public, officially starting the countdown on a horde of technology offerings that are set to bring new wealth to Silicon Valley this year."
1884,"By publicly unveiling the prospectus for its initial public offering, Lyft signaled its intention to meet investors in what is known as a roadshow in about two weeks, after which it will most likely start trading on the stock market in April. The ride-sharing company leads a stampede of other highly valued private tech companies that plan to go public this year, including its archrival, Uber, as well as Slack, Pinterest and Postmates."
1885,"But Lyft’s filing also raised questions about the financial health of the tech companies that are planning I.P.O.s. Its filing revealed that while it was growing quickly, its losses were widening. Last year, the company’s revenue totaled $2.2 billion, while it lost $911.3 million."
1886,"“We have a history of net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,” Lyft said in the filing, adding that it expects to spend more as it expands into new offerings and locations."
1887,"The prospectus is the first time that Lyft has made extensive details of its finances publicly available. Its public offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies. Lyft did not disclose the market valuation it is seeking from public investors; it was last valued at $15.1 billion by private investors during a financing round in June."
1888,[Lyft and Uber said to offer drivers a chance to participate in I.P.O.s.]
1889,"Lyft filed confidentially to go public in December, the same day Uber did. Both companies are dueling to hold their offerings ahead of the other, in an attempt to be the first publicly traded ride-hailing company. But the onus has mostly been on Lyft to get out first because Uber — estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as $120 billion — would potentially steamroll its much smaller rival."
1890,"Both companies are set to face questions about when and how they will become profitable. The ride-hailing business is inherently expensive because companies typically pay incentives to recruit drivers and offer discounts to riders. In addition, the companies are spending heavily to grow in areas such as autonomous driving and bike sharing."
1891,"In 2018, Lyft’s revenue more than doubled to $2.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2017, according to its filing. But losses mounted, rising to $911.3 million last year from $688.3 million in 2017, though they declined as a percentage of revenue. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017."
1892,"Uber, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $842 million in the final quarter of 2018 on revenue of $3 billion. The firm has been trying to turn its image around after a series of scandals involving its workplace culture and onetime hardball business tactics."
1893,"Lyft also said 18.6 million people took at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016. And based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft, the company said it had a 39 percent share of the ride-sharing market in the United States, up from 22 percent in 2016."
1894,"“Two years ago, I definitely viewed Lyft as a second-tier player,” said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida and an I.P.O. expert. “But Uber’s problems with bad publicity, a lot of self-inflicted stuff, really benefited Lyft.”"
1895,"Matt Kennedy, a senior I.P.O. market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research on public offerings, said that it was possible Uber would bite back and that Lyft’s growth would decline."
1896,"“The number of I.P.O.s that we’ve seen with $2 billion in revenue and growing at 100 percent are few and far between,” he said."
1897,"Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. By 2012, the pair had renamed their company Lyft and shifted the business to providing brief local trips, mimicking taxi rides."
1898,"The company presented itself as a genial alternative to Uber. In its early days, Lyft encouraged drivers to strap fuzzy pink mustaches to their front bumpers and to greet riders — who often sat in the front seat — with fist bumps. Although Lyft has since lost the furry fender ornaments, it has maintained its softer image."
1899,"On Friday in its prospectus, Lyft continued to emphasize that image as giving it an edge. In a founders’ letter, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer wrote that their focus on doing the right thing provided them with a “lasting competitive advantage.”"
1900,"Unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe, Lyft operates in the United States and Canada. It has matched Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving cars and has also expanded into short-term bike and scooter rentals."
1901,"The company also disclosed that it planned to have two classes of stock: Class A shares, which carry one vote each, and Class B shares, which carry 20 votes apiece. Lyft plans to sell only Class A shares in its public offering."
1902,"Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who could become billionaires from the offering, each own millions of shares of Class B stock, giving them significant control over the company. In having separate classes of shares — and letting its founders have more power than other shareholders — Lyft is following a well-worn tech company tradition, one adopted by Facebook, Snap and others."
1903,"“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car,” Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer said in their founders’ letter. “We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”"
1904,"Among Lyft’s biggest investors are Rakuten; General Motors; Fidelity, the investment management giant; Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm; and Alphabet, the parent of Google, according to the filing."
1905,"One group that helped build Lyft — its drivers, who are independent contractors — will not share much in the public offering spoils since they do not own stock in the company. Lyft is now working on a cash program to give some drivers money to buy its stock at the time of the I.P.O. The company intends to give $1,000 each to drivers who have completed 10,000 rides for the service; those who have done 20,000 rides will receive $10,000."
1906,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
1907,"After New York City and Amazon went to war over a new campus in Queens, the city is heading into battle with another tech giant: Uber."
1908,"Mayor Bill de Blasio approved a yearlong cap on Uber vehicles last summer, making New York the first major American city to rein in the booming ride-hail company. Now Mr. de Blasio wants to extend the cap, prompting Uber to sue the city last week to overturn the law."
1909,"Uber has fiercely opposed the cap, arguing that it hurts New Yorkers who rely on the app, especially outside Manhattan where there are fewer transit options. The lawsuit called the city’s regulatory approach “unfortunate, irresponsible and irrational.”"
1910,"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat with presidential ambitions, responded by saying the city’s new rules — both the cap and a measure to raise wages for drivers — were needed."
1911,"“No legal challenge changes the fact that Uber made congestion on our roads worse and paid their drivers less than a living wage,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the mayor. “The city’s new laws aim to change that.”"
1912,"Like many other cities across the world, New York is struggling to respond to the explosive growth of the ride-hailing industry. The influx of vehicles has raised concerns about street congestion, working conditions for drivers, the decimation of the yellow cab industry and the siphoning of riders from public transit."
1913,"The lawsuit comes at a critical moment for Uber and its main competitor, Lyft, as both companies rush to go public. Uber, which could be valued as high as $120 billion, is likely to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company."
1914,"The two ride-hail companies have bristled over new regulations in New York, Uber’s largest market in the United States. Lyft recently sued to stop the rules aimed at raising driver pay."
1915,"Uber and Lyft are also battling each other to dominate New York’s thriving bike markets. Lyft bought Motivate, the company that operates CitiBike, the city’s popular bike-share program. Uber bought another bike company called Jump and began offering electric bikes in the Bronx and Staten Island."
1916,"Uber supports the driver pay rules, but argued that the cap hurts drivers who want to join its app."
1917,"“It is disappointing to see the de Blasio administration remain singularly focused on a cap that evidence suggests is doing nothing to relieve congestion while preventing thousands of New Yorkers from earning a living wage,” Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement."
1918,Some business leaders worry that Amazon’s decision to abandon its deal with New York could hurt the city’s image as a tech hub.
1919,"But Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the struggle with Uber is not a tech issue — it’s about worsening street traffic."
1920,"“We’re not really afraid of being branded anti-tech,” Ms. Gelinas said. “In the long term, our problem is how do we deal with all of this growth — and not the risk that we’re going to drive away that growth with a little bit of rhetoric and a little regulation.”"
1921,"Mr. de Blasio has a bitter history with Uber. When the mayor first proposed a cap in 2015, Uber launched an aggressive attack, introducing a “de Blasio view” in the company’s app to blame him for long wait times. Uber won the debate and became shorthand in his administration for an embarrassing defeat."
1922,"But Uber was on the defensive last year when the cap idea was revived by Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker. Uber’s reputation had been harmed by accusations of gender discrimination and other scandals. It hired a new chief executive and a new leader for New York to try to improve its image."
1923,"The number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 60,000 in 2015. But while Uber and other companies are flourishing, many of their drivers are not. About 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps, according to a study by prominent economists last year."
1924,"The cap was expected to last a year while the city studied the proliferation of ride-hail trips. At the end of that period, the city’s taxi commission would review the number of vehicle licenses and decide on how they would be regulated."
1925,"Last month, Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview that he wanted to ""put ongoing caps in place on the for-hire vehicles.” Officials at City Hall confirmed that the mayor was considering extending the cap."
1926,"Uber’s lawsuit argues that it was not legal for the city to delegate the power to cap vehicles to the taxi commission. If Uber cannot meet growing rider demand, the lawsuit says that could hurt the state’s efforts to raise money for the subway through new fees on ride-hail trips."
1927,"The lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in Manhattan, questions the city’s motives: “This is less a ‘study’ and more a ‘post hoc rationalization’ of a remedy the city appears to have already selected.”"
1928,"Lyft also opposes a permanent cap. “Any extension of this misguided policy would do even more significant, long-term damage to drivers and riders,” Lyft said in a statement."
1929,"The City Council is proud of the new regulations imposed on the ride-hailing industry and had the authority to approve them, said Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson. The speaker, his office said, wants the taxi commission to make a decision about any future limits on vehicles based on data from its study."
1930,"The city’s taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi, recently announced that she was stepping down in March. Her successor will have a powerful role in determining the industry’s future."
1931,"In a separate lawsuit, Lyft challenged the city’s rules to raise driver wages to more than $17 an hour. Lyft claims the rules give Uber an unfair advantage because it judges companies differently based on their “utilization rate,” or how often drivers have a passenger in their car versus driving around empty."
1932,"The approach gives “the largest company with the biggest market share a built-in and perpetual advantage over companies with lower utilizations,” Lyft’s lawsuit said."
1933,"Lyft has sold itself as the more ethical ride-hail option. But the lawsuit hurt its image among some riders like Brad Lander, a councilman from Brooklyn, who said he deleted the app."
1934,"After facing harsh criticism, Lyft announced that it would comply with the new pay rules while its legal case proceeded."
1935,"Uber and Lyft say they care about public policy, but the lawsuits show their first priority is self interest, said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who has closely studied the industry. The companies face a difficult challenge of balancing both profits and their public image. In this case, Mr. Schaller said, Uber chose to protect its bottom line."
1936,"“Uber in particular has been playing super nice since its change in management a year ago and particularly as they get closer to the I.P.O.,” he said. “Suing the biggest city in the country isn’t playing super nice.”"
1937,"SAN FRANCISCO — Technology companies rarely make money before they go public. Twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market. So were Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey."
1938,"For Uber, the question as the ride-hailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money. That’s because the company, the most prominent tech start-up of its generation, will set the bar for other well-known tech companies like Slack and Lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this year."
1939,"So far, Uber is not doing itself any favors on profits."
1940,"The company reported on Friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier. But excluding certain one-time items, including the sale of some of its businesses, Uber’s losses for the quarter rose 88 percent from the previous year, to $842 million."
1941,"The losses were a result of Uber’s increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors, many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers. Uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like DoorDash, Lyft and other ride-hailing and food-delivery services."
1942,"Uber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company. A transportation colossus, Uber was privately valued at more than $70 billion last year, and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as $120 billion after going public. The share sale will create enormous windfalls for Uber’s many investors, and for its founders and early employees."
1943,"As a private company, Uber is not required to disclose financial results. But it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business, and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as a surprise later."
1944,"The latest set of figures, probably Uber’s last as a private company, will be closely scrutinized. Many investors initially give young and fast-growing tech start-ups a pass for losing money, but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them. Investors criticized Twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year, and they have pushed down Snap’s share price since its public offering, partly because the company is still deeply unprofitable."
1945,"In a statement, Uber’s chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, did not address the company’s losses. He said Uber had “maintained category leadership” in its ride-hailing business, and he noted other bright spots, including the company’s freight-management business and nascent e-bike and scooter program."
1946,"Uber has a long history of spending large sums of money. Ride-hailing is inherently an expensive business that requires companies to expand into new markets for growth, pay to recruit drivers and lower prices to grab business away from competitors."
1947,"Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has been under pressure to pare its losses, and the company has pulled out of money-losing markets like Russia and Southeast Asia."
1948,"Some of the company’s losses have been overshadowed by its explosive growth. In 2018, Uber increased its total bookings — what it charges customers for rides and food delivery — to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017. Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a 43 percent increase."
1949,"The company’s net revenue for last year’s fourth quarter was $3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, and its gross bookings jumped 37 percent, to $14.2 billion. The company has $6.4 billion in cash, and its net loss was $865 million."
1950,"But Uber’s profit margins have declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its food-delivery business, Uber Eats. The margins are also smaller on Uber Eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery drivers."
1951,"Uber’s self-driving car program, which will probably not yield revenue for years, continues to burn cash. The company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads in December after a 10-month hiatus, which was prompted when one of its vehicles  fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona."
1952,"SAN FRANCISCO — Not long after Tony West joined Uber as chief legal officer in November 2017, he began a delicate task: crafting a transparency report to quantify how many people had been sexually assaulted during Uber rides."
1953,"The effort was part of Mr. West’s mandate to help clean up Uber, which had been grappling with legal entanglements, safety issues and a problematic workplace culture."
1954,"So Mr. West directed Uber employees to work with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center, a nonprofit, to review 212 instances of sexual misconduct that occurred during rides in 2017. He listened to customer service calls, including one in which an Uber driver said he had raped a passenger. And the company began auditing past complaints to determine whether it had evidence of old assaults."
1955,"Nearly 16 months later, the work is far from over. “This is a hugely underreported set of situations,” Mr. West, 53, said. “Those numbers, as we continue to count them, they actually might go up.”"
1956,"Since Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, brought in Mr. West to help turn around the ride-hailing company and professionalize it, the attorney has swept aside many of its highest-profile legal woes. While Uber is still dealing with hundreds of legal cases, Mr. West settled a tabloid-worthy trade secrets lawsuit last year by Alphabet’s self-driving car business, Waymo, and negotiated a multistate settlement over a vast 2016 data breach."
1957,"But the sexual assault transparency report, which Mr. West plans to release this year, underlines just how much more work Uber needs to do — and how thorny the challenge can be to navigate."
1958,"“He is very upfront about the fact that it’s not going to be pretty,” Tammy Albarran, Uber’s deputy general counsel, said of Mr. West and the transparency report."
1959,"The work is especially important as Uber gears up for a highly anticipated initial public offering. Lyft, Uber’s main rival in the United States, made its offering prospectus public on Friday and is likely to begin trading on the stock market next month."
1960,"Uber, which may go public at a $120 billion valuation, would dwarf Lyft. But to pull off a successful offering, the company must reduce its legal exposure and show that it has revamped its culture and cares about the safety of passengers."
1961,"Mr. West, a former Justice Department official and the brother-in-law of Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat who is running for president, said he was hitching his reputation to Uber and its changes."
1962,"“I had a reputation that I was also putting on the table, right?” he said in a recent interview."
1963,"A native of the Bay Area, Mr. West graduated from Harvard University and Stanford Law School. He rose to prominence as an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration, during which he urged the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and worked to reduce the number of detainees in the military prison at Guantánamo Bay."
1964,"In 2014, he became general counsel of PepsiCo, where, he said, he learned how to operate in a Fortune 50 company. Then in 2017, Mr. Khosrowshahi came calling."
1965,"At the time, Uber was reeling from the ouster of Travis Kalanick as chief executive and the aftermath of an investigation into its workplace, amid other issues. Mr. Khosrowshahi was tapped to stabilize the company and eventually take it public. Over several dinners in New York, he pitched Mr. West on the idea of turning Uber into a more self-critical company."
1966,"Uber needed someone with “a great amount of negotiation prowess and relationships,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said. “He’s got both.”"
1967,"Mr. West jumped ship. “There was nothing I was going to do that was going to fundamentally change the trajectory” of PepsiCo, he said."
1968,"At Uber, Mr. West began rebuilding the legal department with several former Justice Department colleagues. He also confronted some urgent legal problems. They included a trial in early 2018 to defend the company against allegations that it had stolen trade secrets from Waymo in the race to build self-driving cars."
1969,"The weekend before the trial started that February, Mr. West met with Waymo’s lawyers to settle the case. The conversation ended in an impasse."
1970,"After the trial opened, embarrassing revelations about Uber quickly tumbled out. Mr. West said that he had texted Kevin Vosen, Waymo’s general counsel, from the courtroom and that the two had met during breaks to keep trying for a settlement. Waymo declined to comment on Mr. Vosen’s conversations with Mr. West."
1971,"Four days after the trial began, the two sides struck a deal. Uber agreed to provide Waymo, which had sought $1 billion in damages, with 0.34 percent of its stock, valued then at $245 million, as well as the right to inspect Uber’s self-driving technology."
1972,"At the same time, Mr. West worked to placate investigators who were digging into the 2016 data breach, which Uber had kept secret and which had prompted numerous state lawsuits for violation of data breach notification laws. Mr. West said he had kept in frequent contact with Lisa Madigan, who was the Illinois attorney general, to hash out a settlement. The two had worked together while he was at the Justice Department."
1973,"Ms. Madigan said that being friends with Mr. West “in some ways makes it easier” to negotiate. “We both know the law, we both know the problem, and we both know there needs to be a resolution,” she said."
1974,"In September, Mr. West and Ms. Madigan agreed that Uber would pay $148 million to all 50 states to settle the data breach investigation."
1975,"Mr. West also worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi to change Uber’s culture. Last year, Mr. West helped Uber settle a $10 million pay discrimination lawsuit by three former female employees. And he helped settle a lawsuit by nine women who had been raped, kidnapped, assaulted or harassed by drivers. The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal."
1976,"Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, who led an inquiry into Uber’s workplace in 2017 and is friends with Mr. West, said of the company: “They still have work to do, but made really significant progress in a short period of time.”"
1977,"Some of the work today revolves around the sexual assault transparency report. Uber is now training its customer service representatives to sort incidents into 21 categories. The process is complex; for instance, Uber considers a touch between a person’s thighs to be sexual, while a touch on other areas of the thigh is not."
1978,"Because the company operates in 64 countries, the training must also be localized. That is tricky because of varied cultural norms — a kiss on the cheek might be a common greeting in Europe but would be unexpected in the United States, Mr. West noted."
1979,"“There are these differing concepts and views about what can be considered intimate, or sexual, or appropriate or inappropriate,” he said."
1980,"How long Mr. West will stay at Uber is unclear; he has already faced questions internally about whether he will leave to join Ms. Harris’s presidential campaign. Mr. West is married to Maya Harris, Senator Harris’s sister and campaign chairwoman. He also co-led Ms. Harris’s transition team after she was elected to the Senate in 2016."
1981,Ms. Harris’s office did not respond to requests for comment.
1982,"When asked if he would return to government, Mr. West demurred and said a presidential victory for Ms. Harris would most likely prevent him from working in the administration because he was a relative."
1983,"“It would depend on a lot of things, not the least of which is: What would I be going back for?” he said."

1985,"Lyft’s stock market debut has set up its founders, employees, early backers and even those who scored shares in the initial public offering Thursday night for quite a windfall."
1986,But not everyone who invested in the company is reaping the spoils.
1987,"Shares of the ride-hailing company rose nearly 9 percent on Friday. At over $26 billion, Lyft’s market value is almost double what private investors valued it at less than a year ago."
1988,"But Lyft’s first-day gain is measured off the I.P.O. price (which was set on Thursday, when shares were divided up mostly among large funds). Ordinary investors who wanted in had to wait to buy the stock until it was available on public markets on Friday, and at a much higher price than the big funds paid."
1989,And those who bought as soon as trading began are already sitting on losses of a little more than 11 percent.
1990,"It serves as an important reminder that amid all the hoopla around trading debuts, small investors wind up taking a lot of the risk. Most of the gains on the first day of trading for a stock are realized with the first trade."
1991,"[Unicorns are riding into the public markets, and their elite early investors will be the biggest winners.]"
1992,"Over the past decade, companies listing shares on American stock exchanges have increased 14 percent from their I.P.O. price, according to Dealogic. But nearly all of the rise has come at the opening trade."
1993,That dynamic has played out in many of the prominent I.P.O.s in recent years. Facebook shares opened 10 percent higher on their first day of trading and then proceeded to give back almost all those gains to finish essentially unchanged for the day.
1994,"Etsy was an extreme example of this. Its stock soared 94 percent on its first day of trading, but investors who bought at the open actually lost 3 percent by the close of trading."
1995,"And it’s not just tech companies. Levi Strauss recently made its return to the public markets, selling shares to investors at $17 a piece on March 20. The stock opened the next day at $22.22, a 31 percent jump. For the rest of trading that day, though, it climbed less than 1 percent."
1996,"Of course, if Lyft keeps growing as fast as Wall Street hopes it will, or works out how to turn a profit, then even the latecomers could wind up with respectable returns. Facebook shares are up more than 300 percent since their first day of trading, and after Etsy struggled for its first three years as a public company, its shares have more than doubled since they started trading."
1997,"Still, not being able to buy at the I.P.O. price also greatly affects returns over the next year. Investors who bought shares at the offering price have averaged a 22 percent increase over the past decade. Returns for those that bought at the open? Sixty percent less."
1998,"MILWAUKEE — Angela Kelley kissed her 3-year-old granddaughter goodbye and sent her up the steps of her Montessori school. She had to get ready for work. Or, for what passed for work on this gray morning a month into the shutdown."
1999,"On any other Thursday morning, Ms. Kelley, 51, would have been settling into her desk at the federal Bureau of Land Management’s offices in downtown Milwaukee, ensconced by office plants and the security of a federal job that Ms. Kelley believed would always provide for her and her family."
2000,"But now, her office is her car. And until the government reopens, her only source of income is driving for Uber, one of a galaxy of improvised jobs and side hustles that have turned unpaid federal employees across the country into unlikely entrants into America’s gig economy."
2001,"Across the country, idled federal workers and contractors are taking up last-resort jobs with ride-hailing services and delivery apps. They are flooding school districts with applications to become substitute teachers. They are taking babysitting gigs, working shifts at local gyms and auditioning for yoga-instructor slots."
2002,"“It’s almost as if I’m starting over again from a teenager,” said Felicia Thompson, who started delivering takeout dinners and groceries after being furloughed last month from her public affairs job with the Department of Agriculture."
2003,"Ms. Thompson, who lives in Upper Marlboro, Md., said she had two children in college, a father in the hospital with pneumonia and little savings to get by. She said she was considering paying a penalty to raid $13,000 from her retirement account to pay her mortgage, debts and other bills for a few more months."
2004,"Federal workers, many of them highly educated, are limited in the type of work they can take as they wait out the shutdown. Anything connected to an employee’s area of expertise is unlikely to be allowed under federal rules, which require approval for jobs that could conflict with government work. And as the Trump administration forces thousands of furloughed employees back to work without pay, some said that job-hunting seemed pointless."

2006,"“Who’s going to hire me not knowing how long I’m going to stick around?” David Arvelo, a Food and Drug Administration employee and local union official in Dallas."
2007,"Even the search for temp work was costing money that people did not have. In Cadillac, Mich., Debra-Ann Brabazon, a furloughed Forest Service worker, said she was paying $100 to get fingerprinted and background-checked so she could get certified as a substitute teacher. She was down to eating one meal a day. She didn’t have $100 to spare."
2008,"When a friend posted that she was looking for child care, Ms. Brabazon said she leapt to volunteer in exchange for grocery money."
2009,"“I was a nanny in college,” she said. “I am falling back on everything I’ve learned about how to survive.”"
2010,"Ms. Kelley was just trying to earn enough to buy fresh fruits and pull-up diapers for her granddaughter Avery, who is legally in her care. As she began her day as an Uber driver, she tucked Avery’s car seat into the trunk, swept up the half-eaten Cheerios the girl had sprinkled across the back seat and then propped her phone on the dashboard. She gave the Uber screen a tired smile to verify her identity, and a map popped up: “Finding Trips.”"
2011,"“We kind of just sit here till one comes up,” she said."
2012,"An hour later, around 9:30 a.m., it felt like not a single one of the Milwaukee area’s two million residents needed a ride. Her phone showed her total haul so far: $0.00."
2013,"“A lot of it is sitting and waiting,” Ms. Kelley said."
2014,"On her best days driving since the shutdown began, she could make $50 or more. It was not nearly enough to replace the $1,100 she took home every two weeks from the federal government. But it was enough to help pay for car insurance, gas and the February payment on her bronze SUV. Just being out helped shake off the sadness of another morning of jobless limbo."
2015,"“It gets me out of the house. It gives me a routine,” she said. “I need to function. I can’t just sit and wallow in my bed all day. I’ve got to get up.”"
2016,"As she headed downtown to look for riders, Ms. Kelley said she was better off than many workers — living with a roommate helped her save on her bills. But she had no savings and said that if the government did not reopen by the month’s end, she would start looking for other full-time work."
2017,"She said she had always been proud of her ability to take care of things, how she raised two daughters as a single mother while she was working full-time and getting a bachelor’s in health care administration. But on Jan. 10, worried about next month’s bills, she set up a GoFundMe page, joining more than 2,000 other federal workers using the site to seek help during the shutdown."
2018,"Through her windshield, she could see office workers huddling together for smoke breaks and clumped around conference tables in glassy ground-floor offices. She turned onto Van Buren Street, and there was her building where she did payroll and maintained the office equipment at a desk overlooking a parking lot."
2019,"“But it’s a window. I love it,” she said. “I so want to go to the office.”"
2020,"She parked outside the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, hoping to snag someone getting off a train and cut the engine to save on gas. On slow days, she said she knits or reads until her phone pings with a ride."
2021,"Finally, it did."
2022,"“It’s only been two hours,” she said."
2023,"A young man in a suit hopped in, and they drove 0.9 miles to his office at the accounting firm PWC."
2024,$3.37.
2025,"After a month without work, time was starting to mush together into one long stretch. Was today Wednesday? she wondered. No. She was sleeping only four hours some nights, and said the psychological toll of the shutdown was growing. She had long since given up watching the nightly news (“too depressing”), and said she avoided talking about bills and money in front of Avery."
2026,"She blamed President Trump for the shutdown, and scoffed when he said he could relate to what federal workers were going through."
2027,"“You don’t,” she said."
2028,"Four hours into the day, her injured right knee was starting to flare up — a sign that if she didn’t stop driving soon, she would not be able to walk without a burning pain. She had gotten just one ride, earned less than $4."
2029,"“We’ll make a way,” she said. “We’ll figure it out.”"
2030,"Some of her co-workers were getting together that afternoon at a Middle Eastern restaurant that was offering free lunches to federal workers, so Ms. Kelley drove over. Squeezed into a booth, they talked about canceled vacations, dreading their mortgage payments and which colleagues were struggling the most."
2031,"As they were leaving, one woman mentioned that she was heading to a cocktail party that evening, because there would be free food."
2032,"Ms. Kelley looked up: “If you need an Uber driver, call me.”"
2033,"Automakers, in quick succession, have moved in recent weeks to end parts of their operations in Europe. Nissan is the latest: On Tuesday, it confirmed that it would cease assembling Infiniti cars at its plant in northeast England."
2034,"The moves, during Britain’s wrenching debate over its departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, have raised the question: Is Brexit forcing the carmaking industry out of Britain? "
2035,"It’s not quite so simple. Traditional car manufacturers, in Britain and in Europe over all, have been buffeted by forces around the world, and they assess where they want to make the next model of a car every few years or so. "
2036,"As automakers allocate resources, they have been balancing the need to respond to these changes with the justifications for producing cars in places like Britain. "
2037,Here are some of the forces reshaping the industry. 
2038,"Honda said it would close its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021 and stop making one of its sedans in Turkey. The Swindon plant employs 3,500 and the Turkish plant about 1,100. "
2039,"Nissan reversed an earlier decision by deciding to produce the next generation of its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Japan instead of Sunderland, England. Its luxury brand, Infiniti, is withdrawing from Western Europe altogether. "
2040,Ford said in January that it would cut thousands of jobs across Europe. 
2041,"Jaguar Land Rover announced in January that it would be cutting 4,500 people from its global work force; most of the cuts are expected to be in Britain. "
2042,"Dyson, which is developing an electric car, moved its headquarters from Britain to Singapore the same month. "
2043,"General Motors pulled out of Europe in 2017, selling the Opel and Vauxhall brands. "
2044,"In the wake of Volkswagen’s diesel-cheating scandal in 2015, when it used software to trick emissions tests, awareness of the harmful effects of fossil fuels has prompted stricter regulation throughout the Continent."
2045,Some German cities are banning older diesel engines in an effort to reduce pollution in urban areas. London has initiated a levy on drivers of older diesel vehicles. Britain and France plan to phase out sales of new diesel and gasoline-powered cars by 2040. 
2046,Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.
2047,"In the meantime, more governments, drivers and carmakers are pivoting to electric vehicles. Cars running on alternative fuels made up 6 percent of new car registrations last year in Europe, up from 4.8 percent in 2017, according to JATO, an auto industry research firm. "
2048,"Norway is aiming to sell only electric cars by 2025, while India is aiming to be all electric by 2030. "
2049,"Carmakers are racing to respond. Volkswagen said Tuesday that it intended to sell 22 million electric cars over the next 10 years, compared with its previous goal of 15 million, and that the company would aim to be carbon neutral by 2050. "
2050,"The investments necessary for building electric cars have added to cost pressures for automakers that, in some cases, have struggled to turn a profit in Europe. "
2051,"In justifying the closing of its Swindon factory, Honda said it wanted to focus on electrification. “The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes,” the company said. "
2052,"As carmakers channel billions of dollars into grabbing a portion of the electric car market, many are looking to China, which is the world’s largest maker and seller of electric cars. "
2053,"China wants one in every five cars sold to run on an alternative fuel by 2025, and officials have said the country will get rid of internal combustion engines in new cars altogether. The country’s rules also require carmakers to sell more alternative-energy cars if they want to continue selling regular models. "
2054,This has prompted car companies to realign where they make and develop cars. 
2055,"Tesla has opened a factory there. Volkswagen signed an agreement with the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group last year to develop an electric vehicle. General Motors has made China the hub of its electric car research and development, while both Renault-Nissan and Ford have joint electric-car ventures in China. "
2056,"In their efforts to grab a share of the growing market for electric cars, traditional car companies are competing not just with each other but also against technology companies. "
2057,"Uber, Alphabet and Tesla are channeling money into electric cars and autonomous cars, while reshaping the way people travel with ride-hailing services. "
2058,"This has prompted rivals to team up, or to work with the technology companies, so that they are not left behind. "
2059,"Ford and Volkswagen formed an alliance in January to share technology for electric and self-driving vehicles, and save money. "
2060,BMW and Daimler announced in February that they would collectively invest 1 billion euros in a joint venture focused on offering services like car-sharing and electric charging points. 
2061,"Audi, BMW and Daimler have joined forces to buy a digital mapping company. Daimler has teamed up with Uber on autonomous vehicles. "
2062,"BMW is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car. It is also in a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to adapt vehicles to owners’ preferences. "
2063,"Fiat Chrysler is working with Google on self-driving cars, General Motors invested $500 million into Lyft, and Volvo provided the chassis for Uber’s driverless car tests. "
2064,"This shift has accelerated change and added to costs, said Peter Wells, a professor at the Center for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School in Wales. And that has prompted companies to scrutinize whether they should maintain operations in markets that are not expected to grow and could become more difficult to serve. "
2065,"“Companies around the world are having to re-evaluate their positions,” Mr. Wells said. "
2066,"The European car market is not growing. Annual car sales there peaked in 2007 at about 16 million. They’re at about 15 million now, according to JATO. "
2067,"It is also a saturated market, dominated by European marques, and favors smaller cars. Carmakers hungry for profits generated by pickup trucks and S.U.V.s are looking elsewhere for growth. Sales of S.U.V.s in Europe are still far behind those in China and the United States. "
2068,The Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler said in February that it planned to expand its capacity in the United States by updating several plants. They will produce large Jeep models. 
2069,"Certainly, even promising regions face challenges. In the United States, many believe that car sales have peaked, forcing the idling of some factories. And the economic slowdown in China has sent car sales plummeting. "
2070,"But in announcing its withdrawal from Western Europe, Infiniti said it intended to focus on its S.U.V. in North America and its new models in China. "
2071,"Against this backdrop, the uncertainty surrounding Britain’s departure from the European Union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead. Several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise. "
2072,"The fear is that Brexit could cause havoc with the carefully choreographed just-in-time production processes at assembly plants. In Britain, more than half of the components in cars come from the European Union, entering seamlessly on trucks from the Continent and arriving within minutes of being fitted in the final product. "
2073,"After Brexit, those trucks could face substantial delays if they must go through customs checkpoints. Without a clear sense of the terms of Britain’s scheduled departure in a couple of weeks, making plans for production a few years down the line is more difficult. Investment into Britain’s auto industry fell by half last year. "
2074,[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]
2075,Ask a New Yorker about their opinion regarding trains and you will likely get an earful about the sputtering subway system or the less-than-reliable commuter rail lines that stretch into the suburbs.
2076,"But few New Yorkers have ever glimpsed, or even heard of, the New York & Atlantic Railway, a freight train that would seem more familiar rumbling across the Great Plains, not chugging through crowded city neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn, bearing cars loaded with food, scrap metal, construction materials and even beer."
2077,Now the little-known railroad’s profile is about to get much bigger.
2078,"City officials have been working to reduce the inundation of trucks on New York’s streets. The trucks carry about 90 percent of the city’s freight, more than most major American cities, contributing to the city’s worsening gridlock and pouring greenhouse gases into the air."
2079,"By contrast, the city’s rail lines transport just 2 percent of New York’s cargo."
2080,"To change that, city officials are investing tens of millions of dollars to upgrade the freight train’s corridors, including modernizing several rail depots."
2081,"The railway will also handle more freight because another little-known piece of the region’s transportation network will soon be expanded: a service that floats rail cars from New Jersey across New York Harbor by barge to Brooklyn, where they connect with New York and Atlantic’s line."
2082,"“That rail line has an important but unsung job of diverting truck traffic, and it is key to the future of freight transport for New York City,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat who has long advocated rail freight, including supporting building a tunnel under New York Harbor connecting New Jersey to Brooklyn."
2083,"The New York & Atlantic line now is in the surprising position of having its big diesel locomotives — and the sooty, graffiti-strewn boxcars they haul — pegged as a progressive, environmental choice for New York."
2084,"“Anything with rail freight in New York City has to come through us,” said James Bonner, the railway’s president. “We’re the conduit to a lot of growth. It all kind of hinges here.”"
2085,"New York & Atlantic operates on a handful of freight-only lines in Queens, Brooklyn and eastern Long Island mostly by sharing commuter lines run by the Long Island Rail Road, per a 1997 agreement. "
2086,"The short-line railroad receives most of its loaded cars from trains operated by CSX Transportation, one of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, and other railroads from north of the city. They snake down through the Bronx and over the Hell Gate Bridge into Queens, to New York & Atlantic’s cramped rail yard in Glendale, which has the Manhattan skyline for a backdrop."
2087,"New York & Atlantic then takes the cars and distributes them to businesses along its lines where they are often taken onto tracks leading to a customer’s property. Some trains end up at rail-to-truck hubs, where goods are transferred to trucks for local deliveries."
2088,The hubs are vital to rail freight expansion since trains cannot reach all parts of the city. Several truck transfer points along the railway’s Brooklyn line will be improved under a $100 million plan by the city’s Economic Development Corporation to upgrade the city’s maritime and rail freight distribution system.
2089,"“New York City’s rail infrastructure provides significant untapped capacity, whereas our aging highways are at maximum capacity, which limits our ability to remain globally competitive,” said Ryan White, director of freight initiatives for the Economic Development Corporation."
2090,"New York & Atlantic’s volume has grown to 30,000 cars, from roughly 10,000 cars in 1997, Mr. Bonner said."
2091,"Since one rail car can haul as much as four tractor-trailer trucks, those 30,000 cars eliminate some 120,000 truck trips."
2092,"Trucks, and the traffic they cause, helped rally support for a recently approved plan to charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s busiest neighborhoods. A congestion pricing panel formed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo last year recommended imposing the highest fees on trucks."
2093,"New York & Atlantic, which serves about 80 customers in the city and in Long Island, has about 60 employees, including eight train crews that must obey strict traffic restrictions and follow a timetable scheduled around the Long Island Rail Road, the country’s busiest commuter rail. "
2094,"Most deliveries are done at night when there are fewer commuter trains. “We have to operate in a very tight window,” Mr. Bonner said."
2095,"In many ways, the train crews practice railroading as it was done a century ago, from assembling the train in the yard and coupling one car to another, to climbing down to the tracks to maneuver heavy hand switches."
2096,"As they lumber along through the dense urban landscape, passing highways, parks, cemeteries and shopping centers, the freight trains draw curious stares."
2097,"“The surprise on people’s faces when we go through their L.I.R.R. station — they’ve never seen anything like it,” said Alex Raia, a 50-year-old engineer, as he worked the throttle and brake on a 2,000-horsepower diesel locomotive to thread it between tight rows of sooty freight cars in the Glendale yard. He likened the task to “playing a game of chess every day.”"
2098,"The cars can carry scrap, recyclables and construction material, including nearly 1 million tons a year of gravel from quarries in Connecticut."
2099,"Walking the yard, Mr. Bonner pointed to a Providence and Worcester railway train that had just arrived. His crews would take over those cars and deliver them to a large yard in Maspeth, Queens."
2100,A rail car then passed by bearing concrete pieces for a new tunnel being built from Queens to Grand Central Terminal that would be used by the Long Island Rail Road.
2101,The railway also handles so many cars of flour and beer that Mr. Bonner has nicknamed it “the pizza-and-beer railroad.”
2102,"During peak beer drinking times — think St. Patrick’s Day and the Super Bowl — that can mean 30 rail cars of beer a week — each car can hold 3,500 cases — including Modelo Especial and Corona that has rumbled by train all the way from Mexico."
2103,"Several other ideas to increase rail freight have been discussed by transportation experts, but are far from becoming reality. They include expanding the use of commuter rail lines for freight and allowing freight trains on a new rail tunnel planned between New Jersey and Manhattan for Amtrak and New Jersey Transit. The Regional Plan Association, an influential urban planning group, has proposed combined passenger and freight service on underused freight tracks stretching 24 miles from Co-op City in the Bronx to Bay Ridge, Brooklyn."
2104,"For now, about 15 percent of New York & Atlantic’s rail cars are floated over from New Jersey, but that percentage will increase because of an expansion of the Cross Harbor Rail Freight Program, one of the country’s few remaining floating systems for rail freight."
2105,"The barges provide a gateway into the city from the west and the south, since the Hudson River effectively cuts New York off from much of the nation’s rail freight network — the closest rail bridge is about 150 miles north of the city."
2106,Rail cars that arrive at a yard in Jersey City are taken across New York Harbor to a yard in Sunset Park on the Brooklyn waterfront. 
2107,"Since taking over the barge operation in 2008, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has increased the cross-harbor volume from 1,000 rail cars per year to 5,000, but has been limited by having only one aging barge, which has a capacity of 14 rail cars."
2108,"The authority is set to add two new barges, each with an 18-car capacity, said Matt Masters, general manager of the authority’s port rail program. Within five years the cross-harbor system is expected to transport nearly 25,000 rail cars a year."
2109,"Mr. Bonner said that the increased focus on his railways would not only benefit his railroad’s bottom line, but also the public at large."
2110,"“Hopefully,” he said, “we can play a role in what New York City needs.”"
2111,"Tesla delivered fewer vehicles than expected in the first quarter, the company said Wednesday, with deliveries falling 31 percent to 63,000 vehicles from the fourth quarter of 2018."
2112,"The electric-car maker, led by Elon Musk, said the lower-than-expected delivery volume and several pricing adjustments would hurt its first-quarter net income. The company previously said it would lose money in the first quarter."
2113,The company’s shares were down about 8 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday.
2114,"The price cuts were aimed at making Tesla cars affordable to a wider range of customers. The cost to consumers was essentially increased on Jan. 1 when a federal tax credit available to buyers of electric vehicles was cut in half, to $3,750, as part of a scheduled phaseout of the incentive. The credit will drop to $1,875 after July 1 and end next Jan. 1."
2115,"The drop in deliveries appeared to reflect new weakness in demand in the United States, occurring even though Tesla began shipping cars in volume to Europe and China in the quarter. Deliveries of its Model 3 sedan, its most affordable car, totaled 50,900, 20 percent fewer than in the fourth quarter. Deliveries of its Model S and Model X luxury models fell 56 percent to 12,100 cars."
2116,[Hints of the slump were evident in registration data.]
2117,"Tesla produced 77,100 vehicles in the quarter, down from 86,555 in the fourth quarter. It reiterated that it expected to deliver 360,000 to 400,000 cars this year, and said it had finished the quarter with “sufficient” cash on hand, without offering further details. Analysts have raised concerns about Tesla’s cash supply. It started the first quarter with $3.7 billion, but used nearly $1 billion to make a payment to bondholders last month."
2118,"Next month, Tesla hopes to begin volume deliveries of a $35,000 version of the Model 3, the car that many of the company’s fans have been waiting for. Analysts are uncertain whether Tesla can make money selling the Model 3 at that price, however."
2119,"In a Feb. 28 conference call, Mr. Musk said Tesla would close most of its stores around the country and rely on online sales as part of an effort to slash costs so it could sell the $35,000 car profitably. But 11 days later, Tesla reversed course and said it would keep many of the stores, and reopen some that had already closed. It also said it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3."
2120,"In the coming weeks, Tesla is expected to report a loss for the first quarter. The company was profitable in the final two quarters of 2018 as Model 3 sales rose."
2121,"There have been other challenges for the company, including a renewed legal battle between Mr. Musk and the Securities and Exchange Commission."
2122,"The S.E.C. asked a federal court in February to hold Mr. Musk in contempt for violating a settlement that he and Tesla reached with the commission last year regarding scrutiny of his statements. In a motion to the court, the S.E.C. said Mr. Musk had not sought approval from company lawyers, as required by the agreement, before making a sales prediction on Twitter that varied from previous announcements. The court is expected to rule on Thursday."
2123,"In the tweet, which was posted Feb. 19, Mr. Musk said Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year, 100,000 more than the company had forecast in January. Tesla’s general counsel left the company two days later."
2124,"In response, Mr. Musk’s lawyers said the commission was overreaching based on comparable precedents. They contend that Mr. Musk was acting within his discretion in his Twitter posting, and that it contained no material information beyond what the company had previously stated in public."
2125,"Geneva — After years of promising electric cars, established carmakers are actually starting to build them."
2126,"But manufacturers are realizing that a shift to battery power also requires them to retool their sales machinery. The old come-ons are obsolete. Range is the new horsepower. Connectivity replaces cylinder count. And sustainability is the new status symbol. Volvo’s Polestar 2 electric car, unveiled last week, even comes with a leather-free “vegan” interior."
2127,The need for carmakers to win over a public still hesitant about buying a car that needs half an hour or more to recharge is becoming more urgent as electric vehicles move closer to mass production.
2128,"Battery-powered rides like the BMW i3, Nissan Leaf and Tesla’s lineup have been available for years. But this once-niche category is now expanding at a breakneck pace."
2129,"There are dozens of new electric cars on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, which opened to the public on Thursday and continues through March 17. These are not concept cars that may never be for sale, as tended to be the case at previous shows. They are vehicles with familiar brand names that you will be able to buy this year or next."
2130,"An electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year. Volkswagen is refitting a German factory to build a battery-powered car that, beginning in 2020, will sell for about the same price as a Golf."
2131,"Audi, a unit of Volkswagen, showed nothing but battery-powered vehicles and hybrids at the Geneva show. Renault, one of the first companies to offer electric cars, is renewing its lineup. Volvo skipped the show in order to leave the stage to its all-electric Polestar."
2132,"“2019 will be a decisive year for electromobility,” Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief executive, said at a company event in Geneva."
2133,"It’s also a moment of truth for the traditional automakers, which have long argued that their decades of experience in manufacturing will allow them to avoid the start-up problems suffered by Tesla and to dominate the next wave of automotive technology."
2134,"Tesla’s financial woes, which have prompted it to shutter retail stores and lay off 7 percent of its work force, may prove them right. But it remains to be seen whether the entrenched carmakers can generate the same energized fan base."
2135,"The key to selling any product is differentiation, making your car seem cooler and more capable than all the others. Long ago, it was V-8 engines, six-speed automatic transmissions, and the actor Ricardo Montalbán caressing the “soft Corinthian leather” seats of a Chrysler Cordoba."
2136,"But a lot of the features that set conventional cars apart, like fast acceleration, quiet interiors and smooth handling, are pretty much standard with electric cars."
2137,"While gasoline engines need at least a few seconds to gather momentum, batteries deliver instant pep. Electric motors make very little noise. And battery packs, heavy and usually spread out beneath the passenger compartment, provide a low center of gravity and help glue an electric car to the road."
2138,"Automakers also need to prevent their models from becoming commodities as the whole idea of car ownership is under attack by Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies."
2139,"One way Volvo and others are trying to answer the upstarts is by importing a bit of Silicon Valley vibe, even if their engineers are in Sweden or Stuttgart. Polestar, which is positioning itself as a brand separate from Volvo, staged the recent unveiling of the Polestar 2 as if it were a new iteration of the iPhone."
2140,"Thomas Ingenlath, the chief executive of Polestar, bounded onto a stage in Gothenburg, Sweden, wearing a mustard-colored zip-up jacket over black slacks and a T-shirt and white sneakers."
2141,"Polestar is “redefining premium for the electric age,” Mr. Ingenlath said, standing in front of a giant video screen. His presentation, broadcast online, was heavy on the car’s digital features, including an 11-inch touch screen and Google voice recognition software that allows drivers to summon driving directions or call up a tune from Spotify."
2142,"A United States version of the Polestar 2 will go on sale early next year, initially in California and Washington State, for about $63,000. (The Polestar 1, a performance hybrid, has just begun rolling off a Chinese production line.) Dealerships will be small retail spaces in city downtowns, and some may be pop-up stores."
2143,"When Mr. Ingenlath got to the part about the Polestar 2’s vegan interior, he showed an image of cows looking content, presumably because they were not fated to become car seats. “I will spare you now the video of mass production of leather,” Mr. Ingenlath said, somewhat darkly."
2144,"Ricardo Montalbán, who died in 2009, may not have been a fan, but the pitch underlined the carmakers’ assumption that electric car buyers will skew green."
2145,"The primary motivation of a customer who wants an electric vehicle “is being friendly to the planet,” Olivier Murguet, executive vice president for sales at French carmaker Renault, said in an interview in Geneva."
2146,"But, he added, electric vehicle customers pay close attention to the same things as other car buyers, like the purchase price."
2147,"Electric cars continue to cost thousands of dollars more than conventional vehicles. High price remains an obstacle, mostly because of the cost of the batteries. That may be less of a problem than it seems. Electric vehicles already on the road are holding on to their value well, Mr. Murguet said. That allows carmakers to offer attractive leasing terms because they know the cars will command a good resale price when the lease expires."
2148,"European customers can lease a Renault Zoe, a two-door battery-powered subcompact, for 150 euros a month, or $170. “Even if the price of the cars is higher, the amount to finance from a customer’s perspective is not that much more,” Gilles Normand, senior vice president for electric vehicles at Renault, said in an interview in Geneva."
2149,"And many buyers of electric cars won’t be individuals, but car-sharing services that buy them by the dozens and can spread the cost among more users. Those buyers tend to pay attention to the cost of a car over its life span rather than just the initial purchase price. Electric cars look better from that angle because they don’t require oil changes and electricity is cheaper per mile than gasoline."
2150,"“The whole business case is changing for all of us,” Chris Delaney, president of Europe for tire maker Goodyear, said as he sat in a self-driving electric shuttle van on display in Geneva. (Goodyear is supplying specialized tires for the vehicle.)"
2151,"While electric vehicles account for only about 5 percent of Goodyear’s current sales, Mr. Delaney said, they account for 40 percent of new business from manufacturers — an indication of how fast demand is rising. Electric cars pose a design challenge for tiremakers as well. The cars’ high weight and fast acceleration require a more robust tire."
2152,"The open question is whether any of the established carmakers, who still make most of their money from conventional vehicles, can generate buzz as effectively as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. Despite all of Tesla’s problems, Mr. Musk commands widespread respect in the industry for transforming the image of electric cars from nerdy science projects to desirable performance vehicles."
2153,"So far, no other car manager has demonstrated Mr. Musk’s ability to make Tesla the center of the conversation, though not always in a good way."
2154,"“Tesla did a lot to build up the market for electric cars,” Detlev von Platen, head of sales and marketing at Porsche, said. “We have a lot of respect for what they accomplished. They’re a reference for us.”"
2155,SEOUL — South Korea's LG Chem said on Sunday that it has set up a joint venture with Vietnam's VinFast Trading and Production to produce lithium-ion batteries for the Vietnamese carmaker's electric scooters and electric vehicles. 
2156,"The two companies established their joint venture factory in the Vietnamese northern port city of Hai Phong, with an aim to produce lithium-ion battery packs for VinFast's electric scooters that are being made now and electric cars to be produced in the future, the South Korean battery maker said in a statement. "
2157,"The plan comes as VinFast, a unit of Vietnam's largest conglomerate Vingroup JSC, aims to become the country's first domestic car manufacturer and targets to produce 250,000 cars per year. Vingroup has earmarked $3.5 billion(2.7 billion pounds) for its overall car manufacturing project."
2158,"Part of the joint-venture plans include providing premium products that meet international standards and supplying lithium-ion battery cells for electric devices and other products belonging to Vingroup, the statement added."

2160,This article contains spoilers for the four-part HBO documentary “The Case Against Adnan Syed.”
2161,
2162,Did Adnan Syed kidnap and murder his ex-girlfriend and high school classmate Hae Min Lee in 1999? A Baltimore County jury in 2000 decided he did. Millions of listeners to the podcast “Serial” haven’t been so sure.
2163,Viewers of Sunday night’s finale of the four-part HBO documentary “The Case Against Adnan Syed” will continue to wonder. But they will do so armed with new facts. Chief among them: A series of new forensic tests found no traces of Syed’s DNA on the many samples taken from Lee’s body and car during the original investigation.
2164,"The series’s director, Amy Berg, made good on HBO’s promise to deliver big revelations on a 20-year-old murder case that “Serial” made famous starting in 2014. Like the podcast, the HBO series offered no definitive statements about Syed’s guilt, but it did raise numerous questions about the methods and conclusions of the state."
2165,"What’s next? Whatever happens will arrive in a context very different from the one Syed faced less than a month ago, when the highest court in Maryland denied him a retrial, overturning the decisions of two lower courts. Here’s a quick look at the finale’s major revelations."
2166,"Many samples were taken from Lee during the original investigation, including fingernail clippings and material from necklaces and clothing. New tests performed at the defense’s request revealed that none of the samples tested positive for Syed’s DNA. His DNA also was not found among samples taken from Lee’s car, where prosecutors have said they believe she was strangled."
2167,"[Read an interview about the series with its director, Amy Berg.]"
2168,"No physical evidence against Syed was presented at his trial in 2000, so these findings could add heft to his innocence claim. Still, there is a major caveat: No one else’s DNA was found on Lee’s body or in her car, either. That means only that the killer, whether it was someone else or Syed, left no detectable trace among the areas sampled."
2169,"News about the DNA testing was first revealed Thursday by The Baltimore Sun, based on documents obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request. “These results in no way exonerate him,” a spokeswoman for the Maryland Attorney General’s Office told The Sun."
2170,"According to the documents, one female DNA profile not matching Lee was found on a piece of rope found near the place where Lee was buried. But that profile did not match anyone’s DNA in law enforcement databases. The DNA of investigating officers, who might accidentally have left some material behind, was eliminated."
2171,Latent fingerprints pulled from the rearview mirror of Lee’s car did not match Syed’s. The defense requested that they be compared with prints in the database.
2172,They did not match with anyone’s prints in the system. Whoever left the prints has never been arrested and booked.
2173,[Haven’t yet seen the HBO series? Here’s what to know before watching.]
2174,"The state’s key witness, Jay Wilds, a former friend of Syed’s, told the police that after he helped Syed bury Lee’s body, he went with Syed to ditch Lee’s car at a grassy lot in a residential area of Baltimore. Wilds led the police to the car about six weeks after Lee was killed."
2175,"Private investigators hired by Berg asked Erik Ervin, a turf physiologist from the University of Delaware with a Ph.D. in horticulture, to examine the grassy lot, along with photographs of the car from the day police discovered it. Numerous factors — including the freshness of the tire tracks, the freshness of the grass blades visible in the treads and the condition of the grass beneath the car — led Ervin to believe that the car may have been there for a week or less."
2176,"The private investigators also spoke with Jan Gorniak, the chief medical examiner of Fulton County, Ga. She examined the autopsy report and photographs and surmised that descriptions of Lee’s injuries did not in many ways appear consistent with the theory that she died during a struggle in her car."
2177,"Because of markings caused by a phenomenon called lividity, which Gorniak described as “the settling of blood after you die,” she said that Lee’s body must have lain for eight to 12 hours somewhere other than where she was ultimately buried, in Baltimore’s Leakin Park. Her assessment contradicts the prosecution’s timeline, which has Syed and Wilds burying Lee’s body about five hours after the slaying."
2178,"Wilds gave two police interviews and testified at trial, and the contradictions among those accounts were well documented in “Serial” and in earlier episodes of the HBO series. (Click here for a useful comparison of the various timelines Wilds gave to investigators.) They are significant and many."
2179,"Berg contacted Wilds, who declined to be interviewed for the series. He did, however, provide statements."
2180,"In them, he made several new claims. One was that the police had coached him to say in his second taped interview that Syed first showed him Lee’s body, in the trunk of her car, at a Best Buy parking lot, not at a meeting point off Edmondson Avenue, as he had originally said."
2181,The Best Buy location matches a map drawn by investigators based on cellphone geolocation records. Those records have themselves been called into question — a factor cited in the lower courts’ decisions to vacate Syed’s conviction.
2182,"In his statement to Berg, Wilds said that Syed showed up to his house in Lee’s car with the body in the trunk. This is new."
2183,"Also new: Wilds told Berg that Syed asked him to procure 10 pounds of marijuana. Wilds said that once the marijuana was acquired, Syed threatened to turn him in if he did not help bury Lee’s body."
2184,"The police and prosecutors have consistently stood by their methods and conclusions. According to Syed’s defense lawyer, C. Justin Brown, the state’s attorney general refused as recently as November to offer Syed any plea deal without a full admission of guilt and more prison time."
2185,"WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Thursday that he planned to give Mexico a “one-year warning” before closing the southern border, retreating on a threat he made last week that he would close the border in the coming days if Mexico did not halt all illegal immigration."
2186,"“The only thing, frankly, better and less drastic than closing the border is tariff the cars coming in, and I will do it,” Mr. Trump said, speaking to reporters after a meeting with the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. “I don’t play games.”"
2187,"He added: “If the drugs don’t stop, or largely stop, we’re going to put tariffs on Mexico and products, in particular cars — the whole ballgame is cars. And if that doesn’t stop the drugs, we close the border.”"
2188,"[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]"
2189,"Mr. Trump cited the flow of drugs over the border as his red line. But last Friday, he announced on Twitter that “if Mexico doesn’t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.”"
2190,"Since then, the White House has backed off that time frame for an action that would carry severe economic consequences if Mr. Trump followed through with it. Nearly $1.7 billion of goods and services flow across the United States-Mexico border every day, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. About 500,000 legal workers, students, shoppers and tourists also cross the border daily."
2191,"Mr. Trump’s latest reversal came after Republican lawmakers and his own economic advisers warned him of the consequences of the move. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said, “I would hope we would not be doing that sort of thing.”"
2192,"Furious lobbying by the president’s own economic advisers and a flood of incoming data from outside groups helped to shift the president’s thinking on shutting down the border, a person familiar with the situation said."
2193,"Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council; Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers; and their deputies communicated to the president how economically disastrous the policy would be, including the effect on daily economic growth starting within 48 hours of the closing."
2194,"White House officials had already been vague about the president’s plans to follow through on his threat. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters this week that Mr. Trump “is not working on a specific timeline.” And on Tuesday, during a meeting with Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general, the president said, “I haven’t made that intention known,” when asked specifically about his threat to close the border this week."
2195,"Talking to reporters at the White House on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was going to either close the southern border with America’s third-largest trading partner or “tariff the cars.” He said he would “probably start off with the tariffs.”"
2196,"But tariffs on cars coming across the southern border would largely drive up costs for American and European automakers — and their customers. Most of the cars and car parts coming from Mexico are intended for multinational automakers, including American car companies like General Motors and Ford."
2197,"It is also unclear the degree to which Mr. Trump could impose auto tariffs under the terms of his newly renegotiated North American Free Trade Agreement. While the new deal, called the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, has yet to be ratified, it includes a provision that exempts Mexican cars from tariffs as long as they stay below a certain level of imports. Only imports above that cap, which is quite high, would be eligible for a levy, the agreement states."
2198,"The president is scheduled to travel to Calexico, Calif., on Friday for a photo op at a newly fortified section of the border."
2199,"While Mr. Trump backed off his threats to immediately close the southern border, the Department of Homeland Security has reallocated officials working at the ports of entry to handle a surge of unauthorized crossings by large groups of migrants, Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, said on Monday. The move has resulted in long delays and increased traffic at ports of entry."
2200,"Ms. Nielsen has also permitted Customs and Border Protection to reallocate as many as 2,000 officials from the ports. The move comes as more Central American families have crossed the border in recent months in search of asylum, leading to overflowing detention facilities and mass releases of migrants into cities along the border."
2201,"LONDON — Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) shut its UK plants on Monday for five days over Brexit, adding to other shutdowns to leave at least half the country's car production off-line in what could be a pivotal week for Britain's divorce from the EU. "
2202,"The move was intended to prepare for any Brexit-related disruption at Britain's biggest carmaker, which on Monday also reported a fall in global sales."
2203,The decision was taken a few months ago at a time when the departure date - since extended to April 12 - was March 29. 
2204,"Automotive firms face several possible risks under a disorderly Brexit, including delays to the supply of parts and finished models, new customs bureaucracy, the need to recertify cars and an up to 10 percent tariff on finished vehicles."
2205,Prime Minister Theresa May's efforts to obtain a longer extension have also ruined contingency plans for some of them.
2206,"Shutdowns are generally organized far in advance so staff holidays can be scheduled and suppliers adjust volumes, making them hard to move."
2207,"With Britain's political leaders still deadlocked over Brexit and some EU states questioning a further departure delay, culture minister Jeremy Wright said May would continue talks with the opposition Labour Party to try to find a compromise solution."
2208,"BMW's UK Mini and Rolls-Royce plants are also shuttered this week, as is Peugeot's Vauxhall car factory, which brought forward summer shutdowns to April."
2209,"Together JLR, Mini, Rolls-Royce and Peugeot's Vauxhall, branded as Opel in the rest of Europe, built over 750,000 of Britain's 1.52 million cars last year. "
2210,"Honda has also scheduled six ""non-production days"" in April but has declined to say exactly when."
2211,"Britain's car sector has posted sharp falls in sales, output and investment since 2017."
2212,"JLR had to cut output last year, and in the year to March 2019 its global sales fell nearly 6 percent to 578,915 vehicles, hit by a sharp decline in China. UK sales rose 8.4 percent, however."
2213,"Overwhelmingly foreign-owned, the Britain-based car industry has become increasingly frustrated as a stable investment environment becomes mired in a political crisis that could lead to trade restrictions. "
2214,At least 25 percent of Britain's automotive engine capacity is also closed as BMW's central English Hams Hall factory continues a four-week shutdown while JLR's Wolverhampton site stops production this week as part of Brexit preparations. 
2215,Honda engine production will also stop on six days this month.

2217,"Todd Morici bought his first collectible car in 1984, a four-year-old Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer. He was 24 and drove it as often as he could, racking up 10,000 miles before he sold it. But he realized something else about Ferrari’s appeal."
2218,"“You could go into a dealership, put $5,000 down and wait” for a new buyer to come along, he said. “The car cost about $75,000. But you could buy it, flip it a week later and basically double your money.”"
2219,"By that point, Mr. Morici was hooked on two things: the beauty of Ferraris and their investment potential."
2220,"That knowledge converged in a windfall in 2010 when he sold a 1959 Ferrari 250 GT long wheelbase California Spider for $7.2 million. He’d paid $900,000 for it seven years earlier. That same model sold in 2016 for $18 million, he said."
2221,"Collectible cars are illiquid assets, those that are not easy to sell, like a stock or a bond. The market can fluctuate wildly, and distressed investors can wind up selling at a loss."
2222,"But that risk doesn’t stop collectors. For some, the cars remind them of a mythical vehicle they could not have when they were young. For others, they are simply more fun to own than stocks and bonds."
2223,"Regardless, collectible cars are going to retain their value better than a new car, which depreciates as soon as it is driven off the lot."
2224,"Unlike art, which I wrote about last week as part of a series on passion assets, cars require a commitment of time and money. Leaving one in a garage, the way one might hang a piece of art on a wall, is not possible. They need to be driven, or else belts will dry out and gears will seize up. But not too much, because low mileage is prized when it comes to resale value."
2225,"Regular maintenance, recorded for a future buyer, is a must, and service calls can be costly, like the ones for Ferraris that require the car’s engine to be removed. They can cost more than $20,000 per visit."
2226,"Whether cars are a great investment in a strong economy isn’t apparent. Their value rose more than 300 percent from 2008 to 2015, according to the Historic Automobile Group International. By comparison, the S&P 500 rose 40 percent in that same period. But over the past four years, they have risen a comparatively modest 85 percent, with Ferrari leading that growth, while the S&P 500 rose 22 percent."
2227,"“When housing and everything crashed in 2008, there were still wealthy people, so they bought alternative assets and they bought cars,” said Stu Carpenter, founder of Copley Motorcars and a leading expert on Ferraris and Land Rovers. “More collectors came into the market and drove up prices, and then more cars came into the market. Supply and demand fed off each other until 2015, when most things peaked.”"
2228,"The response in the last recession surprised even the experts, said David Gooding, president of Gooding & Company, a leading auto auction house."
2229,"“We didn’t see it coming, but in retrospect, it does make sense,” he said. “While there was so much uncertainty in traditional markets, there was a flight toward tangible things people could wrap their minds around.”"
2230,He cautions against thinking it will happen again: “Does it mean it will always be the case? No. The car market will continue to have some peaks and valleys.”
2231,"After recent auctions in Pebble Beach, Calif., and Scottsdale, Ariz., experts said cars were fairly valued, even though that meant some cars, even Ferraris, sold for less than they would have a few years ago. But both Mr. Gooding and Mr. Carpenter said that sellers were going to have to be realistic about a car’s price and quality."
2232,Keeping a car in top shape is not an inexpensive proposition.
2233,"Vinnie Pacifico, who made his money in food service, said he cherished his 1963 Corvette with a split window and enjoyed driving it. But to satiate his appetite for speed, he prefers driving a 2017 Porsche 911 Turbo Carrera."
2234,"“If you figured out what it cost me by the mile or hour, I should have my head examined,” he said of the 8,000 miles a year he drives it. “But I like driving it.”"
2235,"Yet the Porsche, which he leases, cost all in about $250,000. His Corvette, which he bought in the mid-1980s for around $12,000, is worth just $130,000 by his reckoning, and is far cheaper to maintain."
2236,"Benjamin Clymer, who owns the online watch retailer Hodinkee, has seven classic cars, which he keeps in Westchester County, a more affordable garage than any near his Manhattan home. His collection includes Alfa Romeos, Porsches and a 1964 Lancia Flaminia Zagato, a car once considered the Rolls-Royce of Italy."
2237,"But he said he was lucky if he got a chance to visit them twice a month, and that leaves him little time to drive all of them. He said collectors needed to consider the cost of maintenance. A few years ago, he sold a 1999 Ferrari 456 for $115,000, which was $30,000 more than he paid for it. Yet he does not consider it a good investment because the car was due for a $22,000 service, which he would have had to pay had he kept it."
2238,"“I just had no idea how costly Ferrari maintenance would be,” he said."
2239,"His bigger concern is that his taste tends toward cars that are not sought after by his peers, making them harder to maintain and eventually sell."
2240,"Mr. Gooding said such generational tastes needed to be considered, along with the continued existence of the manufacturer. “There’s just a wider mass of people that relate to brands like Porsche than to a defunct brand,” he said."
2241,"There are, of course, exceptions. In August, Gooding & Company sold a 1935 Duesenberg SSJ for $22 million, a record for both an American car and a prewar car. But in this case, only two of this model were built: one for Clark Gable, the other for Gary Cooper, which was the one that was sold."
2242,"With a price like that, many collectors might worry about overpaying. Mr. Gooding said he analyzed past catalogs and found that many of the cars that sold for record prices at the time had been some of the best investments for collectors. He attributes that to those cars having something different or even unique about them."
2243,"But the value of collectible cars can sometimes fall. Mr. Carpenter said a frenzy developed over the Ferrari Maranello 575, first made in 2002. The few that had manual transmissions shot up in value. But those models, which once sold for $450,000, are now worth $300,000, he said."
2244,"A more common risk is having to sell too quickly. Rubin Pikus, chief executive of Milbrook Properties, has a collection of seven cars, including a Corvette, a Rolls-Royce, a Bentley and a Ferrari F12 that once belonged to the former Yankees catcher Jorge Posada."
2245,"He estimates that he has bought and sold more than 100 cars in his life. But he remembers the one car that he lost money on: a 1978 Aston Martin flip-tail coupe that was among a few imported to the United States. He paid $325,000 and took it to his home in West Palm Beach, Fla."
2246,"But the summer heat and humidity clogged up the car’s carburetor, and the car had trouble starting if left out in the sun. So he decided to sell it back to the dealer — who offered him $50,000 less."
2247,"“I’ve had other cars that I’ve made money on it,” he said. “For me, it’s a hobby and to say I can get into that car and drive it and show it off.”"
2248,"But he still sees investment potential. He and his son-in-law bought a 1992 Ferrari Testarossa, which sits on a lift in a private garage and is driven once a month. They paid $350,000 for it last year and expect it will be worth $500,000 in five years. One thing is for certain: It won’t have many more miles on it by then."
2249,“What’s my name?” 
2250,"That’s what students and administrators at the University of South Carolina are urging people to ask before they get into a car, to be sure it’s the one they called via a ride-sharing app. "
2251,"The public safety campaign follows the death of Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old student who was killed last weekend after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber, the police said. Across the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a similar mistake. "
2252,[Read about women being attacked by men posing as drivers.]
2253,"Asking that simple question — “What’s my name?” — would help keep riders safe, advocates said. Here are more tips for what you can do, according to law enforcement officials and ride-share companies:"
2254,"After booking a ride, a confirmation text should include the license plate number and a description of the car. It is critical to know what you are getting."
2255,"Depending on the tier of service you choose, Uber could send anything from a basic four-door sedan to a black sport-utility vehicle that is commercially registered and insured. A vehicle that is not what you expect is one of the more obvious giveaways that there might be a problem. "
2256,"Any discrepancy is a red flag, and riders should not get into the car. "
2257,"That confirmation message from the ride-share app should also include a photo of your driver, so check to be sure they match. Always ask the driver their name and make sure that it also lines up. "
2258,"Share your trip details with a friend, relative or a group through the sharing option available on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. The “Trusted Contacts” feature allows you to select up to five friends or family members with whom you can share your whereabouts for every ride."
2259,"Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course. Riders with Lyft can also share the route and estimated time of arrival by tapping Send ETA."
2260,"Uber and Lyft also offer glowing dashboard lights called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. But the lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Ms. Josephson, that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign. "
2261,"If you suspect danger, or if you have an emergency, call 911 immediately. Uber also provides an in-app emergency button to connect riders directly to 911. It can be reached through a section of the app called the Safety Center."
2262,"Tesla’s sleek stores embodied its green vision for upending the transportation and energy business: a one-stop shop for electric cars, solar panels and battery storage. Less than three months ago, the company announced 11 new store locations across the country."
2263,"Now Tesla is in retreat, shuttering most of its stores in a bid to cut costs. The move signaled the broader vulnerabilities of an upstart that for a time was the most highly valued American car company."
2264,"A spate of price cuts in the United States points to a slowdown in sales, and the company says it is currently making cars for Europe and China only. But plans to bring the company’s mass-market car, the Model 3, to overseas buyers have been hamstrung by logistical challenges."
2265,"A long-promised $35,000 version of the Model 3 is finally being offered, but the price will test the company’s profitability. Tesla now expects a loss in the first quarter, rattling investors’ faith in the company and its enigmatic founder, Elon Musk. In recent days, its shares have tumbled more than 13 percent."
2266,"“I think this company is in scary territory,” said Erik Gordon, a management expert at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business. The “flip-flop” on retail strategy, he added, “makes it seem like Musk is winging it and the board is letting him wing it.”"
2267,"Asked for comment on the company’s strategy and outlook, a Tesla spokesman referred to its financial filings and recent statements by Mr. Musk expressing confidence in its course."
2268,"Mr. Musk has promised a revolution in pretty much every business he has entered. His Space X rockets are meant to take passengers to other planets someday, while his Boring Company aims to solve traffic problems with underground tunnels."
2269,"At Tesla, Mr. Musk wanted to transform car manufacturing with a highly automated production process. But the company has struggled to master the basics."
2270,"Production lines sputtered when Mr. Musk pushed to churn out a few thousand cars a week — something established automakers do in a day. Tesla sent customers $70,000 cars with dings, scratches and malfunctioning screens. Some owners needing repairs were told to wait weeks or months for an appointment."
2271,"Recently, the financial stress on the company has become more evident. It laid off 7 percent of its work force in January, the second job cut in the last eight months. And the company had to use up a quarter of its available cash last week to make a $920 million payment to bondholders, giving it less of a cushion to expand or absorb losses."
2272,"Next week, Mr. Musk intends to unveil Tesla’s newest offering, the Model Y, a small sport utility vehicle that uses some of the same parts as the Model 3. But those ambitions will further strain Tesla’s capital and could pose a risk to sales of other models."
2273,And the abrupt change to online-only sales is a rare strategic reversal.
2274,"In the final three months of 2018, Tesla opened 27 sales and service locations to keep up with rising demand for the Model 3. Over all, it had more than 100 stores and showrooms nationwide and others overseas. In a Feb. 19 regulatory filing, Tesla said company-owned stores strengthened its brand and helped reach potential customers in major markets."
2275,"Just nine days later, Mr. Musk said Tesla was going to close all but “a small number” of its stores, which take orders, and galleries, which increase exposure. He also said that the company would no longer offer test drives, and that all sales had to be completed by computer or smartphone."
2276,"At a darkened Tesla outlet in the Dallas Galleria, one of the locations that opened in December, a security guard sat inside the store this week as passers-by snapped photos of the three cars visible though the glass. A sign proclaimed, “All Tesla Sales Now Online.”"
2277,"As Mr. Musk lays it out, the change is not so radical. In an email to employees, he said that 78 percent of Model 3 orders were already placed online, and that 82 percent of the model’s buyers made their purchase without a test drive."
2278,"Mr. Musk has made two arguments. He said store closings and related job reductions would enable Tesla to lower costs enough to make money selling Model 3s for $35,000. Financial analysts are not so sure. In a note to his clients, Toni Sacconaghi of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company estimated that the profit margin on the base Model 3 was “close to 0 today.”"
2279,"Mr. Musk also said the move to online-only sales would become a strategic advantage. But Mr. Gordon, the University of Michigan professor, questioned whether Tesla would be able to maintain growth without brick-and-mortar stores."
2280,"“They are not going to grow faster by being online only than by online plus stores,” he said. “It’s a logical impossibility.”"
2281,"In the last three years, Tesla has missed several of the ambitious goals Mr. Musk has set. He once forecast that Tesla would turn out 500,000 cars in 2018, twice what it ultimately produced."
2282,"Mr. Musk announced last week that Tesla was accepting orders for a Model 3 priced at $35,000 — $8,000 less than the current basic model. But the federal tax credit on Tesla cars has been scaled back, so none of the cars will be available for a total of less than $30,000, as he once heralded."
2283,"Tesla has reduced prices on its other cars several times in the last two months, including cuts of up to 30 percent on its priciest models last week, suggesting sluggish sales. The online publication InsideEVs, which follows Tesla closely, estimated that the company sold fewer than 8,000 cars in January, down from nearly 30,000 a month at the end of 2018."
2284,"Asked about sales trends, a Tesla spokesman pointed to a statement by Mr. Musk in his conference call about first-quarter earnings: “The demand for Model 3 is insanely high. The inhibitor is affordability. It’s just that people literally don’t have the money to buy the car.”"
2285,"Like its car sales, Tesla’s residential solar business has hit turbulence, a problem that may be compounded by the store closings. Tesla had positioned its stores as a retail hub for the renewable-energy age, offering electric cars, solar panels and battery storage for both car and home."
2286,"“Similar to our approach to selling vehicles, we are also shifting sales of our energy and solar products worldwide to online only,” Tesla said in a statement. It said the model would allow customers to save thousands of dollars."
2287,"But Allison Mond, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, which tracks and supplies solar data for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said the move was likely to be counterproductive. “Online historically is not a very popular way to sell solar,” she said. “It really has not been proven.”"
2288,"SolarCity, the predecessor to Tesla’s solar business, once controlled two-thirds of the residential market. By the end of last year under Tesla’s control, that share was under 10 percent. The latest move, Ms. Mond said, “just adds to the story that, I think, Tesla does not care about their residential solar business.”"
2289,"Many Tesla customers say they have purchased cars online with no problems. For trade-ins, they were able to upload photos and get a quote back without going to a showroom for appraisal. But many still balk at buying an automobile — the second most expensive consumer purchase after a home — without seeing it first."
2290,"Kevin Smith-Fagan, a television executive in Sacramento, said he did a lot of research online before buying a car, but still preferred to see it up close before making a decision."
2291,"“There are intangibles that you can only know by getting into the car,” he said. “There’s a comfort level in knowing exactly what you’re getting.”"
2292,"Online or otherwise, Mr. Smith-Fagan is unlikely to be a buyer. He drives another electric car, the Nissan Leaf, that he bought used for $9,000. He would love to own a Tesla, he said, “but for 35 grand, it’s not in the cards.”"
2293,SAN FRANCISCO — Lyft’s debut on the stock market is off to a bumpy start.
2294,"The ride-hailing company went public in a blaze of glory on Friday, as its stock jumped 8.7 percent from its initial public offering price of $72 a share. On Monday, in its second day of trading, Lyft’s stock plunged nearly 12 percent to below $72, closing the day at $69.01."
2295,"The rapid decline raises questions about investors’ appetite for fast-growing but unprofitable tech companies. While Lyft has been expanding and gaining new revenue, it lost nearly $1 billion last year. Ride-hailing companies often subsidize the cost of rides and pay incentives to drivers, which is expensive. And Lyft is also spending heavily on initiatives including electric bikes and self-driving technology."
2296,"Other tech companies that went public while recording large losses, such as Snap, Twitter and Groupon, also eventually fell below their offering prices."
2297,"“Everyone is taken up with the idea of the ride-hailing business; it’s exciting and high-growth,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages an I.P.O.-focused exchange-traded fund that will include Lyft later this week. “But it’s hard to figure out their valuation.”"
2298,Lyft declined to comment.
2299,[Not everyone who invested in Lyft is reaping the spoils.]
2300,Lyft’s performance could sway other high-profile tech companies that are planning to go public.
2301,"Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing company, is planning to go public in the next few months; it is also deeply unprofitable. Others stampeding toward the public market include Pinterest, the digital pin board; Slack, the messaging company; and Peloton, the home-fitness company."
2302,"“The ones following in the wake of Lyft will be priced more reasonably,” Ms. Smith said."
2303,"Even if Lyft eventually makes money, its margins might be low, she cautioned. Lyft is constantly dealing with new competitors, which means that it may have to continue subsidizing its drivers and cutting the prices that it charges passengers. That makes profits a faraway prospect."
2304,"The volatility in Lyft’s stock was not unexpected, said Tom White, a senior vice president at the wealth management firm D. A. Davidson. “Nothing has changed on the fundamental outlook for the business in the last few days,” he said."
2305,"CHONGQING, China — For Detroit, China once meant opportunity. The country’s growing ranks of drivers bought cars by the millions. Its cheap labor gave American automakers dreams of someday exporting their Chinese-made cars to the United States. The Big Three bet billions of dollars there."
2306,"Now China’s place in the world is shifting, and that bet is starting to sour."
2307,Chinese consumers are buying fewer cars as the country’s economy slows. Local competitors have raised their game. Many young people would rather use ride-sharing services similar to Uber than own vehicles themselves.
2308,"And if the Trump administration’s trade hawks have their way, China won’t make many cars for Americans. As Washington and Beijing haggle over a deal to end their trade war, the hawks are defending tariffs, imposed by President Trump last year, that would make it expensive to sell Chinese-made cars — including those with American brands — in the United States."
2309,"China’s slowdown presents the most immediate problem. Some of Detroit’s Chinese factories have slowed to a crawl. In the inland metropolis of Chongqing, where Ford builds cars like the compact Focus, three big assembly plants have been running at less than one-fifth of capacity. Ford’s joint venture in Chongqing has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its 20,000 workers."
2310,"Seven Zhou, a 32-year-old worker who assembled transmissions, lost his job last month. His paychecks had already shrunk by two-thirds because he was working fewer hours. He quit smoking to pay for food and rent, and the family is struggling to pay for the after-school English and math lessons his son needs for a chance at college."
2311,"“I do not have much education,” Mr. Zhou said. “I had hoped my child would not be like me, the bottom level of labor.”"
2312,"As China transforms, many global businesses are struggling to adapt. China’s economy has matured and can no longer match the sky-high growth rates of its go-go years. The Chinese government is trying to cope with all the debt accumulated to pay for that growth. Initiatives that could juice the economy have slowed. "
2313,"The rest of the world has begun to fundamentally rethink its dependence on China to make much of what the world consumes. Some within the Trump administration see China as an existential threat to core American industries like autos, much as it has come to dominate production of solar panels, steel and aluminum. "
2314,"There have long been doubts among automakers and consumers about whether cars made in China could measure up to those produced in America. But with the gap in quality narrowing, companies in China and the United States have begun to explore the possibility."
2315,"General Motors, which began exporting the Buick Envision from China to the United States in 2016, has been pleading since last summer without success for the Trump administration to exempt it from a 25 percent tariff imposed on Chinese-made cars. Ford announced in the summer of 2017 that it would move Focus production to China from Michigan, only to cancel those plans as the political landscape changed in the United States. "
2316,"Exports from China to the United States of Detroit-brand cars are “a no-fly zone,” said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm in San Diego. “It’s just too politically sensitive.”"
2317,Detroit’s fortunes in China could still improve. A final trade deal could leave the door open to Chinese exports. The Chinese government could take steps to rev up domestic growth or empower its consumers to buy cars. 
2318,"“A stronger economy will lead to stronger auto sales,” said Irene Shen, a General Motors spokeswoman."
2319,"But for now, Detroit’s Big Three are struggling in China — particularly Ford."
2320,"Business from Detroit has helped China become both the world’s largest maker and its largest buyer of cars. Much of the global auto parts industry has moved there as well, making it especially convenient to manufacture cars in China. "
2321,"Drawn by the country’s rapid development and consumer revolution, G.M. invested about $10 billion. It now makes and sells more cars through its Chinese joint ventures than it does in the United States. Ford, which came later, invested as much as $5 billion. "
2322,China’s car-building capacity is now roughly equal to those of North America and Europe combined. More car factories are being built to meet regulators’ demands for more electric cars.
2323,"But a slowing economy and an end to tax breaks for car buyers have brought the industry back to earth. In January, car sales in China fell 18 percent from a year earlier. The average car factory in China, already operating at a little more than half capacity, has slowed even more amid the sales slump, according to LMC Automotive, a consulting firm."
2324,"American brands are also being squeezed. The Chinese elite still prefer premium German brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi. More frugal families buy cheaper Chinese and Japanese cars and are increasingly buying used."
2325,"The ride-hailing business has dealt automakers an unexpected blow. The global auto industry has worried for years that companies like Uber and Lyft could eat into demand, particularly among young customers. That appears to have happened in China, experts say, where dense urban cities have enhanced the appeal of Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing giant. Didi now carries twice as many riders in China each year as Uber carries in the rest of the world combined."
2326,"“None of the multinational automakers foresaw how disruptive that would be to demand,” said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler’s operations in China."
2327,"Young people in China are also more open to Chinese brands, thanks in part to their improved quality. "
2328,"“They’re a lot more favorably disposed towards Chinese brands, and they have a pride in the Chinese brands,” said Nigel Harris, the president of Ford’s main joint venture in China, Changan Ford."
2329,"This winter has been difficult for American brands in China. Sales of G.M.’s Chevrolet and Buick models have faltered (though Cadillacs continue to sell well), and Chrysler’s Jeeps face stiff competition from cheaper sport utility vehicles made by Chinese companies. After a dismal autumn, Ford sold 70 percent fewer cars in China in January than it did in the same month a year earlier."
2330,"The automakers are tweaking their lineups to improve sales. G.M. and Ford are ramping up production of their respective Cadillac and Lincoln brands to tap the luxury market. G.M. has expanded its bargain Chinese brands, Baojun and Wuling. In a potentially risky move for its brand, Ford has put its blue oval logo on an inexpensive S.U.V., the Territory, that is mostly designed and built by a Chinese automaker, Jiangling Motors."
2331,"It is too early to tell how well Ford’s move will go. But at a Ford dealership in Chongqing, the $16,000 Territory was selling briskly, while a number of Focus cars, priced at $22,000, have sat unsold since 2017. "
2332,"“As soon as one arrives,” Li Pengfei, a salesman, said of the Territory, “someone picks it up.” "
2333,"Nowhere are the problems of Detroit automakers more apparent than in Chongqing, an often foggy city built on steep slopes overlooking the confluence of two broad, muddy rivers, the Yangtze and the Jialing. "
2334,"When a local hiring hall held an automotive-themed day last week, it was mobbed with former Ford employees who had accepted severance payments and were looking for their next jobs. The company has changed from running factories on up to three shifts, almost around the clock, to just a single shift."
2335,"Mr. Harris declined to discuss layoffs in detail, saying, “Organizational fitness is a critical part of China cost, so we are working night and day to make sure that we are fit.”"
2336,"In Chongqing, some workers do not see the industry ever recovering."
2337,"Du Wen, a 28-year-old in a green hoodie and jeans who had assembled car doors for Ford’s joint venture partner, Changan, for the past four years, said that he was going to leave the auto industry entirely. So he was applying to work at a factory making instant soup, even though that would mean a sharp pay cut."
2338,"“Everyone needs to eat,” he said, “even when the economy slows down.”"
2339,"BRISTOL, Tenn. — Kevin Harvick finished 13th and on the lead lap in Sunday's Food City 500, and that's about as amazing of a comeback as you're likely to see at Bristol Motor Speedway."
2340,"Making up a lap, perhaps two, is difficult. Harvick, at one point, was four laps in arrears."
2341,Down. Out. Finished. Done.
2342,"Thanks to an incredibly fast No. 4 Ford Mustang, the 2014 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series champion was able to race his way back onto the lead lap and into the picture."
2343,The day certainly didn't start out well -- the team failed pre-race inspection three times and was penalized before the race had even begun.
2344,"Because of the inspection issues, Harvick dropped from 13th to the rear of the field at the start of the race; one crew member was ejected, the driver had to do a pass-through penalty under green once the race began and the team will lose 30 minutes of practice time at the next points event."
2345,His first break came when he hit pit road after the green flag -- a multi-car incident brought out the caution flag and Harvick only lost one lap in the pits.
2346,But a loose wheel put his No. 4 back on pit road a short time later and Harvick soon found himself multiple laps down.
2347,He joined the lead-lap cars during the final caution of the race when he was in the free pass position.
2348,The finish was his worst since a 26th-place run at Daytona this year. But it may have been one of the team's most impressive efforts overall.
2349,POWER BUT NO STEERING
2350,"It was a frustrating day for pole winner Chase Elliott as the Hendrick Motorsports driver lost the power steering in his No. 9 Chevrolet barely 20 laps into the race, then was involved in an incident just shy of the halfway point of the 500-lap race."
2351,"Despite the setbacks, he was still contending for a spot in the top 10 when his car hit the wall with less than 70 laps remaining. He led the first 38 laps of the race, finished 11th and on the lead lap, but saw a good day otherwise ruined."
2352,"""Definitely not what we started out hoping for,"" he said. ""We got turned late in the race, that was about it. We fell behind from there."
2353,"""I had a great car, even without the power steering."""
2354,HAMLIN SHOULDERS BLAME
2355,"Denny Hamlin, the series' most recent winner heading into the Bristol race weekend, appeared to have made the move of the race when a two-tire call under caution at lap 417 put him out front for the subsequent restart."
2356,The lead was short-lived. Hamlin was penalized for speeding on pit road -- something that's been the Joe Gibbs Racing driver's Achilles heel -- and was forced to give up the valuable track position.
2357,"He did manage to rally and finish fifth, however."
2358,"""I screwed up our strategy on pit lane,"" Hamlin admitted. ""We'll get it cleaned up. Just got to work through all the kinks and clean stuff up."
2359,"""We didn't have a race-winning car. Top-five finish with a car that probably shouldn't have been there is a good day."""
2360,"Hamlin won the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as last weekend's O'Reilly Auto Parts 500 at Texas Motor Speedway. The TMS win came after he rallied from a, you guessed it, pit road speeding penalty."
2361,MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR BOWYER
2362,Clint Bowyer led five times for 24 laps and had one of the best long-run cars in the field Sunday. But contact with Joey Logano on lap 432 resulted in a flat tire for the Stewart-Haas driver and put the team in catch-up mode for the remainder of the race.
2363,"""He was racing me pretty hard,"" Bowyer said of Logano. ."".. We just barely touched, and it must have cut the valve stem out of it or something and hit it just right."""
2364,Bowyer managed a seventh-place finish in spite of the setback.
2365,"""My strong suit, just like last week, was long runs,"" he said. ""We just slowly kept picking them away. You could see that on restarts. I couldn't take off worth a damn, but I could really come on strong on the big end of a run."""
2366,PENSKE STABLE SETS PACE
2367,"The cars of Team Penske teammates Logano, Brad Keselowski and Ryan Blaney were among the best for much of the Food City 500 and two of the three -- Logano and Blaney -- finished third and fourth respectively. Combined, the trio led 344 of the race's 500 laps."
2368,"""The last thing you want is a caution with 15 to 20 (laps) to go at Bristol and you're the leader because you know everyone is going to make their decision based off what you do,"" said Logano, who found himself in exactly that predicament."
2369,"""If you stay out, you've got to expect half the field is going to pit, maybe more. If you come in, five or six stayed (out), so it's just part of the game."""
2370,"Keselowski appeared to be in line for a shot at the win as well, but confusion when the field was reset for the final restart left the former series champion mired in a three-wide situation coming to the green."
2371,He was eventually issued a pass-through penalty and finished 18th.
2372,"""Nobody could figure out the lineup,"" Keselowski said. ""There wasn't enough communication and it was just a tough deal."""

2374,"GENEVA — The Geneva International Motor Show, getting underway this week, never lacks star power, but a one-of-a-kind Bugatti is outshining the mere supercars this year. “La Voiture Noire,” or “the Black Car,” was sold before the show even opened for $19 million, reputed to be the highest price ever paid for a new automobile."
2375,"“It is one of one,” said Stephan Winkelmann, the chief executive of Bugatti, a French brand long owned by Volkswagen. “There will never be another. I am pleased to tell you that it has sold for 16.7 million euro.”"
2376,Was that price obscenely high?
2377,"Possibly, if one thinks of it as a car, said its designer, Achim Anscheidt, “but perhaps not if one considers it as a work of art.”"
2378,"Certainly other collectible, less exclusive Bugattis from the brand’s storied 110-year past have sold for more; for a time, a Bugatti Royale, one of a handful ever made, held the record for a price paid at auction. And vintage Ferraris have sold for more than twice what the Black Car fetched. But this is a record for a new car, Mr. Winkelmann said."
2379,Although the buyer’s name was not disclosed and details about how the final price was determined were scant — some sort of auction among the brand’s aficionados is a good bet — Mr. Anscheidt said he believed the Black Car was a solid investment.
2380,"It was meant to capture the spirit of the marque’s famous designer, Jean Bugatti, and his personal Type 57SC Atlantic Coupe, Mr. Anscheidt said. After Bugatti was killed in a 1939 testing accident, legend has it that his Atlantic — one of four built — disappeared in 1940 while being transported by rail to Bordeaux to spare it from the advance of the Nazis."
2381,"The Black Car has a roofline similar to what is known of that rather mysterious Atlantic, including a dorsal fin running down the center; the horse collar grille; and the signature swoop of the passenger compartment’s side windows."
2382,"“It evokes the past, but it is not retro,” said Mr. Anscheidt, who has been in charge of Bugatti design since 2004. “As my former professor from the Art Center College of Design said, ‘There is nowhere to go with retro.’ Yes, I can go where I want with design, but in the end I must coordinate with the engineers to achieve what is technically possible.”"
2383,"He said his design was “something that’s been kicking around in the bottom of my desk drawer for 10 years.” It had to be reworked countless times to be aerodynamically and technically feasible. The engineers had to work their magic for function, as well as form, to realize the car’s desired top speed in excess of 400 kilometers per hour (250 m.p.h.), he added."
2384,"From a technical standpoint, Mr. Anscheidt’s design is said to be powered by a 16-cylinder engine similar to the 1,500-horsepower monster in the current Bugatti Chiron. But here is a little secret: The vehicle shown at the Geneva show is powered by nothing. It’s merely a mock-up of what the finished Black Car is expected to look like."
2385,"“What was shown here was put together in 16 weeks,” Mr. Anscheidt said. “I don’t even know if I would call it a concept, at this point.” He said it might be two and a half years before the owner takes delivery of his treasure."
2386,"So La Voiture Noire remains something of a mirage, much as Jean Bugatti’s storied creation."
2387,"“Take a good look. I doubt if it will be seen again,” said Mr. Anscheidt, who expects the finished car to disappear into the owner’s vast private collection. “Perhaps his son will drive it someday. Perhaps you will see it on the lawn at Pebble Beach.”"
2388,Meanwhile …
2389,"The Geneva show, dating from 1905, is among the last of a dying breed: a truly glamorous and fantastical display of nearly a million square feet of automotive flights of fancy. Other shows in Frankfurt, Detroit, New York and Paris have evolved into somewhat more utilitarian displays of automotive ideas for the masses."
2390,"Geneva offers no such pretense; if the world is headed for climate catastrophe in the foreseeable future, the Geneva show will go down, like the band on the Titanic, playing for time. For now, business remains brisk."
2391,"Though no match for the Bugatti stand — which included two other vehicles presold for multiple millions of dollars — the show’s other exhibitors feature a plethora of seven-figure offerings. The Italian design house Pininfarina unveiled its first branded road car, the 1,900-horsepower Battista, named for its founder. The company claims it, too, is presold, despite an asking price of $2 million. More could be available by 2021, a news release noted."
2392,"Other so-called hypercars were unveiled by the likes of Pagani, Koenigsegg, McLaren, Aston Martin, Zenvo and Ferrari. Exclusive special editions were shown by Bentley, Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini and a host of others. There was also a concept of a flying car. So, maybe the future does hold change, even for Geneva."
2393,"Tesla is finally ready to offer a version of its Model 3 sedan with a starting price of $35,000."
2394,"The company on Thursday began accepting orders for the lower-priced version, with delivery in two to four weeks. It said the base Model 3 would have a range of 220 miles before needing a charge, and would come with a different interior than pricier versions of the car."
2395,"The new offering is a milestone for Tesla, whose chief executive, Elon Musk, has long promised a $35,000 model. But the company has struggled to reduce costs enough to be able to sell such a car."
2396,"“This has been something we’ve been working toward since the beginning of the company,” Mr. Musk said in a conference call with reporters. “It has been insanely difficult.”"
2397,"The automaker also began selling a Model 3 version with a range of 240 miles and a starting price of $37,000. Previously, the cheapest Model 3 sold for about $43,000 before tax incentives."
2398,"Tesla reported profits in the third and fourth quarters of 2018 as it ramped up production of the Model 3, its most affordable car. But sales appear to have softened this year. A federal tax credit of $7,500 that was available on Tesla cars last year was halved on Jan. 1. The credit will be reduced to $1,875 in July and will be eliminated next year."
2399,"Mr. Musk has long said Tesla needs to offer a $35,000 car to attract mainstream buyers who may be skeptical about electric vehicles because of cost, charging time and other reasons. A larger customer base would also allow the company to achieve the economies of scale Tesla needs to produce steady profits."
2400,"Mr. Musk declined to discuss what profit margin the company expected on sales of the $35,000 Model 3 but said Tesla would not make money in the first quarter. “Given that a lot is happening in Q1, we do not expect to be profitable in the first quarter,” he said. But he added that the company expected to return to profitability in the second quarter."
2401,The company’s stock fell more than 5 percent in early trading on Friday.
2402,"Mr. Musk also said the company was now only taking orders online, and would close some showrooms and reduce its work force. “There’s no other way for us the achieve the savings for this car to be financially sustainable,” he said."
2403,"He declined to say how many reservations the company still had from customers who had expressed interest in buying a Model 3. Last summer, Tesla had more than 400,000 orders for the car. “The reservation list doesn’t matter,” Mr. Musk said."
2404,"Mr. Musk also expressed little certainty about how much demand the company is seeing for the Model 3. “My gut feel is 500,000 a year,” he said. But he added: “I don’t know what demand is. We’ll see.”"
2405,"To put buyers at ease about making such big-ticket purchases on the internet, he said, customers will be allowed to return cars for a full refund within seven days as long as the cars have not been driven more than 1,000 miles."
2406,"“It’s going to be super easy to get a refund,” he said. “People should not have concerns about placing an order.”"
2407,"The $35,000 Model 3 is likely to bring more customers to Tesla at a time when it is struggling to serve the affluent buyers it already has, said Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Cox Automotive. Some Tesla owners have complained about long waits to have cars repaired."
2408,"“Tesla’s biggest challenge going forward will be meeting production volumes and demand while maintaining timely service for a rapidly expanding customer fleet,” Mr. Brauer said."
2409,"Customers and reviewers have also raised questions about the Model 3’s quality and reliability. Consumer Reports said last week that it could no longer recommend the car after readers reported cracked windows, chipped paint and problems with the car’s touch-screen display."
2410,"The latest news comes as Tesla is facing several challenges. On Friday, the company is supposed to pay bondholders $920 million, a sum that would consume a quarter of its available cash."
2411,"To conserve cash, Tesla last month laid off 7 percent of its work force, its second significant layoff in the last eight months. It had $3.7 billion in cash at the end of December. In total, Tesla has about $11 billion in debt. The company must pay off $566 million in notes in November and a $1.1 billion credit line in June 2020."
2412,The company is hoping to build a plant in Shanghai but still has to secure funding.
2413,"Mr. Musk has also created more legal trouble for himself. On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission asked a federal court to hold him in contempt for violating a settlement that he and Tesla reached with the commission last year."
2414,"The commission said Mr. Musk had not sought approval from company lawyers, as required by the agreement, before making a sales prediction on Twitter last week that varied from previous announcements."
2415,"Mr. Musk and Tesla reached the settlement with the S.E.C. after the commission accused Mr. Musk of violating securities law with a post on Twitter. In that message, sent in August, he claimed to have “funding secured” to take the company private at $420 a share. It was later revealed that he was referring to a much more embryonic proposal than he had implied."
2416,"Willie McCoy appeared to be asleep in his car at a Taco Bell drive-through in Vallejo, Calif., when police officers, responding to a 911 call, arrived to check on him."
2417,"Minutes later, Mr. McCoy, 20, was shot and killed. The police said he had woken up and was reaching for a gun on his lap, but Mr. McCoy’s friends and family members demanded more transparency."
2418,"On Friday, the Vallejo Police Department released footage from the body-worn cameras of six officers who fired their weapons during the shooting, which occurred Feb. 9."
2419,"The footage showed that Mr. McCoy appeared to be asleep for at least several minutes, and that he was shot about 10 seconds after he began to move. It was unclear whether he was reaching for a gun."
2420,"The police said in a statement last week that the Solano County district attorney’s office was investigating the episode, adding that the department was releasing the videos because it wanted “to address the questions that have been raised to help the public digest both the media reports and to facilitate a community dialogue about the facts of this incident.”"
2421,"Since the shooting, relatives of Mr. McCoy have questioned the police version of events. “Willie was shot a whole lot of times,” David Harrison, a cousin of Mr. McCoy’s who saw his body after the shooting, said in an interview in February. “Our belief is that Willie was executed, like a firing squad.”"
2422,"On Sunday, Melissa Nold, a lawyer for the family, said the video footage had confirmed the family’s fears. “We intend to file a federal civil rights lawsuit shortly,” she said. “Based on the videos, it looks like the officers violated basic safety principles and made no real efforts to preserve human life.”"
2423,"The officers involved had been placed on administrative leave, but Ms. Nold said that they were back on duty within weeks of the shooting. Neither the police department nor the district attorney’s office immediately responded to requests for comment on Sunday."
2424,"The half-hour video released by the police included footage from six body cameras, as well as an audio recording of the 911 call that ultimately brought officers to the Taco Bell drive-through."
2425,"“I have a person unresponsive to car horn honks in my drive-through,” a Taco Bell employee could be heard saying, adding: “He’s unresponsive. I’ve already had, like, people try to knock on the window. I have no idea what’s going on.”"
2426,A dispatcher could then be heard calling for officers to do a “wellness check.”
2427,"Shortly after arriving, one officer could be heard saying: “Gun. Gun. Call it out. There’s a gun in his lap.”"
2428,"About four minutes passed while the officers tried to open the car door and moved their patrol cars to box in Mr. McCoy’s vehicle. In the videos, which were partly obscured by the officers’ drawn weapons and outstretched arms, there was no indication that the police tried to awaken Mr. McCoy, although they were shining their flashlights into his car."
2429,"Referring to a gun on Mr. McCoy’s lap, one officer could be heard saying that the magazine appeared to be detached from the weapon and noting that if Mr. McCoy fired the gun, he would be able to shoot only once. But in a caption added to the footage, the police said that “in fact, the gun was loaded with an extended 14-round magazine, extending past the grip.”"
2430,"At one point in the video footage, officers could be heard making a plan to open the car door, seize the gun and pull Mr. McCoy out of the car. “If he reaches for it,” said one of the officers, nodding."
2431,"“Yup,” said another. But they found the door locked, and Mr. McCoy appeared to remain asleep."
2432,"Eventually, Mr. McCoy could be seen beginning to stir, using his right hand to scratch at his left shoulder. “He’s moving, he’s moving,” an officer said. “He’s not up yet.”"
2433,"Then the officers began yelling at Mr. McCoy to raise his hands. Less than 10 seconds after Mr. McCoy scratched his left shoulder, he could be seen moving his left arm, and six officers opened fire."
2434,"“To respect the privacy of the decedent and his family, we are withholding the portions of the videos showing officers rendering medical aid,” the police said in their statement Friday."
2435,"The police first showed body camera footage to a few relatives of Mr. McCoy on March 13. Last Monday, Open Vallejo, a local news outlet, made a public records request for the footage. It was released to the public four days later."
2436,"“I’m glad that the video was released and everyone can see it because, just like anything else, when there’s something out there that’s dangerous in the community, we want to know about it,” Mr. Harrison, Mr. McCoy’s cousin, said at a news conference on Friday. “We just happen to have police officers who are rogue out here.”"
2437,"Tesla has unveiled a compact sport utility vehicle called the Model Y, in its latest effort to broaden its product range while contending with problems on a number of fronts."
2438,"Speaking on Thursday night at an event at the company’s design center in Hawthorne, Calif., Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive, touted the new electric vehicle’s performance and safety-focused design."
2439,"“It has the functionality of an S.U.V., but it will ride like a sports car,” Mr. Musk said. “This thing will be really tight in corners. And we expect it will be the safest midsize S.U.V. in the world by far.”"
2440,"Tesla, however, is still a long way from delivering the vehicle. It forecast that the earliest deliveries would begin in fall 2020, barring engineering or production delays of the sort that hampered its best-selling car, the Model 3."
2441,"Last year, Mr. Musk predicted that the Model Y would be ready for delivery in the first half of 2020. Tesla has not offered detailed plans for assembling the car, and recently said it would probably make the Model Y at its giant battery plant in Nevada."
2442,"Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said Tesla’s goal of having the Model Y in volume production by the end of next year was a matter of concern."
2443,"“This timeline appears similar to the original timeline for the Model 3 ramp, which was ultimately delayed by nine-12 months,” he wrote in a note to investors."
2444,"By late 2020, Tesla will probably face stronger competition. Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Porsche are just starting to produce vehicles that will rival the Model Y."
2445,"The first Model Y versions will have starting prices of $47,000 to $60,000 and are expected to offer a driving range of up to 300 miles. The company has begun taking deposits of $2,500 for orders."
2446,"A more affordable version with a range of about 230 miles and a starting price of $39,000 is supposed to go into production in spring 2021."
2447,"Tesla said it aimed to offer the Model Y in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, Germany, the Netherlands and a number of other European countries."
2448,Investors seemed unimpressed by the rollout. Tesla’s shares declined 5 percent on Friday.
2449,"Tesla is confronting sales challenges in Europe and China, markets it has been counting on for expansion. The company has also faced some operational uncertainty. Two weeks ago, Mr. Musk announced that Tesla would begin selling a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan priced at $35,000, $8,000 less than the cheapest current version. But he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, and analysts question whether Tesla can ever make money on the car at the lower price."
2450,"Tesla originally said customers would have to wait two to four weeks for delivery of the $35,000 Model 3. It now says the wait is six to eight weeks because of the volume of orders."
2451,"Sales of Tesla’s other models, the Model S luxury sedan and Model X sport utility vehicle, have been flattening. And analysts suspect that demand for Tesla vehicles has softened since the beginning of the year, when the federal tax credit available to Tesla customers fell by half, raising the total cost for buyers. Until the end of 2018, Tesla buyers were eligible for a credit of $7,500. That fell to $3,850 on Jan. 1, essentially raising the price of Tesla cars."
2452,"Tesla responded with a series of price cuts to lift sales. In a conference call in January, Mr. Musk said many customers could not afford the company’s cars."
2453,"To cut costs, Tesla announced that it would close most of its stores around the country. Days later, it backtracked and decided to keep many of the stores, and to reopen some that had already closed, though it affirmed a shift toward online-only sales. It also reversed direction on pricing, saying it would increase prices on all its cars except the $35,000 version of the Model 3."
2454,"Serious train and bus accidents are rare. But when they happen, passengers and their bags have almost none of the protections considered standard on planes and cars."
2455,"The National Transportation Safety Board has long recommended a variety of measures to improve passenger safety, including installing lap-shoulder seatbelts, requiring riders to buckle up and improving window safety and overhead baggage restraints."
2456,"“Current safety standards for locomotive cabs and rail passenger cars are inadequate,” the N.T.S.B. said in February when it unveiled its “most wanted” list of safety improvements for trains. “Protecting passengers and crews from injury requires keeping rail car windows intact and maintaining their structural integrity during an accident, and includes occupant restraint systems, such as seatbelts, to mitigate the severity of passenger injuries.”"
2457,"But regulators of Amtrak, Greyhound and a host of national and regional transportation carriers have generally not adopted the recommendations."
2458,"In 2017, 44 people died in bus crashes, according to the safety board. The Federal Railroad Administration’s office of safety analysis said 21 passengers and employees were killed in Amtrak and commuter train accidents in 2017 and 2018. While the number of bus and rail fatalities is relatively small, thousands of people were injured in accidents in recent years on Amtrak, Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and other commuter trains, as well as on Greyhound and other interstate bus companies, according to federal regulators."
2459,"“Those 44 people could have been saved,” said T. Bella Dinh-Zarr, a recently retired member of the safety board who helped lead major bus and train crash investigations. “In some cases, just simply wearing their seatbelt would have saved them from being severely injured and then dying from those injuries, or being ejected and killed, or suffering traumatic brain injury.“"
2460,"The safety board’s call for regulators to evaluate installing seatbelts in rail cars and “securing potential projectiles” resonates in the case of Rudolf Wetzel. He dozed off in his seat on an Amtrak train just outside Tacoma, Wash., as the train made its first run on a new service route south on Dec. 18, 2017."
2461,"“I woke up when all hell broke loose,” he said. The train had derailed on an overpass, sending the locomotive, the power car and two rail cars tumbling onto Interstate 5. “I didn’t know what was going on.” Thrown from his seat and seriously injured, he lay underneath the train, where he could see wheels turning and hear the engine roaring."
2462,"The N.T.S.B.’s preliminary investigation determined that excessive speed caused the train to derail as it rounded a curve at 78 miles per hour in a 30 m.p.h. zone. Three passengers were killed, and 62 passengers, crew members and motorists were injured. Mr. Wetzel, 82, was hospitalized for three days with a broken back as well as internal and cognitive injuries."
2463,"On its most wanted list, the N.T.S.B. said “compartmentalization” — a design in which closely spaced, well-padded and high-backed train seats absorb energy during accidents — remains a problem because it “may not protect passengers during derailments and overturns.”"
2464,"In a derailment, passengers often collide with one another. In these instances, Ms. Dinh-Zarr said, Amtrak’s seats don’t offer much protection from other passengers or from flying luggage. The overhead baggage racks on most Amtrak trains have only a shallow edge and railing. There are no other restraints or compartments that close with a door and a latch akin to the overhead storage in commercial airplanes, except on Acela Express, according to Amtrak."
2465,"James Vucinovich, a lawyer who is representing Mr. Wetzel and others in lawsuits against Amtrak, said the interior of Amtrak train cabins leaves people vulnerable when accidents occur. “You’re going to be like a Ping-Pong ball inside of a can.”"
2466,"In January last year, Representative Phil Roe of Tennessee was among the dozens of Republican lawmakers traveling to a retreat in Virginia on a chartered Amtrak train when it struck a garbage truck. Mr. Roe, a physician, assessed injuries inside and outside the train with a group of other doctors."
2467,"Does he support putting seatbelts on Amtrak? “If you wanted to move safety to another level, the answer would be yes,” Mr. Roe said."
2468,"He added that he is a mountaineer and not risk averse. “But I always harness up, and I’m always on the rope,” he said. “So if I’m sitting on an Amtrak and there’s a safety belt there, I’m going to put it on.”"
2469,"If trains have an Achilles’ heel, it is their windows. The safety board issued a recommendation 47 years ago about “the problem of ejection of passengers through large side windows.” Ms. Dinh-Zarr said Amtrak’s windows, which are secured by rubber grommets, remain a problem because they can pop out in a crash or derailment. She was on the scene in Philadelphia in May 2015, she said, when eight passengers were killed and 185 were taken to hospitals after a locomotive and seven passenger cars derailed."
2470,"“The N.T.S.B. found that if the passenger car windows had remained intact and secured in the cars, some passengers would not have been ejected and would likely have survived the accident,” the board’s report on the accident said. “Further, the passengers were not protected from serious injuries resulting from being thrown from their seats when the cars overturned.”"
2471,"Kimberly Woods, a spokeswoman for Amtrak, said in an email: “Amtrak will continue to work with industry experts to explore the enhancement of occupant protection systems on our trains.” Amtrak’s windows, she said, “comply with federal requirements for impact resistance and emergency release.”"
2472,"When asked why Amtrak had not installed seatbelts, she said international research on the matter has shown “inconclusive results regarding any improvements to safety.”"
2473,"In a 2017 letter, the Federal Railroad Administration responded to the safety board’s seatbelt recommendation: “Current research indicates that unlike in the automobile and air transportation modes, adding seatbelts in passenger rail cars is not the most effective way to increase safety.”"
2474,"Warren Flatau, a spokesman for the agency, added that the railroad administration’s own “extensive research” on the subject “has revealed that the use of seatbelts could actually increase the risk and severity of injuries.” He said the agency’s focus on “occupant protection and accident survivability” has led to “redesigned tables and seats that contain and cushion passengers,” as well as “enhanced emergency egress features” including windows, lighting and “structural crashworthiness.”"
2475,"Commercial buses manufactured after 2016 are required to have seatbelts. But after a Greyhound accident in San Jose, Calif., in 2016 in which two passengers were thrown from the bus and killed, State Senator Jerry Hill looked into why everyone on board wasn’t wearing a seatbelt. He found that travelers did not have to wear the belts."
2476,"“What’s the point of a seatbelt if passengers and drivers aren’t required to wear them?” he asked. So Mr. Hill introduced legislation, which took effect last summer, making California the first state with a law requiring bus passengers to wear seatbelts in any bus that has them and requiring operators to inform passengers before departure that they must buckle up or face a fine."
2477,"The N.T.S.B. supported California’s law. And on its most-wanted list, it recommends that every state enact a law that requires all vehicle occupants to use seatbelts and allow law enforcement officers to give tickets to anyone who has not buckled up. The agency said it was concerned about “the limited availability and use of seatbelts in commercial vehicles” including motor coaches, school buses and medium-size buses."
2478,"In August, a truck driver on Interstate 40 near Thoreau, N.M., lost control of the vehicle and jackknifed into oncoming traffic, striking a Greyhound bus. Seven passengers died and 39 were injured in the crash."
2479,"Reid Valentine, a passenger on the bus, said he was not wearing his seatbelt. He said he was thrown into the seat in front of him so hard that it broke. “Glass shattered, and I watched the front of the bus just basically crumple all the way up to the front axle.”"
2480,"Mr. Valentine said passengers did not receive a safety briefing, so opening emergency windows proved difficult. “We were fighting to keep them open so that we could get out of the bus and start getting people out,” he recalled. The heavy bus windows don’t just pop off, he said. “You have to hold them up like on camper awnings.”"
2481,"Crystal Booker, a spokeswoman for Greyhound, said in an email: “We are constantly reviewing safety features on our buses to look for ways to improve passengers’ safety.” She added that all buses “undergo thorough inspections” and that “all Greyhound drivers nationwide are trained on safety announcements,” including evacuation procedures."
2482,"She said the back of Greyhound’s seats help to “cushion passengers and mitigate injury,” even for passengers who don’t wear a seatbelt."
2483,"When asked why the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had not issued federal regulations to improve bus emergency exit windows, Kathryn Henry, a spokeswoman, said the agency was still analyzing emergency evacuation research it completed in 2011 “to inform possible means of improving the emergency exits.”"
2484,"She added, “The agency believes that bus window exits must not only enable adequate evacuation in emergencies, but also should not pop out too readily in a crash.”"
2485,"Crash survivors, meanwhile, often have to contend with a range of lingering physical and psychological effects. After physical therapy, Mr. Wetzel — who survived being thrown from an Amtrak train — said he was functioning at just 60 percent of his abilities."
2486,And Mr. Valentine said he avoided all bus travel.
2487,"“I’m still at the point where I barely sleep at night,” he said. “It’s something I’ve constantly got to think of and it’s always on my mind.”"
2488,"WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department is expected to submit a report to President Trump in the coming days that could give the United States authority to impose tariffs on foreign cars and car parts on the basis of protecting national security, setting up another potential skirmish with America’s trading partners."
2489,"An administration official confirmed that the report would be submitted to the White House before a Feb. 17 deadline. The president has 90 days to make a determination on auto tariffs after receiving the report, which is not expected to immediately be made public."
2490,"The document stems from Mr. Trump’s request to the department last year to investigate whether imports of automobiles pose a threat to national security. It remains unclear exactly what the Commerce Department will recommend, but analysts say they expect the document to outline a range of options for the president, whether that means doing nothing or imposing tariffs or quotas on imported cars and parts."
2491,"While Mr. Trump has long threatened to hit allies like Europe with car tariffs, it is not clear whether he will actually take that step. The administration is fighting multiple trade battles at once, including with China, and other countries have warned Mr. Trump that any move to impose tariffs would warrant reciprocal action."
2492,"The United States’ auto industry, including automakers like General Motors, has also urged the administration not to proceed with tariffs, which they say would hobble companies in the country and raise prices for consumers. The car industry, along with other American industries, still bears the brunt of Mr. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from other countries."
2493,Republican lawmakers have also begun pressuring the president to back off.
2494,"“Raising tariffs on cars and parts would be a huge tax on consumers who buy or service their cars, whether they are imported or domestically produced,” Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said on Thursday. “Tariffs are not a long-term solution, and nobody wins in the end.”"
2495,"Mr. Grassley cited data from the Tax Foundation that showed a 25 percent tariff on car imports would amount to a $73.1 billion tax increase and pointed to figures from the Center for Automotive Research that found that such a tariff on auto imports would also result in the loss of over 700,000 jobs."
2496,"According to Henrietta Treyz, the director of economic policy research at Veda Partners, these could include a broad tariff of 20 percent to 25 percent on all imports of cars and parts, higher tariffs on imports from China and Japan with exemptions for Europe, Canada, Mexico and South Korea. It could also include targeted tariffs on imports of automated and electric car components. Any of those possibilities are likely to spur resistance."
2497,"“Outcry and public pressure from the lobbying community has been mostly in hushed tones but release of the auto investigation should spur a new age in the Trump/business community dynamic,” Ms. Treyz said."
2498,"Despite Mr. Trump’s intent to protect the automobile industry, most of it remains united in opposition to tariffs."
2499,"“We’re not always united on public policy issues, but we’re united on this,” said Matt Blunt, the president of the American Automotive Policy Council. “Every auto manufacturer and parts manufacturer that I am aware of thinks this would be a mistake.”"
2500,"Ann Wilson, the senior vice president of government affairs at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, warned that restricting imports of car parts would make American manufacturers less competitive. She urged lawmakers to push back against the administration if it moved forward with tariffs."
2501,"“This is the time that members of Congress, governors and local officials need to pay very close attention to the impact that these tariffs will have on the manufacturing base and on their constituents,” Ms. Wilson said. “This will have ramifications all through manufacturing sector and supply chains.”"
2502,Some Republican lawmakers who have been frustrated by the effect of the steel and aluminum tariffs have proposed legislation that would curb the president’s ability to impose tariffs on national security grounds. Congressional aides have suggested that the White House wants to keep the report confidential so that Mr. Trump maintains leverage in current trade negotiations.
2503,European Union officials have warned that if Mr. Trump imposes tariffs on car imports from Europe that it would derail their coming trade negotiations.
2504,"Although Mr. Trump likes to remain unpredictable on trade, he has made clear that he has a preference for tariffs. The president underscored that point on Friday when discussing the possibility of extending a deadline to raise tariffs on Chinese imports."
2505,"“Well, you know, you’re talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, O.K.?” he said."
2506,"MOGADISHU, Somalia — A car bomb exploded on Thursday near a hotel and restaurant in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killing at least 15 people, rescue services said, in a strike on a busy area that has been targeted by Islamist militants in the past."
2507,"The explosion sent a huge cloud of smoke into the sky and destroyed two restaurants and cars parked in the area, officials said."
2508,"“So far, 15 people died, including five women. Seventeen others were injured in the blast,” Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of Amin Ambulance service, told Reuters. Another witness at the scene said she had seen 18 bodies."
2509,"The Islamist group the Shabab claimed responsibility for the bombing through its Radio al-Andalus website. The group, which is linked to Al Qaeda, previously targeted the same location, the Wehliye Hotel, which is along Maka al-Mukaram Road."
2510,"A police spokesman, Maj. Mohamed Hussein, told The Associated Press that the explosives-laden vehicle had detonated outside the restaurant."
2511,"“The blast destroyed a restaurant and killed many who were inside and outside the restaurant,” the same police captain told Reuters. “The death toll may rise.”"
2512,"He said dozens of others had been injured in the blast, and that most of the casualties had been among diners at the crowded restaurant."
2513,"A Mogadishu resident, Aamina Ali, said she went the scene of the attack to help the victims and that she had seen many bodies and blood everywhere."
2514,"“This is unacceptable,” she said. “We are mothers; we lost beautiful souls.”"
2515,The Shabab are fighting to topple the Western-backed government protected by African Union forces. The group was ejected from Mogadishu in 2011 and has since been driven from most of its other strongholds.
2516,"On Saturday, Shabab gunmen stormed a government building in Mogadishu after a suicide car bombing, and the ensuing gunfight and blast killed at least 15 people, including the country’s deputy labor minister, the police said, Reuters reported."
2517,"On Tuesday, a bomb planted in a private luxury car exploded in Mogadishu’s Hodan District, killing the driver and injuring a nearby pedestrian, Col. Ahmed Abdi, a police official, told The A.P."
2518,"The United States military has increased the number of deadly airstrikes against the militants since Donald J. Trump took office as president. A number of multinational troops, including African Union force, Somali forces and Kenyan soldiers, are also fighting the Shabab."
2519,"Despite all he had seen in nearly three decades as executive director of Detroit’s annual auto show, Rod Alberts found himself staring in mild disbelief."
2520,"On a nearby video screen, he watched as an empty autonomous car parked itself, used a sensor to recharge its batteries through thin air, then returned to curbside to pick up its “occupants.”"
2521,"Although controlled from the event’s lower ground floor in Detroit, the vehicle itself was over 7,000 miles away, in Shanghai. Captured in real time by three cameras, the demonstration used an “automated valet” system developed by ZongMu Technology, a Chinese start-up."
2522,"Increasingly, alongside their traditional sparkling new models on rotating stands, top car shows are mixing in heavy doses of technology and hands-on experiences like driving simulators and virtual reality demonstrations."
2523,"“Technology is here to stay,” Mr. Alberts said, noting the scores of start-ups at the North American International Auto Show last month in Detroit. “The mobility world, and our car shows, have changed a lot.”"
2524,[Carmakers no longer see auto shows as can’t-miss events.]
2525,"Ten years ago, Mr. Alberts estimates, the worldwide car population spanned 50 brands and 350 models. Today, with the disappearance of names like Saab, Scion, Mercury and Pontiac, and automakers like General Motors and Ford still trimming their lineups, he calculates those numbers have shrunk by as much as 20 percent."
2526,"All this means fewer cars on Mr. Alberts’ carpets. Moreover, as carmakers increasingly take advantage of social media and shorter build times, model introductions that historically took place in the fall and winter — when many shows are scheduled — now happen year-round."
2527,"However, despite recent headlines proclaiming the imminent demise of conventional car shows, those predictions seem premature."
2528,"The biggest events still draw large crowds, filled with plenty of potential buyers. Last year, an estimated 11 million people attended the nation’s 55 traditional car shows — excluding classic auto and specialty exhibits — according to Foresight Research, an industry data-tracking firm in Rochester Hills, Mich. Despite record-breaking cold weather, the Detroit show’s attendance reached a reported 774,000, off slightly from the year before but hardly dying."
2529,"“It’s true the shows are evolving — but in a positive way,” said Jennifer Colman, president of the Automotive Trade Association Executives. “They’re offering interactive apps, ride-and-drives and other experiences that meet consumers’ needs.”"
2530,"Two years ago, the Detroit show teamed up with PlanetM, an initiative sponsored by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation that fosters emerging “mobility” technologies. This year, including ZongMu in China, 149 tech and start-up companies populated the Detroit show’s lower ground floor, in a showcase for potential investors. Among them:"
2531,"BEDESTRIAN This start-up from Ann Arbor, Mich., plans to deploy autonomous robotic vehicles for “last mile” deliveries in congested urban areas. The company hopes to find a niche among elderly, disabled and veteran populations."
2532,"DERQ Based in Detroit and Dubai, this start-up is focusing on preventing vehicle and pedestrian intersection accidents before they happen. Its technology links “smart city” cameras and sensors to patented predictive algorithms that trigger audio and visual alarms in standard and autonomous vehicles."
2533,"SEEVA TECHNOLOGIES Seeva, a father-daughter start-up in Seattle, uses targeted streams of a vehicle’s heated washer fluid to clean windshields, cameras and sensors on self-driving and standard vehicles. Fully autonomous cars are expected to deploy dozens of such detectors, says Diane Lansinger, the chief executive."
2534,"“It’s a chance to expose new companies and technologies to potential investors and the traditional automotive world,” Trevor Pawl, PlanetM group vice president, said of the Detroit show. “And we get to do that here, where the industry began.”"
2535,"Two months earlier, a similar transformation was apparent at AutoMobility LA, the big annual Los Angeles auto show."
2536,"As in Detroit, dozens of new car models were unveiled, and to great hoopla. But since 2016, when the Los Angeles show’s owners merged with Connected Car Expo, much had changed. The November event became one of the first to address the converging worlds of technology and automaking and to offer public forums for the discussion of knotty issues facing transportation."
2537,"For one thing, there was the show’s serious-sounding “Future of Human Driving” theme. Panelists wrestled with deep-think topics like “The New Demands of Car Design,” “Future Mobility and the Reimagined Car” and “Preparing Highways for the Autonomous Future.”"
2538,"“This was the first time I’ve felt the kind of excitement you get at the Paris and Detroit shows,” said Kimberly Marte, a member of the design panel."
2539,"“We’re in a time of change in how we look at the whole future of transportation,” added Ms. Marte, a lecturer at the ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, Calif. “The L.A. show reflected that, and it gave the event a lot of weight.”"
2540,"Ms. Marte singled out the show’s introduction of a water-wading electric pickup truck with a range of 400 miles. Made by Rivian, from Plymouth, Mich., the truck was billed as the first in a line of “electric adventure” vehicles."
2541,"[Amazon has invested in Rivian, a potential rival to Tesla.]"
2542,"“It was a different kind of buzz,” she said. “Everybody was talking about it, surrounding that truck.”"
2543,"Notably, the Los Angeles show was bracketed by two portentous announcements from the world’s largest automaker: Volkswagen will end production of its iconic Beetle this year, and it intends to cease gasoline and diesel engine development after 2026."
2544,"Even so, as Ms. Colman and others insist, car shows remain very much alive and kicking."
2545,"Steve Bruyn, Foresight’s chief executive, said the number of car-shopping attendees had recently grown, a gain he attributed to greater interest by millennials."
2546,"“The 18-34 age cohort has increased dramatically since 2015,” Mr. Bruyn said, and is now the largest single demographic among attendees who subsequently buy a vehicle."
2547,"“If anything, because of millennials, auto shows have increased in importance in terms of shopping,” he said. “These folks often don’t have prior experience or brand loyalty, so for them attending the show takes on added meaning.”"
2548,"Since 1998, Kevin Mazzucola has been the executive director of the Philadelphia Auto Show, a more localized exhibit, held this month, that seasons its shiny metal with football cheerleaders and live radio broadcasts."
2549,"“When I look out and see 70,000 people on our floor on a Saturday afternoon,” he said, “there’s no question in my mind of the continuing importance of car shows.”"
2550,"“Consumers revel in comparison shopping,” he added. “We give them a chance to see if that new S.U.V.’s third row of seats is really big enough to haul the kids to a soccer game.”"
2551,"Despite his optimism, Mr. Mazzucola perceives a growing need for the shows to educate consumers, especially as the industry moves toward self-driving vehicles."
2552,"“Polls show the public is apprehensive about autonomous cars,” he said. “We need help from manufacturers to alleviate those fears, to use our shows to educate and expose consumers to new technology.”"
2553,"That effort may get a boost next year, when the Detroit show shifts its schedule to June from its traditional January run. “We’re going to break the mold,” Mr. Alberts said."
2554,The more temperate weather will allow the show to add 14 acres of outside space and take full advantage of the city’s revitalized riverfront and surrounding streets.
2555,"“We’ll have sun until 9 p.m.,” said Mr. Alberts, who predicts a galalike atmosphere comparable to the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England. The new show will be a hub for automotive technology, he said, one that offers consumers plenty of room for “experiential engagement.”"
2556,At least one of the Detroit show’s start-ups will welcome the change.
2557,"“We’ve got six products in development,” Ms. Lansinger of Seeva said, “so the show is definitely worth our time. But sometimes when I walk through the main floor I feel like I’m in a history museum.”"
2558,"Doubtless reflecting the views of other technology companies, she hopes better weather will mean a chance to move upstairs, with the marquee displays."
2559,"Just days after saying that it would close most of its stores, Tesla is making an abrupt U-turn."
2560,"In a message posted on its blog just before midnight Sunday, the electric-car maker said it had decided to retain many of the locations it had shut down or was planning to close. And it said it would raise most of its vehicle prices about 3 percent worldwide, just weeks after cutting prices."
2561,"“Over the past two weeks we have been closely evaluating every single Tesla retail location, and we have decided to keep significantly more stores open than previously announced as we continue to evaluate them over the course of several months,” the company said in the blog post. The price increases, it said, are necessary to make up for the loss of savings that was anticipated from the store closings."
2562,"The flip-flops are the latest sign of turmoil surrounding the company and its chief executive, Elon Musk."
2563,"“This reversal is bizarre and indicates a lack of actual planning in the earlier announcement,” said Mike Ramsey, a Gartner analyst. “Their retail stores still serve a real need.”"
2564,"Until last month, Tesla had been rushing to expand its network of showrooms and mall galleries, which display its cars but take no customer orders."
2565,"On Feb. 28, Mr. Musk told reporters in a conference call that Tesla would start offering a long-awaited version of its Model 3 sedan with a starting price of $35,000. Previously, the least expensive Model 3 cost $43,000 before tax incentives."
2566,"Mr. Musk said closing its stores would allow Tesla to cut costs enough to make the Model 3 profitable at the lower price. But he would not elaborate on those calculations, and he said Tesla would lose money in the first quarter, contrary to previous forecasts."
2567,"As part of the cost cutting, he said, Tesla would henceforth take orders only online. Tesla affirmed the online approach in its announcement Sunday night, saying its stores would serve as a way to introduce potential buyers to Tesla vehicles, provide a test drive on request — another reversal from its earlier announcement — and show how to make a purchase."
2568,"“Stores will also carry a small number of cars in inventory for customers who wish to drive away with a Tesla immediately,” it added."
2569,"In a recent email to employees, Mr. Musk said 78 percent of Model 3 orders were already placed online. Buyers can get full refunds if they return cars within seven days and have driven them less than 1,000 miles."
2570,"Tesla has been in retreat in recent months, scrambling to shore up flagging investor confidence. Along with layoffs of 7 percent of its work force in January, the news of store closings appeared to underline the challenges for a newcomer breaking into an old-line manufacturing industry. The company has struggled to make a few thousand cars in a week — a feat that established automakers can do in a day."
2571,"Asked to elaborate on the company’s latest moves, a Tesla spokesman declined to comment."
2572,"The weeks of tension have taken a toll on Tesla shares. On Monday they rose 2.4 percent, closing at $290.92, but they are down 9 percent since Mr. Musk said the company would be unprofitable in the first quarter."
2573,The twists on the marketing front have coincided with renewed upheaval surrounding Mr. Musk himself.
2574,"Less than a month ago, Tesla’s general counsel quit a day after Mr. Musk said on Twitter that the company expected to sell 500,000 cars this year, an increase of 100,000 from the estimate it made public in January."
2575,"The Securities and Exchange Commission contended that the tweet violated an agreement it had reached with Tesla in September to settle a securities-fraud case, and it asked a federal court to hold Mr. Musk in contempt. Under the settlement, the company was to “put in place additional controls and procedures” to oversee Mr. Musk’s communications."
2576,"In a response filed with the court on Monday, Mr. Musk’s lawyers argued that there were no grounds for a contempt citation. They said that the Tesla chief “correctly used his discretion” to determine that nothing in his Twitter post was material and that “under no fair reading of the materiality standard” did the post alter the information available to investors."
2577,The response also said that a contempt citation “would raise serious First Amendment issues” and that the S.E.C.’s request represented “unprecedented overreach.”
2578,"Even with its financial and regulatory challenges, the company is moving ahead on new initiatives."
2579,"On Thursday, Mr. Musk is scheduled to unveil the Model Y, a sport utility vehicle that Tesla is counting on to fuel further growth. David Whiston, a Morningstar analyst, said the big question for Tesla’s business prospects was when the Model Y would be available for sale. “Thursday is just for show,” he said."
2580,"And in a move meant to address its logistical challenges in delivering cars to customers, Tesla said in a filing with the S.E.C. on Monday that it had purchased trucks and car-hauling trailers from a California company in exchange for stock worth $13.8 million. In November, Mr. Musk said on Twitter that Tesla had bought “some trucking companies,” but provided no details."
2581,"Mr. Musk has portrayed the Model 3 as a mass-market offering crucial to Tesla’s future. In the last three months of 2018, Tesla opened 27 sales and service locations to keep up with rising demand. Over all, the company had more than 100 stores and showrooms in the United States, and others overseas."
2582,"In its announcement Sunday night, Tesla said it had already closed 10 percent of its locations. Those stores did not have “natural foot traffic,” it said, though some will reopen with a smaller staff. The company said an additional 20 percent were under review for potential closing in the coming months."
2583,"The automaker also said the $35,000 version of the Model 3 would not be affected by the price increases. They will apply to the higher-end Model X and Model S — cars on which Tesla only recently had been dropping prices — as well as for more expensive versions of the Model 3."
2584,The company said customers would have a week to place orders at current prices.
